[{"date":"9 August 2013","score":"","review":" The movie was directed by David Fincher, also responsible for the twisted masterpiece Se7en, and revolves around the main character who for all intensive purposes will be called The Narrator, played by one of my favourite actors Edward Norton. The Narrator meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who goes on to completely change his outlook on life, opening him up to what is truly his full potential, and encouraging him to leave behind his old monotonous life and just let go.It's difficult to explain why Fight Club is the incredible experience it is without spoiling anything. The main misconception is that the movie focuses on fighting, which is a fair assumption, based upon the name, but it is almost inexcusable to disregard it without delving a little deeper. About one tenth of the film contains fighting, with the remainder telling an unforgettable story of self-discovery and leaving you as the viewer to raise some questions about yourself and precisely where you think your own life is going. It's clichéd with many highly- rated films, but Fight Club really is life changing if you allow it to be. It'd be wrong to review the film without touching on just how exceptional the acting is. Marla, (played by Helena Bonham Carter) is the embodiment of a wasted life, counting down the days till she dies. Her life, like The Narrator's, completely changes when she meets Tyler, providing even the most depressive character in the film a new way of seeing things. Brad Pitt plays Tyler perfectly, not caring at all how people see him and being his own man, something which he encourages The Narrator to do. The true reason Fight Club is so phenomenal as a film however is down to the fact it was made with the sole purpose of being watched again, thanks to the completely mind-blowing twist featured towards the end. I can't put in to words just how shocked I was after the first time I saw the film, leaving me to instantly need to see it again.

However, I saw this movie once, a long time ago, and really enjoyed it, and recently, when I saw it for sale, bought it. It's not so much a comedy, but it is a romance, more like a teenage romance than anything else.The story is about a college student, Paul Tanneck (Jason Biggs of American Pie) who is accepted into an Ivy League college in New York, however he is on a regional scholarship which means that he needs a specific grade point average to succeed.Paul is an honest hardworking young man from the more conservative parts of the United States, but discovers that life in the city is vastly different. He finds that all his room mates want to do is party, and he simply cannot find any peace to be able to study (though why he does not go to the library is beyond me). To quickly outline the plot, he meets a girl (who also goes to his college) and saves her life one night after she ODed from a spiked drink, but then discovers that she is in love with his English professor (however the relationship is not legal). When Paul's roommates find out, they blackmail the professor, but Paul refuses to stop to their level, and continues to do his work honestly. While he passes the subject, it is not enough to keep up his grade point average. however, the girl (Dora Diamond) dumps the professor and Paul and Dora get together and live happily ever after.I guess this film gives us a glimpse into the college life in New York. It shows the difference between the rural Paul and the rich city kids who are his dormmates. Dora, while being in college, has to work in an industry that is not suited to her (being a waitress at a strip club, in that she is required to flirt with customers so that they end up spending more money). Further, since she lives out of town, she has to catch a train home every night or else be stuck in the city (and in doing so needs to lie to her mother). Paul's dormmates (if you can call them that) suggest that she is the type of girl who will shack up with anybody so they don't have to catch the train home.Is this love? Probably not, but with movies we are not really interested in what happens before (unless it is essential to the movie) or what happens after. It is assumed that once the movie ends, the world continues on in the status quo that develops at the end of the movie. I guess that's just Hollywood.

And I think it is better to write reviews after you have watched many many movies before. This is the mother of all monster movies, I guess that the majority of movie fans have seen this so the review is more like a fan review from my side. And it is for the audience that have seen it and want to rate the review I make or by those who want to become a big movie fan. This is where the Kaiju genre started and in English it is giant monster. It starts with a roar from the monster of all monsters and if you listen closely you will recognize this sound from Jurassic Park by Steven Spielberg's T-Rex. The sound is taken from him. The movie itself is about Gojira (Godzilla) and it is one of the best out there. And if you think about what year this came out you understand what an amazing movie this was in 1954 when it came to theaters in Asia or mainly Japan. It is a mystery what all this is about from the beginning. A ship gets attacked by something and one of the survivors say it looked like the sea exploded. Hilarious quote by the way. They start to research this mysterious thing after some boats are getting attacked. They soon find out it is a sea monster from the Jura era. When the dinosaurs lived. They think it is woken up by atomic radiation. I will come to that in my summary of this review because it has a lot to do with the morale in this movie. You guessed right it is Godzilla that comes up from that sea and make the best movie monster of all time. Acting Well what should we say here the acting of Godzilla or the actors. The monster part is excellent enough said. But the actors I can say something about. He actually played in a lot of these Toho movies with monsters, like King Kong Escapes (1967), Invasion of Astro-Monster (1965), Mothra vs Godzilla (1964), Godzilla King of the Monsters. He did a good job in this movie actually and that is why he appears in other movies outside of this I guess. Momoko Kochi also became a little Toho icon after this movie. Half Human (1955), she also appears in Godzilla King of the Monsters, The Mysterians (1957), Godzilla vs. Destroyah. Did a good job in this movie, nothing very big to mention but still good. Takashi Shimura the biggest actor of them all in this movie. He acted in over 200 movies and some were very big titles from Japan. This guy plays in so many big movies from Japan it would be to much to mention my favorites but to name some of the big ones, it would be the Akira Kurosawa movies he played in many of the samurai movies from him and also played in 4 of the well known Kaiju movies from Toho. He is always a good watch and did a good job in this one. Last of them I wanted to talk about is Akihiko Hirata also represented in other Godzilla movies. And one of my favorite monsters. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974), Terror of Mechgodzilla (1975), also a little heads up he was in Ultraman Monster big Battle (1976). He also did a great job here. Cinematography Well the setting is in Japan and some places in Tokyo mostly in the studio in Tokyo. And it is really great. Very good use of the camera angles by far from this era in the 50's. Sound\/Music I already did say something about this but the sound of this monster is the best in history. It shivers down your spine and Jurassic Park made its own version of this sound. Try to compare them. The music is known even today by the movie industry. And will be there for all time. Costumes\/Make-up The only thing to mention here is the Godzilla costume and it is absolutely amazing for its time. The way his body moves and the way his mouth moves at times is very good. Summary The director Ishiro Honda is one favorite to remember for all time. The man who created the monster genre like we know it today. I can't write up all of the movies I like about him but look him up on IMDb. I would recommend this to all but I can't promise that all will like it. If you like monster movies check out all the Toho movies like Gamera, Mothra, Ultraman, and Godzilla movie. You have many other monster movies by them to if you really like them. Some of them are really hard to come by but search on ebay and maybe you get lucky. But this movie is a masterpiece and everybody who love movies should watch this one time. And hopefully you get your mind in the direction to check out all of the Toho movies. I will review all of the Gamera and Godzilla movies very soon as I see them and take notes. So if you want more reviews keep up to date about my reviews. I am thinking of making video reviews on my youtube channel to if someone want to see my collection and have more fun with watching then reading reviews. As I was talking about earlier this movies morale is actually a bit of a propaganda movie. They still had a big grudge on the US for the Hiroshima bombing. And this goes on in this movie, I will not spoil anything big but have this in mind when watching it.

Yes. As a thriller, this ranks up there behind Citizen X and about at the level of Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer. Owen Wilson is the killer adrift in a world of lower middle-class environments and jobs. Wilson has always been hard to categorize.

I didn't remember much of it, except that the last time I saw it I came away with a so-so kind of impression. Well, this time it was worse. The movie, or I, didn't age well. Probably both.Obviously, it's an action flick, so the plot is paper thin, something to do with immortals trying to chop each other's heads off for reasons the writers had the good grace to mostly leave in the dark, and at some point the central conflict gets a little more personal anyway. The plot isn't the problem, by the standards of the genre it's as good as any.And, of course, being made in the 80ies there is only so much one can expect in terms of technical perfection. The fight scenes are a bit tedious, and the special effects funny, but that, too, isn't really the problem.One problem is that the acting is uniformly bad. In fact, it's been a while since I saw a cast that failed at their jobs in almost perfect harmony. To be fair, the script doesn't provide a awful lot of opportunity for great acting, but all major actors even fail at the most basic emotions, much less the few instances where some complexity might have been nice. In part that is also the fault of script, direction, and photography; a good example is a very emotional moment between our hero and his wife, which is filled with stilted monologue, quick glances at Lambert's expressionless face, and then sweeping landscape shots to illustrate the enormity of the emotion that the actor didn't.The story itself is confused, and the characters are difficult to care for, and cartoonish. A few immortals pop into (and often quickly out of, in ways that make a mockery of the concept of immortal) the storyline, but we never really learn much about them (with the exception of a little bit of background on Connery's character). The modern love story is contrived and ludicrous, and as much just a pretext for a little bit of mild nudity and humping as the rest is for the fight scenes. It's a carelessly strung together collection of stuff that is best not taken too seriously.Another small annoyance is the music --- good pieces by Queen, but as a soundtrack to a movie too intrusive.I guess it might still work for fans, but I doubt a modern viewer will get much pleasure from this movie.

Unfortunately, it was NOT like these other 'so bad they're good' movies--Meatballs 4 is just bad! When the film begins, you know you are in trouble for two huge reasons--it's a #4 and because it stars Corey Feldman. Neither bodes well for the quality of the picture, that's for sure! Sadly, it is much worse! It turns out the picture is a good camp versus bad camp film--a plot that was bled dry in the MANY other films (including, of course, the other Meatballs movies, but also variations of this in Revenge of the Nerds and too many other films). Add to that, completely unfunny jokes, bad writing, lots of horny and soul-less nude teens* and a stereotypical 'stupid fat guy'** (Brad Grunberg) for everyone to laugh at, and you definitely have a recipe for a terrible film.

After all, I have reviewed thousands of art, classic and foreign films. Well, it's because in addition to watching good films, every so often I try to watch a truly horrible film--so bad that it makes me laugh. A few good examples are The Apple, The Room or anything by the likes of William Grefe, Ed Wood or Al Adamson. And, since currently Meatballs 4 is #100 on IMDb's infamous 'Bottom 100' list, it seemed like it was just up my alley. Unfortunately, it was NOT like these other 'so bad they're good' movies--Meatballs 4 is just bad! When the film begins, you know you are in trouble for two huge reasons--it's a #4 and because it stars Corey Feldman. Neither bodes well for the quality of the picture, that's for sure! Sadly, it is much worse! It turns out the picture is a good camp versus bad camp film--a plot that was bled dry in the MANY other films (including, of course, the other Meatballs movies, but also variations of this in Revenge of the Nerds and too many other films). Add to that, completely unfunny jokes, bad writing, lots of horny and soul-less nude teens* and a stereotypical 'stupid fat guy'** (Brad Grunberg) for everyone to laugh at, and you definitely have a recipe for a terrible film.

I've seen all of Monty Python's films however I don't know much about him or anyone involved in the films. But I think that Life of Brian gives us a message. To Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. I don't think it's just a song at the end of the movie. I think it's a message. Because all of Monty Python's films are making fun of situations. Some frightening or dangerous situations. But the point is that it makes you happy(No doubt about that). It makes light of things. Which is how everyone should live their lives. Some religious people take it too seriously. I'm just saying to lay back and take a joke. This is coming from a raised Christian. The film isn't anti-Christian. It doesn't once mock Jesus or deny the existence of God. I'd say that this film has inspired me to look on the bright side of life no matter what. To be happy. This is a very funny and original comedy. It's a must see film which everyone should enjoy. Python's genius in comedy, returns for another equally great film.

I got a good feeling for what's worth to watch. But I had never heard about the movie before. And boy, was I right.I looked this up on IMDb, after watching what I thought was a charming and hilarious movie, and was baffled about a score of 4,7. I understand this film didn't hit the right spots back in 1994, but I'll tell you That was wrong then, and it's wrong now. If it felt was right to bash this back in 1994, this is still what should be considered as a gem now.The film is a typical Chevy Case movie from the 80'ies and 90'ies. It's almost like the Fletch movies or the National Lampoon's best vacation movies. But then, it's also Fletch- director Michael Ritchie. What's worse; this is rated at Ritchie's worst movie. Well, it's so wrong! I laughed way more then I have in many recent movies. Here Chase is doing a great job of a cops and robbers story, where Chase's strange family, called the Robbersons, is encountered by and awful lot of challenges, as he is when on his best. Jack Palance is great as the old Dr. Jeckyll and Mister Hyde-detective, and so is Robert Davi as the scaring and dangerous Osborn, which is staked out from Robbersons house, as their new neighbor. Diane Weist is lovely naive is the wife, and the kids are also great, with extra kudos to Miko Hughes as the youngest son with a Dracula-mania. He is so funny!This film is stupidly funny. It's silly, and it gets sillier the longer into the film you get, In the good way. It's charming, with hitchcockian mystery music, it's well played, an it's funny without full of foul language, being harassing or embarrassing the wrong way, like many comedies do now.This is plain funny, with stupid persons, which is all quite lovable.

For the majority of its runtime, it travels the same route many other examples of its genre have done before, narrates its complex plot in a manner that does enough to keep the viewers around until the end & within those final moments, delivers a masterstroke so profound that it changes everything that unfolded on the screen before.The story of The Usual Suspects is covered in flashbacks & is narrated by a small time conman who is one of the only two survivors from the boat explosion that killed 27 men. His recounting of the events during his interrogation by the FBI links back to the time when he & four other criminals were rounded up by the police after which they formed a group of their own. Things become interesting when the near-mythical criminal mastermind's name comes up.Fabulously directed by Bryan Singer, The Usual Suspects is his breakthrough feature for it instantly catapulted him into the Hollywood limelight & the way he managed to bring the outstandingly written script to life is laudable. Singer progresses the plot in a slow n steady manner which lets the tension build up naturally & also employs various twists n turns at regular intervals to keep the viewers guessing and he is wonderfully supported by its rich cast.However, the film lacks a refined presentation for the narrative sometimes feels convoluted while on other occasions, it's highly intriguing. Editing at times struggles with the pacing but for the most part, it's brilliantly carried out. Cinematography encapsulates the whole picture with a foreboding atmosphere along with a mysterious vibe while John Ottman's score further elevates those elements which in turn makes the experience all the more suspenseful.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite & others. And while everyone is good in their respective roles, Spacey manages to take his role further with remarkable simplicity whether it's his dialogue delivery, vacant expressions or cerebral palsy. Finally, the image of Keyzer Söze looms over the plot so much that the character is already an iconic figure way before appearing on the screen.On an overall scale, The Usual Suspects is a tense, confusing, captivating & entertaining cinema that delivers a mind-blowing experience the first time & is even more fun the second time around when you try to connect the dots from your first experience, and that's exactly when the film's biggest strength is revealed. It's so meticulously crafted with subtle placement of hints that it requires a bit of commitment from its audience but the reward in the end is incredibly fulfilling too. One of the defining works of 1990s cinema with a plot twist as legendary as Keyzer Söze himself, The Usual Suspects comes strongly recommended.

Cain's 1943 novella of the same name, Double Indemnity tells the story of an experienced insurance salesman who starts an affair with the seductive wife of one of his clients & devises a scheme to murder his client in a manner that invokes the double indemnity clause of his insurance plan. Trouble begins when his boss begins to suspect a foul play in the cleverly-executed accident.Co-written & directed by Billy Wilder, Double Indemnity is the first masterpiece of his career & marks the beginning of a legendary filmmaking journey that would later go down as one of cinema's finest. The film opens with what's supposed to be its closing moment & is then narrated by our protagonist, eventually coming full circle over the course of its runtime. And Raymond Chandler's contribution to the script cannot be understated.While the story alone lays down the groundwork for what a film-noir is supposed to be like, the technical aspects still introduce a number of innovations that would later be associated with this particular genre only. Cinematography makes terrific use of light & camera, Editing skilfully paces the whole plot throughout its 107 minutes of runtime & never lets the mystery fizzle out while the background score continues to elevate the suspenseful moments.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck & Edward G.

MacMurray plays Walter Neff; the insurance salesman, & is quite convincing in the given role, Stanwyck plays the femme-fatale Phyllis Dietrichson amazingly well too but for me, it's Robinson who really steals the show as Neff's boss Barton Keyes and moments between him n MacMurray are easily my favourites.On an overall scale, even though Wilder followed Double Indemnity with many more quality films, it still ranks amongst the most memorable & top-rated works of his illustrious career. Influential & unforgettable for its contribution to cinema, still hailed by many film lovers as the quintessential film-noir and effortlessly sustaining its thrills & nail-biting tension despite giving away the ending within the first few minutes, Double Indemnity is a brilliantly plotted, superbly executed & cleverly narrated cinema that comes strongly recommended.

It also had an amazing soundtrack that was mentioned countlessly in the script, and perfectly portrays music in the 1970's.Overall, this film is one of if not my favorite film of all time, and is a must-see for anybody that has ever even heard of the 1970's.A+ ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"9 August 2013","score":"","review":" One wonders if Amy Heckerling has a thing about sex not a positive thing but a negative thing, though this movie is not as anti-sex as Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The only two sexual encounters in this movie result in pregnancies, the first unwanted though the second is wanted. The first pregnancy is also very much a result from a sleazy guy married to a new age woman and uses all of his charm to get what he wants, and though he is a wonderful guy at the beginning, one quickly begins to see right through him.This movie is about a woman who has a baby and the father is not really all that interested so she decides to search for another father. The cab driver that took her too the hospital ended up being in the operating theatre when the baby was born and ends up being the babysitter. The twist in this movie is that we hear the babies' thoughts, and Bruce Willis seems to be a natural at this. I can just picture Willis having a lot of fun doing Mikey's voice-over.I guess this movie is working with an unusual concept, that of the baby's thoughts being heard, to drive the point of the fact that a baby needs a father. We have a couple of times when the baby wonders who the guy is that takes other babies away. Unfortunately the success of this movie meant that two sequels and a series were spawned from it which I don't think pushes the theme that this movie does.Personally I find that this movie is not as funny as I remembered it to be. There are a few really good lines though I did not think that having the baby talk added that much to it. It is interesting to see how people misinterpret the baby's actions, such as Mikey pulling out a photo of Jack saying that he wants Jack as his father while the others think he wants to see photos.Look Who's Talking was in its own way different when it hit the screens, but it was not that impacting that it sticks in the minds of people now.

In this movie the criminal is the good guy and the cops are the bad guys. Okay, they aren't exactly cops, but the warden of the prison, traditionally a good guy, has become the master villain. This movie is very pro-criminal and shows us that not all of them are evil, and in fact some of them are simply there at the wrong place and the wrong time and destroy their lives because of a simple mistake. The law tells us not to make those mistakes, but sometimes this is not always possible, especially for the easily lead.Leone (Sylvester Stallone) is finishing off a gaol term after he was locked up for an assault, and then later for escaping from lawful custody. He was six months to go in a nice prison, when during the night he is transferred to Gateway, the state's maximum security prison. We quickly find out that he has been brought to Gateway by the warden who is angry that when Leone escaped, he was treated as the criminal and Leone was the good guy. He resented this and he is determined that Frank Leone will pay for the humiliation that he caused him.The thing that catches me the most about this movie is the soundtrack. It is able to create an illusion of happiness in the midst of a time of trial and struggle. During the placid moments we are completely oblivious to the danger of the place in which Leone is in, and that the warden is actively against him trying to provoke him to commit a crime and find himself in prison for the rest of his life. The warden goes from simply torturing him to having his friend killed to provoke him to attack and kill his enemy.The warden is the major character which I shall look at. He is not an evil man, but rather he is a control freak who sees the world in aspects of good and evil. Everybody who is in gaol is inherently evil and they should not be let outside because they are responsible for the way the world is running. He is an uncompassionate man who considers the prisoners to be lower than humans because they have given up their rights because of the crimes that they have committed.Donald Sutherland does a brilliant job as the warden. He is so cruel and nasty, yet he is able to hide that side of him to the outside. It is also notable that not all of the guards are on the warden's side. The guards either do their job, love their job and carry it out to the extreme, or treat the prisoners as humans and question the actions of their colleagues. Through this movie we are confronted with the fact that people are not what they seem to be the prisoners are good people, the warden is a very bad and sadistic person, and the guards at first seem to be very brutal only to be revealed that the brutal guards are a minority among those who do their job. Moreso, it is the Negro guards that are the good ones, while the white guards are generally bullies.I like this movie and I also like Stallone as an actor. He is an emotional actor who plays his characters well. I liked him in Tango and Cash and the other movies that I have seen of his have been just as good.

He made three twenty-minute stories with the idea he could always release them as separate shorts if the feature idea didn't pan out. The problem with this is the high bar set by other Buster shorts, like The High Sign and The Scarecrow. Only the '20s section contains material you'd expect from such a master. The Roman section has a funny scene with a lion which is nevertheless underdeveloped, while the caveman stuff is a subtle as a club in the head.Despite the unevenness of the feature, you kind of need the three sections running together for their context. Like how Joe Roberts as the girl's father is the heavy in the first two sections, but a meek servant of his stern wife's will in the modern-day story. Or how a Ben-Hur style chariot race devolves into a football scrimmage when we move along in time.The 1920s section is, like I said, the best part here. While the historical-period stuff may be parodying D. W. Griffith's Intolerance, I get the feeling Buster here is playing off the work of fellow screen clown Harold Lloyd, whose never-say-die gumption Buster mimics to nearly tragic effect. Like Lloyd, Buster just won't quit. One attempted building-leap stunt, which actually went wrong in filming but was kept, works in retrospect because it's the sort of thing you always expected would happen to Lloyd, but never did, at least when the cameras were rolling.I also love Buster's five-minute drunk act in a restaurant, which includes some funny Prohibition humor. A woman sitting next to Buster starts to fix her make-up, so Buster whips out some shaving cream right there and joins her. Buster unknowingly orders crab, then freaks when the boiled crustacean is brought to his table.The other segments work just well enough as excuses for gags, even when the gags are somewhat thin in places. Leahy's a bit of a lump as the leading lady; apparently her career after this wasn't much more than Buster's other leading lady Brown Eyes from Go West enjoyed. Leahy does sell one good joke, her final scene in the Stone Age sequence. Beery's a bit too heavy for this role; one wishes Roberts had been given the job instead.Overall, I like the film; it's funny in an unassuming way, and better than many other history spoofs of more recent vintage.

This film begins in black and white, but when the filming begins, the film switches to colour.

It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another side of it.Because the movie has so much fun with the paradoxes and predicaments of a kid meeting his own parents, I won't discuss the plot in any detail. I won't even get into the horrifying moment when Marty discovers his mother has the hots for him. The movie's surprises are one of its great pleasures. Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit. ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi"}]
