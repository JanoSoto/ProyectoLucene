I rate it 8 to 8.5 at least. To my mind, it's in the same league as Casablanca. No, it doesn't have the same noirish feel, it isn't set in the background of a war (atleast not in the conventional sense) and it certainly isn't a life or death situation. And yet...It's also not a movie with your typical cliché headline - no one will write phrases like their life changes for ever or a coming of age story etc. about this one.What it is, to my mind, is story of one man, Billy Chapel, living in the limelight as it's fading and his war with time and with his own emotions. We all fight this war sometime (I'm on the wrong side of 40 myself); most times it's mainly in our heads with occasional interludes by people near & dear, but there's generally no audience (which is a good thing). If you happen to live in the limelight at such a time, you unfortunately have to fight on two fronts, a public one and a private one. This movie walks us through one such war and it's poignant and heart-warming mainly 'cause Kevin Costner plays it with such understated vulnerability that you root for the character even when he appears a bit clueless.Not the world's greatest movie, no special effects, no nothing other than simple human emotions. But that holds up well thru the 2.5hrs making it a wonderful watch. What could be better than that?

I feel even sadder that people insist on going to the wreck to look though it like ghouls. But anyway I digress.. I am not going to start by comparing this film to the fictional love story built on a back drop of a tragedy made by James Cameron in 1997. There is no point as they are two completely different films with 2 completely different agenda's and i feel those who have on here have missed the point to both these films. This film is meant to be the most true to history account of what happened on that night - obviously apart one or two technical things we weren't aware of when the film was made - i.e the ship splitting. Titanic 1997 was a fictional love story built around the backdrop of the sinking of Titanic and as such should be viewed as fiction. This film is beautiful. The performances are beautiful and believable able and you grow to love the characters and really root for them to make it - unfortunately some don't, its almost as disappointing on screen as it probably was in real life. More attention is paid to the crew and what when on behind the scenes rather than what the passengers got up in the first part of the film and I like that, although it does make you wonder why they insisted on sailing at such speed with the numerous ice reports and the freezing temperatures.

These characters are cast and crew of a variety show with more than its fair share of behind the scenes tumult. The star hippo is completely stressed out, the frog knife thrower (a Vietnam veteran) is a hopeless drug addict, and the rabbit MC believes himself to be dying of a venereal disease. In this wonderfully warped vision that co-writer \/ co-producer \/ director Jackson creates, puppets have sex, defecate, swear, vomit, and gruesomely slaughter each other. Yup, this is far from being appropriate for kids, but that's the whole point, and one is compelled to keep watching this deliciously dark comedy just to see what nastiness Jackson and company will come up with next. First rate puppeteering, truly fun puppet design, enthusiastic vocal performances, and genuinely catchy songs are part of the package in this priceless puppet perversion. The characters are entertaining, too, whether they're endearing (such as well intentioned nice guy Wobert the Hedgehog) or just plain despicable (Trevor the Rat, who indeed is every bit the walking and talking vermin). The movie is a marvel in terms of art direction and spectacle. One of the gut busting highlights has the flustered, in-over-his-head director fox staging his own production number where he pays tribute to sodomy. Jackson just dives headfirst into the mayhem, leaving all of the credits for the end, and does a fun job of skewering show business in general, with the appropriate casting of a fly as a stereotypically sleazy journalist set on exposing the hapless rabbit's secret.

The events of the ill fated journey of the ship is told in the midst of a beautiful love story between two people of differing social backgrounds & how they overcome all odds to be together. Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio), is a man who boarded the Titanic by chance. It was a gamble which had a third class ticket to the Titanic at stake. Rose DeWitt Bukater(Kate Winslet) is a woman of the royal family. She is one of the first few people who got a first class ticket for the very first voyage of the Titanic, along with other famous, wealthy & important people. So it was fate & fate alone, that brought Jack & Rose together. This is the synopsis of the movie.This is my review of the new 3D version of Titanic that released in 2012. First off, what a beautiful story. Sure, it's predictable, but, the way in which it's written ensures that you don't get bored even for a single second. The way that Jack & Rose fall in love is one of the highlights of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet share great chemistry together. Not to mention, that they've acted brilliantly! Both Oscar worthy performances. Unfortunately, only Kate Winslet won the award for best actress. The supporting characters are impressive as well. The way they've shown how the ship first hits the iceberg, starts flooding, tilts at a 180 degree angle & finally snaps into two makes the movie. All this looks even better in 3D! The best conversion from 2D to 3D ever! So, grab your 3D glasses, popcorn & soft drink & be prepared to witness a once in a lifetime experience all over again! James Cameron, take a bow! A must watch!

I thought it was going to be an amazing movie since it has received several good reviews. However I was greatly disappointed in this movie. As many others have stated, the first half of the movie is very boring. It's also not funny at all. I honestly found Guido to be very, very annoying. I also thought the way he tried to win over Dora was stupid. I mean to be honest, I just did not find him charming, or romantic. He was just not funny. I kept thinking to myself when is he going to get the girl so that all this nonsense stops. The second part of the movie was a little bit better, but not much. I could not stand the way Guido kept telling his son that them being there at the camp was a game, and that he would win a tank. I mean I know you don't want to scare your kids but come on. If I was a child and my father kept telling me stuff like that, I would know it wasn't true. I highly doubt his son was stupid, and I'm pretty sure he had an idea of what was going on. All in all, I just did not care for this movie. I found it slow, with lame attempts at comedy, and it just didn't keep my interest. THis movie did not touch me the way others say it has, and no I don't have a heart of ice, I am actually a very sensitive person. It didn't make me cry. I am glad I only rented it and did not purchase it. I give it a 1 out of 10.
