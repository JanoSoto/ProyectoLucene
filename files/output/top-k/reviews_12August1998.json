Tammy Lauren is adequate as the spunky heroine, and Andrew Divoff (mostly  consigned to minor B-villain roles - check him out in the Highlander TV  series) makes a chilling threat.  Jenny O'Hara makes the most of her role  as resident supernatural expert.  Yes, the gore is excessive, but I'm not  sure if that's a concession to the 90's audience, or a directorial conceit  - I'm willing to assume its the former.  For a supernatural thriller\/horror  (as opposed to a Scream-type slasher\/thriller), Wishmaster strikes me as one  of the better efforts to come along since the last Nightmare and the first  Candyman.
