[{"date":"19 October 2001","score":"","review":"  I saw this movie last night, and I have to say it is the BEST animated movie I have EVER seen.  The technical aspects of the animation are simply perfect.  Disney thinks it has the edge in animation.  Well, Dreamworks has been working VERY hard to take that edge away, and I think with Shrek and Antz, it has done that.  The characters look life-like without losing any of their fanciful characteristics.  The background characters and the scenery are simply fantastic.Now for the characters.  Shrek is simply outstanding.  He IS alive.  He is NOT that ugly, and in many ways we sympathize with his situation.  Picking Mike Myers to be his voice was a perfect.  The donkey named Donkey is another great character.  He's the main jokester and Edie Murphy makes him come alive.  The relationship he develops with the dragon is just TOO funny.  Princess Fiona is not like any other animated princess we have ever seen.  She quite a bitch in many ways, but we also sympathize with here situation.  And, King Farquod is just outstanding.  Being voiced by John Lithgow was another perfect decision.SPOILER!!!!!!!!This movie has SO many in-jokes, and pokes at Disney that it is hard to know where to begin.  All the Disney characters in the movie are in the public domain, anybody can use them.  There is Snow White (and the dwarves), Cinderella, the Three Little Pigs, the Three Blind Mice, and countless other Disney characters represented here.  Perhaps the FUNNIEST scene is when Princess Fiona sings in the forest with a blue bird, and sings at such a high pitch, that the bird explodes.  Then she cooks up the bird's eggs for breakfast.  VERY funny stuff. Anyway, as you can see, I just LOVED this movie.  It is most certainly an adult animated movie, but it can be enjoyed by anybody including little kids.  This is mainly because of Shrek himself.  He is VERY lovable from the very beginning of the movie.And a message to Disney.  You WILL NEVER do a movie like this.  Your rules simply restrict your ability to do movies like this.

This could all be the source of a good dark film, if it was handled and explored well, but it isn't here, and this film doesn't make a good transition to it as a subject.

It's a shame, because the first part really seems to be the opening to a view of cult deprogramming, with Ruth's zany family as a background (that bunch of characters is wasted, which is too bad), and then it suddenly becomes about sex, desperation and nastiness, nothing clever.

For a start though, I would have to admit that I do not consider this film to be a masterpiece in any way.  It has some outstanding good points, and gives quite a realistic slant on life - and yet some major flaws just spoil the overall seriousness of the issues involved.First of all, I just HAVE to mention Catherine Zeta-Jones' performance throughout this movie.  Although her actual acting of the role is excellent (in fact, perfect), I have never heard another actor\/actress speak in American, English and Welsh accents all in one movie!  It is rather a shame I found this so noticeable, because otherwise I feel she had surpassed herself in this film.Meanwhile, Michael Douglas I found to be extremely likeable, which is a new thing for me. Benicio Del Toro just once again convinced me that he IS the most interesting and intense actor around at the moment.  I don't believe he has ever made a film where he has not put absolutely everything into his role, and this is no exception.  Beni, even as a less-than-white character, always carries a strong screen presence which commands a certain respect and admiration.  Don Cheadle is impressive, Dennis Quaid is also pretty good, and I was surprised to see a cameo from Albert Finney (how strange to see him in this movie!)  The drugs issues in this movie are, on the whole, very true to life and almost depressingly realistic.  I watched this film shortly after a shocking incident at my school which I found this movie echoed perfectly.  As portrayed by the daughter in 'Traffic', it is often the rich kids, with too much brains and money for their own good, who end up turning to drugs and crime.  However, in other respects this movie was rather shallow.

There are many many funny movies, that I have laughed it, (most from the far past), so I am not without a sense of humor, you see. It is absolutely beyond my comprehension how so many critics can think this is a good movie.  But then, for all I know this is better than much of what's out there these days.

But the movie seemed very tame and watered down - it was hinted that a lot of sex went on, and that drugs were rife, but it didn't depict this very realistically. The plot centered around Shane (Ryan Phillipe), a kid from New Jersey who ends up working at 54, and gets sucked into the whole lifestyle surrounding it. Phillipe's performance was satisfactory, but by no means outstanding. In fact the only good performance was by Mike Myers as 54's owner, Steve Rubell, who comes across as a kid who never really grew up, and never wanted the party of youth to end. Myers' performance is stunning, and you totally forget he ever played Austin Powers, which is how it should be! The rest of the supporting cast was disappointingly mediocre, as was most of the movie. It seemed to lack a certain something, and the plot was very choppy - it was obvious that some storylines were developed, but then never properly concluded. Overall, I'd say if you want to see a good movie about the 70s club scene, see Saturday Night Fever - it's more realistic, has a better storyline, better developed characters, better acting, and last of all, better music!

I thought that Arnie's career was rapidly and irreversibly heading downhill after almost a decade's worth of movies that would have looked better roasted to a golden-brown on a Thanksgiving table. I've not liked anything he's done since True Lies, and even that was suspect.However, The 6th Day is a pleasant surprise, though it's hard to pin down exactly why. I mean, of course it's formulaic Arnold stuff, with the requisite amounts of excellently implemented SFX and shoot-outs, car chases and so on to keep the popcorn munchers happy. But there's more to this than meets the eye.It's partially that the underlying plot premise has been intelligently conceived and implemented. The ethical issues raised by cloning are already with us, and the technological advances that the movie asks the audience to believe in do not require too much of a leap of faith... they probably are just around the corner. Add to that muted questions such as what is identity, what makes a human being and what justifies life that are being asked in a subtle way, and The 6th Day can be enjoyed on more than one level. Don't get me wrong... it's not deeply philosophical, because hey, it's an Arnie movie, but it's not altogether shallow either.The 6th Day is also helped because Arnie isn't a total superman any more, unlike his films of 15 years ago. He can't leap tall buildings at a single bound, so he's actually required to act a little, and doesn't do too badly at all. His relationship with his wife and daughter is believably familiar and almost touching on occasion, and the movie's bodycount isn't too unrealistically high.Roger Spottiswoode directs with an accomplished eye for the visual, and it shows, because the movie is visually a treat. There's also a *lot* of homage to Paul Verhoeven in this, with the side SFX touches - the virtual girlfriend, the shopping mall, the self-stocking refrigerator, the media-rich mirrors etc etc - nicely adding a lightly ironic credibility to what the next generation's future probably holds. Okay, so it's been done before by Verhoeven in both Robocop and Starship Troopers to name but two, but it worked then and it works even more effectively now.***SPOILER***If I was to quibble about anything, it'd be the schmaltzy and definitely forced ending. The whole tenet of the movie is that it's your memories and feelings that makes you *you*, so Arnie 2's easy acceptance that he has no right to his family's love, and indeed his whole previous life, despite having risked life and limb for those he loves for the entire film hit my credibility threshold with a loud and leaden clang. I really don't think anyone would wander happily off to Argentina without much of a second thought in that situation. You should have killed one of the two Arnies off, Roger, in a moment of self-sacrifice to ensure the survival and ongoing happiness of the other - yes, yes, I know it'd be clichéd, but still you chickened out.However, despite this, The 6th Day is an enjoyable action movie, well executed and you never know, it may even make you think a little.

Not only to teens in general dislike musicals, but teen comedies with the Shakespeare theme are really growing old and it would be a hard job to come up with something that is fresh and new. Get Over It, a zany and fresh film, does not disappoint. This is a likeable musical that not only teens will enjoy. I'm sure all audiences will find a few qualities and maybe some will love the movie. I found it to be a cutesy, extremely fast (sometimes too fast) and well-built flick. The chemistry between the two leads &#150; Kirsten Dunst and Ben Foster &#150; is very believable and although predictable, the love story is well put-together and generally likeable. The acting is even better. Ben Foster is a strong newcomer and Kirsten Dunst once again proves she is the queen of teen movies, although she better lose that angle soon or she'll be up for Prom Queen once more! However, Martin Short steals the show. Almost every word that came out of his mouth was hilarious to me. I was in a fit laughing. Great characterisation there Martin. Does he realise though that is the second film that he has been in that involves fairies? Maybe he likes the fluttering phonies. The movie does use recycled jokes in places, which disappointed me. However, most of the humour is solid, strong and fresh, so don't worry, even if we have seen a girl fly over a car before while she's running, you'll still laugh. This movie has a great soundtrack, some very cool ideas, great sets, is very funny, romantic and highly enjoyable with some excellent acting and accents.

This movie has a great soundtrack, some very cool ideas, great sets, is very funny, romantic and highly enjoyable with some excellent acting and accents.

Not only to teens in general dislike musicals, but teen comedies with the Shakespeare theme are really growing old and it would be a hard job to come up with something that is fresh and new. Get Over It, a zany and fresh film, does not disappoint. This is a likeable musical that not only teens will enjoy. I'm sure all audiences will find a few qualities and maybe some will love the movie. I found it to be a cutesy, extremely fast (sometimes too fast) and well-built flick. The chemistry between the two leads &#150; Kirsten Dunst and Ben Foster &#150; is very believable and although predictable, the love story is well put-together and generally likeable. The acting is even better. Ben Foster is a strong newcomer and Kirsten Dunst once again proves she is the queen of teen movies, although she better lose that angle soon or she'll be up for Prom Queen once more! However, Martin Short steals the show. Almost every word that came out of his mouth was hilarious to me. I was in a fit laughing. Great characterisation there Martin.

In this alternate version of the Sherlock legend, the great detective and his sidekick (future doctor)Watson meet as young teens in boarding school. Here they solve their first mystery, concerning a mysterious figure who causes several deaths by shooting his (her?) victims with darts filled wit a powerful hallucinogenic. Eventually, they are led to a mysteriously powerful cult. And of course, there's a bit of romance (no, not between Holmes and Watson).Sounds pretty good for a kid's adventure, huh?Well, as I mentioned earlier, the screenplay by Chris Columbus (director of the new Harry Potter movie)is seriously flawed. Obviously, some research into Holmes' fictional history went into the creation of the movie's revisionist story. But, beyond a couple of clever revelations foreshadowing the adult Holmes canon, Columbus' screenplay completely ignores the most important element of the Holmes character, the element that has made the character one of the genre's most enduring Holmes' uncanny observational and deductive abilities. The payoff of every Holmes story comes when he explains how he has deduced what seemed, up until that point in the story, impossible for him to know. He basically goes through the entire process and we marvel at is abilities as a detective.Well, Young Sherlock Holmes has none of that. Columbus' version of Holmes and Watson simply fall effortlessly from one clue after another, moved not by Holme's deductive abilities, but by the machinations of teh screenplay alone. In other words, the great Sherlock Holmes doesn't really figure much out.If a second screenwriter had been hired to create an actual mystery to lay over Columbus' adolecent adventure--perhaps puzzlemaster Anthony Peter Shaffer (Sleuth)--the movie would have been much more involving. As it stands, it's The Goonies with posh London accents.Then I'm sure we would have had Young Sherlock Holmes 2 Moriarty Returns and on and on. Perhaps its time for a remake.

To me it brought forth feelings that I had tried to keep down.  Now, I believe that most moms have felt at one point in time that they are sacrificing most of their lives, hopes or dreams for their children, and maybe at one point possibly resented a bit of that, thinking that maybe you shouldn't have gotten yourself into this mess in the first place and went forth with being whatever it is you wanted to be, or do whatever it is that you always dreamed of doing.  You may possibly think this, but keep it deep down inside your heart, and just be a good mom, doing whatever you can to keep sane, and still find some time to try and make something in your life work out the way you had originally planned.

No complaints about Willis' performance again, and Jackson is also good in a different type of role to that he usually plays.

I personally got tired by what I saw as a basic retread by Shyamalan of his earlier effort, with a few plot points re jigged for good measure.
