I watched a few horrors as a child that terrified me to the point of small amounts of sleep. Since then I have watched no horror films. I've avoided things that may scare me. So no, I'm not like most teenagers that have watched the modern horrors and don't understand the classics. I decided to watch this film because I wanted to introduce myself to horror through what is considered to be the most psychologically terrifying film of all time.Was I disappointed? No. Did I get what I expected? No. This film didn't scare me at all. I scare easily, so this came as a shock. I can't understand why everyone finds this film terrifying. So why the 8? Well, it may not have terrified me but I still loved it. I can't really say that it was a masterpiece, as others have, but I certainly loved it. I'm a huge fan of the surreal nature of The Shining. I loved the way it was filmed; the style. The shots were very creepy and unique. The director, Stanley Kubrick, certainly knew what he was doing.Another thing that made this film great was the music. Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind did an amazing job with it. If anything made me scared in this film, it'd be the music. It, along with the camera work and lighting, made the entire thing surreal and brilliant. This is the thing that made the film so fantastic. Well, this and Jack Nicholson, who plays the main character. The creepy atmosphere was perfect for this film and added a perfect tension to everything. It made everything just a little more insane.I can't say I enjoyed the writing too much. It didn't really add up and could have been written better. I heard that there was a reason for this, but I see no reason except to confuse the audience. It felt like the writers, Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson, were on some sort of drug. Although to be honest it sort of felt like the whole film was. It wasn't bad writing, just confusing and muddled. At times it was in fact quite intelligent and well done.Apparently the movie is nothing like the novel (when is it ever?). I have never read the novel, but from what I have heard from Stephen King, the writer of the novel, and many fans of both, it is much more terrifying and creates a very different atmosphere to what the film does. I must disagree with the author of The Shining on his opinion that this isn't a good film. What I do agree with is that Jack Torrence, the main character, should gradually become insane, as he apparently does in the novel, not start off as insane like in the film. Or maybe that's just the brilliant Jack Nicholson. He does have that insane affect on his characters.Unique? Yes. Creepy? Yes. Surreal? Yes. The most terrifying film ever made? No. To be perfectly honest, I don't think this film deserves the attention it gets. It was and is still a great film, but it certainly isn't the most terrifying horror ever, as many have stated. I would recommend this to people, but not for the same reasons others have. The surrealistic nature of this film is what stands out to me. It's what makes the film completely fresh and unique compared to anything else ever made.I'm sorry if I'm repetitive or my review is of low quality; I'm awfully tired.

Bloody depressing thought! I very recently rediscovered this purely by chance when I put in a search engine the only, very vague details that I remembered about it - British black comedy, daughter Joyce, and voilà! A virtually unheard of dark gem was lifted from the mists of obscurity by the wonders of modern technology! And it really was a great find for me, it turned out to be just as sharp and strange as I had very dimly remembered it. Very well acted by the three main cast members around whom the drama revolves, effective if not a little dull and dreary 50's setting, I find something so fascinating about the films set in that whole era that are all about scratching under the painfully restrained starchy veneer of the time and revealing the hotbed of seething sexual frustration lurking just beneath... And it's based on a rather grim true story too - although that's the problem with the movies that are based on real events, you never know just what's true and what isn't. It has such a powerfully odd and edgy tone to it that I've never come across with any other film ever. It's like a self-aware spoof of sexual tension, and is pretty funny in a saucy 50's British kind of way that in this instance I can really appreciate, but what I most enjoy about it is that despite it's mostly mundane and deceptively simple quietude, it's also at the same time in a really sly and insidious way quite subtly dark and more than a little disturbing. Although much of this dire tale is somewhat lighthearted and tongue-in-cheek humour there's also a sense of urgency to it, the humour is balanced out with moments of well-placed intensity, and the comedy and suspense is brilliantly intertwined. It's very much a black comedy with a real edge and rawness to it, not just for the dialogue, but for the increasingly tense atmosphere and mood generated by the character interactions, which work to humorous and unnerving effect, as the three very different tones of the three very troubled and overly-close individuals just collide and cause all kinds of mayhem in their wake, and the situation slowly builds and escalates until things become downright deadly by the end. I just love the way you can feel that madness slowly simmer and grow! It's astonishingly well acted by all concerned, but I was most impressed by Rupert Graves who's low-key performance as the seemingly weak-willed and naive Harold was probably the best in the film in terms of complexity and character development. His character gets more and more confused and aggravated as the nightmare he's essentially trapped in works on his mind, and you get a strong sense of this man's desperation and need to escape. The dynamic between the three leads is amazing. At first it appears that they are merely getting sick of each other, but it soon turns into outright hostility, and it was only a matter of time before such uncontrollable anger would turn them against each other, their behaviour becoming ever-more erratic and aggressive until it all reaches a boiling point in the chaotic scene of violent murder at the end. There is something so chilling and distressing about the way that whole final scene is shot. It's so stark, and right in the middle of a bright beautiful day, and even though you somehow just know that the film is not going to end well, I doubt anyone watching for the first time would have been expecting such a horrendous scene. It seems to come out of nowhere and is so sudden, it's born out of spite and barely-contained loathing and is almost gruelling to watch. It left me stunned.  A startlingly well-realised and controversial film that doesn't pull any punches is how I would describe this one. It's presented in a no-nonsense fashion and avoids melodrama and remains plausible and realistic, while still maintaining the humour. I find it complex for its plot, themes and characters. It's planned and carried out with great care and at its heart is quite twisted and delves deep into the motivations of three people who get very carried away and keep blaming each other, instead of taking responsibility for their own actions until it's too damn late.

It is full of adventure but maybe holds back on the action and stunts but still manages enough to be a fun film to watch and the story takes the upper level here, as opposed to the things we see happen. I felt it was a strongly OK film and here is why I felt so.The story is slower and much more reserved than most of Connery's before but I personally felt that is was a good crime film, the villain was illusive and we didn't meet him before the final part of the film. The plot is solid as well and it's Bond being a secret agent again, now he does hold back on gadgets and stunts yes but if anything this Bond is one of the most rational Bond's of this kind of era as although the villain is superbly ambitious, he is also just simply an assassin.Moore is at his same self as his first film and performs well enough not for the Bond to become boring and very stale. Christopher Lee is the biggest character in this with his villainous performance and terrific acting skill making him one of the most memorable Bond villains around. I felt the entire cast did an OK job and as I said when times were more quiet with just Bond kind of walking around, the cast made it dramatic and nice and managed to create an interesting film even though the plot is subdued.The script, direction and cinematography are all basic and don't deserve any extra praise in a sense, I did however enjoy whoever the location scouts were because some places used are beautiful and literally make the film slightly better. The sets are also brilliant and on a large scale too making this Bond one of the most realistic Bond's for a little while. I also did enjoy the few stunts in this film, especially the Boat scene with Bond which is similar to the one on Live and Let Die(in more ways than one).The film as I have said is slow and can take a little while to get started, you have to really be patient with this one and I personally didn't feel rewarded fully, but it was a good try of a film. It misses gadgets and stunts in parts where they could come in handy and especially the gadgets are needed more because they make Bond who he is and they really don't use them here in this film.Bond fans alike will maybe not like this as much as others and some may enjoy it, I can imagine among the viewers in the modern era, views will be mixed and split peoples decisions. People who enjoy the more suave Bond will like it too because he acts more like he is undercover the entire film rather than fight and shoot, the humour is also there we expect of Moore and although not his funniest, it isn't really annoying either.Overall a 6\/10, maybe I did overate this film but I felt coming from watching it that it was entertaining and although quite long to say what is going on in it, it still pleased me as a Bond series film as well.

It is full of adventure but maybe holds back on the action and stunts but still manages enough to be a fun film to watch and the story takes the upper level here, as opposed to the things we see happen. I felt it was a strongly OK film and here is why I felt so.The story is slower and much more reserved than most of Connery's before but I personally felt that is was a good crime film, the villain was illusive and we didn't meet him before the final part of the film. The plot is solid as well and it's Bond being a secret agent again, now he does hold back on gadgets and stunts yes but if anything this Bond is one of the most rational Bond's of this kind of era as although the villain is superbly ambitious, he is also just simply an assassin.Moore is at his same self as his first film and performs well enough not for the Bond to become boring and very stale. Christopher Lee is the biggest character in this with his villainous performance and terrific acting skill making him one of the most memorable Bond villains around. I felt the entire cast did an OK job and as I said when times were more quiet with just Bond kind of walking around, the cast made it dramatic and nice and managed to create an interesting film even though the plot is subdued.The script, direction and cinematography are all basic and don't deserve any extra praise in a sense, I did however enjoy whoever the location scouts were because some places used are beautiful and literally make the film slightly better. The sets are also brilliant and on a large scale too making this Bond one of the most realistic Bond's for a little while. I also did enjoy the few stunts in this film, especially the Boat scene with Bond which is similar to the one on Live and Let Die(in more ways than one).The film as I have said is slow and can take a little while to get started, you have to really be patient with this one and I personally didn't feel rewarded fully, but it was a good try of a film. It misses gadgets and stunts in parts where they could come in handy and especially the gadgets are needed more because they make Bond who he is and they really don't use them here in this film.Bond fans alike will maybe not like this as much as others and some may enjoy it, I can imagine among the viewers in the modern era, views will be mixed and split peoples decisions. People who enjoy the more suave Bond will like it too because he acts more like he is undercover the entire film rather than fight and shoot, the humour is also there we expect of Moore and although not his funniest, it isn't really annoying either.Overall a 6\/10, maybe I did overate this film but I felt coming from watching it that it was entertaining and although quite long to say what is going on in it, it still pleased me as a Bond series film as well. This film is worth the watch I say even if your not watching Bond's in order or something, I feel it will entertain you, although not as much and anywhere near other Bonds before and after it.

I was impressed with the creativity and the quality of the element combinations between the orchestra music and the animations. Also, there was a smooth transition feeling between the various segments of the movie; making each segment more enjoyable. The colors in this magical musical animation were amazing. All the scenes were pretty much full of colors and made me feel as I was a child again. The colors were bright and dark at times, but they were brought to live with the music allowing the audience to relax and enjoy the visual elements. The lighting plays an important part of the film. In parts of the film, like in the Sorcerer's Apprentice, the lights and shadow gave a more realistic look at the animation. For example, Mickey Mouse salutes Mr. Taylor (the narrator) at the end of the segment, providing a unique interaction between real and fictional characters. Lastly, during the orchestra intermissions, the audience can appreciate the human and musical instrument's shadows as they are living to take a break; this effect lets the audience feel as you are sitting down in a theater, watching the orchestra perform live. Fantasia is educational and provided a lot of elements for the audience to use their imagination. A good example is the prehistoric segment as it educates about different dinosaurs and their food sources; and how the world changed to a new era. Also, there are other segments in which people can relate to their belief and dreams. Overall the movie is great to explore imagination and enjoy classical music with art, but I would recommend not watching it if you are tired or you could relax too much and fall asleep. To fully enjoy the movie, make sure you are rested and transport to a colorful world.I must add that Fantasia is not for all audiences unless you enjoy classical music and animations; and if you are watching the film with children, please be prepared to explain some scenes as the general audience standards for rating movies and TV shows have changed. Thus, parents should watch the film before their kids to be ready to answer questions such as the naked angels, dark and mean Gods, Mickey Mouse using an ax to chop up a broom, fighting horses acting like ducks, and so on. This is a beautiful movie, but as times have changed and what was acceptable before, it is not anymore.

Most of them offer colorful, vivid spectacles in wonderful places, but when drawing on ancient myth and legend, very few truly recognize that our history is full of darkness and savagery. In the 1930s, Robert E. Howard created a legend of his own, channeling all the primal brutality and bloodshed of the ancient times into one savage hero Conan, the Cimmerian who would become a warrior, a pirate, a conqueror, and eventually a king. Conan's adventures in literature took him across all corners of the ancient Earth, to battle countless enemies, vicious monsters, and the darkest magic. Films with this same rawness seem to only come once in a great while.1982's cinematic debut of Conan is a welcome break from the typical sugar-coated fantasy fare; the film doesn't hold back on showing brutal warfare, liberal bloodshed, rampant sex, and savage landscapes. Right from the beginning, the savagery is palpable. At the same time, the film is not all that trashy about it; is uses only as much blood and gore as it needs to to tell the story. Using only a light amount of excess, the film progresses through a lengthy adventure full of cool battles and memorable scenes, with the right pacing and an appropriate tone that's not too bleak but not too lightweight. As it is, this incarnation of Conan is fun and awesome to watch, and even after a sequel, remake, and video game, it hasn't been matched since.The original stories can get a bit derivative Conan usually appears somewhere to slay some bad guys, get the girl, get the treasure, defeat evil, blah blah blah. This film ventures into the same formulaic territory, but before doing so, it lays the groundwork by chronicling Conan's origins, in a tragic opening sequence that's so fundamental in nature that it's been seen before. From then on, the film maintains a solid pathos that allows us to follow and root for Conan on his sprawling quest of vengeance. Conan is a fundamental hero to the core, and the film expresses all his characteristics - his strength, his beliefs, his motivations - aptly. The side characters he picks up are lovable, and their enemies are bad guys we love to hate. The plot is pieced together using some scenes inspired by the original stories, but it all flows really well, thanks mostly to the characters and their chemistry. It's all set in a world that looks primal, but not quite as dark or magical as the original stories.This film boasts some good-looking photography. It can be pretty murky and drab at times, but the camera angles are great and the imagery overall is solid. Editing has a few weak parts, but is still mostly good.

James Earl Jones is literally hypnotic as the main villain, and everybody else does okay. Writing has a few weak spots, but there are still quite a few good lines. This production uses some limited, but very real-looking and detailed sets, props, and costumes. Basil Poledoris' music score is epic, grand, and a thing of beauty in itself.Conan the Barbarian is one of the very few epic\/fantasy films that's so raw and brutal, but it's still a fine adventure with lovable characters and solid plotting. Some may call this film overly violent or stupid, especially in the way it revels in savagery. But I've always valued the beauty of savagery, for I believe there is something compelling about the primal nature of this character.

'Pixote...' (pronounced peeshot) is very well known in Brazil but unfortunately less known elsewhere. I had heard of the film some time ago but when I finally saw it I was overwhelmed.The film is directed by Hector Babenco, probably best known to English speaking audiences for 'Kiss of the Spider Woman' which was far from his best work (i.e this). The subtitle of the film literally means 'the law of the weakest' and here Babenco presents us with a harrowing and all too realistic portrayal of the life of a Brazilian street child. Pixote (Fernando Ramos Da Silva) is a 10 year old boy who is taken from the streets of Sao Paulo by the police along with a group of other boys. A judge has been murdered and the street children are always picked up as suspects. However, Brazilian law states that nobody under 18 can be tried as an adult so those accused are simply thrown into reformatories as punishment without trial.The hell that is the reformatory forces Pixote to become tougher just to survive. On his first night he witnesses the rape of another boy. His hair is shaved off and he smokes dope for solace with his friend Fumaca. In the reformatory the boys watch violent TV shows and act out planned robberies. Another boy, the homosexual Lilica, is accused of the judge's murder but refuses to admit to a crime he did not commit. A group of the boys are forced to attend a staged identification parade and Fumaca is accused of the murder. Fumaca is returned to the dormitory later having been so badly beaten that he dies of his injuries. His body is dumped on a rubbish tip. The police then blame Fumaca's murder on another boy who is also beaten to death. This boy was Lilica's lover and in his despair and anger Lilica leads a rebellion and the dormitory is set on fire. Lilica is then accused of his lover's murder and attempts to kill himself by cutting his wrists.Lilica, Pixote and two other boys, Dito and Chico, then escape from the reformatory and return to the streets and to petty crime. They soon become involved in selling cocaine. Lilica and Dito fall in love. The group then take the train to Rio to visit drug dealer Debora who double crosses them and refuses to pay what they are owed. Pixote and Chico later meet Debora by chance and in the resulting fracas Chico is killed and Pixote fatally stabs Debora. The 3 remaining boys then meet up with a prostitute called Sueli and pimp for her so that they can then rob her customers. Dito and Sueli grow close and Pixote treats Sueli as a mother figure. Lilica becomes jealous and leaves. In a clumsily bungled robbery attempt Pixote murders one of Sueli's customers.The film is more about the relationships between the boys and the suffering they go through than it is about crime and violence. However, Babenco does not spare his audience any of the grim reality of their lives. Nothing is glamorised. The drugs scenes and violence are very real. The boys are not portrayed as heroes, just sad survivors. Pixote is not bad , just someone trying to survive through daily doses of death and horror. The police are corrupt and evil. The drug dealers and prostitutes are deceitful and vicious. Ultimately though, what makes this film truly great is Babenco's gritty direction. There's no fancy camera angles or atmospheric music. Everything is left to the actors who are filmed in a chilling matter-of-fact style which makes you feel almost as if you were there watching the horror of the boys lives first hand.The acting is astounding, particularly when you consider that many of the cast had no previous acting experience. All of the child actors in Pixote are from Brazil's streets, coaxed into the film by Babenco in order to call attention to their living conditions. Jorge Juliao as Lilica is excellent and plays the part with a sensitivity that makes it clear that he just wants to be loved no matter how he does it. And as for Fernando Ramos Da Silva as Pixote, with his sad eyed, distant resilience, you could not expect more from a child actor playing such a demanding and gruelling part. You feel that Da Silva actually 'is' Pixote and he may well have been. What makes Da Silva's portrayal of Pixote even more poignant to me is that after completing the film he went on to sink back into poverty and crime, and at age 19 was shot dead by police who claimed he was involved in a robbery. His life became the subject of the 1996 film 'Who Killed Pixote?', which showed that despite the outcry created by Pixote, Brazil had done little to alleviate the conditions portrayed.In summary, this film is a magnificent and moving study of the dark and dangerous lives of Brazil's street children. However, if you are easily upset or shocked then give it a miss. There are painfully realistic portrayals of violence and drug abuse. There are also scenes of a strong sexual nature. But to me what was hardest to stomach was the suffering and abuse that these children endured. Nobody deserves this sort of life. Furthermore, I know that this really goes on in Brazil (and to be fair, probably many other countries) and that is one of the sadnesses of this otherwise beautiful country. Still, this film is not really about Brazil. It is about poverty, resilience, desperation, the search for love, and man's inhumanity to man (or in this case child).I cannot recommend this film highly enough - but be prepared for an uncomfortable ride and don't let the kids watch.

(pronounced peeshot) is very well known in Brazil but unfortunately less known elsewhere. I had heard of the film some time ago but when I finally saw it I was overwhelmed.The film is directed by Hector Babenco, probably best known to English speaking audiences for 'Kiss of the Spider Woman' which was far from his best work (i.e this). The subtitle of the film literally means 'the law of the weakest' and here Babenco presents us with a harrowing and all too realistic portrayal of the life of a Brazilian street child. Pixote (Fernando Ramos Da Silva) is a 10 year old boy who is taken from the streets of Sao Paulo by the police along with a group of other boys. A judge has been murdered and the street children are always picked up as suspects. However, Brazilian law states that nobody under 18 can be tried as an adult so those accused are simply thrown into reformatories as punishment without trial.The hell that is the reformatory forces Pixote to become tougher just to survive. On his first night he witnesses the rape of another boy. His hair is shaved off and he smokes dope for solace with his friend Fumaca. In the reformatory the boys watch violent TV shows and act out planned robberies. Another boy, the homosexual Lilica, is accused of the judge's murder but refuses to admit to a crime he did not commit. A group of the boys are forced to attend a staged identification parade and Fumaca is accused of the murder. Fumaca is returned to the dormitory later having been so badly beaten that he dies of his injuries. His body is dumped on a rubbish tip. The police then blame Fumaca's murder on another boy who is also beaten to death. This boy was Lilica's lover and in his despair and anger Lilica leads a rebellion and the dormitory is set on fire. Lilica is then accused of his lover's murder and attempts to kill himself by cutting his wrists.Lilica, Pixote and two other boys, Dito and Chico, then escape from the reformatory and return to the streets and to petty crime. They soon become involved in selling cocaine. Lilica and Dito fall in love. The group then take the train to Rio to visit drug dealer Debora who double crosses them and refuses to pay what they are owed. Pixote and Chico later meet Debora by chance and in the resulting fracas Chico is killed and Pixote fatally stabs Debora. The 3 remaining boys then meet up with a prostitute called Sueli and pimp for her so that they can then rob her customers. Dito and Sueli grow close and Pixote treats Sueli as a mother figure. Lilica becomes jealous and leaves. In a clumsily bungled robbery attempt Pixote murders one of Sueli's customers.The film is more about the relationships between the boys and the suffering they go through than it is about crime and violence. However, Babenco does not spare his audience any of the grim reality of their lives. Nothing is glamorised. The drugs scenes and violence are very real. The boys are not portrayed as heroes, just sad survivors. Pixote is not bad , just someone trying to survive through daily doses of death and horror. The police are corrupt and evil. The drug dealers and prostitutes are deceitful and vicious. Ultimately though, what makes this film truly great is Babenco's gritty direction. There's no fancy camera angles or atmospheric music.

Robocop is a classic movie that was ahead of its time. The second sequel was a major disappointment, but this movie is even worse. This isn't the train-wreck people say it is, but it's pretty mediocre. When Peter Weller refuses to return as Robocop, Nancy Allen only agreeing to return if her character is killed off, you know things are in dire straits. A P.G Robocop isn't very effective, you just don't do it. I realize the remake of Robocop is P.G, I don't agree with that either. Robocop should be loaded with violence and bloodshed, just the way it is. The violence is so toned down because of the PG rating that it hampers the movie in a huge way. Nancy Allen was a fixture in this series, this is how you repay her? Not only that, but Robocop's revenge was so anti-climatic. I wanted to see something gritty vengeance, not the stuff we got. Flying Robcop with a jetpack? It's like the writers wanted to purposely crap all over the legacy of Robocop. The set-up is actually filled with potential, but it fails to maximize on it. It should have been much more intense than it was. It's filled with droll humor that seems so out-of- place. Wait until you see the scene where a bank robber walks into a diner with a machine gun, only for a bunch of cops with guns to be there. The acting is OK.

It's not entirely his fault, he has nothing to work with. Nancy Allen is a trooper for agreeing to a small role. CCH Pounder gives the best performance in the film. Remy Ryan is tolerable as the kid. Thankfully, she didn't overdo it. Jill Hennessy is gorgeous to look at, average performance wise. They didn't explore her character enough. People like Mako, Rip Torn & Bradley Whitford are wasted in their roles. This isn't the atrocity people say it is, but it's a lifeless sequel that killed the franchise.

It's not entirely his fault, he has nothing to work with. Nancy Allen is a trooper for agreeing to a small role. CCH Pounder gives the best performance in the film. Remy Ryan is tolerable as the kid. Thankfully, she didn't overdo it. Jill Hennessy is gorgeous to look at, average performance wise. They didn't explore her character enough. People like Mako, Rip Torn & Bradley Whitford are wasted in their roles. This isn't the atrocity people say it is, but it's a lifeless sequel that killed the franchise. The PG rating really makes this a mundane experience, along with some stupid writing.

It's one of the extremely few films to actually make me cry and its sheer power makes it Lars Von Trier's masterpiece for me. When I heard about Breaking the Waves and how it's part of the same 'Golden Hearts' trilogy as Dancer in the Dark, I just had to see it. I'm not a normal cinema-goer who goes out to see mainstream films for entertainment. Of course, I do do this from time to time. I'm not a complete film snob. However, the films which I admire the most are the ones which pack a strong emotional punch which you never forget. I love depressing films which stun me into silence and play on my mind for days after seeing it. Breaking the Waves is one of these films.Whilst I personally don't think it's quite as good as Dancer in the Dark (I just love how Dancer in the Dark is a musical and everything) it's certainly not far off, and is definitely one of Lars Von Trier's (a director I admire very much) greatest films and one of the greatest films I've ever seen period. Just like Dancer in the Dark, the film opens on a happy and humorous note. Our hero, Bess is getting married to the love of her life, Jan and everyone's having a wonderful time. Not least is Bess who discovers the magical powers of making love. A stark contrast to the loveless sex she has during the crushing final hour of the film.Lars presents their love as an honest and pure one. It's cleverly against the backdrop of a god-fearing, miserable Scottish village that aren't very Christian at all. It shows how damaging religion can be to someone as childlike and naive as Bess, who regularly plays out conversations with God and imagines Him as a cruel and impatient old man with no sympathy for anyone. Lars takes his time in telling the story. The first part of the film looks at how in love Bess is with Jan. She's absolutely infatuated with him and is outrageously devastated when he has to go back to the oilrigs for some time. Emily Watson makes Bess' pain feel all the more overwhelming with her realistic portrayal of hysteria.Like most of Lars' films, Breaking the Waves is broken up into a series of chapters. Each one becomes more disturbing as the film goes on. Many have accused Lars of being sadistic and nihilistic in his treatment of Bess, however I disagree. If Lars wanted to be sadistic then he would have been much more explicit in the latter scenes of the film and wouldn't have given as much time to allow Bess to develop as a character. As I said before, the film is very patient in telling the story and whilst I wasn't bothered or bored by this at all others may be. It's important to be patient with the film and allow yourself to immerse yourself in it. The earlier scenes which depict Bess anticipating Jan's arrival are slow but extremely important. It just shows how much Bess is in love with Jan, and how childlike and charming this love is.When Jan is paralysed we feel Bess' pain. She sticks by him and just wants to be with him. It's all the more tragic that this is her undoing. Bess' descent into sexual degradation and humiliation becomes increasingly more painful to watch. It's all the more excruciating as the film is shot on Lars' signature raw hand-held camera which gives the film an incredible sense of documentary realism. There's nothing you can do but weep for poor Bess and her immature ways of thinking. I didn't cry, but I almost did. Tears filled in my eyes in some parts and a very potent lump formed in my throat. It's an incredibly powerful look of a woman's life spiralling into madness.Breaking the Waves is a powerful and heart-breaking piece of cinema. Emily Watson is incredible as Bess and really does immerse herself in her character. I don't know who else Emily was up against in the Oscars, but I'm pretty sure she should've won. The surrealistic ending is bound to infuriate many, but for me it just confirmed the film as a masterpiece. It was the perfect way to end and made the film all the more powerful. It's not an easy watch and it's extremely depressing, but it's also one of the most heart-breaking experiences I've had watching a film. Lars Von Trier has created a timeless masterpiece. One which has the power to move, compel and inspire.

The film tells the story of the life of Redmond Barry, a poor Irish rogue that, through a mixture of deceit and chance, manipulates his way into the highest reaches of the British Aristocracy in the late 18th Century. The time-frame is between The Seven Years War and the French and American Revolutions. The three-hour long picture is broken down into two parts, making the movie appropriate for multiple-night viewing.The screenplay by Kubrick, based on the novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray, uses an unreliable narrator to tell the story objectively. This is an intentional, creative choice by Kubrick; the novel itself was told in the first person. Kubrick does this so that the narrator (Michael Hordern) can exist outside of space and time. The narrator knows the entire story before telling it, and gives the audience hints on what is to come. Much of the satire in the picture comes from the narrator's musings. Furthermore, one could argue that the narrator is the most human and relatable character is all of Barry Lyndon.There is no denying that Barry Lyndon is one of the most beautifully photographed motion pictures ever created. Each scene is basically a painting in its own right. Kubrick wants us to take in the scenic beauty of each shot. When viewing Barry Lyndon one feels as if they are traveling through the Romanticism section of an art museum.More impressive than the outdoor shots were the indoor shots. Kubrick had to create a specific camera that would allow filming to be done without any artificial light- creating the ability to shoot entire sequences in candlelight. Any photographer will tell you that lighting is everything in staging a shot- and the fact that Kubrick was able to shoot entire sequences in nothing but candlelit is nothing short of a major technological milestone. Specific lenses were purchased from NASA to shoot the candlelit scenes- the same types of lenses that were used in the filming of the Apollo 11 space landing. He is truly representing what living in the time period would look like.In the end, I think Kubrick is trying to show us the futility of greed- it is this that Barry Lyndon creates a universal message. The vanity of the 18th century is still alive in well, and the story could be that of a stockbroker, imperialist, actor, womanizer, prostitute, terrorist, or President. In the end, everyone is equal. This is a human tale. One can learn a great deal by listening to the tale of Redmond Barry, who once was Barry Lyndon.

I'm sure I went back to see it a second time while it was still showing there.I know I must have seen it several times more since then, because I can remember almost every important line from the movie. But re-watching it now, it still amazes me with its freshness, intensity, and artistry. The camera work and shots are surprising, and really caught my attention this time the extreme closeups, the contrasts between light and shadow, as well as between the extreme focus and blurry parts of the shots.'The Insider' was a commercial failure. A flop. It lost at least $30 million for Touchstone Pictures and Disney (the film's distributor and the bigger studio behind Buena Vista Pictures). The film also didn't win any Oscars (it was nominated for 7) but was beat out in every category that year by 'American Beauty' -- by comparison, an inferior, over-hyped picture. And so 'The Insider' -- a movie with a serious grown-up story about a real-life issue with the most serious implications; a story touching on health, business and the news media; a complex film for thinking adults &#x96; couldn't attract audiences to the theater, without any shootouts, car chases, or explosions.It also happens to be Michael Mann's best film, for all the reasons just mentioned. Everyone involved rises to the occasion and is great in this Bruce McGill, Diane Venora, Michael Gambon, Mister Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Colm Feore. And the major players have some of the best roles of their careers, playing real-life figures. Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace smug, vain, and yet crotchety. Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand an anal, worried, stand-offish but tormented witness, trapped somewhere between his conscience and his comfort; his anger and resentment and the stable family life he once had. And Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman the driven, self-righteous crusader for the freedom of the press, who has built a career seeing himself as the insatiable hound hunting after the truth -- And damn the consequences! (Best Pacino-as-reporter line Everything interests me.)Watching it now, supposedly from the moral-high-horse perspective of a smug ex-smoker, is also new for me. I started smoking -- like most young idiots -- to look cool. Which was something I learned at least partially from images of smoking I saw in the movies. The media image of smoking on screen seemed to communicate something adult, sophisticated, mysterious, cool &#x96; all the things that I wanted to be.... I was a heavy smoker over a period of about 18 years (on and off, quitting for at least 2 of those years). I smoked hundreds of packs, thousands of cigarettes in that time Marlboro Reds, Gitanes Blondes, Gauloises Bleus, Marlboro 'Lights.' I only quit (this time, hopefully the last time) about a year ago. I am almost 43 years old. Statistically, this means I will probably die of some later medical problem related to those years I spent smoking. Fully 1\/2 of smokers now living and smoking will die from smoking-related illnesses. Fifty per cent. Take a coin out of your pocket and flip it.

The media image of smoking on screen seemed to communicate something adult, sophisticated, mysterious, cool &#x96; all the things that I wanted to be.... I was a heavy smoker over a period of about 18 years (on and off, quitting for at least 2 of those years). I smoked hundreds of packs, thousands of cigarettes in that time Marlboro Reds, Gitanes Blondes, Gauloises Bleus, Marlboro 'Lights.' I only quit (this time, hopefully the last time) about a year ago. I am almost 43 years old. Statistically, this means I will probably die of some later medical problem related to those years I spent smoking.

In the sixties, however, the prevailing paranoia was about 'the bomb'. This earlier culture of fear was certainly heightened by the 1961 showdown known as the Cuban missile crisis. (Those of us who were alive then vividly remember how everyone was certain 'we are all about to die'.) In this brilliant film, Kubrick relentlessly and savagely exposes the madness of the system, the leaders, and the philosophy behind the doctrine appropriately known as MAD (abbreviation of 'Mutually Assured Destruction'), whereby if anyone is destroyed, all must be destroyed, the hope being that no one would be crazy enough to start it. But in this film, the world had not reckoned on General Jack Ripper, played by Sterling Hayden, drinker of grain alcohol and rain-water cocktails, obsessed by his 'precious bodily fluids' (how all we young people laughed at that when this film came out!) who did 'not avoid women' but 'I deny them my essence' (i.e. that particular bodily fluid most sought after by prospective mothers). Hayden who commits suicide during the action, has decided to wage nuclear war unilaterally on the Soviet Union with his wing of 34 B-52 bombers at Bortosdale (i.e. really Barksdale AFB in Louisiana, where the B-52s were really based) Air Force Base. (I once spent two fascinating weeks there watching those elegant birds take off their wings dip when resting, then rise to horizontal on the runway, and curl upwards as they soar like birds. They rest overnight with their bomb-bay doors open for purposes of ventilation, but when I once thought I might try a naughty peek, I was warned that if I stuck my head up there it would be chopped off, as they are set to sever any intruder.) The film opens with an aerial scene of a B-52 being refuelled in mid-air by a K.C.135 tanker plane. (I was once inside one of those; you lie flat on your stomach on a kind of bed, looking out through a window, to feed the tube into the bomber below and behind you.) Kubrick, who was sex-mad, lovingly dwelled on the copulatory symbolism of this aerial mating dance. Inside the plane piloted by actor Slim Pickens which is sent to bomb Russia, Pickens is sitting in the cockpit reading PLAYBOY and looking at the centre-fold. Stanley was so obsessed by pornography that he had to have batches of fresh hard-core porn photos daily, so this scene came to his mind naturally enough. I knew Stanley fairly well for a couple of years, and whereas he was certainly a genius, he was a deeply psychologically disturbed one. I was especially nervous of his passion for collecting Nazi insignia and daggers, strange, considering that he was a Jew. However, I only met him after he had already made this film. Wally Veevers did such a good job on the special effects for STRANGELOVE that he was put in charge of those for 2001, where he excelled himself even further. (Wally and his team were a wonderful group of guys.) Of course, this film is also famous for featuring no less than three brilliant performances by Peter Sellers. He plays Group-Captain Mandrake of the RAF, the President of the United States, and Dr. Strangelove, who is one of the fanatical Nazi scientists imported to the USA under Project Paperclip and other such projects at the end of the War. (Considering that some of those very scientists worked for Stanley on 2001, his earlier ridicule of them was rather ironical.) If there is anyone by now who does not know about Operation Paperclip, I would be surprised, and I would merely point out to them that Werner von Braun was an Obersturmbahnfuehrer (Major) in the SS who tormented Jewish slave labourers at Peenemunde, and so go work that out along with its implications! Stanley was clever to choose some of his favourite B-film stars for this film, such as noir actor Sterling Hayden, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Keenan Wynn, all of whom are positively brilliant. The script, dialogue, and scenes are so hysterically funny and hilarious that if this were not also a serious film about the destruction of the world by nuclear warfare, it would rank as one of the greatest screen comedies of all time, which perhaps it does anyway. (After all, if 'we are all gonna die', then you sure gotta die laughing.) The film is based upon the novel 'Red Alert' (aka 'Two Hours to Doom') by Peter George (writing as Peter Bryant), who collaborated on the screenplay with Kubrick and Terry Southern. Peter George (1926-1966, dying aged 42) also contributed to Sidney Lumet's film FAIL-SAFE (1964) about a similar theme. I know nothing about Peter George or why he died so young, but maybe the 'Russkies' got him, or even SAC (the Strategic Air Command under General Le May) was taking revenge. Just joking. Or possibly the American Nazis brought over by Allen Dulles did not like being made fun of. (Hitler may have loved his dog, but who ever heard him laugh?) This film is certainly unlike any other, as was its director. I have seen this classic several times, but each time it becomes both funnier and more horrifying simultaneously. Perhaps it is even more relevant now than it was then, not because 'the bomb' is still our major preoccupation, but because of the mentalities portrayed, which are even more dangerous now than they were back then, when the worst that could happen to us was that 'we will all die', whereas now, it is what happens before then that is even more terrifying.
