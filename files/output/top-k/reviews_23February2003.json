So often, that word gets overused in trite describing other unworthy films over the years, but here it is true.  A film that won a record ten Academy Awards including Best Picture and set the standard for a new generation of film making, West Side Story examines the topics of passion, hatred, dignity, family warfare, and love all on a grand scale.Recently, I was fortunate enough to see the film in a Cinemascope Widescreen format, and what a treat it was.  For as long as I can remember, West Side Story has been one of my all time favorite films.  Still, when I describe my fondness and affection for it, I can not give one solid reason as to why I love it so.  Perhaps it is because of the beautiful score by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, a score that in my mind is unsurpassed in the annals of American Musical Theater to this very day.  Or perhaps it is because of the breathtaking choreography and direction by the show's original creator, Jerome Robbins; a true master of his craft who kept sections of his cast quarantined from one another to induce the tensions of intolerance, hatred and discontent among the many characters of this, his magnum opus.  Or perhaps it is because of the brilliant set and costume designs of Boris Leven which actually transport us back to the slumsof the Upper West Side of New York City, circa 1957.  But, all in all, it is the acting in this film that has stayed at the forefront of my brain throughout the years.Natalie Wood gives in my opinion the performance of her career as Maria, a young Puerto Rican girl whose first taste of love is tempered by the already strong hatred that is brewing between her brother Bernardo's (played exquisitely by George Chakiris in a role that gave him an Academy Award) teenage street gang the Sharks and their American counterparts the Jets. The Jets are led by Riff (played innoculously here by Russ Tamblyn) and are the domineering force on the streets of their neighborhood, their turf. Maria's quiet, low-key existence is shaken when she meets Tony (played by Richard Beymer in a role that was almost tailor-made for his acting abilities and yet that isn't saying much), an American boy who is also one of the founders of the rival gang, the Jets at the Dance at the Gym.  In short, they meet there, they have their first kiss and calamity ensues. The remainder of the film takes us back and forth between the opposing gangs and their ways of life.  We see the Sharks dancing gaily upon a rooftop, led by Anita (played to sheer and utter perfection by Rita Moreno in a role that gave her an Academy Award) extolling the praises of life in America and minutes later we see the Jets assembled outside the neighborhood druggists performing a slapstick almost vaudvillian routine in sarcastic response to the lawfulness of their favorite Policeman, Officer Krupke.  Set within all of this is a gorgeously vivid love story that is set against fire escapes and bridal shop dress dummies.  Both stories of Love and War combine to mesh together in one of the most heart-rending and powerful finales that I've ever seen in a musical.Even though West Side Story is close to forty years old by this time, its message of true love against all odds continues to touch first time filmgoers and seasoned veterans alike almost as if they are seeing it for the first time.  To quote from the score of the musical that quite possibly has touched me the deepest in my entire lifeWhen love comes so strong, there is no right or wrong, Your love is your lifeMy rating 4 stars...without a doubt        ","genre":null},{"date":"23 February 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers ahead!If Rebel Without A Cause was the first film to examine juvenile delinquency and its effect on teenagers in the 1950's, then West Side Story just magnifies that even more and cements it into the Hollywood pantheon.West Side Story is a true masterpiece of film making.

So often, that word gets overused in trite describing other unworthy films over the years, but here it is true.  A film that won a record ten Academy Awards including Best Picture and set the standard for a new generation of film making, West Side Story examines the topics of passion, hatred, dignity, family warfare, and love all on a grand scale.Recently, I was fortunate enough to see the film in a Cinemascope Widescreen format, and what a treat it was.  For as long as I can remember, West Side Story has been one of my all time favorite films.  Still, when I describe my fondness and affection for it, I can not give one solid reason as to why I love it so.  Perhaps it is because of the beautiful score by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, a score that in my mind is unsurpassed in the annals of American Musical Theater to this very day.  Or perhaps it is because of the breathtaking choreography and direction by the show's original creator, Jerome Robbins; a true master of his craft who kept sections of his cast quarantined from one another to induce the tensions of intolerance, hatred and discontent among the many characters of this, his magnum opus.  Or perhaps it is because of the brilliant set and costume designs of Boris Leven which actually transport us back to the slumsof the Upper West Side of New York City, circa 1957.  But, all in all, it is the acting in this film that has stayed at the forefront of my brain throughout the years.Natalie Wood gives in my opinion the performance of her career as Maria, a young Puerto Rican girl whose first taste of love is tempered by the already strong hatred that is brewing between her brother Bernardo's (played exquisitely by George Chakiris in a role that gave him an Academy Award) teenage street gang the Sharks and their American counterparts the Jets. The Jets are led by Riff (played innoculously here by Russ Tamblyn) and are the domineering force on the streets of their neighborhood, their turf. Maria's quiet, low-key existence is shaken when she meets Tony (played by Richard Beymer in a role that was almost tailor-made for his acting abilities and yet that isn't saying much), an American boy who is also one of the founders of the rival gang, the Jets at the Dance at the Gym.

One of his friends drinks too much, another plays the horses too much, one becomes an undertaker ('never out of work!')

Because he was helped out by a mobster named Louie (John Tormey) as a youngster, and because the condition of the samurai is in seriously devoting one's body and soul to his master he becomes Louie's retainer.

With sketch comedy, you do your five minute sketch, if it works great... if not, you only wasted five minutes. In moviemaking, you have to have an idea of what works well and what doesn't work well.

You are used to seeing The State as a sketch comedy group that never has to carry a bit for more than a few moments until it's onto the next one. Unfortunately, that's not how you make a good movie. What sinks WHAS is it's near total lack of cohesiveness. The editing is bad and the direction is worse. Scenes and ideas seemingly start and stop out of nowhere.

Wayne and Garth see the band Crucial Taunt play and that's when Wayne saw the girl of his fantasies Cassandra Wong. She was a total babe! At first she seemed stuck up when Wayne talked to her. The next day, Wayne and Garth meet big-wig Benjamin Oliver who saw their show last night and wanted to give them a contract into the big times! He gives them a contract along with two checks for $5,000. Wayne and Garth were hyped!

Wayne and Cassandra soon get to know one another and become very close. Soon the rehearsal for the first international episode of Wayne's World arrives. It takes off without a hitch!

Well, things were about to take a downward spiral for Wayne and Garth, for the next day, Benjamin informed them that their sponsor, Noah Vanderhoff, would guest star on the show. Wayne declared he would not bow to any sponsor, then he proceeded to gleefully eat Pizza Hut pizza and sip a Pepsi while Garth sported new Reebok gear. Finally, the taping of the show began. Wayne was given cue cards on which he wrote insulting things about Noah. The interview took off without a hitch, but Benjamin was enraged about what Wayne did so he fired him. Wayne walked out, leaving a timid Garth to finish the show on his own.         Wayne and Garth called off their frienship and what's more, Cassandra broke up with Wayne. Wayne headed to Mikita's Donuts to make amends with Garth, then they tried to help Cassandra's music career. Then they remember seeing the limousine of Frank Sharp of Sharp Records in Milwaukee. Garth would televise Cassandra's video into the limo TV, which hopefully Sharp would be watching that evening, and they'd be in the clear, so Wayne drove up to Chicago where Cassandra was filming a rock video. Wayne put on an Oscar performance to try and get her back. It worked! So that night, live in Wayne's World's old stomping grounds Wayne's parents' basement, Cassandra performed a rockin' rock video. Sharp saw it and headed to Wayne's house, but not before Benjamin. Sharp told Cassandra she wasn't good enough, she broke up with Wayne and went to live in Hawaii with Benjamin! As if! Wayne and Garth then did the Scooby-Doo ending by revealing that Benjamin was really Old Man Withers who runs the haunted amusement park. But then they do the super-happy ending in which Sharp offers Cassandra six-album deal, so things were finally alright for our gnarly buds!         An amusing movie. It has it's pretty funny moments.
