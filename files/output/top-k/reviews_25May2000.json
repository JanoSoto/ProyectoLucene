I certainly don't need my little sister thinking that's a useful way to relate to people.Just about every invocation of the powerful, resonant images from the original series is compromised.

It is also full of huge holes, like the fact that Luther claimed to hack into NATO GHOSTCOM in the first film. In this one, he can't even disable a simple alarm in a commercial corporation's security system. Maybe his skills got rusty because he partied too much between films. Since the good guys locate the bad guys in the first half hour, it becomes glaringly obvious that they could be wiped out by SAS, SEALs, Delta Force, etc. about halfway through the film. The crowd at my theater repeatedly burst into laughter at dialogue which was entirely inappropriate for the situation depicted onscreen. None of the characters were very memorable or engaging, except Ving Rhames' part. Dougray Scott was more an annoying wuss than anything else. Maybe he'll be better as Logan in X-Men. Thandie Newton looked cute, but that's about all she contributed. Woo's direction of this film is really tedious.

There is an utter lack of tension except for the closing minutes, and even during that part some goofy cuts are made. Most annoying are the repeated slow pans and zooms that are supposed to show us the characters are so cool and dangerous it hurts. This is tough to buy when they're ambling along the street or a dock. Woo's dove fetish also got a lot of laughs during the closing minutes of the film. Tom Cruise also landed many chuckles with his martial arts talents. Yes he looked fairly credible, but an agent in such situations would be more concerned with killing efficiently rather than gracefully. Also note that the chase scenes in the movies are real snoozers, nowhere in the league of say, Bullitt. I still can't get over the tedium of the final chase scene. In real life, the Triumph bikes used in the film would walk away from the SUVs and sedans in pursuit. My final beef is with the score. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard also scored Gladiator, and he was prevented from attending the premiere of that film because he had to work on this film's score. I can tell you right now, one of them was absolutely smashing and functioned brilliantly and it certainly wasn't this one. Zimmer is all over the place here seems to reference all the boring parts of his past works. Lisa Gerrard's stylings added a nice sense of humanity and gravitas to Gladiator but here they combine with the overly melodramatic visuals to descend into the realm of pure cheese. Unless you're really eager to waste $8 and 123 minutes of your life, I'd advise waiting to see this hits your local Blockbuster...

The effects became so absurd, that I had to listen to everyone around me laughing the whole movie.  And I hate, I mean hate, to hear people talk or laugh during a serious part of the movie.I also did not appreciate the actress, Thandie Newton, who played Cruise's lover.  She made the same face during the whole movie...truly an untalented actress.  The face that she made was a cross between pouty and sexy, with her eyes always fixed.  It really got old after a while--almost a little comical after seeing the same expression for so long. But for some reason, the stone cold Ethan Hunt from the 1st movie was chasing her like a Mad-man during the duration of the MI2.  Essentially, she drives most of the plot.  I couldn't buy into their intense spontaneous love and neither did most people in the theater.On a positive note, however, the action in the flick was visually stunning.  I truly have no idea how Woo shot most of the scenes.  Woo over did himself.In essence, the movie seriously lacked a plausible plot. The heroine couldn't act--she could only make a single (perhaps even goofy) facial expression.  And the action scenes were so spectacular, that they were unbelievable. The movie is clearly not a spy movie, but a demonstration of the latest special effects and jaw dropping action scenes.

But none the less I paid the $7 and checked it out.First of all this movie is NOT like MI1, sure we've got Tom Cruise running around with a bunch of cool gadgets but the similarities end there. What we don't have is the intriguing and complicated plot of the first movie, in fact I thought the plot was fairly bland and uninteresting. We also don't have the shocking plot twists, yes there are attempts at plot twists but they're all way too predictable to be even the least bit shocking.

You can really see John Woo come out in the action, particularly the last scene. There are tons of big, cool explosions, gunfights, stand offs, and slow motion effects. By far his flashiest, but not his best movie. A downside to MI2 was that it had to be rated PG-13, most all of Woo's other films have R ratings which adds a level of brutality to them, and in that, realism. I found it took away from the movie to have such obviously far fetched scenes in it.

It is shot in gritty 'ultrareal' locations - crime-ridden, rat-infested, poverty-stricken docks & their surrounding hovels - yet every scene conveys an unreal, dreamlike quality that completely belies it's setting much like a dream on screen. The characters are weird & wonderful, a lot of them looking as if they come from a circus freak show (which many do). It could be described as surreal, but in it's context I don't think it is it obeys the internal 'logic' of a dream come nightmare where anything & everything is possible.This film is hard to classify but I think it belongs in the 'cyber-punk' sci-fi genre - characterised by a world of advanced technology but also one of decay, hardship & anarchy. However, unlike most films of that ilk ('Blade Runner' is the best example), this film rather than being set in the future seems to have gone back in time to the Victorian era. The lifestyles, clothing & poverty of the inhabitants of the docks is very Dickensian, & the advanced technology looks more like weird & wonderful contraptions that could have come straight out of a Jules Verne book. So perhaps this is the so far sole example of the 'French Victorian Cyber-Punk Sci-Fi' genre!There is a host of weird, wonderful & freakish characters here on a rig in the harbour behind a mine-field live the failed human experiments of a now absent mad inventor's efforts to create his own family outside of the more traditional methods. Head of the house is a monster of a man named Krank who has aged prematurely due to his inability to dream; there are ½ a dozen midget clones who suffer from somnambulism (here translated as 'sleeping sickness'); the woman who was meant to be the wife is even smaller; & 'Uncle Irvine' is a migraine-ridden disembodied brain that is still able to see, hear & speak.On the shore there are religious cultists named Cyclopes, who upon joining are fitted with an artificially enhanced eye & ears; evil conjoined twins (who I'm sure were influenced by Cora & Clarice from Mervyn Peake's 'Gormenghast' books); a drunken flea-trainer; a simple-minded strongman named One; his very young omnivorous adopted brother Denree; & a gang of child thieves led by a young girl named Miette - among others.The Cyclopes capture children under 5 who are then taken to Krank's rig where they are hooked up to machines along with Krank so he can attempt to experience their dreams. Not surprisingly - except to Krank & his 'family' - the dreams are always nightmares, Krank's quest remains unfulfilled & his premature ageing continues.When One's little brother Denree is taken by the Cyclopes he, along with Miette, sets out to find & rescue him.If this sounds weird & confusing that's probably because it is! The plot is somewhat convoluted & hard to follow, & the freakishness of a lot of the characters I'm sure many people will find off-putting. On the other hand this is definitely one of those movies which benefits from repeated viewings it has such richness, depths & attention to detail that you will almost certainly notice something different or view it in a different light every time you watch it.The sumptuous cinematography is one of the outstanding features of this gem of a film - visually this is stunning every scene looks like a painting; dark & moody but at the same time vividly colourful.However, what I most love about this film is it's wonderfully imaginative inventiveness. There is so much to admire & enjoy here, & I don't want to spoil things by recounting too many, but there are delightful ideas & tricks here that I doubt I will see anywhere else. Here are a few examplesA 'bird's-eye' viewpoint is a common thing in film; here Jeunet & Caro give us a 'flea's-eye' view at several points in the film the action is viewed as if from a flea as it leaps from post to post, hitches a ride on a passing dog then settles in someone's hair. Wonderfully inventive, & also great SFX.There are some great tricks with perspective to do with the fact that the Cyclopes can swap their eyes with each other, enabling them to see themselves from another's viewpoint.My favourite character(s), the 'Octopus twins' as they are known, are wonderful - 1 being with 2 heads, 3 legs & 4 arms all over the place - & have to be seen to be appreciated - especially the rather unique way they have of smoking a cigarette!In what has become one of my all-time favourite movie sequences, a protracted chain of events is set off by a teardrop flying from a child's eye & culminates with a huge icebreaker ship smashing the dock - wonderful stuff.One final note on the dilemna you always have with foreign-language films of dubbed vs. subtitles. Having seen both I still don't know which I prefer. You lose a lot of the character's personalities when their voices are done by someone other than the actor - for instance the child who did the English voiceover for Miette was awful, whereas the French actress (Judith Vittet) I thought was superb - & should have a great future. It's also disconcerting when the actors' mouths & their words are out of synch. On the other hand having to read subtitles means you aren't able to see as much of the film itself, which in a film of this visual style & detail is a big disadvantage. Maybe I should just learn French & watch the original language version - this film is so good it's almost worth doing just for that reason!There is so much to this movie I found it hard to describe, & even as I was writing it all sounded a bit like a load of French arty-farty weirdness. It IS weird, but also wonderful, & if you can get past that or (like me) even enjoy it & the complicated plot you will find a film that is unique, rich, rewarding, refreshing & hugely entertaining. I personally rate this is one of my all-time favourites - highly recommended.

Question how do the military aircraft and weapons the man-animals (ugh-ugh) acquire still work after a THOUSAND years? There's still gas in the tanks? And how did the uneducated man animals know how to fly in formation? Question what was the point of the girl? Question why does the whole Psychlo planet explode? Wasn't the bomb only going to react with their atmosphere? Question for such a melodramatically evil race, how is it the Psychlos laugh so much? Question did the nauseating angles and barn-door cuts make everyone feel seasick, or just me? Question for a superior race who kept the humans subdued for so long, how is it the Psychlos seem to be completely clueless about EVERYTHING? Oh, the gold is in pure BAR form? Oh okay. Along those lines, how is it the Psychlos conquered Earth in 9 minutes but are powerless against a handful of uneducated men using the SAME weapons that failed miserably a thousand years ago? How was the door at Fort Knox convieniently left ajar? And do they really just keep a room full of gold right next to the entrance? Why did John Travolta laugh so much? Why was his voice demonic when speaking Psychlo, but high-pitched and completely non-threatening when translated to English? Why did Johnny have to be taught how to fly the Psychlo ship? Couldn't Travolta fly one and Whitaker fly the other? Did the creature designer intentionally mean to rip off the Klingons? Even their language was similar! Why were the Psychlo numbers so similar to humans? If the air was poisonous to humans and they had to wear those noseplug thingies to breathe, how come they were breathing heavily through their mouths? What was the point of Johnny's dad dying in the beginning? Where did Johnny learn to read? (if he learned from the machine, why didn't the Psychlos understand English too?) Where did the soldiers who were transporting from planet Psychlo at the end disappear to? They weren't on earth! They weren't on Psychlo!

We can only hope that Tom Cruise and his co-producer Paula Wagner decide against adding onto this completely joyless series.  John Woo takes over for Brian DePalma as director of this big-budgeted turkey which I implore you not to but a ticket for.After an opening sequence that gives hope to the audience, even as it leaves us feeling unusually empty, the film almost completely runs out of steam before the halfway point.  This time around, taking the NOC-list's place is some stupid virus named the Chimera that could wreak all sorts of havoc on the world.  Topping off Cruise and Company's obstacles are the villains a corrupt ex-spy (Dougray Scott) named Ambrose and his gallery of inept goons as well as the bigwig pharmaceutical company president (a wasted Brendan Gleeson).  Not even Anthony Hopkins, in a totally wasted unbilled cameo, can entice us to not be annoyed. Maybe Hopkins had an idea how bad the film was going to be and took his name off it.Then come the unintentional laughs.

It's strange to think that a John Woo-directed film would have a love story as the only real attention-grabber, but Newton is completely ravishing and her chemistry with Cruise (doing his usual smirking and staring) is moderately successful.

The mastermind behind The Killer, Hard Boiled, Bullet in the Head, and even Face\/Off has created a very exciting, visceral, tense action flick in MI2. But that's it.The action sequences are very cool and fun to watch, but they are all just typical Woo-isms we've seen before the excessive slow-mo, the dive and shoot executed by Tom Cruise (and by Chow Yun-Fat millions of times before), the stunts and jumps that can only be explained by non-Newtonian physics, and of course the doves. When there is action, it is very fun.Everything else, i.e. the plot, was forgettable. Before I went to see MI2, I knew nothing about the story. After I saw it, I understand why The plot was not worth talking about. Robert Towne wrote the screenplay (from the story by Brannon Braga and Ronald D Moore). He also wrote Chinatown which is a masterpiece in itself. How did Woo and Towne collaborate on such a piece of crunk?!?Trying not to spoil anything. The main storyline is Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has to figure why a former spy has defected. The side plot (or maybe this was supposed to be the main plot, I'm not really sure) is the blossoming relationship between Cruise and a professional thief played by Thandie Newton. One of the things that really spoiled this movie for me was the inappropriateness of this love story. I have no problem with the existence of a love interest in an action movie, but it didn't work here. They focused on it too much, but then trivialize it at the same time. It had no meaning, it was just trying to put two attractive people together half-naked in bed. If they want to make the love story the main part of the movie, I needed more. I needed to know why they like each other beyond pure attraction. I want more cerebral dialogue between them. I want to know more. In Chinatown, I wanted to know more about Dunaway and Nicholson, and then the movie gave me what I needed. MI2 fails miserably. The rest of the plot is slightly familiar if you've seen Twelve Monkeys (sans time travel).And of course there's the acting. How can you go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, Ving Rhames, and Tom Cruise of a very impressive outing in Magnolia and a pretty good outing in Eyes Wide Shut. Hopkins is in it for an very unimpressive 2 or so minutes. Ving Rhames had some funny lines, but was also a non-factor. Cruise had his moments, but the rest was filled over-acting or non-acting. To Cruise's credit, he did do most of his own stunts a la Jackie Chan.A major disappointment I had was the target audience, or rather how they made the movie to target their audience. I hate this fact about 90% of studio movies anyway, but it was so blatant. The PG-13 rating so that kids can go see it without sneaking in. A Woo movie is supposed to be an R. Without the R, much of the violence loses it meaning. Watch Hard Boiled and The Killer, the violence in those two movies mean something, a certain poetry that many critics have accredited to Woo. Second, the inclusion of the love story seems to attempt to appeal to a larger female audience. And of course the fast cars, fast motorcycles, and fast draws of guns always draw the masses of men (18-49). Lastly, the fact that it is a summer movie. I'm sure if there was less pressure to open MI2 on Memorial Day (wednesday), there would be more time to make a better movie. Imagine if this was given three or four more months and opened in September. I have to wipe the tears from my eyes.All in all, MI2 is not worthy of its predecessor nor its legacy. Mission Impossible is a better movie even if the story is convuluted (it was still intriguing). Most of John Woo's previous movies are by far superior (although Hard Target is a glaring exception).

I am sure that any child in a concentration camp (who would have survived, which was virtually impossible) would have been all too aware of what was really happening. I see the hero's attempt at shielding his child as lying, plain and simple.The thinly-veiled insult contained in this movie is if only all those poor victims of the Holocaust had only had a sense of humor! Then of course many wouldn't have died, and there would have been so much less suffering. I really hope that anyone reading these lines gets my sarcasm here.But the worst thing about this atrocious movie is the way it has rewritten history. The only other people who are doing that on the subject of World War II are neo-Nazis, I'm afraid.

Gotham City looks quite good through Tim Burton's lens.Now, the criticisms  We are given no reason to care aboutthe characters.  When Alfred reminds Bruce that Vicki Valeis special,  I want to yell out WHY?!?!?!  The character isa cardboard cutout she has no particular attributes, nospecific personality.  She just *is*.  Of course, maybe sheseems special in comparison to Bruce Wayne, played  more like a large rock than an internally hurt man.  Keatonis a better actor than this, so I can only blame the script orBurton - probably both.  Tim Burton tends to be a bettervisual director than person director, especially when thecharacter isn't already self directing in the script.  Anddon't get me started on Knox, the reporter.  He's a lovablegoof character - which is fine in its place.  But supposedlyhe's some gifted reporter (gifted enough that a respected,serious photojournalist wants to work with him on the  Batman story), and I'm sure that Knox couldn't write acohesive sentence.Of course, underneath it all, this is just a comic book cummovie.  Perhaps it doesn't bear a serious film criticism. Fair enough.  But even then, this film doesn't hold up.  Themovie looks like and acts like a comic book, from cameracuts that reflect panel drawings to the tenor of the dialog. Fine.  Burton succeeds in this endeavor in a technicalsense. But there is a fundamental problem with this is thatmovies need more fleshing out than a comic book allows. Panel to panel, the reader connects the dots in his ownway.  A movie doesn't permit this so easily, so when thenarrative is left as sparse as the comic, the film feelsincomplete.  An already used but ideal example is the  relationship between Bruce and Vicki.  In a graphic novel, itis best left to the imagination that the characters developtogether and find out what it is that is so... special abouteach other.  In a movie, we turn ourselves over to theexperience too much to create that separate world as thefilm happens.  Thus, what we're left with is a strainedmoment - after Bruce and Vicki have just ONE date - whereVicki asks, Are we going to try to love each other?  Ofcourse, the line was asked so flatly, Kim might as wellhave asked, Do you want crackers with the soup?  But Ican't blame her - there's no relationship for her to react to.Blah.  Looks good, great job Jack.  Those two elementsearn it a 6\/10.
