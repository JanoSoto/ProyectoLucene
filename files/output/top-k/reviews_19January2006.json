It was well done and the story was a good one. The only problem I had with the film was the way Bonnie and Clyde were made out to be. In real life they were hard evil criminals, but in the movie they were romanticized and made out to not be that bad. Other then embellishing the characters and a few other minor details I loved the movie.For the time the gun fight effects were pretty good. They had good detail in and around the fight scenes, including the blood effects. It was a pretty bloody movie which qualifies as a good movie in my book because where there is blood there is action so it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The first homicide in the movie surprised me. I didn't think it would be like that. I thought it would be from far away and not be very detailed and gory. In fact it was right up close in the face with blood and all. It was totally unexpected. The other scene that was pretty gory was the end scene when Bonnie and Clyde were ambushed. That scene was very gory for the time. I did not expect that at all because not only did they shoot them but they kept shooting them and brutalized their bodies.The other part of the movie that I liked was the driving scenes. There were a lot of good fast chase scenes through fields and other remote parts. I find chase scenes to be exhilarating especially when there is a gun fight going on at the same time. The whole movie was basically either in a high speed chase or a shootout which made it pretty suspenseful. When one of these wasn't going on it was building up to the next one and you could feel it coming so I was on the edge of my seat just waiting for something to happen.The acting itself was pretty good. The main actors were good and knew what they were doing. On the other hand the secondary actors were not very good. They seemed scared and seemed like they didn't know what to do. Bonnie's mother for example gave me the impression that she was reading off of a script during the movie. She seemed like she really had no idea what was going on. So other then the secondary characters it was a well done movie acting wise. Overall I liked this movie a lot because or the chases, gunfights, and the acting.

The problem with Minority Report is that he's so intent on downplaying the movie's subject--preventive detention--that he's afraid to address the underlying issue that the original Philip Dick story pondered. It's a film that for most of its two-and-a-half hours seems more interested in the sci-fi thriller elements of the story than in the difficult questions it poses. While the movie transcends its genre because it deals with such an interesting topic, it shortchanges that topic by skirting around these tough questions.Tom Cruise plays a cop in the mid-21st century who's part of a unit called pre-crime. A trio of psychics can tell when someone somewhere is going to commit murder. One example A man inadvertently walks in on his wife with another man. In the heat of the moment, he picks up a pair of scissors and is about to stab her, when the cops burst in and prevent him from doing what the psychics had predicted he would do. They slip a weird machine over the man's eyes and keep him locked up, immobile, and comatose.Right there you have a problem. Even in our justice system, a man who raises a weapon to someone has committed a crime, even if he's caught before he has had a chance to carry out the act. That has nothing to do with pre-crime. Of course, the punishment this man receives seems quite harsh for attempted murder or assault. But it would seem quite harsh even if the man had carried out the act. The notion that preventing this man from killing his wife would require that he be detained indefinitely, particularly in such a grotesque fashion, is absurd. But there are examples of preventive detention that are not so easy to dismiss. By failing to address such examples, the movie weakens its own argument.As in other anti-utopian tales, the very person who carries out the corrupt form of justice becomes its next victim. The psychics envision that Cruise will soon commit a murder. Since Cruise believes in his job, shouldn't he accept their reading and allow himself to be arrested? But he finds himself in the same position as the people he has detained. They all swear to their innocence. Up to now he has trusted the psychics, knowing that the detainees would have committed the crimes if not for his intervention. But he knows he is no killer. The psychics must be wrong this time! Caring for his own self-preservation, he goes on the run.The rest of the film is an intense hunt-and-chase thriller as Cruise evades the police while trying to solve the whodunit. His adventures will take him in icky directions as he encounters spider-like robots and men without eyes. He also must meet with a strange old lady in a sequence that seems ripped off from The Matrix, which is ironic, since The Matrix was itself inspired by Philip Dick's fiction. Minority Report is longer and more complicated than necessary, but it is handled with the intricate craftsmanship that we have come to expect from Spielberg.The problem is that the movie is so focused on the complex plot that most of the time it forgets about its provocative themes. Certain plot points are muddier than they should be. Until I read the original story, I did not understand what the minority report was. (It was actually quite simple one of the three psychics may have a different reading than the other two. But the movie explains this concept poorly.) And the final explanation for why the cop was thought to be a potential killer, which involves something of a time-travel paradox, was much simpler and to-the-point in the original story, leaving readers with something to grapple with. The movie tries so hard to argue against preventive detention that its case feels forced.Dick was never much interested in the design of his futuristic stories, and that's certainly true of the story on which this movie is based. In that story, the detainees were kept in ordinary fenced areas. There was nothing about them being suspended in a bizarre, computer-induced coma. In an effort to create a visual representation of the story, the film envisions a lot of new technology, including the ability to transfer the psychics' thought to a screen, a level of technological advancement that I doubt will exist by 2054. The movie does capture some of the paranoia that was typical in Philip Dick's fiction. To escape the police, Cruise has to take some gruesome measures because of the government's sophisticated means of identifying everyone, a possibility that doesn't seem far off in our own world.But all this technology distracts from the movie's political and philosophical message. Spielberg is a master of design, and his vision of the not-too-distant future is impressive but not exceptional. Most big-budget science fiction movies today do a good job at the level of world creation. I just can't help feeling a little frustrated every time a Philip Dick story gets turned into an action movie. Ironically, a film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which is not based on any of Dick's stories, does a better job of bringing out his ideas than any of the actual adaptations of his works have done. Because it focuses on the consequences of technology rather than the conception, it comes closer to the spirit of this great philosopher of science fiction.

The clout behind the film is that they were stars because of the style and the publicity that they received. Bonnie Parker was most likely a large reason for the success that this film has.

I must give a lot of credits to the music\/sound as well because it did not only influence my own film-making, but It really completed this movie.The acting and directing was superb, I really don't have much to say about it. Lynch was Lynch, only the surrealistic plot seemed less hard to believe than some other films he had made. there's nothing wrong with any of his films, I just thought it would be worth mentioning.I suggest that, when you want to watch this movie, that you pay close attention to ALL details given in this film. from the very first second it begins! I cannot stress that enough. I do not want to give any spoilers because if you only know 1 it would be a hell of a lot less fun to watch. however, if you have seen this movie and still do not get it, just watch it again until you're really sure you can't figure it out by yourself.I can only give away that the outcome of this movie is worth thinking about. Oh, and I'd like to recommend having a high IQ for this film, or watch it with someone with a high IQ. Cause it will help. It won't be crucial, but it will help.Now, I started writing this with a rating of 9 out of 10 stars (9\/10) but when I tried to explain why I didn't gave it 10 stars, I couldn't find any possible explanation.

I was swaggering down Causeway Head, Penzance's premier street as its the only one that contains a cinema AND a chip shop - in my hand a thick wedge of pornographic magazines. My Destination? 'The Matrix', an incomplete garage where myself and two friends stored a hoard bought using homeless men given extra for cigarettes. As I walked past the Savoy I saw a coming soon poster for the Back to the Future sequel. I had no idea it was even being made. It was a fantastic moment. The original was one of my all time favourite things and the only one I could enjoy with my Mother in the room. When I finally saw it 3 or 4 months later I was entertained but held reservations which hold up to this day and that, lucky people that you are, I'll share with you now. Immediately it was apparent that there were some problems. One, Claudia Wells had become Elizabeth Shue and no-one had noticed - worrying because it was the original actresses good looks that had effectively saved Marty's bacon when his assertion that she's beautiful had caused him to whip out the clock-tower flyer with its precious future information. Two, Chrispin Glover had chosen not to participate. Why was this allowed to happen? He was a key supporting character in the first film and though they could clearly get round it with a lot of soft long distance shots and layers of makeup his absence left a hole in the ensuing two episodes. I'd love to see the original paradox script which presumably had him in it. Three, it was too complicated and so packed with plot that you never really had the opportunity to sit back and breathe it in like the first film. You know it's been retrospectively plotted when you have to insert a scene into the original epilogue to make it work. Four, continuity. Michael J Fox's appearance in the 1985 film is a matter of record as its, er, on film, so you'd think it wouldn't be a stretch for just one person to observe that the diminutive man child had different hair. For those of you that think this is pedantry, YES IT IS and wacha going'do about it? Some nights all I can think about is a digitally tinkering but thats a different subject entirely and not something we should go into here. So part II is good fun, cleverly conceived and all the rest of it but it just doesn't have the heart of the first and of course it doesn't really work as a self-contained instalment because its essentially half a film - a 108 minute setup for the better, more satisfying part III. 'Tis a comedy lets not forget so its worth mentioning some good jokes - Nixton's fifth term in the alternate future, the black and decker hydrated pizza, Doc Brown's Women! monologue and of course Ooh la la! OK, the product placement is disgraceful but you can use the 'minority report' defence (which presumably the producers saw coming) and argue that it adds a real-worldly dimension to the future. That said, Pepsi did very well out of the futures and that would be fine 'cept it tastes terrible. Its nice that you have a sequel that does something different from its predecessor and credits the audience with a bit of intelligence, plus it was blatantly robbed of the best-visual Oscar (went to the Abyss would you believe).

Faye Dunaway draws you into her character with her facial expression in the first scene of the movie. However, throughout most of the film I wondered why she stayed with Clyde. At the beginning it's obvious that she is bored and alienated, and she is looking for something more in her life. When she meets Clyde she is excited and very interested. Unfortunately, she does not get the kind of relationship she expected or would like with him. She becomes continually more frustrated and unhappy with how their relationship is progressing. I questioned why she stayed with him if she did not find what she had been looking for.This film was very different in the idea that the bad guys became the good guys. You are able to sympathize with the characters and be happy for them when they get away from the police. Even other characters in the film appreciate the Barrow gang and are excited to hear about them or get their picture taken with the gang. Clyde, Bonnie, and the gang become proud of what they've done. They are continually showing people their faces and telling them their names. They know that they're all over the newspapers and take pleasure in reading about themselves. They think that they are ordinary people just like everyone else. They do not understand the true reality of their situation; that they are running away from everyone and everything. Bonnie believes that they can settle down and be happy but her own mother knows better. Bonnie's family is excited to see the gang and ask them questions but her mother is the only one that shows concern for them.Although humor is combined with violence and crime, I believe that this film should be taken as it is and enjoyed as entertainment and a small window into 1960's American culture. Arthur Penn does a very good job of placing the film in the 1930's but embedding the attitudes and culture of the 1960's. The characters take advantage of their new freedom and enjoy being rebellious. We should appreciate the film for its different artistic style and entertainment rather than worrying about the violence. In the end it is not about the original Bonnie and Clyde but these newly created characters living like they were in the 1960's and the amazing relationships they form.

OK, we have some no name acting here, but a few we know.Maureen Teefy as some of us know played Lois Lanes Cousin, Lucy, from Supergirl. Not the best acting in the world, but she has a cute face that makes up for it.Didi Conn has reappeared as the Beauty School Dropout, Frenchy, from the original movie. She does seem to settle things, and make it feel a bit more like home,....even that voice seems settling...at times.And of course, we all know Michelle Pfeiffer. But frankly, I'm sure most of the boys out there would like to get to know her better,..I know I would. Hint,...buy ALL her movies!OK, so the scene starts off rather familiar. Everyone is coming back to school, sure it isn't the very next day, but I swear I got a Porkys II flashback. I just loved this movie, and...even a few of its songs. Reproduction was quite funny, Score Tonight was great, and very catchy, as was Cool Rider. Still, since Cool rider was Michelle Pfeiffers only solo song, it ranks up there anyway. Love her dance number to it as well.Anyway, I think for a sequel, this movie ruled. I think, however,...grease 1 should have been the sequel. I hope you agree.a cool rider, a cooooooool rider if he's cool enough, he can burn me through and through whoooa if it takes forever, then I'll wait forever. No ordinary boy, no ordinary boy is gonna do, I want a rider that's cool...............

Bridget Jones, arguably the funniest film of 2001, I think you'll agree. This is a film for anyone over the age of 15, but honestly I think seeing as I'm not fifteen myself, everyone will most probably love it. But, I'll give you one piece of advice, DO NOT, and I repeat DO NOT watch it with your parents or grandparents because it will lead to utter embarrassment.The Storyline- It's New Year's Day, hung over and still single, Bridget Jones- a 30-something year old journalist girl from London-decides to start a great new life. And in order to do so, she decides to keep a diary. Of which she rights down everything from her calories gained to her instant messaging with Daniel Cleaver (her boss). She makes new years resolutions such as to stop smoking; make better use of time; and learn to programme video. It is a film like no other, a masterpiece of great storytelling. As for the genre-it is a Romantic Comedy, which is very equally balanced, which on one hand, makes you feel very sorry for Bridget at times, but on the other will leave you laughing uncontrollably. I mean, come on, how many films have you seen with a great storyline, a love triangle, and that can make you laugh till your ribs hurt? Now I think of it, not many!Characters Mark Darcy, the love of Bridget's life, and Daniel Cleaver, quite funnily enough, also, the love of Bridget's life are sworn enemies. Mark is a very upper-class sophisticated character. Who is sometimes very up himself. Daniel is the complete opposite; he is a very laid back easy-going character. Jude, Sharon and Tom-Bridget's three best friends which give her some of the worst advice you can think of. But they do try to help, Tom-The main character-Bridget is a working class girl, slightly overweight, or so she thinks. She is infatuated with Daniel before Mark comes along.Movie Soundtrack-Well, I can't say it has the best choice in music to be honest, but its okay, if you're into the whole complaining of heart-ache scene. But I suppose it goes well with the movie so I can get over that. On the other hand, there are quite a few classics in the movie such as; all by myself and without you.

Broomfield is a scuzzy English tabloid documentarian obsessed with white-trash America. His best trait is his aggressive interview technique, and the way his films seem to descend on a spiral. As he neglects to get the truth from his interview subjects he returns to them again and again, his questions and manner growing more and more relentless. It's fun to watch but also annoying and unnerving. Like watching someone slowly drill a hole through metal. I hope I'm never subjected to his process.Culturally and geographically, this film is like looking at a graveyard. The grunge scene (Seattle in particular) seems to have died along with Cobain. What a thriving mecca it once was. The brief concert clips of Seattle bands post-Nirvana are just depressing. At one point the lead singer in some Nirvana wannabe group attacks a fan with his microphone and screams obsceneties at him and it comes off as pathetic and listless. What a boring, dried-up scene Seattle has become. And who are these losers Broomfield trots out in front of his camera. Someone named Ami who says she had the same dealer as Cobain and Love and calls Love a harpy. Maybe she is but who cares. Who in the world IS this Ami and why are we listening to her. She could be lying about knowing them. Later, there's someone else (they don't even say her name) who says she worked for Cobain and Love as a nanny for a month.

I flat out refuse to believe anyone would offer this guy 50 grand to snuff anyone because he looks like he could hardly make it to the mailbox. The only really reliable people are Love's father (who's just plain odd), Cobain's former friend and the guy who supplied him with the shotgun (he's so doped up he can't follow Broomfield's questions) and Cobain's aunt (who's the only sane person in the entire film).Amazingly, the one who ends up looking good is Love. This was during one of her together periods so she looks great in the few clips we see of her. Certainly better than anyone else in the movie.

It's spectacular, it's thrilling, it's beautiful. You won't find anything like this now-a-days, no matter how hard you try. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should be ashamed of himself.The plot is simple - Blondie (Clint Eastwood), the Good, Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), the Bad, are all after a stash of Confederate gold, holding 200,000 dollars in gold, during the American Civil War. Seems like a pretty simple plot for 1 and a half hours, let alone 3. So what drives this movie? Style. Cinematography. Atmosphere. Let me explain.The first scene in the movie is the (rather unappealing) face of a bandit. It then switches to a wide shot of the small town he and his two companions are entering. A few more shots of the bandits. They enter an inn, and gunshots are heard. Out the window comes charging Tuco, clutching a gun in one hand and meat in the other. The image freezes while he's in midair, and the writing The Ugly appears on the screen. The first half hour or so serves to introduce the three main characters in similar fashion. No plot progression whatsoever, merely introduction. Most movies would fall with a start like that, but not this one. It takes more than an hour before the rush for the gold begins, and by that hour you already know everything you can and need to know about the three anti-heroes Blondie is the Good. He is not good at all under normal standards, as he is an outlaw, a killer and he betrays his friend. But he seems good in comparison to the other slime-balls in the movie Tuco is a villain, pure and simple. He steals, murderers, rapes, and does a bunch of other nasty things. But he is still fun and amusing, while the sinister Angel Eyes stands in comparison - a menacing figure in black clothing with an evil mustache, who kills and double-crosses without blinking for a few more dollars.And the movie doesn't follow a plot. The plot is just a background for the amazing scenes that come one after another and construct the movie - you go from one scene to the other. And there are many memorable scenes in this movie The first time Blondie shoots the rope before Tuco is hanged to death. Blondie's march through the desert. Tuco and Blondie's capture by the Yankees. Tuco's torture. Tuco's gunfight in the tub and the classic line that follows. The showdown in the deserted town. The bridge being blown up. Tuco's search for the grave. And of course, the amazing climax. But I'll get to that later.We've covered the style, but I also mentioned cinematography and atmosphere. And the cinematography is amazing. Wide shots of towns and deserts zoom to close-ups of desperate and rugged men. The effect is amazing, especially during gunfights. It creates tension and suspense, and that leads me to the second point I mentioned atmosphere. This feels like the West. The people look dirty and hard-working. The buildings look rickety. And when time is spent looking at each other before the guns are drawn for a few short seconds when the men fire at each other, you feel what it's like to be there.And finally, as I mentioned before, the climax. Possibly the best climax in a movie ever. A Mexican Standoff between the three main characters in the film - Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Minutes pass as they stare at each other, each bringing their hand a bit closer to the gun. The music becomes more and more dramatic as time passes. You wait, and then... They fire, and it's over. A duel as a duel should be. It's mind-blowing.Few movies can reach the level of this masterpiece. Fewer still can surpass it. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a damn shame.

But he seems good in comparison to the other slime-balls in the movie Tuco is a villain, pure and simple. He steals, murderers, rapes, and does a bunch of other nasty things. But he is still fun and amusing, while the sinister Angel Eyes stands in comparison - a menacing figure in black clothing with an evil mustache, who kills and double-crosses without blinking for a few more dollars.And the movie doesn't follow a plot. The plot is just a background for the amazing scenes that come one after another and construct the movie - you go from one scene to the other. And there are many memorable scenes in this movie The first time Blondie shoots the rope before Tuco is hanged to death. Blondie's march through the desert. Tuco and Blondie's capture by the Yankees. Tuco's torture. Tuco's gunfight in the tub and the classic line that follows. The showdown in the deserted town. The bridge being blown up. Tuco's search for the grave. And of course, the amazing climax. But I'll get to that later.We've covered the style, but I also mentioned cinematography and atmosphere. And the cinematography is amazing. Wide shots of towns and deserts zoom to close-ups of desperate and rugged men. The effect is amazing, especially during gunfights. It creates tension and suspense, and that leads me to the second point I mentioned atmosphere. This feels like the West. The people look dirty and hard-working. The buildings look rickety. And when time is spent looking at each other before the guns are drawn for a few short seconds when the men fire at each other, you feel what it's like to be there.And finally, as I mentioned before, the climax. Possibly the best climax in a movie ever. A Mexican Standoff between the three main characters in the film - Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Minutes pass as they stare at each other, each bringing their hand a bit closer to the gun. The music becomes more and more dramatic as time passes. You wait, and then... They fire, and it's over. A duel as a duel should be. It's mind-blowing.Few movies can reach the level of this masterpiece. Fewer still can surpass it. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a damn shame.

All the characters are wonderful, and the story is fantastic, plus Sylvester Stallone is simply amazing in this!. I thought the scenery was absolutely beautiful, and all the characters are extremely likable, plus John Lithgow plays one of the coolest villains ever here!. Michael Rooker is always an outstanding addition to any cast and here is no different, and I though this was extremely well made and written as well, plus It's kind of like Die Hard on a mountain!. The opening is one of the best ever, as it's so intense, and it had a couple of very cool fight scenes as well, plus it's unpredictable for the most part!. Stallone had a bit of a rough patch for a little while back then (I still enjoyed most of his films though), but really redeemed himself with this one!, as it got him back to the top, plus he had very good chemistry with Janine Turner!.This should be much higher then 6.0 in my opinion, and I feel this is Renny Harlin's best film! plus some of the stunts just blew me away!. The cinematography is outstanding, and believe it or not Stallone does not have as much screen time as one would think, which was good and bad, because Stallone is one of my absolute favorites, but it was good because he did a nice thing and gave the other stars just as much as him, plus the ending and finale were both especially awesome!. I loved how ruthless and sadistic Lithgow was, and the climbing scenes are awesome as well, plus there is plenty of violence as well. Yes it is somewhat of a Die Hard clone,however it also adds tons of new stuff as well, plus This is one of Stallone's absolute best!. It will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end, and the scene where the bats attack Stallone and Turner was very cool, plus I loved the setting as well. This is one of my favorite actions films of all time! it's really thrilling, with brilliant action scenes and amazing performances, and if you haven't seen it please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!.The Direction is superb!. Renny Harlin does a superb job here with outstanding camera work, fantastic angles, great zoom in's and zoom out's and lots of other awesome shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace.The Acting is amazing!. Sylvester Stallone is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, intense, plays one of his coolest characters, was focused, had very good chemistry with Rooker and Janine Turner, kicked that ass, and brought his usual wonderful charisma, he was amazing! (Stallone Rules!!!!!!!). John Lithgow is brilliant as the main villain, he plays one of the best ever, is extremely menacing, and cold, and you will love to hate him, he impressed me big time!. Michael Rooker is outstanding as usual, and is his usual intense self, he had some great scenes with Stallone, and I was happy they gave him a lot of screen time, because I love this guy!. (Rooker Rules!!!). Janine Turner is good in her role as the love interest, I liked her lots. Rex Linn is good as the traitor I dug him. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!. ***** out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 January 2006","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of my favorite action films of all time! it's really thrilling, with brilliant action scenes and amazing performances.

There's no real 'charm' to the film except of course 'dry wit' from Red as if it's the gospel according to Red. He basically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he's his agent. Now Andy this and Andy that. Not to mention a walking brochure for penitentiaries Shawshank this and Shawhank that his gospel just never lets up.Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing 'the babe in the woods' who looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over a tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass. But once nothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim Robbins didn't have the 'acting chops' to bring the 'required depth' to this character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman saved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was premeditated but 'the truth' is Robbins gave such a wooden performance it was necessary.Most people think this isn't your average prison drama ether because its not about violence and melodrama. But 'the truth' is this film is no better than your TV movie of the week that features a 'prison escape'. The whole 'poster thing' couldn't be more 'implausible' if an elephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don't let me get started on how he just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was 'elevator music' at best. The only time I even took notice was when they actually featured it in the plot And even then if I'd heard it id have personally punctured my eardrums. Why the 'sound' was nominated for an academy award is beyond me. If it weren't for packaging and distribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if you consider its box office taking against home rental.The entire cast reeked 'cartoon'. You have your 'evil' warden with his 'religion'. You have your 'mean' guards you 'grow to love'. Not to mention 'the kid', 'the old guy', 'the black guy' and 'the guys'. The prison was so stereotypical it even had 'fags'. Some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'harebrained'. If it was supposed to fascinate, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the mini stories unfolded was 'not stimulating'. His ability to get beers and do taxes in particular 'sucked'.In short this film 'sucked'. Worst film 'since', well since ever!

There are many different elements of film present in this movie that make it as great a film and as revolutionary as I have learned it was in its time.The beginning scene automatically attracts the viewers' attention and holds it as the movie progresses. The trouble had with understanding the meeting of Bonnie and Clyde quickly fades as we are brought into a life of crime, violence and passion. One thing that I found very interesting in this film was the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde. Clyde alerts Bonnie from the start that he isn't a lover boy but still shows interest in her which is confusing. Violence plays a larger part in this film than sex. At some points I found the shooting excessive and a little unrealistic. The getaway scenes seemed a little too convenient from a modern perspective, but at the time I'm sure they were something people hadn't seen before. After reading about this movie and how revolutionary it was it only added to my enjoyment of watching the film. From the start I was hooked by the story, the characters and the intrigue that is somewhat lacking in today's films. Bonnie and Clyde had such a tender relationship and one scene that really struck me was when Bonnie was lying on the bed crying saying that she had the blues real bad. It is obvious by Warren Beatty's facial expressions and actions in this scene that his character, Clyde, does care about Bonnie but is not sure how to reconcile his career and his love for her. It is very easy to relate to Faye Dunaway as Bonnie in this film and her struggle to become something more than a waitress, while also trying to figure out why Clyde shows no interest in her.The viewer finds it hard not to empathize with the Barrow gang, even though we see them shooting cops and robbing banks. Their relationships outside the crimes are what keep us emotionally involved in their story and their lives. They are all human characters, not monsters.Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway both give great acting performances and seem to really care about their characters, which in turn makes the viewer more invested in them as well. Although the shooting scenes seem a little excessive they are necessary to the movie as a whole, just like everything in it. Each scene is a development in the story line and shows a different side of the gang. The fact that humor is worked in as well only makes this film that much stronger. The scene with the Texas Ranger could make the gang look really bad taken out of context, but when we get to see what events take place leading up to that we would probably like to send that Ranger down the river as well. This film explores violence, relationships and humor in such a way that the viewer becomes entranced by the story and finds themselves rooting for the bad guys. This is something not uncommon in today's cinema but in the 60's was practically unheard of. Even still the film is very moving and is only loosely based on the real life Bonnie and Clyde, which is another thing to keep in mind while watching this romanticized yet thrilling depiction.
