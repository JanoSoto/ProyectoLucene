This one, From Dusk Till Dawn, was before today in that list, well I had seen before some bits of its first part (and certainly the famous part of Salma Hayek) but just today I finally saw it in its entirety.And From Dusk Till Dawn has two parts, Salma Hayek sort of marks the end of the first part, the part in which she kills Quentin Tarantino's character but not really literally, the only part in which Hayek is sexy and yes here Hayek stops being sexy&#x85;you don't believe me? Well, I can tell you, second part is carnage with only few moments for our characters to really think about what's going on, to really be sure about what they are dealing with. And is great, very memorable fun, with Tom Savini and Fred Williamson (as Sex Machine and Frost, respectively) joining our main characters, but wait I haven't say much about our main characters so Tarantino plays what is my favourite of his characters, I mean not my favourite of the characters he had written but just of the ones he has played. Tarantino, who also wrote the screenplay, plays Richard Gecko (by reading some other comments I can say most of the people hated Tarantino here, for me it's a lot of great fun with him), sex freak, crazy bastard, criminal and brother of George Clooney's (you can say whatever you want about Clooney but he is great in the Coen brothers masterpiece O Brother, Where Art Thou?, he is awesome here so&#x85;) character Seth Gecko. Both had killed in a week 5 Texas rangers, 8 police officers and 3 civilians and while the authorities say they will caught the fugitives within the next 48 hours the Gecko brothers are on their way to Mexico. The introduction to the Gecko brothers is just superb, as a whole it's a really great opening, and certainly is clear who is who, who is the craziest son of a bitch, who will make things harder for himself and for his brother. Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu play the other main characters, the family Fuller, victims of the Gecko brothers, they did what they had to and they were going to leave Mexico to can tell later on their unfortunate encounter with the Gecko brothers but when the carnage is on&#x85;what, were they psychos?, Cheech Marin is also very memorable here!Why I waited till now to see this film, this awesome film?

Directed by B-movie maverick Jack Sholder, it combines elements from many a distant film genres - science fiction, horror, the buddy movie and '30s-style film-noir, fused together with some sly social satire on Ronald Reagan-era American excess and consumerism - and what we get is one weird hybrid of camp and B-movie sci-fi greatness.That is not to that this film is anywhere near bad. It is actually quite good, even with an utterly preposterous script that may make this one of the most uniquely original sci-fi films to come out of the late '80s.The film's plot concerns the hunt for a killer in Los Angeles. This killer has a taste for fast cars, loud music, and violence. Tom Beck (Michael Nouri) is the L.A. homicide detective put on the case. Matters are complicated when a mysterious FBI man named Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan) shows up and assigns himself to the case, and he soon informs Beck that this killer is not what he seems to be on the outside. (In fact, there's A LOT more to this killer than what he seems to be on the outside.)It seems that on the inside, this killer is actually an alien parasite that has embarked on what could best be described as an intergalactic crime spree. (How it got here and where it came from is never explicitly stated in the film.) This alien, a nasty, slippery-slither slug-type thing that looks like what you might find swimming around in the Toxic Avenger's toxic cesspool, has the ability to assume the physical identity of its host. And on a host-hopping crime spree through Los Angeless, said alien plays (and preys) on American tastes with a wicked streak.I have to say again that The Hidden is one of the most uniquely original sci-fi films to come out of the '80s. Even if the film is prone to genre conventions (buddy cop movie conventions), it doesn't lose itself in those conventions. In fact, it uses the buddy cop genre to turn itself on its head somewhat it turns out that Gallagher is not what he seems to be on the outside either, and that he is in fact an intergalactic policeman\/bounty hunter looking to stop this nasty alien invader dead in its tracks.There are also plenty of cool-looking special effects that suffice this film's low budget. The most astonishing of which is the alien invader itself, and the disgusting ways it's able to move from host to host. (You have to give it to the filmmakers that any visiting alien invader would get swept up in the materialistic excess and violence of 1987. Said visitor could easily mistake that this is the way humans live and when an outsider begins doing it, we have no way to deal with the problem - this is where that sly social satire comes in.) There's also some cool intergalactic weaponry, and plenty of scenes of explosive violence to remind us that this is pure '80s excess of the highest degree.The Hidden has amassed a pretty big cult following in the time since its release all the way back in 1987. I seriously hope that this is one genre classic that doesn't get the big Hollywood remake treatment any time soon.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2009","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I have to admit that the 1987 sci-fi-\/crime-thriller The Hidden is one of the most weirdly entertaining films to come out of the '80s.

Pardon me for writing these many superlatives but this film is a classic Masterpiece in the true sense of the word. I absolutely loved it! The movie has one of the most simple plots and only runs for an hour and 36 minutes. It is predominantly shot in a single room and its in Black and Whitereleased way back in the year 1957. So whats so great about this film you ask? Well to start with this film has 12 stars...Have you ever seen a film with more stars? Probably not. These 12 stars are none other than the 12 Jurors who have to decide a boy's fate. All they have to do is to vote whether the boy is GUILTY OR NOT? What follows is the greatest and maybe the longest conversation in a film I've ever seen. You won't believe how different and unique these 12 men are.Juror#1  A guy who appears confused and tries to calm everyone else around him so that they can reach to a conclusive verdict. Juror#2  A shy person who doesn't speak his mind but understands the situations.Juror#3  A dominant personality who appears very firm and a successful businessman.Juror#4  The most logical of all.Juror#5  A young man from a violent slum who maybe understands the boy's situation the best.Juror#6  A well built man, principled and respectful.Juror#7  A sports fan who doesn't care much.Juror#8  An architect who deeply thinks about the case.Juror#9  I liked all the characters but the most interesting was this one A wise old man whose experience speaks for himself.Juror#10  A foul mouthed and an aggressive person.Juror#11  An immigrant watchmaker and a supporter for the justice.Juror#12  An advertising executive who likes to be with the majority.As someone had commented before If you ever see only one Black and White film make it this one...Rightly said.

I don't know how else to describe this film than by writing the following statement. 12 Angry Men is immaculate, impeccable, flawless, perfect and astounding. Pardon me for writing these many superlatives but this film is a classic Masterpiece in the true sense of the word. I absolutely loved it! The movie has one of the most simple plots and only runs for an hour and 36 minutes. It is predominantly shot in a single room and its in Black and Whitereleased way back in the year 1957. So whats so great about this film you ask? Well to start with this film has 12 stars...Have you ever seen a film with more stars? Probably not. These 12 stars are none other than the 12 Jurors who have to decide a boy's fate. All they have to do is to vote whether the boy is GUILTY OR NOT?

There are a handful of exceptions (Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Jaws, Silence of the Lambs) but generally they are shunned. Then a movie like The Mothman Prophecies comes along, and you wonder if a film is Oscar-worthy because of its most effective conveyance of its subject matter, its sheer execution, then Mothman should have at least been nominated for Best Picture. It conveys its subject matter (although it deviates greatly from the book) in a dead-on, unforgettable, hallucinatory way. I haven't seen another film that 'feels' like Mothman before or since. There's an absolute marriage of style and content to the film, and it demands that it be seen as its own beast, apart from the source material. There's the feeling of evil being 'within the very celluloid' of the film, a quote which comes from an overtly Catholic review of The Exorcist. Director Mark Pellington (Arlington Road) has created a tale for the ages; a relentlessly creepy look into the lives of a small group of people grappling with the unknown - and increasingly losing their grip on reality. Mothman has entered their lives, and their eyes have thus been opened to a truth about our world which defies explanation and belief. There is no line between reality and speculation in Mothman, and it's extremely disorienting and very, very scary. Richard Gere (American Gigolo, Chicago) gives an understated (and underrated) performance. Laura Linney (Tales of the City) gives a somewhat wooden performance, very controlled, but it works within the context of the film, as her character, the town sheriff, needs to remain rationally distant from the goings-on. Will Patton steals the whole movie, and his performance is so sensitive that you feel every painful nuance of his role. Lucinda Jenney is every inch the actor that Patton is, and their scenes together as beleaguered husband and wife are raw and exciting. Among the reasons that the film is so great is that it doesn't show too much of its 'monster'. It reminds me of Charles B. Pierce's The Legend of Boggy Creek, which, like Mothman, is really a thinking-man's monster movie, one that does not destroy its own mystery with heavy-handed special effects and dodgy, expository dialogue. Mothman raises more questions than it answers, and I think this is another one of its strengths. The atmosphere of the picture is absolutely chilling. Even casual daytime scenes, that are not big set-pieces, have a feeling of menace, and you find yourself looking for Mothman around every blustery corner. Tomandandy's musical score takes the subject matter to a whole other level. The music sounds so organic with the images that it's impossible and pointless to imagine it being any other way. That the film deviates from the book is my only qualm about the production. The book is actually creepier than the film, very different from it and much more detailed. It's a shame that the script couldn't have included more of the book, which involves UFO waves, Men in Black, and poltergeist activity, among other things. But the fact that the film works as well as it does justifies the means; the two stories stand separately. Both are powerful, provocative, chilling, and deserving of wide recognition.

Good Bad and Ugly was such an awesome, awesome film. From the second it began, I was glued to the screen, continuously wondering exactly what would happen next. Having watched it for the 2nd time last night, I am still unable to get this amazing piece of art out of my mind. There is no way possible that Sergio Leone is not the greatest director of all time. But enough of me rambling, let me give a reason for my madness.....This film has some of the best acting you will ever find from an allstar cast. Clint Eastwood returns in his role as The Man With No Name, or as he is referred to in this particular film, Blondie, and he plays the role flawlessly, supplying lots of memorable quotes in the process. And then there is Eli Wallach playing the comical bandit called Tuco. Tuco is one of the most hilarious characters ever in movie-making, and there are plenty of scenes where he makes an absolute fool of himself, as well as making others look like idiots in a very funny manner. Finally, there's Lee Van Cleef playing the role of ruthless hit-man Angel Eyes. Van Cleef does superbly in getting the audience to really despise the character he plays because he obviously puts so much emotion into playing the merciless Angel Eyes, who doesn't hesitate to kill ANYONE.....for the right price, that is.But it has been proved numerous times that good acting alone will not make a movie a classic. And fortunately, Leone's masterpiece features one of the most clever plots ever. The story revolves around gunslingers Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes looking for a treasure of gold buried by Confederate troops in a remote cemetery. But here's the interesting part- none of them are able to find the gold without one of the two others. See, each of the three men know a vital fact about the location of the gold that the others need in order to find it. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery, Blondie knows the name of the grave the gold is buried under, and Angel Eyes, like Tuco, knows the name of the cemetery. With an innovative story like that, a director like Sergio Leone, and a stellar cast of actors like Eastwood, Wallach, and Van Cleef, you know ahead of time you are going to see something special. Everything unfolds at such a smooth pace throughout the film, and there are lots of interesting twists that keep you guessing.But there are two things about this film that stand out to me, even above the acting and story. And those two things are the musical score done by Ennio Morricone and the ending climax of this film. I won't say anything other than they are two things that need to be heard\/seen by everyone. Awe-inspiring stuff.So going back to my original statement, Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly is without a doubt the greatest film ever made.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Where do I start?

I was 2 years old when it was released, I'm 20 years old now and I still love it and watch it all the time. It hasn't lost its touch and it never gets old. It's amazing how you can watch a movie over and over again and still love it. Of all movies, this is the one movie I grew up on.Of all the Disney movies out there, how can people not like this one? I don't understand it, I really don't. It's so beautiful and heart felt and always cheers me up when I watch it. Look at the animated movies being made today. It disgusts me and makes me really sad knowing that movies like Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin will never be made again. Some of the animated movies nowadays aren't too bad, Kung Fu Panda and Over the Hedge I love, but will never live up to and be as good as Beauty and the Beast. This movie is pure magic and is one of the best Disney movies ever made. I don't care for the old classics like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, not that I dislike them or anything. All my favorite Disney movies are from the 90s because I grew up with those one.Beauty and the Beast shows one of the most beautiful love stories ever told, showing us that appearance isn't everything but what's inside. Belle fell in love with the Beast, seeing the goodness inside of him. Some people don't like this movie because of why Belle loves the Beast. The message they're trying to give is that you can love someone for what's inside of them, it's just one of the key elements when in a relationship but not the only. During the ballroom dance scene, you can see that Belle and the Beast's love for each other is getting stronger and the way they look at each other, you can definitely see how they have bonded since their first meeting. It's just beautiful and makes me feel all warm inside.The funniest part is when Gaston has his wedding prepared and hasn't even proposed to Belle yet. I mean, what's up with that, but it's funny!Beauty and the Beast makes me miss how they used to animate Disney movies back in the day. The coloring, the gleam in the characters eyes. They added everything. It's absolutely brilliant and with the picture quality increasing nowadays on DVD it makes the movie look even better! I honestly can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie in the last 18 years growing up on it. I personally think it's the most beautiful love story ever told and this movie will stick with me until my dying day. No doubt, I'll be 50 years old and I'll still be watching Beauty and the Beast.I missed buying the special edition when it came out in 2002 so I still have the tape, which surprisingly, still works! I'll be waiting for the re-release of Beauty and the Beast next year in 3D.Beauty and the Beast isn't just for kids but for all ages. It's always gonna be one of my favorite movies.

The lighting was also very dull, which I suppose fits the tone of this movie as I shall demonstrate.The plot, if you can call it that, revolves around F.W. Murnau shooting the movie, NOSFERATU, and finding out that his lead actor, Max Shreck, is a real vampire. At least the plot idea seems unique enough. So, two characters are based on real people and they are involved in the production of a real movie, NOSFERATU, but the production is fictionalised. If you hear a noise you are probably hearing Murnau and Shreck spinning in their graves.At the time of writing this comment, the movie has a rating of 6.8 out of 10. Why? This movie was boring beyond even the wildest parts of my imagination. I can't really give away spoilers as there's nothing to spoil. This excuse for a movie contained a series of only loosely-connected scenes seemingly created and placed randomly. They show director F.W. Murnau, directing the production of his well-known legend, NOSFERATU. Nothing of interest happened at all! Every single scene was lifeless. The movie was as flat as a pancake. SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE bored me so much that I could only handle the first half of it. I decided to switch off at the halfway point, one of the few rare occasions in my life that I felt compelled to turn a movie off. I have no regrets because I don't think I missed anything exciting.John Malkovich plays F.W. Murnau. He was in most of the scenes I saw. He delivers all his lines in a very boring one-note style that makes most things bland appear to shine like bright beacons. From Malkovich's portrayal, one would think that Murnau was a control freak unable to motivate those he directed and who had no real passion in his work at all. This is a complete insult to the memory of a famous director of a now very popular movie. Malkovich has done better work and I've seen one example that I really loved. So, what's he doing here?The same could be said about Willem Dafoe, who played Max Shreck. What's he doing here? Admittedly, he made a better attempt than Malkovich to try and save the movie, but his efforts were wasted. He would have been better off staying at home. Even his short screen time in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY was a far better achievement than his work in this movie.I noticed Cary Elwes in the opening credits and on the cast list on IMDb. Where was he? I don't remember seeing him. He must have been keeping a very low profile. I have to say I don't blame him.Then there's Eddie Izzard. What's he doing here? He was very popular on British TV screens at the time this movie was made. Maybe he was casted to fool British audiences into the idea that this movie is a spoof documentary about the making of NOSFERATU. But there's nothing funny to find here.The only remotely pleasing aspect of this movie was the design of the opening credits. However, at 5 minutes or so in length, even they go on for too long.After noticing the high rating for this movie, I felt compelled to express my view. I bought the DVD of this movie for £1 at the local pound shop and still feel like I've allowed myself to be cheated. I would feel very guilty about selling my copy so I'll probably just put it in the garbage heap where it well and truly belongs.To summarise, I do not recommend this movie at all.

Firstly this film seems to produce very contrasting opinion depending mostly on movie taste. I see some have given it 1 star due to lack of meaning i feel that this movie is completely the opposite to a film devoid of all meaning. It is drenched in meaning, some obvious, some more visible if you delve deeper into the sub context of the film. The film basically follows Alex in his life and the way society has rejected him so it seems he has rejected society.

Though it ought to be said that some artistic license has been used.Or maybe a lot.OK, let's say that anything that was interesting in 'Balto' is completely made up.The problem is that, once it was decided that that they'd make the serum run by dogsled, it actually went without any real problems. And while that was all well and good for the people in Nome who needed medicine, and while Balto isn't any less of a hero for it, it doesn't exactly make for an exciting film.Also, the real Balto was a normal husky dog, not half-wolf. Which means that the real Blato wouldn't have been an outcast trying to rid himself of the nasty, vicious wolf stigma (which is odd in itself, since dogs are pretty much just diluted wolves so I'd have thought that he'd be trying to rid himself of the sissy dog stigma if any). Additionally, the character of Steele is completely made up, which means that the real Balto didn't even have an antagonist to deal with.But that doesn't matter when the film's entertaining, right? Well... I can't say that I was exactly gripped by 'Balto'. But I did laugh.Let me put it this way subtlety is clearly not in the vocabulary of the folks at Amblimation. Balto, the faultless hero, pitted against Steele, the cocky, no, make that egomaniacal antagonist.This in itself doesn't have to be a problem Unfortunately, Steele didn't strike me as a particularly strong villain. He came across as more of a pain in the neck than an actual threat (which is strange since he spends an entire scene beating Balto in to a pulp). I'm aware that perhaps he wasn't the real enemy, and that the real enemy might have been the treacherous terrain and weather on the journey to Nome. But that wasn't very menacing either.These problems, I think, stem from the fact that Balto is way too smart. I know that this sounds really dumb since I'm more than happy to accept that he can talk, but somewhere along the way Balto's ingenuity and propensity to have an immediate solution to every problem crossed my line of credulity and left me thinking whatever... And it's very hard to feel the drama and tension when you're thinking whatever... But aside from this one central, glaring flaw, 'Balto' has a lot going for it. It doesn't fall in to the traps that so many other films of this type fall in to. Namely, it doesn't take itself too seriously (something that I was really expecting it to do), but at the same time the characters aren't playing it for laughs. And on top of that, the comedy is actually funny and surprisingly sophisticated at times.Basically, 'Balto' doesn't try too hard. Which once again seems odd, given that I've just been nattering on about the spotless hero vs. the raging sociopahthic narcissist. This truly is a film of contradictions.Suffice to say that if I'd seen this as a lad I'm sure it would have been my all-time favorite film for at least a week, and while I would have been far too much of a little grot to admit it, I'd have been glad at the end when Rosy didn't die.Because I really do think that 'Balto' is a great kid's film. And I don't mean that in the patronising It's crap but those little darlings won't notice way. I mean it in that, as a general rule at least, kids will notice that Balto is implausibly smart but are more willing (i.e. less jaded and fickle) than most adults to consciously overlook this fact and enjoy the film on the basis of its merits, and merits are something that 'Balto' actually has quite a few of.So I reckon it would have been one of those films that I don't really like anymore, but that I don't regret having liked.

I am not one of those who dislike Woody Allen's work .The Purple Rose of Cairo and Love and Death (where he showed he was able to combine farce with both fairly natural dialogue and his beloved philosophical discussions, this deserted him in BOB) are both treasured parts of my private movie collection. Although BOB is largely free of the artificial dialogue which spoils many of Woody's other films, it was spoilt by unrelenting and continuous overacting. Many films include at least one actor guilty of this heinous sin, but when they almost all do so the fault probably lies squarely with the Director. Here you could watch a few minutes culled from almost any point in the film and be confident of finding a shouting match, or characters waving their arms about like windmills.Many cinema fans do not like watching silent films because of the overacting they are said to feature. This is conventionally explained by the absence of dialogue forcing a greater emphasis on gesture, but John Barrymore even in some of his most unrestrained roles seldom continued exaggerated gesturing beyond the point when it was needed; and this need was often due more to difficulty in creating effective close ups than to the absence of sound, problems that co-existed in those early days. Today an actor can convey a world of meaning whilst quietly sitting at a table by, for example, just raising an eyebrow and uttering the word Really in an appropriately questioning tone. In silent days a one word caption Really would be almost as effective but the scene at the table, filmed from 5 or 10 metre away, would not do justice to the raised eyebrow in the same way as a modern close up, filmed from a distance of no more than a metre; so I can watch, for example, the 1925 version of Ben Hur more readily than I can Bullets over Broadway - improved technology has made us much less tolerant of artefacts that destroy the intended atmosphere. Fans of BOB claim the behaviour shown in this film is in fact typical of interactions between the types of character being portrayed, and the overacting is not as severe as I am suggesting. I doubt if this is true, but even if so the film itself makes it clear that this would be no excuse. The gangster's hit man Cheech in an early sequence explains carefully that it is no good presenting any dramatic work in a manner with which a viewer cannot empathise - depicted dialogue and behaviour must always be adapted to what would be expected and accepted by the potential audience. I do not live among people who shout and wave their arms about all the time, although I will of course accept such behaviour in a film where it is a natural response to a stressful situation; but if I do not live among people who behave like that, I am not likely to watch a film that shows everyone doing so continuously, for very long before I turn it off - or at the very least feel compelled to complain, as I am doing now.Bullets over Broadway is of course dangerously close to being a direct copy of the film Mistress, released a couple of years or so earlier, the stories are almost identical, except that the locale has been changed from Hollywood to New York and the film being produced has become a stage play. The same type of moral and artistic issues are brought out in both of them. Mistress was not so well enjoyed by IMDb users, but it is very interesting to compare the impact created by the two works. Whereas BOB plays more like a farce most of the time, Mistress provides biting satire which for me is both more enjoyable and far more effective. It was extremely well acted by almost all the cast, and Robert De Niro in particular gives a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. No wonder the Hollywood elite did not like it, many of its barbs must have struck very close to home! Recently, after watching Bullets over Broadway I re-watched part of Mistress to decide whether my more favourable recollections of it were justified.

It is a beautiful tale about love, humanity, and the environment.Director Hayao Miyazaki is simply a master at his craft. Not only is the film highly imaginative, well drawn, and has a very tight story; it is also a highly emotional film that will not only make you feel, but also make you think. Miyazaki weaves his environmental message into the story, taking center stage amongst all the epic conflict, making you grow to appreciate the great outdoors even more after viewing this film. Not only that, Miyazaki shows us how awful war truly is, he makes us realize all the sacrifice and loss involved. He does not glorify the battles within this film, he shows them in a very real, almost upsetting fashion (or as real as war can be represented in a fantasy). Though Princess Mononoke is also a story of real love. The romance between the warrior Ashitaka and the wolf princess San is beautiful, and very real in how it unfolds. In the midst of all this conflict, these two opposites come together and form a force that is stronger than all.Even still Princess Mononoke is also a terrific action film. The action set pieces in this film are many, all being extremely inventive and exciting to watch. The opening battle with the possessed boar and San's attack on Iron Town are among two of the finer action sequences in the film. Of course the one that is truly the stand out battle scene is the battle between the humans and the boars. This battle is played out in a very affecting, very artistic way, and is definitely one of the more memorable sequences of the film.This film is easily one of Miyazaki's greatest. It is far more mature than any of his other films, and that might be why it's so special to me. It's a film that is different, but relishes in it, delivering a film that is not just a good animated film, but simply a terrific film in general.I give Princess Mononoke a perfect 10 out of 10!

The opening battle with the possessed boar and San's attack on Iron Town are among two of the finer action sequences in the film. Of course the one that is truly the stand out battle scene is the battle between the humans and the boars. This battle is played out in a very affecting, very artistic way, and is definitely one of the more memorable sequences of the film.This film is easily one of Miyazaki's greatest. It is far more mature than any of his other films, and that might be why it's so special to me. It's a film that is different, but relishes in it, delivering a film that is not just a good animated film, but simply a terrific film in general.I give Princess Mononoke a perfect 10 out of 10!

It is a beautiful tale about love, humanity, and the environment.Director Hayao Miyazaki is simply a master at his craft. Not only is the film highly imaginative, well drawn, and has a very tight story; it is also a highly emotional film that will not only make you feel, but also make you think. Miyazaki weaves his environmental message into the story, taking center stage amongst all the epic conflict, making you grow to appreciate the great outdoors even more after viewing this film. Not only that, Miyazaki shows us how awful war truly is, he makes us realize all the sacrifice and loss involved. He does not glorify the battles within this film, he shows them in a very real, almost upsetting fashion (or as real as war can be represented in a fantasy). Though Princess Mononoke is also a story of real love. The romance between the warrior Ashitaka and the wolf princess San is beautiful, and very real in how it unfolds.

Well, with me that film was Golden Eye. As I have said before in other film reviews there needs to be some sense of realism in a movie (unless you are watching a cartoon)for me to accept it. Well, no more than 10 minutes in this film Bond (played by Peirce Brosnan)is trying to escape from a mountain stronghold and is fighting to get to a plane that is going down the runway to take off. Bond manages to fight off his attacker and go for the plane. At this point I was expecting him to climb into the plane and fly it off the mountain, which would have made sense. Well, instead the plane goes off the mountain and Bond goes after it. It is now in a zero dive with no one in the cockpit heading to the bottom of the canyon. But wait!! Bond dives after it and catches it, then manages to climb in and take the controls and pull the plane out of that zero dive and fly it away. Here are the problems with realism 1) He could never have caught that plane being it weighed more, and it would have fell away much faster.2) once in a zero dive there would have been no way he could have pulled it out of the dive and level it out and fly it away.Talk about showing a contempt for the audience. What were the film makers thinking? I know its James Bond but its not suppose to be Super Man. I miss the days of Roger Moore and Sean Connery as Bond where they did things that where a little hard to believe (but was not out of the realm of possibility)but it was fun. I am done with Bond.

I first saw the movie in flight. And guess what, I saw it all 3 to 4 times, before the flight landed in LAX (from Asia). Eddie Griffin and Orlando Jones, such great actors who put up one hell of a performance. They became their respective characters which is why the movie turned out to be great. Every part of the movie is a double take, something's going on and you might\/may not miss it or you wouldn't know whom to believe. So you clearly experience what Daryl Chase (Orlando Jones) is going through. Over all, the movie is brilliant, if you are looking for quality action and comedy then this is a must own (DVD) or you can always rent it (but the movie deserves a lot better than a rent). I have the DVD since 2004. And been watching it often, till today.George Gallo is awesome incarnate. This man is the brainchild behind some of the massive action\/comedy\/adventure\/crime\/thriller genre movies. MIDNIGHT RUN and BAD BOYS to mention.
