The plot with this one sounded hysterical and I like Marley Shelton, so I was ready to be entertained with this little flick.I found Sugar & Spice to be an excellent and extremely amusing, enjoyable teen flick with edginess and sass. The material was not rolling on the floor, laugh out loud hilarious, but it was enough to where you get tons of continuous little chuckles and I always had a smile on my face, always. That's why I loved this movie so much. It was able to make me grin and laugh all the way through at such little things, such as the Betty masks and whole robbery ordeal, and little lines and scenes, tons of which are through out the entire film.The performances were wonderful for their characters. Marla Sokoloff, Marley Shelton, Mena Suvari and James Marsden gave my favorite and most memorable performances of all, but everyone was memorable in their own, special way and I really just had an all out pleasurable experience with this joyous film and the joyous characters and essence it brings.In the end, as I've said, I had an amazing blast with Sugar & Spice. It was fun, fresh and though it's not for everyone, it certainly was for me, because I saw it as much more than most would for it's eccentric and zany sense that was very different in ways from other films of it's caliber. If you can enjoy films like these for what they are, try on Sugar & Spice for it is really just non-stop delight from start to finish with lovable characters and a screwball, surreal plot.

Yes there is violence and sexual content but in my opinion it is all in context and not gratuitous but thats just my two cents.

The films are entirely entertaining, but I have always regarded them as overrated by many of my fellow Horror fans. The sixth part, Jason Lives was probably my favorite film in the series (apart from the letdown that it was the only one featuring no female nudity), as it presented the creepiest version of Jason so far, and gave him obvious supernatural powers for the first time, and furthermore included a nice amount of gore. This seventh film in the series, Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood (1988), presents an even scarier-looking Jason, which is probably the most positive aspect about it. Other than the continuation of the Friday films, The New Blood also includes sort of a homage to Brian De Palma's brilliant Steven King adaptation Carrie of 1976 (which is incomparably greater than any of the Friday films), as the main protagonist is a girl with supernatural powers very similar to those of Sissy Spaceck's eponymous character. So the film includes some new elements. So far, so good, but it also suffers from the factor that Jason's continuous butchering teens tends to get a little tiresome after a while. My main complaint about The New Blood is the fact that it is quite tame. This obviously had a higher budget than any of its predecessors, and was therefore intended to attract mainstream audiences. The gore is therefore almost nonexistent, as most murders are either un-gory or happen off-screen (or, even worse, the camera blends away when the good stuff happens). As sort of a substitute, this one features some female nudity again - but then, if you're merely looking for that there are plenty of other films to watch. Jason does look creepier than ever though. This is the first time that he was played by the tall and intimidating Kane Hodder, and the makeup people really did an amazing job. In the predecessors, I always felt that it took some of Jason's creepiness away when his mask comes off, but this isn't the case here. He looks really, really creepy. This is no surprise regarding that this film was directed by John Carl Buechler, who worked as a makeup artist on such Horror greats as Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator (1985) and From Beyond (1986).(As a director, Buechler is responsible for the unbearably terrible Troll, though). Lar Park-Lincoln makes a pretty likable protagonist in the role of the supernatural girl. For my money, The New Blood is neither the best nor the worst Friday. For carrying the word 'blood' in its title, it should have been a lot bloodier though.

MGM's contribution to these films was not bettered served than by Meet Me In St. Louis. It's a simple story about the Smith family in 1904 St. Louis eagerly awaiting the World's Fair that would take place in their town. And to my knowledge no other World's Fair had as enduring a theme song as the one written for this fair, serving as the title song for the film.The Smith family consists of parents Leon Ames and Mary Astor and their five children, son Henry Daniels, Jr. and daughters in descending order, Lucille Bremer, Judy Garland, Joan Carroll, and Margaret O'Brien. Grandfather Harry Davenport lives with the clan and so does live-in maid Marjorie Main who functions like Alice in the Brady household. A good meal and an occasional wisecrack to keep everyone in line.Everyone's excited about the upcoming fair, St. Louis's rival city Chicago had one a decade earlier and Buffalo did three years earlier, but this one promises to be the most extravagant of all. Ames gets an opportunity in business and wants to move the family to New York, but one by one the family has or develops obligations and ties to St. Louis that makes them reluctant to leave. Not to mention they don't want to miss the fair.Vincente Minnelli directed Meet Me In St. Louis and it was his first opportunity to work with Judy Garland whom he would marry after the film was finished. Judy got to do three of her most identified songs from the Hugh Martin-Ralph Blane score that was blended with some traditional music of the times. The Boy Next Door, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, and The Trolley Song all come out of Meet Me In St. Louis and were staple items at Garland concerts for years. One of the Oscar nominations that Meet Me In St. Louis received was for The Trolley Song for Best Original Song. It lost to Bing Crosby's Swinging On A Star that year. The other nominations were for musical scoring, color cinematography, and screenplay.Margaret O'Brien did a remarkable job in this film, this was probably her best role while a child star at MGM. Not that she was the youngest and most appealing of the kids, she was that. But Minnelli did a great job in directing her. She had all the fears and trepidations of a child growing up and not wanting to leave all she's known and loved in St. Louis. Her acting reached its zenith in the scene where she destroys the carefully made snowmen in her yard and in the Halloween scene where she is induced to play a practical joke on a neighbor the rest of the kids regard as scary. Her number with Judy Garland, Under The Bamboo Tree is a gem.Meet Me In St. Louis was one of the earliest and best films coming out of the Arthur Freed unit at MGM. It was films like these that gave the Freed unit and MGM its reputation for turning out the best in musical film entertainment. It can never be duplicated because you don't have studios with all that talent under contract.In its way the film itself is as nostalgic as the time it celebrates.

I knew I was going to be watching something poorly done. It looked like trash, but maybe it would at least be fun. It isn't.Joshua Jackson is invited to join the secret society, The Skulls, based on a real network that supposedly includes many powerful, influential people. The kids who enter into this world as college students will have many doors opened up for them as they enter the workforce and maneuver through life's challenges. Except that Joshua Jackson's character, Lucas, starts to feel morally conflicted about some of the things that happen.I think I was hoping to see the decadent or possible sleazy side of having these advantages.

Having finally seen it, I must say that, while the film is definitely worthwhile, I do not quite get the hype it receives from most of my fellow admirers of European cult-cinema. Possession is often called a 'love it or hate it' film, but, personally I must say that neither is the case with me. On the one hand, Possession is a wonderfully bizarre film which really isn't like anything else, and furthermore an exceptionally shot exercise in fascinating cinematic style. On the other hand, it is - plain and simple - a mess.Terriffically set in Berlin (divided by the Berlin Wall), the film is about an... eer... slightly troubled married couple - Mark (Sam Neill) is slowly going out of his mind over his wife Anna (the stunning Isabelle Adjani), who does not merely betray him with a quite sinister lover, but also with someone (or something) else... This is only a very vague description of the first part of Possession, but, in this case, giving a proper description would mean describing every scene from start to finish (and what would be the point of that?). While I usually LOVE cinematic weirdness (one of my all-time favorite filmmakers being the Chilean\/French\/Mexican genius Alejandro Jodorowsky), and this one is full of it, the weirdness of Possession is too messy at times. Too often does it seem as if director Zulawski simply put together unrelated scenes, just to make the film more bizarre. The cast is great, and the over-acting (from everybody, which was obviously requested by the director) fits the film in this case. However, there are many scenes in which the characters simply grimace and do things like cutting themselves with electric knives for no reason whatsoever. Scenes like these may be shocking or fascinating in a film every now and then, but when large parts of a movie do only consist of barely related weird sequences attached to one another, the weirdness can loose its impact. Still, the film never gets monotonous.Technically, Possession is a masterwork. Both the settings in Berlin and the cinematography are fascinating. The film is set in West Berlin, and, in many parts, one can actually see the Eastern part over the wall, through windows on one the Western side. This aspect alone makes the film fascinating. Besides its stylistic and cinematographic greatness, Possession has many other fascinating aspects. The characters are entirely sinister. As mentioned above, all cast members are extremely over-acting, but, in this case this isn't a bad thing. Especially Sam Neill and Isabella Adjani are great. Neill is a terrific actor and he greatly portrays the maddening despair of a left husband obsessed with his crazed wife. Adjani (who actually plays two roles in this film) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful actresses ever, and she is an equally fantastic actress. Her performance as the ravishing but 'possessed' Anna is magnificent. Heinz Bennert is also very remarkable as her sinister, creepy and somewhat nuts lover, who claims to be a sex-master and still lives with his mother. Possession has the reputation of being very gory and perverted, which even landed it on the UK's infamous Video Nasty List (another proof that Film censors are a bunch of fascist morons). Except for one very gross scene, however, the film isn't really exceptionally gory, and the perversity is mostly suggested rather than show.Overall, Possession certainly is an unforgettable film experience, maybe even a must-see for every true cineaste. Still, I cannot quite see it as the masterpiece that some of my fellow cult-cinema fans seem to regard it. For true masterpieces of bizarre cinema see any film by Alejandro Jodorowsky (especially El Topo, The Holy Mountain or Santa Sangre); in case you dig surreal Art-Horror films in which beautiful women have sex with strange monstrosities, I recommend Walerian Borowczyk's La Bête (1975) over this one.

This movie literally made cinema's history in the evening of March, 30th, 1992. It was Oscar's night, and Jonathan Demme's thriller went home with all the five major awards - Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, becoming only the third movie is history to ever achieve this accomplishment (the other ones are 1934 Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' and 1975 Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'). And the Academy was perfectly right, as 'The Silence of the Lambs' is easily the best movie of 1991 and one of the best thrillers of all-time. It deserved all the awards it got.'The Silence of the Lambs' is based on one of Thomas Harris' novels about serial-killer Hannibal Lecter. But Lecter only appears in the movie within 13 minutes of runtime. Before that, we are presented to the movie's major plot, that is centered around Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster). Clarice is a young FBI agent that is assigned to the case of Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), a serial killer that skins his victims and then throws them in a river. But in order to gather information for the case, Clarice must talk to Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the most feared and dangerous serial killer in the world. The story here doesn't have a lot of originality, but the way the movie explains it to the audience is simply amazing. The character development is incredible, the dialogs are outstanding and the montages are breath-taking. I couldn't blink not even for one second, which proves how good the writing is. The first of the five major Oscars was certainly very well-deserved. Thumbs up for Thomas Harris for the novel and for Ted Tally for the excellent adaptation.Now, let's talk about the acting, and there is only one thing to say about it it couldn't be any better. The whole supporting cast is outstanding, with the exception of Brooke Smith, as one of Buffalo Bill's victims. She was just average, nothing special to it. But the member of the supporting cast that stands out is certainly Ted Levine. He should have been at least Oscar-nominated for his performance as Buffalo Bill, a quite creepy interpretation. Aside from the supporting cast, also composed by Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald, all the attention here goes for the two leading roles. Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are perfect, specially Hopkins. Even though he has only 27 minutes of screen-time, Hopkins managed to deliver one of the most memorable performances of the 1990's decade. All his gestures, that creepy coolness, the tones his voice reaches... it's all perfect for the character. None other actor could have done a better job, another very well-deserved Oscar. The other leading role here goes to Jodie Foster. Of course she is not as great as Anthony Hopkins, but she also delivers a very memorable performance. Her naiveness, the hidden South accent, her desperate struggle to impress her superiors - Clarice Starling and Jodie Foster are only one. Again, a deserved Oscar award - this time for Best Actress.The fourth Oscar award this movie received was Best Director for Jonathan Demme. And the guy really impresses you on his directing work. The movie wouldn't be the same nor it would have the same recognition if it wasn't for him. The places Demme puts the camera are excellent, as he did it for the audience to feel in the skin of Clarice Starling. And in order to do this, Demme makes all the characters look straight into the camera, except for Clarice, that never does this, always looking at another direction. There are also a few scenes (most tracking-shots) designed to be like the the eyes of Clarice. And her childhood memories only increases the audience's approach to Jodie Foster's character. Another deserved Oscar-award.The movie was also Oscar-nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing. The Sound here is nothing out of the ordinary, with nice Sound Effects, but a lousy musical score. Nothing that takes away the movie's accomplishments, tough. As for Best Editing, it should have got the award. Craig McKay's editing work is outstanding, as the audience is fooled to believe in things that turn out to be others. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but you are gonna feel pretty dumb once you find out the tricks McKay used. The cinematography here is also nothing out of the ordinary, such as the other aspects. Nothing that's worth mentioning.Overral, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is the perfect psychological thriller. The fact it won all the five major awards at the Oscars only proves my point, and they were all extremely well-deserved. The writing is amazing, the acting is perfect, and the directing is outstanding. You put that with one of the most memorable performances of the decade by Anthony Hopkins, join with a great editing work, ferocious dialogs and an impressive directing, and you have the best movie of 1991.

In the first part, for example, the lake was entirely surrounded by deep woods, whereas in the third part, the area looked more like a swamp. Still, none of the films gave the impression that Crystal Lake was connected to any other waters, let alone a river that connects to the sea. Well,... guess what Good old Jason is resurrected once again by a teenage couple in a boat on Crystal Lake. After butchering the two lovebirds, Jason takes the boat to a nearby coastal small-town, where a bunch of teenagers as well as two teachers are planning a trip to New York on a cruise ship. Jason sneaks on board, of course, and his presence quickly reduces the number of teens on the ship...The Friday the 13th series is mainly a product of the 80s, and, shot in 1989, Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is the last 80s Friday film. This film's setting on a cruise ship (which, considering its size, carries only very few people) is actually a good thing, in my opinion, as a ship is one of the most inescapable settings imaginable. And, at least in the beginning, Jason does what he does best with acceptable results. Sadly enough, Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is once again relatively gore-less (which also was my main complaint about the previous part, New Blood. Most of the murders either let camera slide away when the good stuff happens, or are virtually gore-less. This is too bad, because, at least in my humble opinion, gore was probably the one thing the earlier entries to the series had to offer. Kane Hodder plays Jason again, which is good as he gives him a creepy and intimidating look. Jason's look is generally creepier in the later entries to the series, but the gore is still way too tame in this film for my tastes. The few gory sequences are pretty cool, though, especially one in which Jason punches a guy's head off his torso with his bare hands. Also, one could (once again) care less about any of the protagonists, as a viewer one isn't scared for them but eagerly waits for them to get butchered. The Jason makeup underneath the mask isn't impressive (it was very good in the previous part). Oh, and the ending is the stupidest thing ever.Personally I have always thought of the Friday series as extremely overrated by many of my fellow Horror fans, and this eighth part is one that can easily be skipped.

Do they ever do anything wrong? I'd have to say no. Do they ever do anything less than great? Well . . . . yes but, luckily, Monsters, Inc. is never less than great and it remains, for me, their very best movie.It's all about Mike and Sulley (voiced, respectively, by Billy Crystal and John Goodman), two monsters who work together at the titular company. Mike controls the doors that Sulley enters, with each door taking him into some child's closet and an opportunity to scare some screams out of them because screams = fuel in the land of Monstropolis. All seems good, despite the jealousy of snide co-worker Randall (Steve Buscemi), until *gasp, horror* a child gets through their door and into Monstropolis. And as all monsters know, children are highly dangerous, toxic things.With a great mix of humour, warmth, heart and lush visuals (aka, surely, the Pixar recipe for success) this movie remains my personal favourite from the studio for many reasons.First of all, the vocal cast is unbeatable. John Goodman is perfectly suited to play lovable monster Sulley while Billy Crystal is all snappy one-liners and simmering frustration as Mike, the partner who helps him during the whole interloping child situation. Steve Buscemi is brilliantly sneaky and cold as Randall while Jennifer Tilly brings her unique voice to the role of Celia, Mike's love interest. Then we get the likes of John Ratzenberger in a small role, James Coburn and Frank Oz along with many others who just end up ideally suiting their animated characters.Secondly, the central concept is just as good as the one behind Toy Story. All kids have grown up with the thought of monsters in the closet and this film riffs on that idea nicely, providing the twist that some of the monsters are just as scared of the kids they're visiting.Thirdly, the script is as good as any other Pixar movie script with it's blend of laughs, references, imagination and ability to make you suspend disbelief while you simply go along for the ride that the movie provides you with.Then there is the gorgeous animation. From the movement of Sulley's fur to the constant changing of chameleonic Randall's colouring to the finale involving more doors than you could find in your local Doors R Us, it's all so beautifully rendered that each frame is a real treat for the eyes.Added to all of the above you get a movie that works on a number of levels for children and adults alike, as many of the best animated movies do. Yes, children are scared by monsters but just what makes a monster? Is it always something hiding in the closet or sometimes just seeing a loved one in a very different, unflattering light? Oh heck, I don't want to read too much into things or overcomplicate the movie for anyone - just see it immediately and love it as much as I do.

Elwood has driven his sister and niece (who live with him and crave normality) to distraction by introducing everyone he meets to his friend, Harvey.Let's just say everything James Stewart does is gold. There are some lines of dialogue I wish had been cut (he introduces himself and hands out his card a bit too often), but all in all you can never have too much Jimmy Stewart and his voice is one of those voices you long to hear (right up there with Morgan Freeman). Credit must also be given to the actress who played Nurse Kelly, Peggy Dow (an actress from 1949-1951, who then retired when she was married to Walter Helmerich). Dow could have had a bright future in film, but turned it down... though, by all accounts, she did go on to become a successful advocate for a variety of worthy causes in Tulsa, Oklahoma.The big question Is Harvey real? As bartender Mr. Cracker points out, there are two schools of thought. Either Elwood is talking to himself, or he's not. The truth may be revealed by the end of the film, and maybe it won't. There is some level of interpretation involved. You can accept the obvious if you'd like. But the mystery's part of the fun delusion or pooka?

There are some lines of dialogue I wish had been cut (he introduces himself and hands out his card a bit too often), but all in all you can never have too much Jimmy Stewart and his voice is one of those voices you long to hear (right up there with Morgan Freeman). Credit must also be given to the actress who played Nurse Kelly, Peggy Dow (an actress from 1949-1951, who then retired when she was married to Walter Helmerich). Dow could have had a bright future in film, but turned it down... though, by all accounts, she did go on to become a successful advocate for a variety of worthy causes in Tulsa, Oklahoma.The big question Is Harvey real? As bartender Mr. Cracker points out, there are two schools of thought. Either Elwood is talking to himself, or he's not. The truth may be revealed by the end of the film, and maybe it won't. There is some level of interpretation involved. You can accept the obvious if you'd like. But the mystery's part of the fun delusion or pooka? Elwood also at one point philosophizes that people must choose between being oh so smart and oh so pleasant, and says that after trying the former, he's settled on the latter. Indeed, his intelligence is debatable, but one cannot deny he's pleasant (even winning over a nurse that should be committing him). Is he right that one must be one or the other? Could one be both or neither? I'm not going to touch on that, but it's worthy of discussion.Harvey is a must-see. It was a Pulitzer Prize-winning play, it was a successful film, and has been remade numerous times (once more even featuring Stewart). Assuming you're not going to see the play, this is as close to the original as it comes. And as Henry Koster's most widely-known film, the least you can do is give him a chance.

Having similar tastes in movies as him, I decided to rent this movie right away. And I can honestly say that I am extremely happy that I didn't put this one off. From the very beginning of Gattaca, I felt an instant liking for the main character Vincent(Hawke). The time period takes place in what the movie calls as the not too distant future, and Vincent finds himself a genetically imperfect invalid and outcast in a rapidly changing society. This new world puts heavy emphasis on the genetic perfection of the individual humans which constitute this perfect society. As the story progresses, Vincent comes to realize that his true place and purpose is not of the world around him, and becomes infatuated with becoming an astronaut. However there are difficult barriers which Vincent discovers he must surpass so that his seemingly unattainable dream can be realized. On an endnote, Gattaca is a superbly made film with all the ingredients which are required for a perfectly balanced film. Gattaca has a wonderful blend of romance, suspense, science, and also has an excellent script that allows me to give it a solid 10\/10. I can honestly say that this movie is one of the most underrated films ever.

She is trying to write a script and hires him to ghost write it, keeping him a virtual prisoner... yet, she showers him with gifts. Is it love? Sunset Boulevard is considered a classic, a bit of romance, some noir, and a drama... it connects to the real world of Hollywood (director Cecil B. DeMille and Buster Keaton make appearances) and adds a seedy side. Not too seedy, mind you... but there is some joking about the lead being a Black Dahlia suspect. That such a gruesome case gets referenced in a movie taking place on a Paramount lot is a bit risqué, I think.The surprise star, aside from the obvious, is Milwaukee native Nancy Olson, who plays love interest Betty Schaefer (though whose love interest is a matter of dispute). She is quite beautiful, but never really became a big name (though she did make it into some notable Disney films).I suspect this film was an inspiration for Stephen King's Misery -- another writer held hostage story. King's has a bit more violence and torture, but the premise is similar. Take a dark plot and run it by King, it's bound to come out even darker... (Misery starred James Caan and Kathy Bates, who actually won a Best Actress Oscar for her part!) Take Billy Wilder's film noir masterpiece Double Indemnity, lighten it up just a notch, make the plot more complex... and out comes Sunset Boulevard. I daresay I preferred Double Indemnity, but this may be a close second... though I have much more Wilder to go through before I can be truly sure!

Add to it, it was the first ever 'Screwball comedy' movie. Yup, this was actually a new genre invented by Capra.

But the story-teller that Capra is, this simple story is converted into a very lovable and feel good rom-com which never ceases to amaze you. The movie is full of clichés such as a rich spoilt girl falling in love with a not so wealthy guy and the girl running away from her marriage once she realizes her true love etc etc. But one must also consider the time when this movie was made. Perhaps, this was the first bride runway from marriage scene of cinema history. This movie also influenced a lot of other artists and filmmakers.
