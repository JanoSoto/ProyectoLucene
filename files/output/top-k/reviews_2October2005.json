The plot follows him through his best years and highest profile troubles and is an entertaining look back at this chapter in this life but the focus is on the facts rather than anything really deeper. Like Ali himself, the film is at its best when it is floating, boxing and trash talking and in these moments it is great fun &#150; but not because the film is anything special but because Ali was. However when the film has to delve deeper into him as a person, it seems less certain of itself and is surprisingly dull. Issues that require a sensitive touch fall flat and, although the film does show him in a bad light, it is mostly done reluctantly and sheepishly.The running time is longer than necessary to accommodate this side of things and, because it doesn't work that well it does make the whole film feel longer than it should be. The fights and talking are where the show is though and it does this aspect really well. The fights are well directed and convincing, doing justice to the real things and they are fun to watch. In these scenes I was happy to have Mann as the director but I couldn't wonder but wonder if Spike Lee would have been a more interesting choice for the depth and review of the man as a person and on his cultural impact. Matching the film's strength in recreation, the cast is led by a couple of performances that are very good but really very good impersonations. Smith never makes Ali his own and never gets below the skin of the character. He is great in the ring and he trash talks really well but he is part of the problem when it comes to the other stuff. Voight does great work as Cosell; I barely recognised him and he has gotten the mannerisms and voice bang on. The support is very mixed but is mainly good. Foxx impresses in a minor role and I imagine it is this performance that won him the support in Mann's Collateral. The rest a re a strange mix with too many of them being recognisable from other films and undermining their characters &#150; with such little time to make an impact, many of them are that guy from rather than being the person we need them to be. The limited pool of actors that Mann drew on also caused me some amusement; specifically it was amusing to see Hall go from being Baines in Malcolm X to being Elijah Muhammad (a promotion) or Esposito not shooting Malcolm X. Nobody is bad but I did think that the cast would have benefited from having fewer famous faces despite the fact that Silver, Wright, Williamson, Smith, Gaye, Michele, Morton, McGill and others were all fine (not sure about Van Peebles as Malcolm X or Williamson's Don King though).Overall this is a good film but it is at its best when it is just recreating the magic of Ali and his skills as a fighter and entertainer. When it tries to go below the surface it falters and does occasionally drag. One thing worth noting is that the very things that the film does well is captured just as well in the (much shorter) documentary When We Were Kings, that covers the same sort of ground but uses the man himself.

The two come together when another tragedy strikes and soon they are both using each other as physical and emotional crutches. As their relationship grows it only seems a matter of time before secrets and lurking tragedy will strike again.It is hard to really put the plot of this film into a few sentences without having to just spell out what happens from start to finish because really the film follows two characters as one depressingly bad thing happens to them after another. As stories go it is not great and, although I can see it serving as a realer reality than Hollywood often serves up, the fact that it is so bleak means that you pretty much end up just waiting for the next bad thing to happen rather than getting into the narrative. This is not to say it is dull because it is still engaging as a story but it is often a bit of hard work and it would have been better to scale the tragedy back a little and provide more balance within the story; as it is it moves swiftly from one bad thing to another and it can be a bit overwhelming at times.The direction is good and matches the narrative's sense of a slow collapse; it is dark, patient and very professional. The cast are perhaps the main reason to stick with it because they are roundly good. Thornton could be seen as just walking through the film but I thought he got the tired life of Hank pretty much spot on.

However, unlike the majority of the sub-genre; this one isn't all that bad. The plot is hardly original in it's fusion of the haunted house tradition and eighties slasher trash, but at least it gives the film a slight edge over it's less imaginative counterparts. The plot sees a group of four high school 'kids' having to spend a night in a creepy old house as an initiation ceremony for the fraternity they want to join. However, this isn't just a creepy old house and by way of a super-camp story telling sequence, we learn that the master of the house killed himself, his wife and three of his four horribly deformed children. This, of course, means that one survived; and that one, is course, rumoured to still be hanging around the creepy old house. That is, of course, a rumour that turns out be true! What then follows is the usual slasher sort of stuff, with the kids inside getting sliced and diced along with the ones outside, who were just trying to make their new frat-mate's stay a little scarier.Linda Blair, now all grown up since her role in The Exorcist, takes the lead role and does pretty much what you would expect the heroine to do. There's some nice murder sequences in this film, but the gore is never over the top. I actually like over the top gore, but despite not having much of it, it never really harms this film. The murders are stylishly shot, and the way it portrays them allows it to be shocking without the need for a lot of bloodshed. In a sub-genre that is primarily concerned with bloodletting; this is actually quite admirable. The sets are one of the best things about this film. The Gothic mansion gives it that great atmosphere that is usually reserved for haunted house movies. The movie doesn't always make best use of it's settings, however, with too many scenes being restricted to close-up's when a shot that takes in more of the surrounding area would have been better. The fact that the killer is deformed gives it a bit of an edge over the likes of Halloween because aside from there being a killer, you also want to see him to find out how badly deformed he is. It is a disappointment when he's finally revealed...but the wait holds some suspense. On the whole, this isn't all that good; but it's not bad either. Slasher fans will find something to like.

Many films since have used the same formula that makes this one a success, and most have failed. The reason this film is almost a resounding success has nothing to do with the plot or characters, however, it's the way that director Curtis Hanson handles it. The man who would go on to find acclaim with the astounding L.A. Confidential directs with the utmost still, and while there are few absolutely shocking sequences in this film; you would be forgiven for thinking otherwise due to the way that Hanson handles every scene. The movie leaves a lot of room for suspense, and every instant is made the best of by the director. The plot seems rather routine these days (and it probably did back in 1992), as we see a good all-American family hire the 'perfect' babysitter. She's not quite so perfect, however, and as we watch her pull down the family she's supposed to be helping from within, this becomes abundantly clear.One thing that makes this film hard to like for some people is the fact that almost every motivation in the film is extremely unlikely. Would you hire a babysitter who apparently 'just knew' you wanted one? Wouldn't you become suspicious when everything started going wrong after you hired her? The list goes on, it really does, and it would seem that writer Amanda Silver just wanted to portray certain plots and didn't care too much how the characters fit into them. It's also obvious that the script was written by a woman throughout, with many of the sequences being more aimed towards women. None of these bad points really harm it though, because it's so well handled that it's hard not to just sit back and enjoy yourself. The centrepiece when it comes to the stagy set pieces is definitely the one with the greenhouse, which is both psychologically pleasing and suspense filled. The acting is just fine, with Rebecca De Mornay slotting into the deranged psycho role nicely. The best thing about this film for me is definitely the way that the babysitter manipulates the children and engineers situations to her advantage. This may be trash at the end of the day, but it's fiendishly done!

There could have been a very strong story developed behind Pruitt Taylor Vince's character of Victor instead of the inconsistent scenes that I witnessed. Liv Tyler could have honestly stepped up in the Hollywood atmosphere on this film alone, if she would have just attempted to take one small chance and go outside of herself. The same could be said for both Shelly Winters and Deborah Harry, who just never felt anything more creative than a walking cliché. Mangold had the power in his hands to really set the stage on fire, but instead we are forced to watch a very inconsistent, obscure, and emotionally voided film that tries to tackle too many issues, without solving any in the long run.I initially envisioned Heavy's story line to be about a man, concerned about his weight, being the outcast member of society. At first, and at brief intermittent moments of the film, that was the case, but something changed as the other characters were introduced. Liv Tyler became a disturbing obsession instead of a passionate, yet simple, love for Victor. There are scenes in which Vince thinks that he sees a dead Callie walking through his house or even floating in a puddle, but alas, they are only daydreams. Why were they daydreams? What was the overall relevance of these scenes? Was it to show a different side, a troubled side, to Victor, or was it merely used to confuse the audience? I thought that perhaps she was representing Victor's mother, but even that was stretching a bit. It was moments like this that really brought a speed bump into this film. There were other scenes similar to this one that really pulled us away from the central focus of the film, the growth of Victor. The encounters with Leo seemed forced, and the clichéd and random sexual advances of Delores seemed to come out of left field. The moments between Victor and his mother didn't even feel real. I felt as if Shelly Winters was speaking from a cue card instead of her heart. There was one emotional scene where it felt as stale as cardboard, yet it was supposed to evoke tears. Pathetic. I felt at times that Mangold had one of those Choose your own plot books and just randomly flipped through it during this film.Outside of random plot interjections coming at you from every angle (quite distractingly), there was some decent acting from our lead character Victor played by Pruitt Taylor Vince. Vince was able to bottle up the emotions of the situations around him very well, the twitching eyes was not something that I thought helped build his character (was that a acting trait or actually Vince's eyes), while the stress eating moments did seem very human. Vince is a strong actor. He is typically cast as the psycho in most films, but I thought in this film he did stretch his wings a bit. It wasn't far, but he brought compassion and emotion to a very forgettable character. He is the only one worth watching in this film, while the rest of the cast just hurt the film further. Liv Tyler has trouble acting. She talks about never taking an acting class before, and in this film you can tell. She brought nothing new to the screen. The connection between her and Vince was non-existent. There was no chemistry, no power, nothing that made me really see a love between the two. These two have a very silly match.Outside of the acting and the zigzag plot, there was not much else going for the film. The music was a tease. There were some scenes where you would have Vince walking along the road, powerful, emotional, and together, and the music would suddenly change. Either it was poor editing or just bad music placement, but it seemed to be jumping just as much as Vince's eyes. It made me cringe in my seat. I just get extremely worked up about films that claim to be an emotional powerhouse of an independent film, yet it feels like crayons were used instead of the power of the paintbrush. Again, Mangold had a great film under the surface of all this muck, but it just wasn't worth wading through to get to.Overall, I was not impressed with this film. If Mangold would have stayed the course, kept us glued to Vince's powerful character, and developed him using the other minor characters around him, than I think it would have been a winner. If Liv Tyler would have been a stronger central character and perhaps stepped outside of her lines, than we may have had a winner. If the point would have been to show a weak man overcome the boundaries of his life, than I think we would have had a winner. Instead, we are left with unattached moments that come from left field and walking cardboard characters that spit cliché lines into the sky instead of to the viewers. Heavy had so much potential, one can only blame Mangold for all these disasters. Skip it. Have yourself a big pizza and watch some Chris Farley films.

I love Nicholson's seventies movies because the great actor was still raw and going into one of his films, a performance with gusto comes as standard. Not to say that his latter day performances haven't been as good; but in his early days; he was more outrageous, and this is a film that does a good job of portraying that side of him. The film is a character study, which gives Jack the opportunity he needs to get inside the film and deliver a performance that not only works, but also makes the film work with it. I found it interesting that Nicholson, a co-star in 1969's Easy Rider stars here with another of it's co-stars; Karen Black. Having these two together in another film would make you think that the acting isn't going to be as good; with them both being co-stars in the earlier film - but they rise to the challenge and, really, both show that they should have been given more screen time in Dennis Hopper's roadbound classic.The plot follows a greasy oil rigger who has to return home after receiving news that his father is dying. It turns out that this guy is actually a very good piano player, and while back home he must come to terms with the life that he leads, and the one he ran away from. Themes include finding your place in the world, as well as how some people's selfishness can take over their life. Five Easy Piece's gritty portrayal of a man leading his own life and making his own way is really well done, and almost every event in the film has a meaning beyond what you are immediately seeing on the screen. At times, it can seem like the film is rather slow paced; but it really has to be, due to the fact that there's so much of it to take in. I loved the atmosphere of the movie, which is very gritty and gives the film a distinct 'real life' feel. These days, most movies go for a glossy texture; but most of the seventies films that have stood the test of time include this gritty feel and the reason why this will be remembered and so-called 'modern classics' like 2004's 'Crash' wont is that this flick feels real, and not like overblown Hollywood rubbish.

An ensemble cast of characters, landed in circumstances unknown by presumed hostile, try to keep their cool in the face of a growing but undefined sense of unease, but in the finale have to fight to the death with aliens (and traitors among themselves); not all will survive. Add to that a grungy, poorly lit aesthetic and you might consider the film almost a carbon copy. But if you're going to copy a film, then copying one known for it's atmosphere of claustrophobic tension is not such a bad idea, and there's a lot of original detail in 'Pitch Black' as well, some of it good, other bits less so. For example, the central idea is of a spaceship crashing on planet bathed in near-permanent light, thanks to three suns; but on which, like a desert in the rain, all sorts of things come alive when (every twenty years or so) there's a solar eclipse. The three suns also provide three alternative colours of light (before the darkness strikes, of course), which allows director David Twohy three visions for the price of one; but he doesn't seem quite to know what to do with this gift, and while the colour of the world changes from yellow to blue to red, it's unclear what this adds to the film except for a superficial jumpiness. As for the indoor scenes, shot unfailing in half-light only, the use of semi-darkness as a cheap way of creating an air of menace has surely not been this overdone since David Fincher's 'Se7en'. As for the characterisation, the dynamics of a group whose members have their own selfish agendas are well portrayed, but the film lets itself down by making clear its sympathies for two crew members over the others, especially as the two characters it favours are essentially the least believable vin Diesel's super-criminal Riddick, and the unlikely babelicious ship's commander, played by Radha Mitchell. While the moral darkness of the plot's conclusion is offset by the willingness to grant vin Diesel corny, Schwarzenegger-style lines, usually involving at least one word starting with the letter 'f'. Another flaw is Twohy's exaggerated preference for constant cross-cutting between scenes, which sometimes increases the tension, but sometimes makes the film appear more like a pop video than a movie. He undoubtedly succeeds in capturing an interesting look, but only at the price of also acquiring a certain corollary shallowness.In conclusion, this certainly is not a wholly original film. But it looks good, and is plenty scary. Moreover, the whole somehow feels a little more distinctive than the individual parts. Still, one can't help but feel, this movie is just 'Alien' with better special effects, less judiciously used.

Going to boss Cliff Brumby, Carter gets CCTV footage of the bar on the fateful night and also makes a connection to his brother's lover Geraldine. However the more progress he makes the more attention he gets.Standing in the shadow of the original was always going to mean that this film was seen as a bad idea by a lot of people. Of course the film doesn't help itself by, remake or not, being lacklustre, predictable and plodding. Visually the film is actually pretty good and on this level alone I think that Kay should be able to churn out formulaic American action movies as well as anyone else. However in regards all other aspects of his delivery he cannot do much despite the fact that the basic story does have potential. It should have been tough, complex, emotional and engaging but on all fronts it falls down. The heart of the story is Doreen, but the film makes a mess of her relationship with Carter &#150; we never care about her and it hurts the film. This failure takes away from the impact the material could have made and left something that lacks heart and just feels like it was going through the motions for the majority of the time. Even in the area of being tough it fails it talks the talk but we never see anything or experience anything &#150; a fact shown all the way to the ending, which is indeed an act of cowardice and commercial fear if ever I saw one.The cast are partly to blame as well as Kay. Stallone does his usual stuff and his inability to give his character any personality at all means that the whole film just drags along with a big chunk of meat on the screen &#150; not a man. Cook tries hard but she doesn't convince and her key failing is the fact that she relates her rape as if it was an annoyance to her as opposed to an event that took her respect and her father. Richardson is a non-entity; Caine yet again proves that you can never have too much money, but it is annoying to see him lacking respect for his own work in this way. McGinley seems to be in a different film for the most part and is totally superfluous to requirements while Rourke, Cumming and others just read their lines and add little. Of course the main failing in the cast is the lifeless turn from Stallone who kills off the story before it has even begun.Overall a plodding and dull film that had potential with a good story but totally fails to deliver on it. Lacking an emotional impact, a genuine toughness, performances and audience involvement this is not awful but it is certainly nothing more than distracting and, to be honest, it probably won't even do that for many viewers.

As in Spartacus a lot of creative differences were aired and there was animosity, but the thing got made and got made well.The film Mister Roberts is the screen adaption of a play that ran on Broadway from 1948 to 1951 for 1157 performances. It was based on the novel written by Thomas Heggen and was directed by Joshua Logan. It marked a return to the stage for Henry Fonda who for the rest of his life shuttled back and forth between Broadway and Hollywood. Mister Roberts became his career signature part.According to the book In the Company of Heroes by Harry Carey, Jr., Henry Fonda because this was his signature part, the part that won him a Tony Award on Broadway, he had a certain proprietary interest in seeing a faithful adaption was done for the screen.John Ford however wanted to put his own individual stamp on the picture as he always does. Fonda and Ford had done six films together before 1948 and Fonda was a willing pupil. But after the acclaim he got for this play Fonda was no longer willing to respond to Ford's direction dutifully. This led to an ugly clash on set and Ford leaving the picture. The direction was taken over by Mervyn LeRoy officially, but Joshua Logan came over from Broadway and in the background Henry Fonda himself directed some of it.There are certainly enough Ford touches to recognize the film as a Ford product. But Fonda kept the essence of Doug Roberts as the average man doing a disagreeable task, serving as a buffer between the crew and the tyrannical captain. He makes life somewhat bearable for the crew of the cargo ship he's the executive officer. And like James Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life, Fonda also has to be shown just how important his contribution to the morale of that ship is.And what a boss they have. The role of the Captain is a very difficult part. Though there are certainly elements of comedy with the captain, James Cagney never allows the captain to become a figure of burlesque. It's a very difficult tightrope to walk, but Mr. Cagney brought over 30 years of professionalism to that part. During the scene of the cabin confrontation with Fonda, Cagney does go into his background, going to sea as a kid, doing a lot of menial jobs and rising through his own efforts in the Merchant Marine. We get to understand Cagney, but we never sympathize with him.Even though Mister Roberts is a military setting, the themes are universal and that is why I think it got the popular acclaim it did. I think most of us in our lives as workers have occasionally had to work in settings where the boss was a tin pot dictator, using and abusing his position of authority. And maybe we've also had immediate supervisors who did buffer between the employer and the workers. I'm sure that applied to just about anyone who ever had any kind of work history.What allows Cagney to become the little martinet that he's become is the fact that the cargo ship is in the backwater of the war. You do kind of wonder what might happen if the ship was ever a target of some Japanese submarines or airplanes. He and the man are bored, but he's in the position of authority. Mister Roberts is the only film I know that ever made boredom a component of a successful production.William Powell who was a player for over 40 years on stage and screen put a cap to his career as Doc, the ship's medical officer and confidante of Fonda. John Ford never met a doctor he didn't like and I'm sure that part might have attracted him to the play. From Arrowsmith to Stagecoach to Seven Women, Ford's doctors are all kinds of characters, but they are all wise and offer good counsel on all subjects, not necessarily medical. And the collaborative efforts of the creators netted for Jack Lemmon his first Oscar as the Best Supporting Actor of 1955. Lemmon is a nice man of admittedly limited character as Ensign Pulver. But his stay on the ship shows a dramatic growth in character as we see in the finale. The crew is populated by a mostly Ford stock company characters. In fact the only other player besides Fonda from the original Broadway production to repeat his part is Tige Andrews as one of the crew. It's with them that we see the real Ford touches. Note that horse whinny that Ward Bond uses when the visiting nurses led by Betsy Palmer come to the ship at Captain Lemmon's request.

And like James Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life, Fonda also has to be shown just how important his contribution to the morale of that ship is.And what a boss they have. The role of the Captain is a very difficult part. Though there are certainly elements of comedy with the captain, James Cagney never allows the captain to become a figure of burlesque. It's a very difficult tightrope to walk, but Mr. Cagney brought over 30 years of professionalism to that part. During the scene of the cabin confrontation with Fonda, Cagney does go into his background, going to sea as a kid, doing a lot of menial jobs and rising through his own efforts in the Merchant Marine. We get to understand Cagney, but we never sympathize with him.Even though Mister Roberts is a military setting, the themes are universal and that is why I think it got the popular acclaim it did. I think most of us in our lives as workers have occasionally had to work in settings where the boss was a tin pot dictator, using and abusing his position of authority. And maybe we've also had immediate supervisors who did buffer between the employer and the workers. I'm sure that applied to just about anyone who ever had any kind of work history.What allows Cagney to become the little martinet that he's become is the fact that the cargo ship is in the backwater of the war. You do kind of wonder what might happen if the ship was ever a target of some Japanese submarines or airplanes. He and the man are bored, but he's in the position of authority. Mister Roberts is the only film I know that ever made boredom a component of a successful production.William Powell who was a player for over 40 years on stage and screen put a cap to his career as Doc, the ship's medical officer and confidante of Fonda. John Ford never met a doctor he didn't like and I'm sure that part might have attracted him to the play. From Arrowsmith to Stagecoach to Seven Women, Ford's doctors are all kinds of characters, but they are all wise and offer good counsel on all subjects, not necessarily medical. And the collaborative efforts of the creators netted for Jack Lemmon his first Oscar as the Best Supporting Actor of 1955. Lemmon is a nice man of admittedly limited character as Ensign Pulver. But his stay on the ship shows a dramatic growth in character as we see in the finale. The crew is populated by a mostly Ford stock company characters. In fact the only other player besides Fonda from the original Broadway production to repeat his part is Tige Andrews as one of the crew. It's with them that we see the real Ford touches. Note that horse whinny that Ward Bond uses when the visiting nurses led by Betsy Palmer come to the ship at Captain Lemmon's request. Bond did the same thing in My Darling Clementine to a passing Linda Darnell.Despite a difficult birthing, Mister Roberts has become an American classic and will be so as long as we have a planet.

They're always going to harp on horrid failures that they praise as innovations (Hunchback, Pocohontas, Mulan). And they will never admit that the light-hearted, comedic Hercules was the big step in Disney's revolution concerning style and storyboarding in the past twenty years.Big deal; it's true.Herc was the first time Disney decided to run on fast, colorful frenzy and coy shots at the material instead of cutesy sidekicks alone for comedy. A direct predecessor to Emporor's New Groove? You better believe it.With a grecian style and a gospel swing, this film comes on strong with guns blazing and hardly stops for air. A little strong is the Oscar-winning song, Go the Distance, but I guess Micheal Bolton was flavor of the week then. What can't be ignored is how repeatedly watchable this film is, and that's important with kiddie fare, since parents must endure multiple viewings.This film does butcher its subject matter in a way nothing short of savage, it's true. No myth remains intact as the storyboard scrambles to include every monster ancient Greece had to offer, and it's sad to see Medusa, the minotaur and other greats fly by without so much as a by-line.Still in all, the mainstay of the film is the wry humor, and some very fun wordplay. If you want the myths straight, never go to Hollywood; even Harryhausen (otherwise known as The Man) cut-and-pasted mythology to suit his films.If there are spots where Herc lacks polish it's probably because the artists were rushing to finish it and work on Mulan, which is unthinkable when you see the products. Still that's the word I get directly from a former member of Disney. I met him in 2001, when he was working for dreamworks on Ice Age. He explained that Disney artists were awed by the deep, original ideas in Mulan, and considered Herc just another cartoon. Well, what can you say? He was all excited about Ice Age too.
