It's just that the story didn't interest me enough to make me want to see it more than once.  But I'm glad I saw it once and would recommend it to anybody else who likes PTA's stuff--Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love first and foremost.  Be forewarned--like Magnolia, it's over three hours long; unlike Magnolia, it's less of a pure character study and has a bit of a plot, so those who were bored by Magnolia might find this a little more palatable.Boogie Nights follows a young man's rise to porn stardom and subsequent fall.  PTA acknowledges in the DVD commentary that the movie is heavily influenced by and borrows from the life of the real porn star John Holmes, although the story as a whole is not a John Holmes biography.  In the first half of the movie, Marky Mark's character gets into porn and becomes a huge star.  In the second half, he does too much coke, gets full of himself, falls dramatically from his throne, and returns to those he rejected for redemption.  We follow the other characters in his little porn family through this story arc as they also peak and, to varying degrees, fall, and then come back together, their porn family ultimately intact.  Like all families, this one's defining characteristic is that it sticks together in spite of rifts and occasional tragedy.Like all of PTA's movies, this one is heavily character-oriented.  The movie is about things happening to people instead of people acting out a plot, if you get the distinction.Artistically, this movie is excellent.  I am repeatedly impressed by PTA's camera direction.  He loves to use long steadicam or handheld shots, and by long I mean maybe one to three minutes.  I think they're beautiful, innovative, and creative.  He also has a knack for making transitions through the use of the camera--a car containing one character drives down the road as the camera peels away to follow a car going the other way containing another character, for example.  I love these little touches.Overall, I give the movie a 3\/5 even though I probably wouldn't see it again.  I wouldn't be adverse to it, though... Well worth seeing once.

In 1993, not for the first time and not for the last, two films were created on exactly the same topic. In that year Holywood released the overly long and slightly infuriating Wyatt Earp staring Kevin Costner (again I'm just going to quickly plug Open Range which looks impressive from the trailers), but Holywood also released this film, Tombstone.In Tombstone, we're told by Robert Mitchum's narration about the Cowboys, an outlaw gang who control the area. This gang is recogniseable by the Red Sashes around it's members waists and when the film begins they run around doing basically exactly what they like. At this point enters the man of the hour, the legend Wyatt Earp. Earp arrives on a train with the plan of retiring and settling down with his brothers Morgan and Virgil and the three brothers wives. This peace doesn't last however and eventually Earp is forced to put his retirement on hold as he fights first unwillingly, and then for retribution.It's been a strange habit of mine over the last few months to praise practically every single film I've seen. Whilst there's been one or two I've heavily criticised, the vast majority of the time I'll talk about how wonderful a film is and generally describe it as either close to a masterpiece or a masterpiece itself. Well in this case I'm going to make a discerning effort not to. If anything I'm going to make an effort to actually condemn this film.In Tombstone, the key areas of Wyatt Earp are played out. We don't get to find out about his childhood or his earlier years and are forced to make do with only the action packed years around the town on which the film is named. This film contains a vast spectrum of talents ranging from Kurt Russell and the amazing Val Kilmer, through to cameo's from Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestley and  Billy Zane. Also we have outstanding performances as the leaders of the Cowboys by Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn. Despite this though, do we really have anyone with as charasmatic a figure as Kevin Costner (I am joking if you hadn't gathered).Ok, so far I'm not doing a good job at really condemning this film, but truthfully, why should I? Tombstone is just another of those modern Westerns which aims to mix a sense of realism in with a fantastic plot and an amazing cast. Add to this the special effects and you've got a hit. So it might not be worthy of a place anywhere near the Internet Movie Database Top 250, who cares.

The sponsors are a tough sell, nothing is going as planned, and everything is pure chaos, compounded by a mounting tally of murder victims.Radioland Murders is one of the noisiest and busiest live-action movies I've seen, literally wall-to-wall in every frame with rapid-fire slapstick and pratfalls, and it does not quite work as a comedy, but even as a comedy, it's breezy and pleasant in the face of its frenzied pace -- not unlike an old Warner Bros. cartoon of the Merrie Melodies variety.  Better, though, it works as a nostalgic notion of old-time radio.  The staggering gaps in logic and plot are meant to be ignored, as this is fantasy; it embraces the idea of radio in its heyday as the missing link between paperback adventures and television, requiring the listener's imagination to do half the work, while television requires none of it.  The movie amounts to what could likely be a 9-year old listener's visual projection of what he's hearing on the radio.It's technically dazzling, too, with the lens darting into rooms, out of windows and around the action becoming its own frenetic participant, and there's some breathtaking shots of the exterior of the station, often accentuating its height and distance from the city street far below.  Brian Benben and Mary Stuart Masterson might strike the same one or two chords throughout the movie, but they're likable, as is this movie.  And Scott Michael Campbell is very funny as Billy the pageboy, a kind of wide-eyed Quentin Tarantino of the radio age; fast-talking (everyone in the film is fast-talking, actually) and easily distracted (the look on his face as he accidentally barges into the ladies' dressing room and becomes mesmerized by the sight of the topless actresses is priceless), his entire grammar and understanding of life is derived from the radio shows of which he has encyclopedic knowledge.Finally, Radioland Murders closes with some wistfully ironic thoughts (the movie is mostly free of contemporary irony, with the exception of this and an unsuccessful line about warning labels on cigarette packs) about television (best summed up by three uniformed cops hypnotized by a cathode ray tube) and the immortality of radio.  A movie more about myth than story, Radioland Murders is written in the scattershot style of the radio programs depicted.

Sixteen candles is more of a pure teen-comedy with a big house party followed by a hangover-morning, and Breakfast Club is the most serious one and, as far as I'm concerned, the most distinctive of the Brat-pack movies.Breakfast Club is the one I like the most, but Pretty in pink is also a very good movie. Molly plays (as always) a very unusual girl who lives with her lazy but very caring father (Harry Dean Stanton). She has only two real friends and one of them is a guy called Duckie. Duckie is kind of a geek and Jon Cryer does this part so good you don't even miss Anthony Michael Hall a bit. Molly also works in a record store owned by her other friend played by Annie Potts. Molly falls in love with a rich and popular guy (McCarthey) who has mutual feelings. The story is very cliché with a rich guy and a poor girl from two opposite sides of society who falls in love, causing disappointments among their old friends. Duckie is really hurt and McCarthey's best friend tells him to drop Molly, mostly caused by jealousy in this case. This jealous friend is played by James Spader and he is very good at playing bad. The cliché's are told with charm and intelligence though (like Mischief) and some scenes almost brings tears to the eyes. (I wonder if the movie would have been even better if Hughes had directed it himself!?) Anyway, it's a sweet story with many wonderful actors typical of the 80s. Remember to look for a very young and very gorgeous Gina Gershon as a High School girl. The only thing I miss is a great song or two, like the ones in Sixteen candles and Breakfast club. Otherwise if you're crazy like me about the movies from the 80s I see no reason to skip this one. This movie also has one of the most clever titles ever.

It must, however, have been planned well in advance and was presumably not actually intended as anti-Clinton satire, but that is how it tends to come across today.`Wag the Dog' is another film that proves to have been unintentionally prophetic. Shortly before an election, the President is embroiled in a potentially explosive sex scandal which threatens to end his presidency in disgrace. In order to distract the public's attention, his advisers concoct a wholly fictitious military crisis in the Balkans and hire a Hollywood producer to provide the necessary harrowing footage of war scenes. When the Albanian government protest that their country is not in fact at war, the aides present this as a triumph of American diplomacy that has averted the threatened crisis, and, in order to keep the affair in the public's mind, concoct a further sub-plot involving a supposed military hero (in real life a convicted rapist in a military prison) held prisoner by a rebel faction.All of this may seem very familiar, but bear in mind that this film was made in 1997, two years before President Clinton, faced with a potentially explosive sex scandal which for a time threatened to end his presidency in disgrace, took America to war over a crisis in the Balkans. At least he didn't need to concoct a fictitious war. The parallels with the more recent Iraq war are perhaps less exact, although the scenes involving the supposed hero `Old Shoe' were strongly reminiscent of the ballyhoo surrounding Private Jessica Lynch.Like `Being There', `Wag the Dog' is not, of course, a work of social realism. In real life, a simpleton like Chance could not become President without being found out, and no administration could actually get away with inventing a bogus war. (That's why they have to provide real ones).  In order to make a satirical point, both films exaggerate prevalent tendencies in modern political life. `Being There', among other things, is about self-deception- Chance never pretends to be anything he is not, but those around him deceive themselves by seeing him as what they want him to be. `Wag the Dog', on the other hand, is about political `spin' and the deliberate deception of the public. Politicians try and deceive as many of the people for as much of the time as they think they can get away with, and the media will go along with such deception for as long as it is in their interest.`Wag the Dog' has some sharp points to make, and there is a very good performance from Dustin Hoffman as the Hollywood producer Stanley Motss. Motss is recognisably suffering from status anxiety in its most acute form- the form that afflicts the brilliantly successful and wealthy man who still feels undervalued by society and will do anything, however unethical or even dangerous to his own safety, to win public recognition. (He complains that there is no Academy Award specifically for producers, ignoring the fact that one is not needed because the producer traditionally receives the Best Picture award).Despite that, however, I felt that the film as a whole was not as sharp or as funny as it could have been. I think the reason is that it is basically a one-joke film; once the war story has been exploded, the plot tends to lose direction. The idea of concocting a wholly bogus war is a brilliantly surreal satirical conceit; the idea of concocting a bogus hostage drama, although more inherently plausible, lacks the same inventiveness, so the `Old Shoe' scenes come as something of an anti-climax after what has gone before. I felt that Robert de Niro as the presidential aide Conrad Brean was less effective than Hoffman; I have never thought that comedy is his forte and that he is at his best in serious roles. (I may be judging unfairly, as there are several of his comedies that I have not seen). I also felt that it was a mistake not to show the President in the film- this may not be a realistic film, but the idea that a spin doctor could create a fictitious war without even the President being aware of what is going on strains credibility past its limits. Moreover, as we found out with Nixon and his attempted cover-up of the Watergate affair, the culture of spin involves our elected leaders themselves, not just members of their staff.

Everybody should watch this movie, at the very least to have a look at the atmosphere and at the gothic, phantasmagorical and yet oddly bright light set around. Useless to say, it's a Tim Burton film, therefore this fact should not be too surprising, but still...(well, he's lucky, the progress of technique helps him out, that's quite clear). I love Burton's style. Maybe his way of telling stories is not very orthodox, in fact the plot of Sleepy Hollow is not always clear, but the magic is there anyway. Also, it is funny that he is classified as a horror film maker, when in fact it would be quite difficult to get creeps from any of his films. Everything in this tale is unbelievable, from the begining to its very end, and I mean it nothing fits at all, it dances between a comedy and an umbalanced terror film and the music is too romantic to thrill anyone. But that's one of the nice points why should it fit anyway? It is alright like that. Burton's jokes are funny, and, which is even better, are intellingent, shinny and beautiful. To look at the images is like going through a Friedrich's painture. It also has something of the old, forsaken beauty of Murnau. The actors look great in this big confusing weirdness. Well, not as if Depp and Ricci were bad actors! but they really do their job here; specially Ricci with her strange and slightly malicious innocent look is able to confuse the viewer until the end...which I'm not gonna tell you, basically because it is quite obvious. And you'll find Christopher Lee and Lise Marie around...you just have to seek for them. Jewels within jewels. Oh, and another note...why is the blood so red? This I never understood. It annoyed me a bit it definetly didn't fit with the general setting. But, nobody is perfect I guess.

For that reason, I can understand why Falcon has a better reputation; it's a remarkable study in sleaze, and not a single character is above reproach.  Yet I'm more of a Big Sleep kind of guy; I like a nice hero.  Marlowe is a little shady and grumpy, perhaps, but he means well.  He even gets a very human moment of fear when his hand shakes during the final confrontation.  Unlike Sam Spade, he's not a mystery to the audience, but an open-book type whom you can root for with a clearer conscience.  This film is more Hollywoodized and accessible than The Maltese Falcon in several other respects.  Sexy babes abound here; every few seconds, another gorgeous woman pops out of the woodwork.  The pacing is much faster than Falcon, and while that helps sustain interest, it also means that certain plot elements are glossed over and obscured.  And yet, I still prefer the style of The Big Sleep.  I don't necessarily need realism or grimness to carry a detective story; in fact, this film's glib and sexy tone is more in keeping with my image of the genre than The Maltese Falcon.  At the end of the day, this film is simply faster and more fun, and I can relate to the protagonist more closely.   So, my somewhat flippant summary line actually disguises a deep admiration for this film!  This is about as much fun as you can have with a hoary old classic.  By the way, for my money, the theatrical cut is better than the original (boring) version.  Even with the D.A. scene added, the plot is still confusing, so I'll take a faster pace and some extra flirting instead.

That year, audiences and movie history were blessed with the classic THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Tarantino's milestone of cinema, PULP FICTION, Stone's own landmark Tarantino adaptation, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, the much loved FORREST GUMP, and many other good movies. Then there's stuff like DISCLOSURE, no... that's unfair. Very little Hollywood fluff gets as bad as DISCLOSURE. There were other bad movies released in 1994, but they were the safe, normal bad movies we've come to expect.DISCLOSURE dares you to enter the terrifying cut-throat business world in which bad dialogue runs rampant, characters appear in cartoonish clarity or linger blurred in the background, and all dramatic points are rendered in stark black and white.If I hadn't seen a little cheapie shot-on-video horror movie called HELLSPAWN, I'd call DISCLOSURE the worst movie of its year. The packaging looked intriguing at first we have the usually respectable Michael Douglas, the talented Demi Moore, and the once respectable Barry Levinson. Then there's that whole roles-reversed sexual-harassment thing. It sounded like a neat idea at first, but they brought it off as some cheesy thriller complete with bad suspense and a hero who is constantly accidentally implicating himself. It's like FATAL ATTRACTION plus crap.In short, it's about a guy (Douglas) being sexually harassed at the workplace by his superior, and ex-lover (Moore). Nobody believes him because guys generally like girls coming onto them  even when they're married (if the film was good it might have dispelled this sexist stereotype). The matter gets legal and things complicate.Now, we've seen hundreds of these bad thrillers, but DISCLOSURE isn't satisfied with being a regular old bad thriller. Instead, Demi Moore, Donald Sutherland, Michael Douglas, and probably the entire supporting cast are entangled in some kind of shady deal involving technology and the manufacture of microchips overseas. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't result in supposedly important techno-babble about the technologies for which they obviously failed to consult a technical advisor. That isn't the worst of it either. The real stinker of this flick is the virtual reality scene. Michael Douglas puts on the virtual reality goggles to uncover footage exposing corporate black-ops, only to find a cheesy 2D icon of Demi Moore deleting his files with what looks like a laser-beam (Ha! Ha!). And then comes the computer-geek with angel wings and a halo, trying to warn Douglas while still in virtual reality. The scene inspires one to say out loud What the F***?Meanwhile in reality, Douglas has a wife who doesn't trust him, people in his office shifting loyalties, accusations- the whole deal. None of it is interesting, and you can see the twists coming a mile around the corner. Levinson renders it all very dull, taking no steps to save the picture from its script. Levinson even fails to put the beautiful Seattle locales to the proper use. I think this one really unmasked him as a bad director (after all, how good was RAIN MAN, really?). DISCLOSURE is a bad 80s concept trying to squeeze into the newly forged 90s in all the wrong ways.The final result is truly inexcusable. DISCLOSURE should only be watched for laughs, and even then, only out of severe boredom. For a good suspense\/thriller involving a domineering woman and sex, see PLAY MISTY FOR ME.

To see what I mean, it is enough to compare this movie with a vastly superior one Blade Runner. In that movie, replicants are not programmed to feel love, pity, sorrow or rage about injustice, but they develop these feelings spontaneously and mysteriously. As a matter of fact, these human feelings render the replicants not only unusable but dangerous, and hence, they have to be eliminated. Blade Runner is about what makes humans human if androids can have feelings that are real and not planned, if they have memories, if they can appreciate beauty, if they have a will of their own, aren't they human? Isn't destroying them murder? In A.I., there is never a question of David being human he is nothing but a machine that smartly apes a real loving boy. The boy robot has a chip or whatever it is that programs him to feel `love,' being such `love,' if correctly interpreted (something the movie does not do), not real love, but an unhealthy fixation. A real boy who developed such an obsession with his own mother would be a Norman Bates in the making. Unlike Blade Runner, where we empathize naturally with the replicants, it is impossible to feel anything but irritation, at best, and horror, at worst, for David, and, indeed, it is easier to pity the bad mother who wouldn't be unnerved by such unblinking adoration? (and unblinking it is; Spielberg erased Osment's blinking, apparently not realizing that a blinking robot would have been more lifelike and therefore, more useful to its purpose, to replace a real boy. Apparently, it was Osment who suggested the unblinking thing. Now, this is what happens when you listen to child actors instead of your own judgment). That's not the way the movie thinks, however. It assumes that this pre-packaged, superficial feeling is the real deal, which is rather disturbing.As a matter of fact, just like David, A.I. is a movie that wants to be what it is not. It wants to be profound and philosophical (we know that because from time to time some character, or the voiceover narration, says something sententious). Spielberg's unquestioning admiration for Disney has already landed him in trouble in some of his other movies, but never as devastatingly as in this one.

In that movie, replicants are not programmed to feel love, pity, sorrow or rage about injustice, but they develop these feelings spontaneously and mysteriously. As a matter of fact, these human feelings render the replicants not only unusable but dangerous, and hence, they have to be eliminated. Blade Runner is about what makes humans human if androids can have feelings that are real and not planned, if they have memories, if they can appreciate beauty, if they have a will of their own, aren't they human? Isn't destroying them murder? In A.I., there is never a question of David being human he is nothing but a machine that smartly apes a real loving boy. The boy robot has a chip or whatever it is that programs him to feel `love,' being such `love,' if correctly interpreted (something the movie does not do), not real love, but an unhealthy fixation. A real boy who developed such an obsession with his own mother would be a Norman Bates in the making. Unlike Blade Runner, where we empathize naturally with the replicants, it is impossible to feel anything but irritation, at best, and horror, at worst, for David, and, indeed, it is easier to pity the bad mother who wouldn't be unnerved by such unblinking adoration? (and unblinking it is; Spielberg erased Osment's blinking, apparently not realizing that a blinking robot would have been more lifelike and therefore, more useful to its purpose, to replace a real boy. Apparently, it was Osment who suggested the unblinking thing. Now, this is what happens when you listen to child actors instead of your own judgment). That's not the way the movie thinks, however. It assumes that this pre-packaged, superficial feeling is the real deal, which is rather disturbing.As a matter of fact, just like David, A.I. is a movie that wants to be what it is not. It wants to be profound and philosophical (we know that because from time to time some character, or the voiceover narration, says something sententious). Spielberg's unquestioning admiration for Disney has already landed him in trouble in some of his other movies, but never as devastatingly as in this one. Any hope to take the movie seriously is dashed by cartoonish stuff like the Dr. Know or the Blue Fairy, and by the sickening sentimentality that clogs the whole movie and reaches its peak in the completely stupid ending. I spent the last half-hour or so gaping at the screen, and I mean that literally. I felt (and probably looked) like the audience watching the Hitler musical in the movie `The Producers.' I was so nonplussed at the nerve of someone ending a movie in such a ridiculous fashion, I could not even feel rightfully angry as I should.All things spoken, I did like Teddy. I wish I had one of these. But then, of course, when the only thing in a movie that keeps you minimally interested is a talking teddy bear, the movie in question is really in deep trouble.

I went anyway, as this one was hard to avoid, you might say. I found the story on the ship quite annoying, tailored with shallowness, and aimed smack-dab at the Blockbuster potential Teenagers.I was disappointed by the depiction of a romance that would have NEVER happened in 1912. A young woman masquerading as a socialite? Becoming interested in (and getting naked for) a steerage passenger? Sleeping with him on the ship? Flipping the bird and spitting? Really? in 1912 ??? Wow, James, you have quite an imagination.Technically, the film is hard to fault, but it just seems to lack in suspense. There are some fake looking computer generated moments. The most serious flaw - how anyone could spend 3 minutes (never mind 30 minutes in the film) - in freezing seawater in the bowels of the ship, and somehow make it all the way to the stern to jump off? COME ON! I would encourage those who share my views to check out these two classics insteadA Night to Remember (1958) A definitive British minute-by-minute docudrama that has rightly stood the test of time. Titanic (1953) A great Hollywood version (the OLD Hollywood) which I could not even find a mention in these reviews. It did a superb job of depicting a troubled and ultimately doomed romance on the great ship. I can actually say this version puts you on the ship more than the 1997 version. It featured a great story, believable characters (unlike this version) played to perfection by some of Hollywood's best. Not to mention an unforgettably sad Father-Son moment at the end. It featured special effects way ahead of their time, which still look pretty impressive today. But it is literally forgotten, save for a 'Studio Classics' DVD release. It certainly makes me wonder why Cameron needed to spend a gazillion dollars on SFX, put in such a LAME unbelievable story, and get more awards than the 1953 version. Those who get anal about some of the technical details on the earlier films (such as for instance the ship not breaking in half) seem to miss the point. This Titanic must have caught the Academy sleeping.

The film is beautifully photographed, and like 'Lawrence', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war.  The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas.  The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy  - the titular character.  The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what unfolds. He has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers.       The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. If you're a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'The English Patient' speaks directly to you.
