This film is a drama which demonstrates the psychological elements inside a maximum security institution for the criminally insane. Or does it? While the story is quite contrived, the drama a bit anti-climactic, and the dialog sometimes choppy and poorly-delivered, the overall work is far above the current critic's estimation.Anthony Hopkins is exemplary as the angry mental patient who is enamored with gorillas (don't ask, it's actually interesting, once you get into the story), and delivers a stellar performance. While his character is not given the same love as is Hannibal Lecter, Hopkins still contributes a good portion of his talents herein.All in all, while it's not Friday night fare, there is still something here worth seeing.It rates a 7.7\/10 from...the Fiend .

Daniel Kaffee What's special, or even topical, about this movie is it speaks to how military honor can be so readily suborned by the authoritarian impulse. And second, how the same honest pride&#151;not to mention competence&#151;is necessary to bring such posturing would-be tyrants to justice. No, Im not going to launch into another angled criticism of the Bushoviks; but the facts are apropos in the name of a notion of high-minded military protection the Cheney-Bush Oil Junta (CBOJ) performs criminal acts of the highest, deadliest, and most treasonable nature.CBOJ's acts are much worse in scale than what Colonel Nathan Jessep (Jack Nicholson in an Academy Award-winning role) is ultimately accused of, which is ordering a Code Red that winds up killing a Marine in his barracks on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (Gitmo). But what he's accused of is of the same essence, bred of the same perverse conceit of absolute power. This movie originates from a stage play of the same name by the same author, and it's based on actual events. A young, Judge Advocate General Corps (JAG) Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) intends to coast thru his service time playing softball and pleading cases (so they don't have to go to trial). Nonetheless, his higher ups select him to defend two Marines charged with a hazing death at Gitmo. It's an important case to Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore), who feels many of the explanations don't add up. Though an attorney with an elevated position in what is the Navy's version of internal affairs, she lacks the confidence and acumen of Kaffee&#151;son of a famous trial attorney who had a decorated career in the Marines. Kaffee is supremely capable as a trial attorney, yet is immature, hiding a deep anxiety that he can never measure up to his late father. This is the basis for character development as the plot moves forward. Lt. Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) is appointed to assist Kaffee, and provide a nice comic balance to the grueling Marine Corps gravitas.The three attorneys travel to Gitmo, interview several officers and enlisted men Jessep, his CO Lt. Col. Matthew Andrew Markins (J.T. Walsh), and Jessep's true henchman on the base Lt. Jonathan Kendricks (Kiefer Sutherland).......For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 May 2007","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Harold, you don't need to wear a patch on your arm to have honor. &#151; Lt.
