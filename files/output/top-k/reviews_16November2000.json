The other two, Sue and Fiona, were both great and about the most depressing things you could watch (Sue, in fact, is a masterpiece). So I was curious to see where Kollek was going to go with this, a more light-hearted, and even comic romance.  Of course, we aren't talking Sleepless in Seattle here, thank goodness.  I have to say that while I was watching the movie, there were times whenI shook my head and said to myself, this is bad or that's ridiculous.  In fact, this film had many more flaws and awkward scenes than Kollek's earlier work.  But at the same time, after it was all over and I was walking home, I really felt like I had seen something special.I can't explain why exactly, but one thing that was surprising is that Anna Thomson's character, while the driving force in the previous films, was comparatively dull and uninspiring and underdeveloped here.  Her love interest, even moreso.  But this film was buoyed by a secondary romance plot involving two 60-somethings fumbling their ways into some sort of relationship.  Louise Lasser Louise Lasser, hehe, making a comeback of sorts in recent years (Happiness), was just wonderful.  Her partner (was it Robert Modicka?) was also off-the-map charming.  If I have one complaint, there wasn't enough time in the film devoted to this burgeoning romance. There is one scene involving the two that is about as tender as anything i've ever seen on the big screen.  It's nice to see good love stories about middle-aged people and above and they show that often the actors, perhaps due to more experience acting, pull it off much better than most of the young and the beautiful.In sum, another winner for Kollek and Thomson, and I just wonder when, if ever, Thomson will become a star in the states (she is quite popular in France).  I kind of hope she doesn't, but that's out of my own selfishness to see her in more of these kinds of films as opposed to the inevitable lure to make the big money in the bad movies.

Essentially a character study, the story is a glimpse into the lives of three people  Willie (John Lurie); his cousin, Eva (Eszter Balint), recently arrived in New York from Hungary; and Willie's friend, Eddie (Richard Edson).  After a couple of weeks in the Big Apple with Willie, Eva moves to Cleveland to live with their Aunt; a year later, Willie and Eddie are off to visit her.  One thing leads to another, and the trio wind up in Florida (the designated paradise of the title).  Watching this film is like spending time with some people you know; the characters are real people, so much so that watching them becomes almost voyeuristic, the camera somehow intrusive, exposing as it does the private lives of these individuals.  It succinctly captures their lack of ambition, the ambiguity with which they approach life, and the fact that they seemingly have no prospects for the future beyond whatever a lucky day at the track affords them.  The action, such as it is, is no more than what you would find in the average day of someone's life.  The dialogue is what drives the film, though frankly, nothing they have to say is very interesting.  And yet, this is an absolutely engrossing film; sometimes amusing, at times hilarious, but  mesmerizing throughout.   \tThe performances are entirely credible, and again, you never have the sense that these are actors, but rather real people who happen to have had some moments from their lives filmed and presented to the audience for perusal.  Jarmusch has an innate sense of capturing the essence of the everyday and transforming the most simplistic and mundane events into refreshingly documented, worthwhile viewing.  It's an inspired piece of film making, helped to some extent by the stark black&white photography that adds to the realism of the overall proceedings.  The use of brief blackouts during transitions works effectively, as well as providing the film with a unique signature.  Original music is by Lurie, but the highlight is the use of the song `I Put A Spell On You,' by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, used recurringly throughout the movie, and which exemplifies that special touch Jarmusch brings to his projects.  And there's a superb bit of irony at the end that really makes this gem sparkle.  \t\t\tThe supporting cast includes Cecillia Stark (Aunt Lotte), Danny Rosen (Billy), Tom DiCillo (Airline Agent), Richard Boes (Factory Worker) and Rockets Redglare, Harvey Perr and Brian J.

Looking back, that seemed like a pretty lame way to comment on RoboCop, my favorite movie of all time.  I hereby present the following, more relevant reviewHow can your favorite movie be RoboCop? I get that question a lot now, it seems. I'm not sure I want to write some kind of terribly detailed explanation of why this is my favorite movie of all time. Quite simply, everything in the movie works for me. To therefore try to explain what I like about the movie would equate to me writing about why a joke is funny when someone didn't get it. However, I'll give an effort here.I'll go ahead and state two main reasons on why I like the movie that most other fans of the movie probably didn't already state, such as the notion that it is a great satire of the corporatization of America, that it is ultra-violent and therefore cool, or that it works great as a bleak near-future sci-fi comedy. I didn't really dwell on those things when I saw this movie the first few times. So what did I like about it? SPOILER ALERT First of all, it is an extreme movie, but unlike many movies the extremeness works in this case. I felt the lowest point of disgust, the most uncomfortable fear, the highest thrills of triumph, moments of sadness, and moments of hilarity. The execution of Alex Murphy is one of the most horrifying things I had ever seen. I felt sooooo bad because of what happened, but this was brilliant on the part of the filmmakers because it made RoboCop that much more fun to root for, and it made his revenge that much sweeter. RoboCop then exists to counter all the woes we can experience. One very scary scene to me is the one where Emil threatens the college boy at the gas station (for anyone who's ever been behind the counter in a store, this scenario is dreadful!). It's even scarier than the scene where the armed robber holds up the mom and pop store, because in the other scene you know what Emil is capable of. Anyway, in both cases, out comes RoboCop to put the fear back in to the criminal. Elsewhere, RoboCop experiences deep loss because he has lost his past life, and for him to slowly realize that was very sad to me; he slowly finds out that he has lost his life and has been turned into a programmed robot. The scene where he revisits his house really made me sad; no one else gets a chance to come back from the dead and see what has happened since he had died and what he has lost because of it, and no one ever should. Therefore it's another joy to watch him triumph beyond that as well, as he starts to regain some semblance of free will and identity (and, thus, end the movie on a high note when he answers the question of What's your name? with a self-assured Murphy.). Add to that the satirical humor littered throughout the movie (the corporate cutthroats, the stupid I'd buy that for a dollar! guy, the news briefs), and it's got all the ingredients to touch every emotion anger, pity, elation, laughter.Second of all, to put it quite simply RoboCop is just plain cool! I loved comic book-style heroes, but to me RoboCop was the ultimate comic book hero. He's a cyborg, and he doesn't look cheesy, he looks slick (having become a fan of Transformers and RoboTech, a cyborg could easily get on my good side). He's got a huge gun that he can holster in his leg. He has great comic hero lines (Your move, creep! Dead or alive, you're coming with me. Come quietly or there will be... trouble.). And best of all, he's practically invulnerable! Poor helpless Murphy gets wasted by one of the most evil gangs of villains you've ever seen; they toy with him and laugh at his slaying. Then he comes back and they can't touch him. In the cocaine factory, he takes them all out, one shot at a time. He throws Clarence Boddicker (to me, the most evil slimeball villain ever; hats off to Kurtwood Smith!) through several windows and barely holds back from strangling him... with ease. The bad guys can't stop him, and in the final showdown, they come somewhat close, but you always know that they don't really have a chance. And these bad guys get it but good in the end. Of course, the worst is Emil's toxic waste death. How many murderers would you like to see get taken out like that? Anyhow, I loved RoboCop as a comic hero and a movie hero. Because you know what happened to him, you root for him all the way, from the moment he is being built to his final showdowns with Clarence and Dick Jones.So many other things are cool in the movie how RoboCop takes out the rapist, the stop-motion ED-209, the little goofy commercials, the supporting cast which includes Murphy's partner Lewis, Sgt. Reed, RoboCop creator Bob Morton (go Miguel Ferrer, another actor whose specialty is slimeballs!). This is a spectacular entry into sci-fi, and was every much as big in the '80's as other sci-fi greats like Aliens, Terminator, and Predator. But in those movies, the good guys were always disadvantaged. Not so with RoboCop. Go Robo!

Shackleton fans won't be disappointed and those who've never heard of Shackleton will be converted. Thank you George Butler.

Total RecallThe crew getting picked off one-by-one is The Dirty Dozen, Predator and how many others.The guy who runs off gets killed - Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Lost Ark and scads more.The guy gets the girl - ten thousand movies.At the end, I thought that perhaps the bug might come out of Val Kilmer's mouth just after the CPR appeared to be successful or that the cockroaches would defoliate Earth, but no such Oh, S**t surprise, instead, the credits rolled.And in case you think I liked the movie, no one, and I mean no one, is going to sing Nineteenth Nervous Breakdown as they are wounded, low on air and yomping towards an uncertain horizon.  They are going to sing Men of Harlech, Long way to Tipperary or their college fight song.Rent Total Recall instead.Brewski-2  ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"16 November 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  The earlier reviewer djnichols hit the same point that hit me I wish that plagarism was a crime (or at least painful).Some SPOILER stuff to follow...Just about every device in this film was used before.  Why does the only spaceship in space need anti-collision blinking red lights? (Star Trek(s), Lost in Space, etc.)  The spinning centrifuge supposedly creates the gravity, but we never see the curved floors as in 2001.  In fact we see flat floors as Terence Stamp pedagogues to Val Kilmer.  And when the gravity kicks on it does not come on slowly as the centrifuges begin to spin again, rather it comes on like a lightswitch.  If (instead) the gravity is magnetic, then why is glass held in place?Why do the flashbacks have to be scenes we already saw?  The movie isn't that long.OK, so the Mother Ship gets hit and the crew has to bail out in the landing craft - Starship Troopers did it better.When the landing craft hits and rolls (based on actual science) you get the best special effect - however the we're safe - no we're not was done better in The Abyss. (The crane's on its' way down to you)Carrie AM was great but no professional female officer is going to stand naked, arms akimbo, and give one of her troops an eyeful.  If this was a seduction attempt on her part, OK, but, obviously it wasn't.  Seeing the naked back and side of breast is another Oh, heck, I could see that on NYPD Blue rip-off.  Carrie AM working braless in a tank-top, oh, lemme think, Alien? Aliens?  Carrie AM does CPR from the 60s (precordial thump a la George C. Scott in The Hospital) and w\/o the breaths.  Hooking her feet under the girder was at least an attempt at reality.And we are to believe that this crew hits Mars w\/o a sensor for oxygen or CO or CO2 levels?  They did not have to pull out tricorders but, you mean to tell me that they do not have one sensor until Hey, lookee here, I can breathe. Puhleeeeze.Killer cockroaches was done using plastic bugs in Damnation Alley and CG in The Mummy.  The bug coming out of the mouth was in The Abyss.Supposedly these bugs destroyed the modular home, with some assistance from the wind.  Was that it?  Then who threw the girders fifty feet away? Ripped and shredded foil - OK, but heavy steel torn as if a bomb went off?  Help me on this one.AMEE was a great concept but no one is going to leave a military mode in a service robot.  That's like leaving Spitting Cobras in a day care center. Lost in Space (TV and movie) used the robot turned against us device as was Hal in 2001.  The final showdown with AMEE was right out of Aliens with our hero whipping a coup de grace on the attacker.  But hey, learn from Terminator - how does a measly punch and fire destroy this battle-droid? At least Val Kilmer did not call AMEE bitch.  Then the remote sensor (see Empire Strikes Back, or the TV dud Viper) hits like a mortar round and Kilmer is unscathed.  Then he pulls out the battery that just happens to be the right voltage and amperage for an ancient Russian (Soviet?) craft that has full-color Misha the Bear indicators for low battery.  Yeah, sure, right.AMEE was (seriously now) very eerie and scary as she moved like a jungle cat but the squinting eye and kung-fu stance made her lose all credibility.Mars has ice.
