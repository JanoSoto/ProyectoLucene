He is also a master at suspending disbelief to better enjoy a film. I came into this movie with no preconceived ideas as to how it would turn out or how it was going to be. It was one of the most suspenseful films I have ever seen and at times, truly convincing.Without discussing the plot too much, it invokes the idea that anyone we meet anywhere could be a murderer. It makes us question our own moral views and ask ourselves Have I ever wanted to commit a murder? Of course, most of us do not follow through with it, but without a doubt all of us have thought about it. That's what this movie did for me. It made me question myself and those around me. Not to the point of paranoia, but just as an interesting and disturbing thought.Farley Granger stars as Guy Haines, a famous tennis player and a man on the verge of a divorce. One day, while riding the train he meets a stranger, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) who recognizes Guy and initiates a conversation with him. Bruno seems genuinely intrigued by Guy and it is this moment on the train that is really one of the greatest scenes I've seen in any film. It's the way Bruno looks and acts around Guy that makes it what it is. He seems interested yet almost a little too personal - you get the feeling he is a little obsessive about Guy Haines and his life. As the story unfolds, we begin to see that is indeed only putting it mildly. Alfred Hitchcock is a master of suspense, but also a master of suspending disbelief. I was drawn into the story from the first frame and there is not a single moment that keeps the story moving - relentlessly like a train. The climatic ending seemed rushed and in my opinion could have been done better, but you be the judge of that. No doubt it was rushed (you'll know what I mean), but it was a bit over the top. You just have to take the ending for what it is and draw your own conclusions on some things, but it will undoubtedly leave you shocked. Strangers on a Train is one of the great cat-and-mouse thrillers in cinematic history.

The film captures you from start to finish as Corso (Jonny Depp) evolves from money hungry book dealer to Lucifers chosen. As a believer in God myself (And as someone who will always have hope that there are ancient, other-worldly, supernatural things in this world) I found this film to be not only fascinating and thought gripping, but also dark and terrifying. For example, when Corso gives the girl (Emmanuelle Seigner) some ice for her neck after the confrontation by the water and she takes off his glasses, Corso looks deeply into her eyes and notices for the first time something that could be considered other worldly or supernatural (he doesn't see her float down the steps during the fight). After re-watching the film over again with Polanskis commentary, I can see why that scene was his favorite. There is something remarkably sexy and terrifying about Emmanuelles character as her eyes glow, and as she places her blood on his forehead you can't help but realize thats she's marking Corso for something greater. During the course of the film it is slowly made apparent that Corsos strange companion the girl is the incarnation of Lucifer himself, or at least his servant. This is only made more apparent during the sex scene in front of the burning castle, for you see her face constantly shift from that of a stunningly beautiful woman to the frightening smile of something dark and malevolent. One reviewer on here wrote something I really liked (I apologize ahead of time for not remembering anyone that I mentions name, but you know who you are and I thank you for being awesome!). They wrote about the girl being the whore of Babylon which is who I thought she was the first time around (and still do).

Not only is Indy on good form, Spielberg is also on great form and together it creates a movie that is entertaining and enjoyable. The film also may not have as much adventure as say Raiders or Last Crusade but in any case it is good fun and an addition I don't mind.Harrison Ford continues to be in good shape for the films, he doesn't do any worse than he did in Raiders, maybe there is a little less action from him but in any case his humour and adventurous spirit is acted out well. Kate Capshaw as Willie is well, quite a bit annoying, I mean the acting isn't bad(but not great really) it is just the constant screaming and moaning can really get on your nerves. The addition of the young man that is Short Round(Jonathan Ke Quan) is a good one, some may argue he is a little annoying which he can be but he creates a certain lighter tone among the more dark things going on.No matter what Spielberg may think of this movie, I for one found it to be well done by him and one that should be a movie to be proud of. Without Lawrence Kasdan you may think the script would be poor and not a good example of writing in Indiana Jones movies, but for me Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz create something that is fine, not perfect by any means but it at least forms a nice basis for the entire picture.Don't get me wrong here, Temple of Doom can have its fairly dull moments and points maybe of negativity. The pacing of the film is just a little off, sometimes you can have all out action then none at all and even the thrills disappear then reappear out of nowhere, this is truly a film that moves fast and slow in its story. Of course with just under two hours of a movie you can't just sit around all of the time but I admit I found the middle parts to be slightly duller than say the beginning and end but all in all it is a solidly put together piece.One thing I found this movie is underrated for is actually the darkness it holds, sure people then and some people even now find it a little too dark but in truth I feel that is what makes it different. Of course the film is not realistic(I mean come on) but what it does do is bring a more realistic kind of tone to if what was going on were real, this is how it would be done, with blood and all. I personally didn't find it too dark, I admit like others also think that the treatment of Indian culture and faith is not exactly spot on here although I never found it to be overly horrible, just maybe don't claim Indians eat monkey heads and snakes for their dinner.

All I have to say at this point is I watched all three as a kid and this one is the one I remember the least and looking back I know why... It succumbs to almost every 90's cliché at the time.The plot is that Jeff Goldblum has been ridiculed by society because he is the only character out of the first movie that tells anyone (which is out of character for... hmm let's see - EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE FILM!) Being a crackpot Hammond tells him that there's another island and he's sent an expedition to show the world that the dinosaurs are harmless so long as nobody goes near it, and he managed to talk Goldblum's girlfriend into it and she manages to leave without him knowing. Okay, then they get there and document but soon poachers come to take the animals away from the island. Why? Because a businessman that works with Hammond thought it would be a good idea to fulfill his dreams and re-open the park but instead of a remote location that killed 5 people in the first movie - changed to the middle of a city with even more people! When leaving they find out that (Shock, gasp!) something's gone wrong and a T-Rex is rampaging.The plot is much stupider this time. I really would have loved to hear the businessman out into why he's re-opening a park that killed 5 people before opening and moving it to an even more densely populated area, and being that a power outage caused the dinos to attack in the first movie would like to know what he had in mind in case a bad storm passed over, the software needed to be updated or some guy spilling coke on the machine.That and it does succumb to 90's clichés. Basically while my description of them as poachers weren't entirely accurate, basically they're the villains from every single environmental kids movie ever made, the same with the businessman. He's just a slimy bastard. Oh and did I mention it rips the first movie off, basically the good guys take an injured T-Rex baby back to their base just so T-Rex mother can walk back and start beating on the car, trying to kill them. Why bring the T-Rex baby to their base in the first place? It seemed obvious that the T-Rex's family would be back and seeing their child kidnapped and injured would try and kill them! Believe me in saying that it's not even half of why the characters in this movie are idiots.Oh and the effects. Unlike the first movie the CG work is terrible. The later years of classic Doctor Who had better CGI effects and that was done with 1% of it's budget in the 1980's. This movie also plugs in references to stuff only people in the 90's would know of like Sega, because that ages well! It just makes the whole movie feel like This movie was only intended for the people who saw it in 1997 who liked it, no-one else.Very quickly on what I liked about this movie. Well, while I hated the CG work the puppets are excellent and seeing a Dinosaur running around Urban life causing chaos is a pretty cool idea to go with. While I did describe the bad guys as every villain in a 90's children's environmental film - At least here they aren't portrayed like the typical mustache twirling bad guys usually seen in this category.This movie just tries to be the first one without any of the thought behind it. I think I heard the iconic John Williams theme about once in the entire thing. Each of the characters are just idiots and the effects make games on the PlayStation (as in the original!) look like Avatar. This is just a meandering movie that tries to be exactly a classic but fails miserably.

You know, superwoman, who shows men who's boss? The movie's premise that an energy being, that is as alien to us as energy is to matter, could live inside of a human body, parasitically, makes TRON look realistic. The biggest flaw is the eternal boredom in a putatively scary movie. This is followed by a woman who continues in the relationship apparently needing either the Deity to tell her to get the hell out of there or see the water tentacle come out of him. The latter you will have to wait the entire length of this incredibly boring movie. Yes, I concur with the above great reviewers, this really is a cheap rip off of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby with just enough changes to escape a lawsuit. Spencer is so obviously not himself, from the moment she is reunited with him, the viewer will get progressively more and more irritated with her stupidity and impotence. Then his partner buys it, his wife tells Charlize the truth, before electrocuting herself, does she run then? Nope, she stays with him. More and more disturbing things happen and are done to Theron but she continues to, insanely, stay with him.The movie has perhaps one scary scene, Nan's murder, Charlize's friend, but that is really not terribly intense, frankly. If you get this expecting Rosemary's Baby, forget it, this idiot couldn't polish Polanski's shoes he sucks as a director. There is such lack of verisimilitude in Charlize's character. She suspects Spencer's boss; yet, she goes to Baldy's wife for the abortion pills? After Spencer discovers this, gee, where could he have found it out from? She still stays with him. This is the core of why people hate the movie and it dropped like an anvil. Her stupidity is matched only by her cowardice, at the end, pulling her feet up and dooming the entire world because she is such a stupid, clueless, dependent, cowardly fool. This is your heroine? How the actress who did Monster could portray such a weak woman who ends up, theoretically, destroying the world because she is afraid of going through with it and pulls her feet up? My theory is that the feminist Theron liked the character because she is tortured and set upon by the evil male Spencer. He is so cruel, rapes her, kills her friend and then annihilates and possesses her body at the end. Well, sorry Charlize, audiences just will not identify with the world's most clueless, retarded, cowardly heroine. Look, I am open to other interpretations, try to find one where a feminist actress that plays strong female role models, like the new Mad Max, chose the most pathetic wife in the history of films. I am sorry the only logical explanation is to delineate the horrors visited upon this sweet, clueless idiot by this evil, cruel man. Whatever the ideology, this is the most boring horror movie you will ever endure. Frankly, nothing much happens until the end of the movie. Three quarters of the movie is Spencer acting creepy, with her growing suspicions that a Down's Syndrome patient would have known within fifteen minutes and caught the next plane to Montana. Creepy music does not substitute for actual scares and a script. Frankly, she may have made some ideological points for her cause but she did real damage to her career taking this role. The premise itself is not clever the idea that an energy being could live both in the vacuum of space and possess a human body, I found utterly absurd.

Yes, there were several before (and many since!), but this one feels like the peak of the genre, and it's mainly due to the tremendous acting displayed by it's stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, but ESPECIALLY Gibson! I honestly believe that Gibson was robbed of a Best Actor nomination for his intense, deeply involving performance of L.A. Police Sergeant Martin Riggs, a suicidal 11-year police vet who mourns the loss of his wife in a tragic car accident every single day of his life. Riggs lives life on the edge. He can't keep a partner due to his affinity for danger. In comes Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (excellently played by Danny Glover), a family man who just turned 50 and is ready for early retirement, because, you know, he's too old for this sh*t! LOL.Riggs is paired with Murtaugh to investigate an apparent suicide of a coked-out 18-year old Amanda Hunsaker (played by Jackie Swanson of Cheers fame in the scene that opened the film) and things get interesting fast as the suicide leads the cops to a web of intrigue. The girl's father, a prominent banker Michael Hunsaker is a former Army buddy of Murtaugh who saved his life in Vietnam. The banker is played by Tom Atkins (a stalwart of John Carpenter 70s-80s flicks) and Atkins is very persuasive as a man in over his head. Turns out that Hunsaker is involved in money laundering, using his bank as a front for a local drug ring comprised of former military specialists. The head of the ring is General McAllister (played with cold detachment by Mitchell Ryan) and his right hand is Mr. Joshua (played with scary, scene-stealing brilliance by Gary Busey). There seemed to be a trend around this time of having high class villains in action movies, with McAllister and Joshua actually preceding the Die Hard villains Hans and Karl by about a year and a half (Lethal Weapon technically premiered on Christmas Day '86 while Die Hard came out the summer of '88). But the Lethal Weapon villains are just as scary and intense (if not more so) than the Die Hard ones. The real pull of Lethal Weapon to me is the authentic chemistry and budding relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh and their snappy banter throughout. There have been buddy movies ad nauseum over the years, but this one feels like the best due to the believable progression of the Riggs-Murtaugh relationship. Of course, this being the first film of the eventual series (there were 4 total), this is the only one where Riggs and Murtaugh actually disliked each other for most of the film, but by the end they were best buddies, which carried over to all the sequels. Anyone who watched any of the (inferior) sequels first will find it hard to imagine that these 2 cops actually had an active dislike for each other at one point, but you have to start somewhere!Notable performances are also delivered by Darlene Love (as Murtaugh's wife Trish) and Traci Wolfe (as Murtaugh's eldest daughter Rianne, who has a crush on Riggs). The film was directed with energy, style, and flair by Richard Donner, who notedly directed the first Superman film from 1978 (interesting dichotomy) and would go onto direct all 3 Lethal Weapon sequels.

Whether you like this change or not is purely subjective, but it is there and for that we must talk about it. So what did I think? Well, for me - The movie was okay, clearly a movie that focused on the effects more then the story.So the plot is that Alan Grant and his girlfriend paleontologist are approached by a man named Richard Hammond who is building an amusement park and after some safety concerns and other such things he is forced by lawyers to give an eyewitness account of the park.

Why The Lion King and Aladdin or course. sure, The Lion King is stellar and Aladdin has the genie... and uh... it has the genie. anyone will say that Disney's golden decade was the 90's which to me is the one where they all started singing for some reason to the point where I was relieved when Phil Collins would do the singing in Tarzan and Brother Bear. To me, the two golden decades of Disney was the 60's (101 dalmatians, The Sword in the Stone, The Jungle Book and The Aristocats) and the early 00's. yeah, sure, Atlantis The Lost Empire and Brother Bear where kinda mediocre. But The Emperor's New Groove, Treasure Planet and Lilo & Stitch was Disney waking up from there 90's musical\/princess\/cheesefest trip. Emperor's New Groove was more self-aware and fourth-wall breaking than anything else, Treasure Planet was more ambitious and refreshing than anything else but Lilo & Stitch was just nothing like anything else in the Disney catalog. Then, drawn animation officially died in 2003 when Finding Nemo came out but let's not be resentful of the past, shall we. we're here to talk about Lilo & Stitch.The movie starts of in the extra-terrestrial world where Stitch (currently called experiment 626) and Dr. Jumba are both on trial. Jumba is accused of having created Stitch and Stitch is accused of being Stitch. From this very first scene, everything works beautifully, you feel engaged and sucked into this super cool setup and it's characters including the grand councilwoman (yes, that's her official name) and Captain Gantu. Then, Stitch escapes effortlessly, flies away with a ship and then crashes on our favorite little blue planet. The galactic government peeps decide to send their own version of Laurel & Hardy (Jumba & Pleakley) to Earth to destroy Stitch. Jumba, because he created Stitch and Pleakley, because he's the alien nerd who knows stuff about Earth. What's so great about Jumba and Pleakley is that they're not evil and stupid because they have to be as Disney antagonists. They're actually very likable and are carrying this mission because Stitch is actually a threat during the beginning of the movie. And the reason they keep failing to catch Stitch is not because they're stupid and clumsy but because Stitch is just impossible to catch, which makes it so brilliant.We then get to the good people of Kauai, introducing Lilo and her older sister, Nani. And that's where this wonderful little Disney feature get's very heavy and emotional. Lilo and Nani are orphaned sisters and Nani being the young adult, has to take care of Lilo all by herself, under the supervision of the harsh but fair social worker, Cobra Bubbles. They are all introduced in that first infamously heart-grabbing scene that some will remember having cried to back in the day and maybe still today. The wonderful yet heartbreaking connection that Lilo has with Stitch is that Lilo, too, acts like a strange and destructive alien and can't fit in with anyone due to the troma of having lost both her parents and only having her caring sister left as a parent figure who yet is patience-limited at times while going under the stress of her little sister's odd behavior and finding a job so that the social worker won't have to take Lilo away from her (yes, it's a Disney movie we're talking about). I don't think I have ever seen a film or animation that shows a truer and rawer depiction of sibling relationship, while struggling under the burden of living as a broken family.Eventually, Lilo meets and adopts Stitch in a dog adoption home, as he makes himself look like and act like a dog to stay undercover while trying to get Jumba and Pleakley off his tail. From the point Stitch comes in the picture with Lilo and Nina, he starts of acting destructive and careless while Lilo constantly finds an appeal to him and tries to tame him and soothe him all while Nina is very skeptical of Stitch.Why I think Lilo & Stitch is the best is because it's made for everyone and has the power to move anyone. Everything feels so true and organic, the attention to detail when it comes to timing, dialogue, comedy, little actions and mannerisms, character relations and personalities and the loyal attention to Kauai's culture when it comes to the dancing and the music makes Lilo & Stitch's quality the same level as an award-nominated live-action movie and if Lilo & Stitch was adapted perfectly as a live-action movie and it could be (even though, I don't want it to be), it would still be amazing but of course not as amazing as it's original form. go watch it.

Roger Rabbit becomes a suspect when he learns of his wife Jessica's affair with Acme. But who actually framed Roger Rabbit? Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a classic blend of live action animation combined with a real world motion picture and it's these aspects combined that make it so memorable (it was also very unique back in 1988). The audience are treated to a wonderful 5 minute cartoon at the start which was great for me as it harked back to my youth - it reminded of the wonderful cartoons from my youth. The story in itself plays as a murder mystery and this aspect alone is strong enough to make the film worth watching (even if it is a little bit predictable). Hoskins initially seems like an unsympathetic character, but my impression of him changed as the story unfolds - we do at least get an understanding of why he is the way that he is.The real stars of the show here are the animated characters and whenever Roger Rabbit is on the screen you're almost guaranteed a laugh. Fans of the 'cartoons of old' are guaranteed some fun here with various cartoon character cameos from the likes of Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, Yosemite Sam & Porky Pig just to name a few. The zany antics of the cartoon characters really do make this a fun and joyous experience. The scene in the lift with Droopy and Hoskins was simply genius. In this film we also get to see Jessica Rabbit who is arguably the sexiest cartoon creation in existence (even though it feels a bit weird saying this).The only minor criticism that I have with this film is that it does sag a bit in the middle, but it's never a major problem as those crazy Tooney characters are never far away and it is definitely they that give us the most laughs.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an excellent film that was quite a unique experience when it was released and it's a film that still holds up well today. The showdown between Lloyd and Hoskins at the end was also incredibly funny and was also quite imaginative as well.

Leonard Bernstein's score is absolutely impeccable, nearly unrivaled in the realm of musical theater and film composing for its cohesiveness and beauty. The orchestra packs a punch, but also supplies needed gentleness to tender moments. Each note fits perfectly into the scene, especially when there's a quarrel between the two rival gangs. Nearly every song is an instant classic, from Maria to Tonight to Cool. On top of that, the music scenes themselves have remained in the American consciousness for decades. The Sharks' humorous adoration and mockery of the American Dream in America still resonate deeply today, while the Jets' not-so-nice ode to the oafish Officer Krupke digs deep at what makes a kid go bad like them. Dance in West Side Story is used to its stylistic peak. The choreography is insanely tight. Watching the Jets and Sharks duke it out with dance on stage is simply a delight and definitely a highlight of the film for me. The dance at the gym is a prime example of just how stellar a scene can be when both the music and the choreography are finely tuned to perfection. I can say with much confidence that those are my two favorite elements of the entire movie. In addition, every shot is filled with gorgeous color. You could analyze its usage till the cows come home and still find more to say. That being said, the film has quite a few flaws that prevent me from haphazardly calling it a masterpiece. Despite what other reviewers say, I find West Side Story's pacing to actually be too fast at times. The whole story takes place over a two day period. Now, within those two days, relations between the Jets and Sharks go from a tense calm to explosive hatred and bitterness. Tony and Maria meet at the dance at 10pm, and by the next evening they're singing about getting married! The two say barely any words to each other, and yet they're dead set on being together for eternity. So much so that when Tony kills Maria brother Bernardo, she isn't even the slightest bit mad at him after a minute or so! Give me a break. And will someone please explain to me why Tony doesn't so much as shed a tear when his best friend Riff dies in front of him? Such a timeless fight scene is nearly ruined by Tony's complete lack of character. Granted, the overall picture is perhaps more important than the little details, but some are just too glaring to ignore! While there are some good performances here (Rita Moreno's is fantastic), there's some pretty poor, ham-fisted acting here and there too, particularly on the Sharks side. This is mainly due to the fact that almost none of them are actually Puerto Rican or even Latino. Most of the Sharks are so bad at their accents that they sound Italian, Maria and Bernardo included.

This is particularly weird for the Barry character since his life story, the topic of the film, undergoes great transformations from start to finish. Yet, Ryan O'Neal, as Barry, looks like a lifeless, emotionless mannequin just reciting his script lines for almost the entire film. Marissa Berenson, as Lady Lyndon, is also a lifeless, emotionless mannequin just reciting script lines, although she is portrayed as being seduced by Barry while still being married to her elderly husband, although the narrator says that she falls in love with Barry before her husband suddenly dies, and although Barry is blowing her fortune and openly cheating in front of her after their marriage. It is true that the film is set in 18th Century England, when we would expect propriety and decorum to dominate more than today, but the flat, emotionless portrayal of the two main characters in such a tumultuous storyline is just unreal and just indicates a VERY POOR directing job by Stanley Kubrick.I was even more amazed when I read a Wikipedia summary of William Thackeray's The Luck Of Barry Lyndon (1844). In the original novel, Thackeray definitely sets up Barry Lyndon as a hot tempered young man at the start of the novel, using this as his motivation for his duel over his cousin Nora. In the novel, Barry is not the victim of highway robbers, but makes it all the way to Dublin, where he immediately begins hanging around with low lifes and accrues so much gambling debt that he joins the British Army just to escape. Wiki says Barry seduces and bullies Lady Lyndon into marrying him. The novel not only has Barry's stepson Lord Bullington join the British Army to fight in the American Revolution, but has Barry plotting long distance to have Lord Bullington deliberately killed in battle in America.Although I'm the first to say that an auteur should have the creative freedom to revise a screen adaptation of a novel however much he wants, it is VERY STRANGE to me that Kubrick BOTH revised the storyline of the original novel and focused his direction of the main characters in a way that turned his main characters into such lifeless, emotionless, script reciting mannequins. What kills me is that Wiki's plot summary of the novel reveals Barry Lyndon to be a truly colorful and adventuresome guy, a character who already would be a wonderful film character. So what the hell was Kubrick thinking here?? I don't know, but he FAILED BADLY as far as I'm concerned.The elaborate and obviously expensive costumes, period settings, and period accessories such as the horse drawn coaches in this film make it even more puzzling to me what Kubrick was thinking in his production of this film, that is, if he was thinking at all. In any case, elaborate and obviously expensive costumes, period settings, and period accessories do not compensate for a POOR screen adaptation of a novel, and for POOR direction, and that's all I can see in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1972).Anyone who thinks that this is a great film must first start with the assumption that Kubrick is a great filmmaker and then work his way backward from that assumption to justify the greatness of this film.

The novel not only has Barry's stepson Lord Bullington join the British Army to fight in the American Revolution, but has Barry plotting long distance to have Lord Bullington deliberately killed in battle in America.Although I'm the first to say that an auteur should have the creative freedom to revise a screen adaptation of a novel however much he wants, it is VERY STRANGE to me that Kubrick BOTH revised the storyline of the original novel and focused his direction of the main characters in a way that turned his main characters into such lifeless, emotionless, script reciting mannequins. What kills me is that Wiki's plot summary of the novel reveals Barry Lyndon to be a truly colorful and adventuresome guy, a character who already would be a wonderful film character. So what the hell was Kubrick thinking here?? I don't know, but he FAILED BADLY as far as I'm concerned.The elaborate and obviously expensive costumes, period settings, and period accessories such as the horse drawn coaches in this film make it even more puzzling to me what Kubrick was thinking in his production of this film, that is, if he was thinking at all. In any case, elaborate and obviously expensive costumes, period settings, and period accessories do not compensate for a POOR screen adaptation of a novel, and for POOR direction, and that's all I can see in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1972).Anyone who thinks that this is a great film must first start with the assumption that Kubrick is a great filmmaker and then work his way backward from that assumption to justify the greatness of this film. I just don't see it any other way. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, History"},{"date":"9 August 2015","score":"","review":" For the early part of Jean-Claude Van Damme's film career when his popularity began to rise, there was one person Van Damme frequently was associated with. That man was Sheldon Lettich, a director, writer and producer to some of Van Damme's early successes like Bloodsport (1988) and Lionheart (1990). Yet even with Lettich not taking part in all of Van Damme's productions, a number of the same writing elements worked their way into each screenplay. Up to this film, almost every film starring Van Damme portrayed a character who had nothing to lose and went into a situation that seemed practically hopeless but pulled through despite the odds. Initially, this formula works a couple times but it does become apparent very quickly. Interestingly enough, this movie has a number of similarities as well, but in some ways it also feels like it's parodying that to some degree.Again directed and written by Sheldon Lettich along with Van Damme, the story is about two brothers named Chad and Alex Wagner (played by Van Damme) who end up being separated as babies after a mob hit on their family because of a construction agreement between China and the US. Fathering Chad in the US is Frank Avery (Geoffrey Lewis) a good friend of his parents. As for Alex, his childhood took place in China where the mob hit happened. After 25 years, Frank and Chad head to China and meet up with Alex and his girlfriend Danielle Wilde (Alonna Shaw). Together they search for the truth to whether the mob hit was due to protest or if it was from the inside, ordered by Nigel Griffith (Alan Scarfe). Watching close by is another deadly archenemy of the Wagners named Moon (Bolo Yeung) who acquired an equally deadly looking scar from Avery during the mob hit. As an overall product of the story, it's entertainment fluff. Like stated before, the writing uses the usual Van Damme formula and somewhat puts it on its head.Again, Van Damme plays a character(s) with nothing to lose (other than one friend) and set out to get back what's rightfully theirs. There's also a subplot where Alex becomes jealous about his brother who believes he's out to sleep with his girlfriend (it doesn't go far). The most noticeable problem in the writing is that the motivation to attain what is rightfully the Wagner brother's is ultimately lost in the execution. Like several other Van Damme flicks, the whole run time is based on revenge and that's it. There's nothing more than that but once it's realized, the story feels kind of shallow. The characters do help the story though. Jean-Claude Van Damme as two brothers would seem unnecessary but he ends up pulling it off decently. Van Damme plays both characters like they know how to use firearms and fight. Chad is more innocent by nature than his brother. Alex on the other hand is a much more gruff and no-nonsense type of guy. It's also nice with the distinguishable contrasts between them, that way viewers will know the difference.The other two actors who give the film an entertainment boost are performances by Geoffrey Lewis and Bolo Yeung. Geoffrey Lewis has always had underrated roles in film and this one is no different. Lewis playing the father figure to one of the Van Damme characters is mostly believable and they both have acceptable chemistry on screen. It's difficult not to enjoy Lewis' roles. The same goes for Yeung who continuously casts himself in villain roles. Although Moon is nowhere near as memorable as his role in Bloodsport (1988) as Chong Li, Yeung still looks like he had fun and his presence is still one that is not to be messed with. The action is nicely integrated into the direction of the film. There are plenty of shootouts and fistfights, all of which show Van Damme's skill. And yes, for those who have to see Van Damme doing his signature split, he does that too. The cinematography looked competently shot too. Behind the camera for this production was Richard H. Kline best known for his work on The Andromeda Strain (1971), The Mechanic (1972), King Kong (1976), Star Trek The Motion Picture (1979), and Body Heat (1981). There's a mix of shots that range between Hong Kong China and island rendezvous points that look gorgeous due to the sheer lushness of the tropical landscape. Plus, Kline's work and with several tricks, the ability to keep Van Damme playing two characters at once looks real. There's only one questionable shot that looks spliced on top of each other but everything else looks like it was Van Damme had a twin. The music was a disappointment though. Composed by Arthur Kempel, the orchestral cues sound organic but there really isn't much to say about them other than it sounds like it belongs to a movie and has music appropriate for the setting with several percussion instruments. It is quite forgettable.The story takes other elements from previous Van Damme films and turns it on its side with Van Damme playing his own double. It is different and it works out but its execution just leads to more action fluff, which isn't bad, just empty. The characters are likable along with forgettable music, but that's it.
