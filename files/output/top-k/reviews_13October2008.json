This film really pulls you in. It's like if the movie spins a web that brutally absorbs you. Honestly.I first watched this film projection on a festival that was doing a school. The room was filled over to the top. But, actually at the middle of the movie some people really went out. Specially, two girls. They went out crying as hell. But, anyway, that's another story.American History X is directed by British director Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. Is about a racist, Derek, (wonderfully played by an impeccable Edward Norton) that wants to 'clean' (let's put it that way) its neighbourhood of colour people (I am not a racist) and Mexicans and all. But after he is arrested for killing two colour people (and crushed it's head to one of them) he reforms of what he has do. But, his little brother, Danny, (played by an excellent Edward Furlong) is following Derek's steps. But Derek will do anything (even go back and look, in a metaphorical way, to his disturbing and terrifying past).Verdict An stunning and truly terrifying movie, with magnificent performances, excellent music and beautiful photography, that you won't soon forget. An instant classic. Edward Norton's performance is one of the best of the history of cinema. An extreme odyssey. Definitely, one of the most daring movies of the last 100 years. It's a shame that I can only give 10 stars to this movie. I would give it 1 000 or a million or all the stars in the world. A masterpiece. One of the best pictures ever made.

The script is strikingly well-written at times, particularly when it comes to the dialogue. Bob Hoskins' outstanding performance makes Marlon Brando's Godfather look like something out of a high school play, and the direction by John Mackenzie is suitably gritty and focused on grim realism, and nearly completely lacking in flash. Stylish without being stylized, if you will.So, with all those positives how can this film end up being as generally mediocre as it is? It's simple- the story is largely lacking in imagination, it's just not involving, and you could have replaced any of the supporting actors half-way through the film and I wouldn't have noticed or cared (that includes the usually excellent Helen Mirren). Oh, and there's the unbearable score, which is apparently well-liked for some reason. This film fails to live up to its reputation simply because it's a character study focused on Bob Hoskins' character Harold, who sees his basically perfect world crumbling around him, but when a film is a character study the characters better be interesting. Note that I said 'interesting' and not 'sympathetic', because I couldn't give less of a damn if Harold is sympathetic (he's not), especially as he's just not interesting.The Long Good Friday boasts an interesting premise but dull execution script-wise (outside of a few scenes here and there), and in spite of all the things to recommend about it- Bob Hoskins' superb lead performance, the dark humor, the tour-de-force final scene, it's all a bit flat and uninteresting in the end. I'll stick with Get Carter, thank you.

Basically Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was raised by his father at a young age to be the best bowler in the world, and in 1979, all grown up, he was growing as a champion. Unfortunately his talent was cut off (literally) when fellow bowler Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) and him got into a misunderstanding, and Roy lost his bowling hand. Years later, Roy is now living with a metal hook, and a connectible rubber hand, and works as a travelling salesman, but he is going downhill, until he sees the opportunity to get back into the bowling world. One night he sees a skilled bowler, Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid), an Amish who secretly went away from his farm to bowl (and he would get disowned if the other Quakers knew). Roy convinces Ishmael to let him be his trainer to make the world's best bowler, and Ishmael is actually finding life outside the farm quite fun. Roy does soon encounter now top ranking bowling champion Ernie, now obviously his nemesis, and Roy gets his chance to prove he still has his skill (even with the rubber hand) when Ishmael breaks his hand, and he takes over at the ultimate bowling championship. In the end, you don't expect Roy to lose (by one point), but at least he gets the girl, Claudia (Vanessa Angel).

The next night her brother disappears around the same time a panther mauls a prostitute in a seedy hotel, this creature is captured and taken to the local zoo.Irena goes looking for her brother but can't find him so decides to do some sightseeing and ends up at the zoo where she seems drawn the the recently captured panther which she starts to sketch, in fact she is so engrossed that she is still there an hour after the zoo closes. When Oliver, the zoo's curator, finds her there they end up going out for a meal of oysters together and she is offered a job in the zoo's gift shop. Her first day at work doesn't end well though as she witnesses one of the zoo workers being killed by the panther, and when Oliver arrives to put it down the panther has escaped. Once home she finds that her brother has returned, he explains their families strange heritage; that they are part panther and whenever they have sex with a person they become a panther and can't be human again until they have killed a person. He also tells her that the only exception to this is if they do it with another of their kind and as they are the last too that means incest. Irena is horrified at this and flees, bumping in to the police outside, they search the house's basement and find human remains they assume that Paul has been feeding people to a big cat rather than being the cat himself.Oliver takes Irena to his house out of town which can only be reached by boat, here she starts to feel more in touch with nature and goes out at night, removes her nightdress and prowls around naked till she finds and kills a rabbit. On their return to the city her brother kills again, this time however he is trapped as a panther and killed, when Oliver performs a post mortem on the creature something rather strange occurs.When Oliver's colleague Alice is out running she has a feeling she is being followed.

There is a fair amount of nudity in the film, some scenes like Irena walking around naked can be justified as it shows she is behaving in an animal rather than a human way others such as Alice swimming topless seem to be there just to show off Annette O'Toole's admittedly nice breasts.The acting was good, especially Nastassja Kinski's portrayal of Irena which was positivity feline and switched from an innocent to a predator believably through the course of the film. While this film is by no means perfect I'd certainly recommend it to fans of creature features or Nastassja Kinski.

The next night her brother disappears around the same time a panther mauls a prostitute in a seedy hotel, this creature is captured and taken to the local zoo.Irena goes looking for her brother but can't find him so decides to do some sightseeing and ends up at the zoo where she seems drawn the the recently captured panther which she starts to sketch, in fact she is so engrossed that she is still there an hour after the zoo closes. When Oliver, the zoo's curator, finds her there they end up going out for a meal of oysters together and she is offered a job in the zoo's gift shop. Her first day at work doesn't end well though as she witnesses one of the zoo workers being killed by the panther, and when Oliver arrives to put it down the panther has escaped. Once home she finds that her brother has returned, he explains their families strange heritage; that they are part panther and whenever they have sex with a person they become a panther and can't be human again until they have killed a person. He also tells her that the only exception to this is if they do it with another of their kind and as they are the last too that means incest. Irena is horrified at this and flees, bumping in to the police outside, they search the house's basement and find human remains they assume that Paul has been feeding people to a big cat rather than being the cat himself.Oliver takes Irena to his house out of town which can only be reached by boat, here she starts to feel more in touch with nature and goes out at night, removes her nightdress and prowls around naked till she finds and kills a rabbit. On their return to the city her brother kills again, this time however he is trapped as a panther and killed, when Oliver performs a post mortem on the creature something rather strange occurs.When Oliver's colleague Alice is out running she has a feeling she is being followed. Later when she goes for a swim she hears a strange growling and is scared when Irena enters as if she somehow knows she is dangerous. Later Irena sleeps with Oliver and as predicted becomes a panther in an impressive transformation scene. She does not however kill him, instead she leaves him but she is cornered by the police on a bridge, when Oliver arrives she jumps from the bridge into the river. Oliver heads back to his river side home and finds a friend dead in a tree and Irena at the house.

","genre":"Fantasy, Thriller"},{"date":"13 October 2008","score":"","review":" A few months before releasing his legendary epic The Godfather &#150; Part 2, Francis Ford Coppola crafted an understated, intriguing dramatic thriller, The Conversation. Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul, a lonely private audio surveillance expert from San Francisco who becomes obsessed with a conversation he's recorded. He's afraid the couple he was hired to spy on is in danger, which leads him to paranoia.The Conversation is not for everybody. Released shortly after the Watergate scandal (although Coppola had written the screenplay in the 60's), it's a slow paced character-driven thriller, and also a poignant study of a man who's too paranoid to trust anybody around him, including his girlfriend (Teri Garr). Gene Hackman delivers one of his best, subtlest performances, and the supporting cast is also very effective (particularly the late John Cazale; there's even a young Harrison Ford in a secondary but important role). Coppola's rhythmic narrative, underlined by a wonderful score that includes unforgettable piano pieces, is very European and seems to homage some important avant-garde directors from the 60's and 70's; some scenes seem reminiscent of Michelangelo Antonioni's now outdated Blow Up (1966).The Conversation, though, more than holds up to the test of time. Even if its slow pace and somberness might turn off some of the spectators who grew up watching MTV and Michael Bay, its gripping story is timeless. The recent German production The Lives of Others (the movie that stole the Best Foreign Film Oscar from Pan's Labyrinth and is now being remade in Hollywood) has a similar protagonist, played by Ulrich Mühe (except that Mühe's character is somewhat more cold-blooded than Hackman's). In a world where paranoia is all around us (the Iraq war, money and gas crises, global warming, the end of privacy and all the cameras focusing on you right now), Harry Caul's search for the bug is tragically poetic - and hauntingly believable.

Combine the two and what do you get? A film made in heaven? No - nearer to hell in fact.I read somewhere that Eastwood was so methodical and resolute in his film making that he managed to shoot Absolute Power 3 weeks ahead of schedule and 2-4 million under budget. Now, I don't know if he had spent that money and time on the film if it would be an improvement but it couldn't be any worse.Right from the get-go this film is doomed. Hackman (a criminally underused Hackman) is the President having some midnight fun with the wife of his biggest supporter. He gets a little rough, she fights back too much for the liking of the secret service men who in the end shoot her dead in her own bedroom. All of this is witnessed by Eastwood hiding in a secret vault room. The chase is now on. But the thing is - nothing - not one single thing afterwards, fits. There is NO suspense, no drama, a sequence of events that would make your eyes water with incredulity and enough plot holes to drive a truck through - sideways.I won't (can't - don't have the space nor the time) go into all of the issues with this film but here's a flavour 1. Eastwood abseils out a window of the crime scene with a pack that must weigh a ton on his back - filled with jewels\/cash and then manages to outrun 2 trained secret service agents through a forest. Now the fact that Eastwood is quite obviously an old man carrying substantial weight doesn't seem to matter. The two guys following him must be 25 years younger, are armed and even have night vision goggles !!!! Yet cannot catch him.2. The day after the theft\/murder, Ed Harris, the police investigator, walks into his office, holding Eastwood's file. He says something about how a friend of his told him there are only 6 guys IN THE ENTIRE WORLD that could pull off that theft and only 1 of those 6 lives in D.C. - Eastwood! Is this how police investigation works??!! Very convenient that he just lives right under their noses too.3. Harris then persuades Eastwood's daughter - Linney (again criminally underused) to set up her dad and bring him in. She agrees. Why? I don't know. But the set-up goes wrong and she is shot at by 2 snipers (one SS guy and another hired killer). Then Harris takes her home and starts flirting with her. Embarrassingly. I would have thought she would be a little aggrieved that he nearly got her and her father killed a few hours previous, but no... she invites him in for water and flirts back! This stretches believability to the max here. Why would a beautiful, successful lawyer even look at a small, balding cop who almost got her killed? To make matters worse, Eastwood - at the end of the movie encourages his daughter to get together with this cop. WHAT?!! 4. One of the snipers is set up in a hotel room of some sort with a big window. After building his rifle like something from an airfix kit, (the SS man is simultaneously building his click-together gun too) he HOLDS THE RIFLE OUT OF THE WINDOW waving it about. The place is in the middle of a high traffic, public domain, SWARMING with cops as well, in daylight! 5. Eastwood turns up in disguise. My dog would come up with a better disguise. A hat and a Mac left over from Columbo. Terrible.6. The President then sends the SS guys to find Eastwood's daughter. I thought they would bring her in for questioning or put the squeeze on her, but they simply follow her until she parks her car at the edge of a cliff prior to a run. Rather than arrest her and bring her in for questioning (or use as bait), they simply push her over the cliff and drive away? What purpose does that possibly serve?7. After Eastwood finds out that the SS is taking over surveillance of his daughter, he drops a public phone, speeds across the city from a phone booth in the middle of who knows where, screeching his tires and blowing his horn repeatedly through traffic to the same spot where Linney has just been pushed over the cliff. How did he know she would be there? At no time, did he see his daughter's car or talk to his daughter. How did he know to find his daughter there ?8. At the end when the billionaire husband walks in to the President with the knife in his hand , confronts the President and CUT- there is a scene cut - and later it is announced that the President stabbed himself to death. WHAT? I could go on for another 5 pages with things that were just happening for the sake of it or Eastwood appears out of nowhere but I won't bore you any longer.Given Eastwood's pedigree behind the camera, I am majorly surprised at this shoddy effort. He had a good cast Linney, Harris, Glenn, Hackman, Haysbert and a decent premise of a story - but the haphazard way this is thrown together is nothing short of abysmal.3\/10 - 5 points for Linney alone, 1 point taken away for Harris' terrible flirting and another point taken away for the serious amount of plot holes.

I think the reason was because I've seen so many faux masterpieces&#151;that include everything from A Nightmare on Elm Street to Suspiria&#151;that I've given up hope in anything and everything that people claim to be a classic horror piece. The Exorcist is no different.I assume that the hardcore fans of this movie either (1) grew up on it, or (2) were scared the first time they saw it, then build it up to be something it isn't in their mind, and if they were to see it a second time, I'm sure they would realize how boring and cheesy it is. I also assume there are some people out there who truly see this as a perfect movie, but I simply cannot come close to understanding their reasoning, and here is why - Cheese. The voiceovers are downright HALRIOUS. At one point it sounds like the girl was trying to talk like a hobo or something, which had me laughing more than any comedy I've seen in the past year. Also, some of the dialogue may have been vulgar in its time, but now just sounds a lot like the script for a bad teen comedy.- Boredom. I'd say that close to 80% of the runtime of this film has nothing to do with exorcism, but has everything to do with boring daily life that doesn't make me sympathize for the cliché, stereotypical characters, but certainly make me sleepy. There is literally no plot, and without a plot there is no suspense. I'm someone who finds the original Alien to be a fine movie, but the difference between The Exorcist and Alien is that Alien understands suspense whereas The Exorcist does not. There is a MAJOR difference between suspense and just downright pointless scenes, and The Exorcist fits into the latter.- Unoriginality. Yes, I can understand that The Exorcist was the first movie to bring exorcism to the big screen, but come on now. It is not an unknown subject by any means, and though this is my first exorcism movie, the subject just bores me because I know everything about it long, long before I watched it. It was like watching someone drink coffee to me&#151;I can care less because I've seen it so many times. I have read many books about exorcism that actually bring something original to the table, such as Ted Dekker's novel Adam, which is so far superior to The Exorcist it feels weird even mentioning it in this review. Exorcism with nothing else original attached was a bland, unoriginal subject in the 60s, and it's even more so in the 21st century.- The scariest movie of all time lie. I'll be blunt this movie had me so board I was on the verge of fast forwarding if something didn't start happening. Calling this scary, much less the scariest movie of all time is an utter joke. The cheesiness had me laughing, and the lack of originality and plot had me bored to tears. There was not a single scene in this film that scared me, or even came close. The stairway scene was a little&#151;very little&#151;jolt of shock, but other than that, I've gotten more scared choking on food. I wouldn't even say this is even 1\/10th as scary as a realistically portrayed exorcism. The majority was just intentionally hilarious. Oh no, it's a little girl possessed by a perverted hobo! - Lack of realism. I've studied real exorcisms, heard firsthand accounts of them, and seriously, folks, this is a trip to Never Never Land compared to a real exorcism. The majority of the things the girl does are completely retarded, and no more based in realism than a tree is based in Jell-O. The Help me scene just downright had to be THE absolute unintentionally funny scene of all time.Overall, I just want to say this just because something is old doesn't mean it's good, and just because something is new doesn't mean it's bad. Just because some people got scared as little kids from a movie then grow up and label it a classic doesn't mean they aren't just as wrong as the kids who label Hostel a classic in our generation. If this movie were released today it would be laughed out of the theater. Age doesn't make up for the lack of entertainment or scares or thrills and cheese&#151;it just makes something old. And usually boring.Watch the hobo-possession scene on YouTube and laugh your head off. The rest isn't worth watching.2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 October 2008","score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" As a hardcore horror fan, who has seen the majority of what the genre has to offer, it's a little weird of me to wait so long to see a classic like The Exorcist.

I think the reason was because I've seen so many faux masterpieces&#151;that include everything from A Nightmare on Elm Street to Suspiria&#151;that I've given up hope in anything and everything that people claim to be a classic horror piece. The Exorcist is no different.I assume that the hardcore fans of this movie either (1) grew up on it, or (2) were scared the first time they saw it, then build it up to be something it isn't in their mind, and if they were to see it a second time, I'm sure they would realize how boring and cheesy it is. I also assume there are some people out there who truly see this as a perfect movie, but I simply cannot come close to understanding their reasoning, and here is why - Cheese. The voiceovers are downright HALRIOUS. At one point it sounds like the girl was trying to talk like a hobo or something, which had me laughing more than any comedy I've seen in the past year. Also, some of the dialogue may have been vulgar in its time, but now just sounds a lot like the script for a bad teen comedy.- Boredom. I'd say that close to 80% of the runtime of this film has nothing to do with exorcism, but has everything to do with boring daily life that doesn't make me sympathize for the cliché, stereotypical characters, but certainly make me sleepy. There is literally no plot, and without a plot there is no suspense. I'm someone who finds the original Alien to be a fine movie, but the difference between The Exorcist and Alien is that Alien understands suspense whereas The Exorcist does not. There is a MAJOR difference between suspense and just downright pointless scenes, and The Exorcist fits into the latter.- Unoriginality. Yes, I can understand that The Exorcist was the first movie to bring exorcism to the big screen, but come on now. It is not an unknown subject by any means, and though this is my first exorcism movie, the subject just bores me because I know everything about it long, long before I watched it. It was like watching someone drink coffee to me&#151;I can care less because I've seen it so many times. I have read many books about exorcism that actually bring something original to the table, such as Ted Dekker's novel Adam, which is so far superior to The Exorcist it feels weird even mentioning it in this review. Exorcism with nothing else original attached was a bland, unoriginal subject in the 60s, and it's even more so in the 21st century.- The scariest movie of all time lie. I'll be blunt this movie had me so board I was on the verge of fast forwarding if something didn't start happening. Calling this scary, much less the scariest movie of all time is an utter joke. The cheesiness had me laughing, and the lack of originality and plot had me bored to tears. There was not a single scene in this film that scared me, or even came close. The stairway scene was a little&#151;very little&#151;jolt of shock, but other than that, I've gotten more scared choking on food. I wouldn't even say this is even 1\/10th as scary as a realistically portrayed exorcism. The majority was just intentionally hilarious. Oh no, it's a little girl possessed by a perverted hobo! - Lack of realism. I've studied real exorcisms, heard firsthand accounts of them, and seriously, folks, this is a trip to Never Never Land compared to a real exorcism. The majority of the things the girl does are completely retarded, and no more based in realism than a tree is based in Jell-O.

Chaplin did an about face from his previous film with The Gold Rush, realizing the public would not accept serious drama with his name attached to it. Instead, he returned to the little tramp character and his tried and true formula of an everyman at odds with the world around him. Although, in this film he seamlessly combines comedy and drama, as he did in The Kid. It was his first film with a prepared script before shooting began. As with The Kid, it was also another film beset with personal turmoil. Lita Grey, who eventually became Chaplin's second wife, became pregnant after being selected as the female lead in the film. As a result, Georgia Hale, Grey's friend at the time, was selected instead. Filming was delayed considerably, but the film was finally released in the summer of 1925 to instant fanfare. Chaplin plays a lone prospector who meets up at a cabin with Mack Swain, another prospector in the Alaskan Klondike looking for gold. Together they hoodwink escaped convict Black Larsen into looking for help during a snowstorm. This sets the stage for an avalanche of sight gags. From the boiled shoe, to the chicken hallucination, to the bear fight, the audience doesn't know what's coming next. Eventually Chaplin and Swain part ways at the cabin but cross paths again in the neighboring town where Chaplin takes a fancy to Georgia Hale, one of the dance hall girls. Initially she feigns interest and toys with Chaplin to make someone else jealous. Chaplin is taken as usual and is made a fool of soon afterward. Chaplin assists the now forgetful Swain back to Swain's claim in order to strike it rich with him, providing the precursor to one of the most famous comic set pieces in film history The cabin blown to the precipice of a cliff. The climax is reminiscent of Buster Keaton's rescue of Natalie Talmadge in Our Hospitality only two years before. The film has great editing and pacing and holds up well after all these years.

It will keep you locked in a close embrace. It is also the best choice to start learning couples' dancing. But, if you're looking for some silver screen accomplishment, which I mostly do for every movie I watched, there is only the noteworthy achievement of costume design. Directing-editing-screenplay are collaboratively proper since it is Baz Luhrmann's own project. I only disliked the sound editing.

When a giant ape escapes from a local circus the doctor sees a woman to continue his experiments but this leads to murder. THE APE comes from Monogram and I think it's the perfect example to use if one wanted to compare the straight Boris Karloff to the more over-the-top Bela Lugosi. Lugosi would appear in Monogram's THE APE MAN, which is a very silly film that has several silly moments but it's actually entertaining thanks to the campy stuff. This film here is just incredibly stiff, lacks any real entertainment and really comes across as boring. The film seems constantly worried that they're going to hurt Karloff's good guy image and no matter what happens through his character, the screenplay is always quick to give some sort of excuse to make him look good. The character is basically a murderer but instead of just being a bad guy, the screenplay is constantly making him look better and all the excuses just leads to a rather boring story. Karloff offers up a good performance but it's certainly not enough to liven up the film or make it more interesting. The supporting cast is mostly forgettable but I'm sure some of this is due to the screenplay simply not giving them much to work with. THE APE has a pretty forgettable story and there's just no life, energy or passion to be seen anywhere. The film is certainly better made than most Monogram movies but that doesn't lead to any sort of entertainment value.

This is certainly without question one of my favorite movies and it certainly had a large impact on my life when I watched it as a teenager. I hold this film very close to my heart and especially the character of Luke but even without the personal feelings this remains one of the better movies out there. Some have called it a prison movie but I think that's really an insult because the film is so much more than that including one of the best character studies out there. The film has so many laughs, so many painful moments and so many dramatic moments but I think the true heart of the film is in its honesty towards Newman's character. There are countless great scenes including the legendary egg eating contest but one of my favorites has always been the ending with Newman talking to God inside the church. Needless to say, Newman is brilliant in the role and while it's hard to say which one performance of his is his greatest this one here is awfully close. You can really see Newman sticking his heart and soul into the role and you really can't imagine anyone else playing the character. George Kennedy also deserved his Oscar and Strother Martin makes for one great villain.

It's an all-time classic. The character played by Ned Beatty undergoes one of the greatest on screen transformations ever portrayed. He is a shallow, almost useless, overweight insurance salesman. He is proud of his ignorance, and yet judges the backwards hicks to be the ignorant ones. When he compliments the old man on his hat, and the old man responds, you don't know nothing', the tone is set. It's true. He really doesn't know nothing'. But one backwoods anal rape later, the man is practically a warrior. His shallow fake bravery is toned down into serious resolve. The old self is forever dead, left in some far off woods, soon to be under hundreds of feet of water. And what of Lewis, our intrepid guide? Lewis is a philosopher\/hunter\/warrior, and he's just about nuts. Burt Reynolds proved himself as an actor way back in 1972 in this film, completely giving himself in to this wonderful role. Who wouldn't want to have a friend like Lewis if one was to venture into the dangers of a forgotten\/soon to be left behind world like the one our hapless travelers find themselves in. This film speaks to us on so many levels. The story feels real. It works as a complete action\/adventure, with wonderful cinematography, and deliberate, grinding pacing. It works as a bit of a horror film, with the danger and almost surrealism of the encounter with the vile rednecks who objectify their sow Ned Beatty. But it also works as an art film, using incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to our very core. I have seen this film at least fifty times, and every time it comes on, I find I have to watch it. You have to watch it quite a few times to even begin to comprehend it. This is one deep movie. This is one well-acted movie. And this is one hell of a story. I gave it a 10 out of 10, and put it in my 10 all time greatest films ever made, along with Schindler's List, Casablanca, Taxi Driver, and Sling Blade, among others. Movies that make you think. Movies that take you beyond having to think. Movies that use a STORY to make their point, without trying to preach to you. If you think you know Deliverance, you might, but again, you might not. It really is that good. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 October 2008","score":"","review":" This is one of the greatest films ever made. It's an all-time classic.

Having seen many WWII-based films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and TV series like BAND OF BROTHERS, the visual effects and dialogue seem a bit...dated. Nevertheless, that does surprisingly little to take away from the overall 'feel' of this movie in which every scene in its run-time of approximately 165 minutes seems relevant and necessary.The best movie of all time? Not quite. But very highly recommended in any case. Deservedly won 4 of the 'Big 8' awards at the Oscars, including Picture, Director, and Lead Actor.

At the same time, however, a film that convinces you that it falls somewhere within the lines of conventional crime drama, also turns into something much greater and infinitely more meaningful than that. It takes you deep into the psyche of a desperate man turned criminal and simultaneously broadens the scope to critique society.You can pretty much tell from the start that Sonny (Pacino) is not a run-of-the-mill bank robber. He knows a lot about banks, but he has a nervous, frenetic energy about him. The film wisely dives straight into the robbery, not setting us up to know any of Sonny's motivation, which is slowly revealed and even then not clearly understood over the course of two hours. The writing is so terrific in the way that it starts with a small event but then expands and becomes richer through small, dialogue-heavy scenes. Afternoon sort of has the soul of a work for the stage in that sense, which makes it unique immediately.Sidney Lumet is just an absolute master of the craft. Much like in 12 Angry Men, he uses strategic camera-work to convey time, intensity and pressure. He wants to get you sweating like the characters, unsure of what might happen next and paranoid about it. You wait for something to go horribly wrong, yet instead you are subjected to learning about the interesting lifestyle and behavior of Sonny.Afternoon in a sense becomes both an individual and group psychological study of a particular situation in which there is a very clear conflict with very clear implications. From the cops negotiating outside the bank to the ladies trying to pass the time inside, the circumstances of the event have a definite bearing on the characters and also our experience of the film.It's not a traditional film involving a bank robbery and that's easily the best part of this film. It is more than just the mystere surrounding bank robberies. Instead of painting a cool portrait of a professional criminal, it jumps into the mind of an average person who might actually commit a random crime to get money. Instead of nearing its climax with some sort of police break in and fight, it takes a much more reasonable turn. At the very least, Afternoon deserves respect for being a great film despite un-fulfilling our Hollywood bank robbery fantasies.
