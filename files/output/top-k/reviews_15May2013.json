The movie is simple mindless full of hot chicks and fast cars. 'Petrolheads' probably did like it as it was the sleeper hit of 2001, and spawned many sequels. Still, the movie had mixed reviews, and in my opinion, they didn't go all the way in entertaining the kind of audience this movie was aimed towards. In the movie, there were few street races and not to mention the fact that the street racing element is just dressing for a bland, generic plot of thieves stealing commercial goods. If I went to go see a racing movie, and found myself watching a Point Break (1991) rip-off. I would be disappointed. The story goes like this, rather than having intense full-throttle action fun, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, the movie goes into another direction by having an undercover cop, Brian (Paul Walker) infiltrates an underworld subculture of Los Angeles street racers looking to bust them for stealing goods. He soon befriends the leader of the group, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and begins to question if he should turn him in, or let him free for one last ride. The movie is supposed to be fast and the furious, but it's not- it's slow pace like a grandma driving in the fast lace in the highway. The limit racing in this movie are over so quickly they're just boring as the movie puts countless amounts of filler scenes of talking that don't further the plot. There are unfinished sub plots. The movie spend all that time developing a love interest, and then you aren't going to let us know what happens? What the hell, movie! I know the movie was going to be for the low-brow, so I didn't expect a life lesson, I want to entertain. This movie was flat out lackluster. There's not enough action. The movie has a lot of flash, but the characters are dull and not interesting enough, with cars replace for personalities. That is, of course, with the exception of Toretto, who thanks to that scene about his dad and Diesel's performance, shines above the material. Still Diesel's acting is mediocre, at best. I presumed they were going to sell them off for upgrades to their cars and bikes, like Toretto was doing with his stolen goods. It's not made clear, though. It doesn't make much sense, either. The cars in the film are not that real to the real deal. Doing a wheelie while burning the the rubber on the rear tires of a 900hp Charger at the same time is simply not possible. First of all, don't expect any kind of realism from this movie. I was dumbfounded when the Brian's Honda floorboard came out of his passenger side when he used his nitrous boost and then his engine blew smoke. Next scene, after this, he picks up someone who was running from the cops with his car and drove away as if it's brand new. I didn't know Brian's puke green car came with a healing factor modified in his engine. What is with each of the underground street races have so many spectators on long streets block off. Not once, you think the police would just look for a large street block off and arrested them. The women in this movie are just drop dead hot, but it's weird for them to be hanging out at underground racing. I don't see many women there, at less not as hot as Jordana Brewster. The movie is supposed to be about Import-car racing which is a spectacle started by Asian American auto enthusiasts. How does The Fast and the Furious pay tribute to the sport's Asian American heritage? Make them the villains in the film. The movie has a lot of loud noises, and soundtrack full of the worst music artist at the time, Limp Bizkit and Ja Rule. The techno rock is a bit annoying. Like the 1955 film, The Fast and the Furious which is not based on, but took the title rights from, this movie is less for smart adults and more for kids who shell out money to pimp their car and add a 4 diameter exhaust to it, thinking it's cool. Don't get me wrong, I love cars, but you don't see me endangering other drivers by driving fast illegally on city urban street. I like driving fast in the country side where it's less dangerous for other drivers. I think the movie glorified the illegal street racing way too much that it's a bit unhealthy. I think the movie is a bit far fetch from reality where most illegal street racers end up getting killed due to crashes or other car racers car-jacking your car before you can race. So it's not worth it. People like seeing cars go vroom and potential cause untold amounts of property damage. That must be it. Still, there are better movies than this. Go see the chase scenes in Bullitt (1975), the French Connection (1979) or Ronin. (1998). Even modern movies like Drive (2011) are better than this movie. If you have to watch the movies, go rent it, don't buy it. I wouldn't advice thinking too much into this, it's just mindless popcorn flick and also don't complain if you hate it, cause I did warn you about seeing it. It's still driving me up the wall.

Basically, Lucifer (this time played by Guri Weinberg) has decided that Hell isn't big enough for both him and Gabriel (Christopher Walken) and so he sends Gabriel back to earth to continue his war with the archangel Michael (Eric Roberts). Meanwhile, the detective Thomas Dagget (now played by Bruce Abbot) has returned to his previous calling and resides in a monastery where he continues to have visions. Anyway, our story starts off with an attractive registered nurse named Valerie Rosales (Jennifer Beals) driving to work and accidentally hitting a man who goes by the name of Danyael (Russell Wong). She takes him to the hospital where he recovers. One thing leads to another and within a very short time they spend the night together. What Valerie doesn't realize is that Danyael is an angel sent by Michael to get her pregnant. Naturally, Danyael succeeds. This causes a serious problem for Gabriel because the nephilim growing inside Valerie is prophesied to end the war in Heaven that Gabriel started. So once again Gabriel launches into a search-and-destroy routine. At any rate, Christopher Walken put on a splendid performance as did Jennifer Beals to a lesser degree. Be that as it may, I didn't care for Russell Wong's acting and I thought Eric Roberts wasn't utilized to his full potential. Likewise, the concept of relocating Eden from Mesopotamia to the United States and making it look like Scranton, Pennsylvania on a Monday night was also a bit weird. Additionally, this film is full of Scriptural inaccuracies and it seemed like the writers were simply making things up as they went along. Not only did they take the characters totally out-of-context but they ascribe motives to beings that are totally inconsistent with Biblical theology. For example, the archangel Michael would never look favorably upon the creation of a nephilim. Neither would Lucifer, for that matter, because the consequences would be incredibly disastrous for him as he knows only too well. And the writers should have known this before they built their entire story around something so preposterous. Again, there are many Biblical errors in this film that some people may not fully realize. Personally, I found the entire plot to be both sad and laughable and I have rated the film accordingly.

The director and actor has received massive acclaim, and is still considered today to be one of the world's greatest directors. And yet, I had not seen any of his films. In fact, I had seen relatively few silent films at all. However, if Chaplin's other work is even nearly as good as City Lights, I will not hesitate to see his many other films.Often considered one of Chaplin's best films, City Lights is the story of a young tramp (portrayed by Charlie Chaplin), who befriends a drunk millionaire. The tramp uses resources provided by the millionaire to give gifts to a young, blind girl, whom the tramp has fallen in love with. Things are a bit complicated, though, as when the millionaire is sober, he does not remember ever befriending the tramp.Due to my limited exposure to films of this era, this review may seem a bit more pointed towards the art of silent film in general, as opposed to this specific film. At times, City Lights plays like a big cartoon. Slap stick and quirky situations saturate this film, insuring that there is never a dull moment. This is not sophisticated comedy, and it does not take a sophisticated mind to enjoy. In fact, this is likely one of the reasons for City Light's success; it's accessibility.Chaplin arranges a large number of very elaborate humorous sketches. A masterpiece in comic timing, City Lights is an absolute delight to watch. There are dozens of memorable scenes. If you're not smiling at any given point during the film, you're probably laughing.Actually, I take back what I just said. For even though City Lights is a comedy, it's also a romance. Very touching, and even tear-jerking at times, City Lights proves that it's just as effective as pulling heart strings as it is at tickling funny bones.The romance succeeds for a number of reasons. For one, we feel invested in the characters and their story. The film is only 82 minutes, which doesn't leave much time for the characters to be developed, and because City Lights is a silent film, only important lines are shown as subtitles. Everything else is silent. And yet, the characters are defined and layered, some more subtly than others.The romance also works due to the excellent acting. Charlie Chaplin quite literally makes this movie. His both hilarious and touching performance as the tramp is sincere and humorous. Virginia Cherrill portraying the blind girl is another great performance, and Harry Myers effectively portrays the eccentric millionaire.I also believe the romance actually benefits from not having dialogue. I say this dialogue is the number one thing that kills a good romance in a film. You could have the best actors and actresses in the world, but with bad dialogue, comes bad romance. By eliminating dialogue, City Lights also eliminates this common issue in modern film that's not just limited to romantic flicks.The score (also composed by Charlie Chaplin, as well as Arthur Johnston) is delightful. Boasting a large number of catchy and clever tunes, the score is both diverse and entertaining. Music has a much more important role in silent films than in today's talkies, but Chaplin and Johnston have no problem here.Not all the sketches work as well as others, and the heavy slapstick may not meet everyone's tastes, but City Lights is a brilliant film that succeeds on both an emotional level, and a comedic one. Funnier and touching than most of today's films, City Lights isn't perfection, nor is it without flaw, but the sincerity and simplicity in which the story is presented is simply beautiful. I look forward to watching more of Chaplin's films in the near future.

If you're not smiling at any given point during the film, you're probably laughing.Actually, I take back what I just said. For even though City Lights is a comedy, it's also a romance. Very touching, and even tear-jerking at times, City Lights proves that it's just as effective as pulling heart strings as it is at tickling funny bones.The romance succeeds for a number of reasons. For one, we feel invested in the characters and their story. The film is only 82 minutes, which doesn't leave much time for the characters to be developed, and because City Lights is a silent film, only important lines are shown as subtitles. Everything else is silent. And yet, the characters are defined and layered, some more subtly than others.The romance also works due to the excellent acting. Charlie Chaplin quite literally makes this movie. His both hilarious and touching performance as the tramp is sincere and humorous. Virginia Cherrill portraying the blind girl is another great performance, and Harry Myers effectively portrays the eccentric millionaire.I also believe the romance actually benefits from not having dialogue. I say this dialogue is the number one thing that kills a good romance in a film. You could have the best actors and actresses in the world, but with bad dialogue, comes bad romance. By eliminating dialogue, City Lights also eliminates this common issue in modern film that's not just limited to romantic flicks.The score (also composed by Charlie Chaplin, as well as Arthur Johnston) is delightful. Boasting a large number of catchy and clever tunes, the score is both diverse and entertaining. Music has a much more important role in silent films than in today's talkies, but Chaplin and Johnston have no problem here.Not all the sketches work as well as others, and the heavy slapstick may not meet everyone's tastes, but City Lights is a brilliant film that succeeds on both an emotional level, and a comedic one. Funnier and touching than most of today's films, City Lights isn't perfection, nor is it without flaw, but the sincerity and simplicity in which the story is presented is simply beautiful. I look forward to watching more of Chaplin's films in the near future.

The director and actor has received massive acclaim, and is still considered today to be one of the world's greatest directors. And yet, I had not seen any of his films. In fact, I had seen relatively few silent films at all. However, if Chaplin's other work is even nearly as good as City Lights, I will not hesitate to see his many other films.Often considered one of Chaplin's best films, City Lights is the story of a young tramp (portrayed by Charlie Chaplin), who befriends a drunk millionaire. The tramp uses resources provided by the millionaire to give gifts to a young, blind girl, whom the tramp has fallen in love with. Things are a bit complicated, though, as when the millionaire is sober, he does not remember ever befriending the tramp.Due to my limited exposure to films of this era, this review may seem a bit more pointed towards the art of silent film in general, as opposed to this specific film. At times, City Lights plays like a big cartoon. Slap stick and quirky situations saturate this film, insuring that there is never a dull moment. This is not sophisticated comedy, and it does not take a sophisticated mind to enjoy.

And one of my favorite moments in this movie is during the after-hours party, when Allen Garfield pulls the rug out from under Caul when we hear his intimate exchange with a woman was secretly recorded. It's a showstopper of a scene, and Hackman plays it perfectly; his tight restraint cracking under seething rage. Hell, Hackman plays the whole film perfectly. Harrison Ford's is the other notable performance in the film. Though not a big role, it's sinister enough to make an indelible impression. Dude was all sorts of ominous. And just when I thought that third-act twist was a punch to the solar plexus, Coppola waits until the end to play the trump card an unforgettable scene in which Hackman systematically rends his apartment, piece by piece in search of a listening device that isn't there.

Back in 1953 aspiring playwright Horton Foote did this as a play on Broadway. It had a very limited run even with the presence of Lillian Gish in the starring role. 32 years later now a successful screenwriter Horton Foote adapted his flop play to the screen and it brought home an Oscar nomination for best screenplay adapted from another medium.More important this work brought home an Oscar for Geraldine Page after seven nominations without the big prize. Geraldine will keep you glued to your seat watching this film, her performance runs quite the gamut of emotions. Page plays a widow living with her milquetoast son John Heard and his domineering wife Carlin Glynn. For Glynn the only value Page has is the Social Security check she brings in every month to keep the family going. In fact Glynn grabs it every month to make sure the bills are paid. Truth be told we learn that Heard was laid up with some undisclosed malady for a couple of years and now is starting with a new company and a new job in Houston. Still that money is something Glynn has gotten used to controlling.I can identify with Page in her longing to return to familiar places and surroundings and get away from her daughter-in-law. For her what she wants most to see is Bountiful, Texas where she grew up.My guess is that Horton Foote growing up in Texas himself saw a lot of towns like Bountiful go belly up, probably because there was oil there at one time and now the fields are played out. That's what's happened to Bountiful, the bounty ran out. But that does not deter Page one single bit.As good as Page is in her role I think some recognition should be given to John Heard and Carlin Glynn in the Supporting categories. I can't believe neither was nominated, especially Glynn. Also Rebecca DeMornay has a fine part as a young wife journeying to join her in-laws while her husband is overseas.No doubt that Horton Foote wanted to keep the setting in the Fifties when the play was written and the film was successful in doing that. But the story is a timeless one and could easily have been done in the year of 1985 when it came out.Geraldine Page is wonderful in the part that finally brought her the Oscar.

But what will Rose's boorish egotistical fiancée think of it??.This film maybe 3 hrs long but its definitely worth it.

He's really picked some dogs the past 10-15 years, which is a shame. Sean Penn is pretty much in the same boat. Don't even get me started on Demi Moore. I've seen better acting in 4th- grade school plays. Take my advice and ave a couple hours of your life and pass on this movie.

It has what could be argued as a great cast, but everything about this film is painfully horrible. I can't believe DeNiro and Penn made this movie.
