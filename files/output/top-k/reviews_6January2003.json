I can see why a lot of people wouldn't like this film, but there are some cool things to be seen in this film.  ...And it was much better than I expected.  This could have been an excellent film if a few things had been changed.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!The first thing that didn't sit very well with me was that they killed off Officer Lewis.  Granted, it was a noble death and was pretty well done, but I didn't want to see Lewis get gunned down so haphazardly.Secondly, there needed to be some better (and longer) fights between RoboCop and Otomo (The Japanese Android)!  All of the fights between the two were way too short and were anti-climatic.  Although, I must say I liked Otomo during the fight scenes, he had some good moves.  It just seemed to me that RoboCop was a bit of a wimp against Otomo.  And, in the finale of the film, our hero doesn't even get the kill, the little computer hacker girl turns the Otomos against each other.  Quite a bit far-fetched if you ask me.Lastly, there were a number of cheesy things throughout the film that could have easily been avoided or better done.  For instance, the scene where the little computer hacker girl hacks into ED-209 and makes him obey her.  Kind of a cool idea, but could have easily been done better.  Oh, and why did they always refer to the CEO as The CEO, just give the guy a name!!!  Also, some of the comedy in the film was either too dark or misplaced.  I would tend to want to leave the comedy out of a film like this.END OF SPOILERSThe cast in the film was decent, I wouldn't say excellent, but they got the job done.  I thought Robert John Burke was a good replacement for Peter Weller, Peter will definitely always be the true Robocop\/Murphy in my eyes, but Burke pulled it off and looks quite a bit like Weller at times.  Nancy Allen returns to the role of Anne Lewis and does a fine job, as was expected.  Remy Ryan (as Nikko) was ok, sometimes really good, sometimes terrible, nothing spectacular there.  Rip Torn (as the CEO) was a bit unexpected in the film, but did an ok job.  I don't blame Rip, I blame the writer of the character, there was just something off about him.  Mako (as Kanemitsu) did a fine job as usual, he played the perfect head-honcho Japanese business man.  Something about CCH Pounder (as Bertha) really bugs me, I'm not really sure what it is, but there was something I didn't like about the character...or maybe it's the actor...I'm not sure.  Stephen Root was another unexpected cast member, although at the time of this film he was somewhat unknown, now it's hard to see him as anyone other than Jimmy James of News Radio.  Nonetheless, he did a fine job with is role in this film.  Daniel von Bargen (as Moreno) did a great job with his role as well, there is something about this actor that I've always liked.  Jill Hennessy (as Dr. Marie Lazarus) was a nice touch, she did a fine job in the film and looked quite good.  Bradley Whitford did a pretty good job, a few bad lines here and there, but overall, pretty good.  He seems to be very good at playing a smug jerk.  All in all, the cast was pretty good, a few things I would have changed here and there, but the fault in this film lies more with the writing and the direction, not the cast.The plot in the film was nothing to write home about, but it was decent, it had it's moments.  I did think it was interesting that RoboCop was forced to choose between defending the public and serving his creators (OCP).  The film had an interesting idea, what happens when two of RoboCop's prime directives contradict each other?  Good idea, not perfectly executed, but a good idea.I was somewhat impressed with the special effects in this film, sure they weren't perfect, but there is some good stuff to see.  The scenes involving RoboCop and Otomo looked pretty nice.  Personally, I thought the flying RoboCop was pretty well done as well (could be that my expectations were quite low)...granted, they could have been better, but I'm sure the budget was somewhat low for the film.  There were also a number of really great stunts in the film.No, the film isn't spectacular, and it isn't as good as either of it's predecessors, but it's worth a watch.  If you are a fan of the previous RoboCop films, give this one a shot, just don't get your expectations too high.  Personally, I enjoyed the film, and I hope you will too, thanks for reading.-Chris ","genre":null},{"date":"6 January 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I'm not really going to defend this film.

I understand how they use an extensive amount of profanity, as do I, but having sex with almost every girl that you can isn't something I go out and do.I remember one scene where the a kid does a 360 Flip (skateboard trick) and hits a 'black' man (I hate using that term, I'm white, but I'm not racist) and then he starts to talk 'trash' about the kid who hit him. Not knowing what is going on, the black kid gets hit in the back of the head with a skateboard from another kid and a big fight breaks out against the black kid. It's approx. 30 kids hitting this black kid, and he is down on the ground bleeding from his head and chest. One kid holds him up, and another smacks him in the face with the 'trunks' (wheels with metal bars) of the skateboard, and then spits on him claiming that this is his turf.I had it by then, cause I couldn't believe that kids are doing that during their daily time. Drug use is normal amongst teens, and I know they wanted to state that in this movie, but also slipping a girl with a drug that knocks her out for awile just to have sex with her isn't really that true. This movie is extremely informing, but is also informing us of some wrong material. Maybe that is normal behavior in Brooklyn or Harlem, but not in my city.I rate this movie 4\/10 stars, cause it is mostly about lame things that only 'sick' people like my friend Lawrence would watch, he wanted me to watch it, so I did, and I pretty much hated it. He enjoys this kind of crap, and also just bought a movie called Salo which is also very demented, so I hope he doesn't ruin his life and end up making even more twisted films.Kids aren't doing most of these things, trust me, and if they do, then there's nothing that we can do, they're going to disobey you (adults) anyway.

It is about a math-genious (excellently played by Russel Crowe) who starts going to some school, can't remember which, where he faces many diffrent kind of persons. Some like him, some don't. His life goes on and soon he is a teacher and falls in love with one of his students and they get married. But soon after that the problems start to occur. John Nash (the math-genius, the main character) has been working for the goverment for some time and has been performing top secret operations. But soon after his marriage he starts to realize that everything has just been something he made up. His schizofrenia has caused him to see images. Or were they really images?From there John Nash goes on with his life after some time spent in a psychatric hospital and the story takes one twist after another. Very, very interesting movie. I have also learned that it is based on a true story (well, not entirely), which is very interesting.The look, the sound and just about everything else in this movie are just superb, and the story is brilliant. Ed Harris and Paul Bettany also contribu te with some of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in a film. A must see for everyone, I'm giving this movie a 10. It deserves it well!

Though not for everyone, this somewhat cynical story has much to say about a teenager who is dealing with his own fate. I think we can all get different meaning out of it, though, because everything is so complicated from the very start of the film.I don't want to be a spoiler, so if you haven't viewed the movie, please don't read on.To me, this seems to be a movie where the main character, Donnie Darko, must deal with his own fate ... the realization that he is dying and only has 28 days to time travel to his grave and accept his own death. There are also a lot of other stories within this story (i.e., youth rebellion, political and religious dichotomies, the American way of life, and simply the complications that come with being a teenager).The bunny Frank, I believe, helps carry Darko to his own destination ... his own death. When Darko finally kills Frank, he kills his own human existence and opens the cellar door to his own death.The reason I think Darko is really already dead after the fatal accident, which occurs in his own bedroom, is because his whole persona changes after this point. Before this point, he seems like your typical, rebellious teenager, calling his mother a bitch and arguing with his sister. Then, after the accident, he walks around almost like a zombie with a funny expression on his face. He acts silly, and nothing seems to bother him anymore. He also only starts taking his medication after the accident. But Darko having to deal with his own fate is juxtaposed with other themes, such as looks at American suburban life, teenage turmoil, and religious and political themes.Donnie wants to go back to his human existence but knows that he can't. Frank the bunny tells him the world is going to end in 28 days. Perhaps what Frank means it that Darko's world as he knows it is about to end.Perhaps this movie is also a look at our modern medical association and how rebellious and mildly depressed teenagers are viewed by our society. Is there really anything really wrong with Darko, or is he just your typical, pissed-off teenager who must go through the motions to figure things out for himself? After Donnie is already dead and takes his medication, that's when he starts drooling, a possible effect from his medication.  He also stops acting like he did in the first five minutes of the film.This movie is really good. I liked how it is set in the 80s. It made me feel nostalgic.  Everything-- the music, the fast-forward motion-- seems to coincide with the storyline. The fast forward motion seems to illustrate the routine motion of teenage school life with the same stereotypical students (i.e. the good kids, the bad kids, the picked-on kids) and teachers (the young, idealistic teacher versus the conservative, overbearing and even fanatical teacher).I gave this movie an 8\/8. I watched it twice, but this movie is one of those films that you must watch several times, and every time you watch it, you will probably pick up something you hadn't before.

Since Alexander believes in travel through the fourth dimension (time. This is explained in a deleted scene) he starts building a Time Machine (and a very beautiful one at that) to travel back in time and save his fiancée, but when this fails, and he realizes that he cannot change the past, he travels into the future to find an answer to the question why cannot one change the past?. His first stop is 2030 where he meets Vox, a holographic character who is driven by a photonic sphere that links him to every database on the planet. Or as he explains it to Alexander A compendium of all human knowledge. When Alexander tells Vox of his Time Travels Vox takes him for a crazy science fiction fan and simply ignores his questions. So Alexander travels further into time to the year 2037, where a big boom throws Alexander into his time machine and knocks him unconscious, while the time machine travels further and further into the deepest reaches of time...He finally manages to stop the machine in the year 802701 (or at least that what we are supposed to believe, but if you look at the panel just before you can see that number you can see that he has traveled beyond the 99900000 mark... a miss perhaps?). He finds a diffrent world than the one he left, a world where the peaceful Eloi live in their huts and hunt and fish for food and stuff that would would expect from indians... who just live for no purpose at all.Soon he encounters another race, the Morlocks, a fiersome monstrous race which hunt the Eloi for food and they look like they have a pretty bad breath.

Those days where your life turns to crap and you feel like punching everyone in the face.  That's why I can sympathize with Douglas' character.  He's having a bad day and he simply wants to get through it without people p**sing him off.  Of course, he's a short fuse, but what fun would this story be if the character were mild-mannered?Douglas' methods of dealing with his anger are quite unorthodox, but if you had the courage to do so and didn't have laws inhibiting you from doing so, you would destroy a man's store for overcharging you for a can of Coke (85 cents?  Come on!  I don't know a single store around me that charges over 75 cents for a CAN of soda!) or murder the gang members who tried to pester you for trespassing on their property.  I was cheering when Douglas beat the living daylights out of those 2 thugs.  Some of the things he did are pretty ridiculous, but that's what makes him a flawed character.  When I watch a movie, I tend to sympathize more with characters who aren't straitlaced and likable in a conventional sense, because I feel more of a connection to them (i.e.  Kevin Spacey in American Beauty).  I believe we're all demented in some sort of way; Hollywood has a way of making their sympathetic characters way too sympathetic because they're afraid audiences will become intimidated.  Oh boo-hoo!  I'm sure I'm gonna read quite a few comments saying how difficult it is to like a film where the main character's not that likable.  Sure, pulling a gun on a fast food manager and cashier for not serving breakfast is pretty darn crazy--and what he does afterwards is even crazier--but we all do crazy things!  Maybe not as outlandish as that, but crazy nonetheless.But when it all boils down to it, his intentions are pure.  He just wants to go home to see his daughter and hand her a birthday present.  The store owner mistakes him for a theif and tells him, Take everything in the register!  He doesn't want to steal from the owner; he feels the owner is stealing from him for charging 85 cents for a can of Coke.  When he lowers the price to 50 cents, he stuffs a dollar in the register, removes 50 cents in change which he needs to make a phone call and leaves.  As he says, I'm just defending my rights as a consumer.  And when he hides in that rich family's backyard, suspecting that the cops are coming, the father tells him to take him along, thinking he's holding them hostage.  Douglas replies, I have a family of my own.  His recurrent line is I'm just trying to go home.  Through all his anger, you can see spurts of humanity in his character.  For example, when the Nazi gunshop owner throws the snowglobe, which Douglas hoped to give to his daughter, against the wall, he cries out No!  He doesn't want to kill anybody, he doesn't want to steal from anybody, he just wants to go home to his daughter.Douglas' performance is great, one of the best of his career.  And it was also a wonderfully written part for him.  Robert Duvall also gives a fine performance as a straitlaced, mild-mannered but highly committed detective on his last day of work.  And boy is Rachel Ticotin--one of the very few female stars of Con Air--one hot babe!

Those days where your life turns to crap and you feel like punching everyone in the face.  That's why I can sympathize with Douglas' character.  He's having a bad day and he simply wants to get through it without people p**sing him off.  Of course, he's a short fuse, but what fun would this story be if the character were mild-mannered?Douglas' methods of dealing with his anger are quite unorthodox, but if you had the courage to do so and didn't have laws inhibiting you from doing so, you would destroy a man's store for overcharging you for a can of Coke (85 cents?  Come on!  I don't know a single store around me that charges over 75 cents for a CAN of soda!) or murder the gang members who tried to pester you for trespassing on their property.  I was cheering when Douglas beat the living daylights out of those 2 thugs.  Some of the things he did are pretty ridiculous, but that's what makes him a flawed character.  When I watch a movie, I tend to sympathize more with characters who aren't straitlaced and likable in a conventional sense, because I feel more of a connection to them (i.e.  Kevin Spacey in American Beauty).  I believe we're all demented in some sort of way; Hollywood has a way of making their sympathetic characters way too sympathetic because they're afraid audiences will become intimidated.  Oh boo-hoo!  I'm sure I'm gonna read quite a few comments saying how difficult it is to like a film where the main character's not that likable.  Sure, pulling a gun on a fast food manager and cashier for not serving breakfast is pretty darn crazy--and what he does afterwards is even crazier--but we all do crazy things!  Maybe not as outlandish as that, but crazy nonetheless.But when it all boils down to it, his intentions are pure.  He just wants to go home to see his daughter and hand her a birthday present.  The store owner mistakes him for a theif and tells him, Take everything in the register!  He doesn't want to steal from the owner; he feels the owner is stealing from him for charging 85 cents for a can of Coke.  When he lowers the price to 50 cents, he stuffs a dollar in the register, removes 50 cents in change which he needs to make a phone call and leaves.  As he says, I'm just defending my rights as a consumer.  And when he hides in that rich family's backyard, suspecting that the cops are coming, the father tells him to take him along, thinking he's holding them hostage.  Douglas replies, I have a family of my own.  His recurrent line is I'm just trying to go home.  Through all his anger, you can see spurts of humanity in his character.  For example, when the Nazi gunshop owner throws the snowglobe, which Douglas hoped to give to his daughter, against the wall, he cries out No!  He doesn't want to kill anybody, he doesn't want to steal from anybody, he just wants to go home to his daughter.Douglas' performance is great, one of the best of his career.  And it was also a wonderfully written part for him.  Robert Duvall also gives a fine performance as a straitlaced, mild-mannered but highly committed detective on his last day of work.  And boy is Rachel Ticotin--one of the very few female stars of Con Air--one hot babe!

The performances are all first rate, especially the leads but also the innocent script-reader, played by ... well, I've forgotten her name.  Nancy Olsen?  Something wholesome lime that.  She was excellent, and this film, if popular, should have made her a Star, but since I can't recall her name, it's somewhat obvious it didn't.Even the supporting cast was great -- C.B. DeMille, as himself, brought a truth to his role, and great sympathy for Norma Desmond, the forgotten diva, probably based on his real-life working relationship with Gloria Swanson, who did indeed do some of her finest work with him, in his pre-Biblical-spectacular days.Any who haven't seen this film HAVE TO, NOW!  It's entertaining, suspenseful (even though you know Holden's fate from the first minutes), funny, eerie, and wonderful.  The exteriors used for Desmond's mansion have fallen just into the right stage of decay ... the pool looks unkempt and decrepit (even though it was built specifically for the film!) ... the huge 1926 limosine, though gorgeous, is perfectly cast as the kind of limo -- with the leopard skin seats and flower vases -- that Norma Desmond *would* have bought in 1926, when $28,000 was at least ten times harder to earn than it is today.Highly recommended.

One of the '70's finest due in part to a high level of craftmanship in every department  Pakula's deliberate pacing and treatment of the script, Michael Small's tingling music with the soft-screaming voices, perfectly cast supporting players who are riveting even in the smallest of scenes and, most importantly, superb cinematographer Gordon Willis's dark and shadowy look that almost always presents somebody lurking in the fore-and-backgrounds in nearly all of Fonda's scenes giving Klute a disturbingly intense complexity that is absent in most thrillers.  There are a few film performances that I would say rank as great art  Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc, Louise Brooks in Pandora's Box, Brando in Streetcar, Pacino in The Godfather, Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence, DeNiro in Taxi Driver, and Jane Fonda in Klute.  Even if she brings a sneer to your face these days, Klute shows she was an artist at the height of her craft her obviously improvised therapy scenes, her use of silence and stillness in the film's climax, her body language whenever Bree is alone on screen, the long uninterrupted takes where she and Sutherland interact, and especially the sequence where Bree shuts down and goes to a club to relieve the mounting tension only to wind up curling in her pimp's lap show a beautifully studied and carefully crafted exploration of a human being trapped by her environment but who oh-so-desperately wants out.  Pauline Kael said at the time about her work here that no other American actress can touch her  nobody has since either.    Donald Sutherland is a consistantly strong actor who compliments Fonda quite well;  his John Klute is a quiet skeptic who's both repelled and fascinated by Bree's world and when these two are alone on screen, a unique intelligence is displayed and it makes for compelling viewing.  It's a testament to the director and the actors that in spite of the shag haircuts, street slang, and funky '70's wardrobe the 31 year old film holds up as well as it does.  An almost perfect adult thriller that is still powerful, scary and penetrating and makes most other character-driven pieces look amateurish and clumsy.

Maybe that's not an exact quote of the script, but it's my bulls*** recollection.I have such praise for this film, I only hope that my praise is going to the right people. First off, it's a story that's an extraordinary combination of THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF, CINDERELLA and CITY LIGHTS. No one would believe that Bernie the Plant's a hero; The missing shoe was worn by the wrong person; the man who gave sight to the blind (meaning all the regular suckers who wanted a hero) was not a rich and noble man but, like Chaplin in City Lights, just some bum.The City Lights reference is quite clear in the telephone conversation that Bernie has with his son and wife when he talks about going away on a business trip and offering support to his wife (for the benefit of his son and her) when he's really going to prison. The screenplay, by David Webb Peoples, is just about perfect. Dialogue that's the best in a movie since Preston Sturges - and that's REALLY SAYING SOMETHING. Peoples, whatever he's doing now, had an astounding year in 1992 when he had, produced, two of the best scripts ever written by anyone - HERO and UNFORGIVEN. Then, we have Dustin Hoffman's perfect performance. Finally we have Stephen Frears. He did a great job with his material, which, presumably, he would have been willing to cut off a foot to have the opportunity to direct.This movie is what America is really about - total bulls*** that has a beautiful heart at its core.

She is estranged from her family, has problems with insomnia, and her only friends are the people she works with.  Enter Catch (Jim Caviezel), a shy, quiet man who saves Sharon's life.  They both seem to have problems with insomnia and reclusive behavior.  They start a cat and mouse game - she brings him to her apartment, he seems to want to leave, he wants to come back, she tries to kiss him, he doesn't want to be kissed.  She stands him up, he gets upset, then he doesn't seem to care; so, she follows him into his apartment, etc.  It seems like it would get repetetive, but the story is actually quite good.Lopez gives a good performance, probably second only to her portrayal of Karen Sisco in Out Of Sight.  Caviezel is good at these sort of parts, and seems to be in danger of being stereotyped as the guy that weird stuff happens to.  People often complain that the two of them have no chemistry together, not realizing that this is the whole point - their relationship is made intentionally akward by director Luis Mandoki, most likely to make it seem all the more impressive that they still want to be with each other.I have one big problem with the advertising, and two smaller problems. They tried to make this seem like some sort of cop thriller - it is not. You'd think by watching the trailer that Catch is a menacing person, the opposite of what the character really is.  They should have made this film out to be what it really is - a chick flick about an unlikely couple with no chemistry who love each other enough to stick with each other anyway. Consequently, the film only brought in about $24 million.Which brings me to my second problem, the budget.  Why did this take $38 million to make?  I noticed that this was released by Warner Brothers, and distributed by two different production companies, internationally.  That was unnecessary.  They could have easily made just as good a film for a lower budget.

I also didn't get the sex scene - the character didn't seem like the type to have sex with someone after only a few weeks.End spoilerDespite these last few problems, I rated this film very highly, as it is one of my favorites.

Why the heck did they do that whe  they could have just walked through the door and taken the unarmed girl without a problem?Apparently there is some sort of underground train beneath the house that the swat dudes need entrance too, and they take the girl and cop with them... apparently the girl works for them, but she doesn't know it. or something...On the train they find yet another dizzy character. Apparently he works for them too. And he is the chicks boyfriend... and he doesn't remember anything... or something...They step off at the research center and after a very long and boring house scene which makes absolutly no sense you finally get the feeling that something is about to happen. Well yeah, about half of the dudes die to a laser. Ok, cool... Then they have to disarm some kind of mainframe, because they got a feeling she is crazy. But in doing so, they release the virus into all halls of the research facility. Nice going guys! You just released a virus that turns all dead bodies into zombies! Better get out of there quick!! (or just restart the mainframe).However they find out to late, and zome (get it? zome?) zombie action occurs. Bite, screams, blood, gore. Probably the most entertaining scene in the movie, altough it isn't entertaining at all.Finally they decide to restart the mainframe in order to escape, and the mainframe leads them through some tunnels and airshafts through some really stupid and funny (unintentionally) scenes. Sometimes I thought it was supposed to be funny, because of the really, really excessive music and then suddenly... silence... Well, its wierd, and bad. And it goes on and on after that... you have to see it to understand how incredibly crappy it is. But instead spend your time on something else.For a very bad script, some very bad editing and directing, some very bad characters and acting (most of them anyway) and some zombie action I sum it all up to a 2... It almost deserves it. ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 January 2003","score":"","review":"  SPOILERS How could they even release this product into the cinemas? What a waste of time and space! This junk has got to be the worst thing ever made since Death Race 2000, only Death Race 2000 is fun to watch because of its crappiness, this movie is not fun to watch because it is just so horribly, horribly bad!Ok, in the beginning they show a scene where some people get trapped in an elevator and a virus is released in an underground research facility. So far so could, this could lead to some pop corn action. Then we jump to a scene in a house out of nowhere where a naked lady lies in a bathtub. She gets up, gets dressed and walks around this empty house without saying a word for a few minutes. Hmm... interesting.
