[{"date":"1 July 2011","score":"","review":" A little gem clearly meant to be a sleeper hit (it's much too quirky and clever to be classified alongside mainstream efforts), Alexander Payne's ELECTION takes a neat concept for a high school comedy and turns it into a sly, cynical look at current politics. And with great performances, sharp comedic dialogue, and a neat premise, you just can't help but love it.Reese Witherspoon (in a spunky enjoyable performance) plays the over-achieving and slightly obnoxious know-it-all Tracy Fink, who is the fore-runner for the candidacy for student council president. This social studies teacher Jim McCallister (Matthew Broderick, in his usual performance only more unlikable) won't allow. In order to establish a more democratic election (and mostly to get that Fink girl out of the way for some reason), he requests former jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klien) to run for presidency, due to his charisma but with complete disregard for his lack of interest. In addition, Paul's tomboyish sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) also runs purely out of spite, since her girlfriend runs off on her and hooks up with her brother instead. While all this is brewing, McCallister has problems of his own. Whilst happily married, he's also fooling around with his old friend's ex-wife. It's not a gratuitous subplot; it just adds to the crazy complicated world that Payne (along with screenwriter Jim Taylor) has created and it adds to the silliness and cleverness of it all.This is not your typical Hollywood teen movie and very much every cliché in the book is ignored here. Payne's high school is not simply surrounded with easily distinguished stereotypes. In fact, the good and bad guys aren't easily distinguishable here. There's a cunning, scheming side most of the characters here, and yet Payne and Taylor does a great job of actually making them likable (sort of). For example, we hate Mr. McCallister because he cheats on his wife and he would stoop so low to make sure Tracy will lose. And yet, part of us wants him to succeed, just because that Fink girl can easily get on our nerves for being obnoxious and rather b*tchy. Paul on the other hand is a rather nice guy; in fact too nice. He's a sardonic look at those candidates that may know very little about being a leader but somehow manages to get people's votes just because of how popular or nice they are. Meanwhile, his sister's campaign is a simple who cares?, a not-too far cry to what some members of society would choose to think. And this is what the whole movie's about It's about how messy and silly politics today can be and how messy the election of officials can be since mostly everyone plays dirty just to get what they want. It's not just America, but in other countries as well (including here in the Philippines).A neat little gem with some funny performances and a bitingly satirical premise, ELECTION has my vote.

Even given this difficult uncertainty, there's no excuse for the litany of plainly obvious mistakes and misjudgments of Kissing a Fool. The things that are wrong with this motion picture are so glaringly wrong that it is inconceivable how no one noticed them. This sort of fiasco doesn't just get people fired, it should actually end careers.The plot here is almost as old as fiction itself. A guy falls in love with his best friend's fiancée. The guy in this instance is Jay (Jason Lee), a passive mope who is still devastated after being dumped by his ex-girlfriend and is writing a novel about the miserable experience. His best friend is Max (David Schwimmer), a Chicago sportscaster and all around hound dog who, of course, is the exact opposite of Jay in every way. The fiancée is Sam (Mili Avitai), the editor of Jay's book. Jay introduces Sam to Max, they fall instantly into love, move in together and start talking marriage.Let me stop with the plot and explain how this movie goes into the crapper right away and never gets out. First, it opens with Sam getting married to somebody but we can't see who. We're then introduced to Linda (Bonnie Hunt) who claims to have introduced the newlyweds and proceeds to explain how they got together to a couple of fellow wedding guests, essentially narrating the story as it appears in flashbacks. The whole point of this structure is to create a mystery as to whether Sam ends up with Max or Jay. Yet before you realize there's supposed to be a mystery, Linda says she introduced the newlyweds and then we see her introducing Jay and Sam. So, anyone with half a brain has to assume that Jay and Sam are the ones who got married and absolutely nothing, not even Max and Sam getting engaged, ever causes you to reconsider that assumption. There's never a single second when it seems like Sam might end up with anyone other than Jay, but the film still carries out the non-existent mystery until the very end.Secondly, Jason Lee is playing the sympathetic guy in a romantic triangle&#x85;and he has a unibrow. It's not an ordinary unibrow, either. It's one where his eyebrows not only meet but take sharp turns and crawl down the bridge of his nose. It's so hideous you can hardly even notice anything else when Lee is on screen. Lee isn't exactly a matinée idol to begin with and here he's made to look physically repellent.Those two blatant errors strangle Kissing a Fool in its crib. It wouldn't have mattered how good everything else was, it was doomed from the start by those two awful and inept creative choices. And they're both such easily avoided problems. Simply have Linda say she knows the married couple instead of introduced them and there could have at least theoretically been a mystery. Pluck Lee's eyebrows every morning before shooting began and at least the audience wouldn't have been distracted by looking at Lee and expecting him to start strumming a banjo and squealing like a pig.It ultimately doesn't matter because the rest of the movie stinks on ice. Apparently realizing they weren't talented enough to do anything with the old two people are perfect for each other but neither wants to betray a third person shtick, they add in a twist that sounds like something Aaron Sorkin would have resorted to if Sports Night has lasted another season or two. Max wants to test the fidelity of his fiancée, so he asks Jay to see if he can get Sam to want to sleep with him. The filmmakers also include an appearance by Jay's horrible ex-girlfriend and give Max an ex-girlfriend he's constantly hanging around with for no explicable reason. They even throw in a female cousin (Judy Greer) visiting Sam and staying at her house, as though giving each main character an annoying chick to deal with somehow made it funny.Compounding the suck is that Max is a far more interesting and dynamic than Jay and also happens to be the one who pushes the narrative along. When the third wheel of your romantic triangle is the most proactive character in the film, that's a problem.Bonnie Hunt and David Schwimmer are both quite good here, particularly Schwimmer, who demonstrates the comedic skills that could have led him to an entirely different career if he hadn't been cemented in the public's mind as Ross from Friends.Kissing a Fool is a misconceived mistake that people should have seen coming a mile away.

Now, after watching several of his movies I can say that Dead Man is right there among his best. This is a good movie in every way, it has an original concept and a good execution, but it also has a few problems viewers may find it a little slow and sometimes it doesn't have a clear message.The film starts like an ordinary western with accountant William Blake traveling to the town of Machine in order to take up a job. Arriving in Machine, he finds the locals to be hostile towards him and his employer Mr. Dickinson informs him that his job was given to someone else. Out of money and luck, he gets into trouble after he kills Mr. Dickinson's son, Charles, and he finds himself forced to leave town. He is found wounded and unconscious by an Indian named Nobody, who believes that he is the great poet William Blake. From this point on, the film's atmosphere and narrative style somehow dissociate from that of traditional storytelling.Dead Man is filled with symbolism and there are plenty of situations where things have more than one meaning. What I found interesting is the fact that the director left certain details for the viewer's own interpretation. It is one of those films that require multiple viewings in order for the viewer to fully understand what is going on. The film has a slow pace at times, probably to emphasize on the beautiful black and white cinematography. Jim Jarmusch's movie almost has a surreal feeling to it due to the way it is photographed, the lines exchanged between the characters as well as the actions they undertake.The movie's style is the one that makes it unique, but that may also be its weakness. There are several scenes that are perhaps a bit slow and there are moments when I felt that the director threw in too many symbols. As for the music, while I generally liked Neil Young's score, I thought that it was overused at times and it distracted the viewer from the rest of the film.Leading man Johnny Depp is good here as usual and this is the kind of role that defined his career in the 90's. Even though Depp plays the lead here, it is Gary Farmer's Indian Nobody who acts as the defining character of the movie. It is he who acts as a guide to Blake and prepares him for his journey to the underworld.

Likely two men was able to play on this, Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven was able to play on this and made a really excellent take on Slashers.In the small town of Woodsboro two teenagers (Drew Barrymore and Kevin Patrick Walls) are shockingly murdered, a year after a woman was raped and murdered in the town centre. Very quickly the town is thrown into turmoil, with the media reporting on it, but the teens do not seem to be worried. The killer, known as Ghost-face soon targets another Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the daughter of a victim, who luckily escapes. But Ghost-face is going to rest and goes on a mission to take down Sidney and anyone who stands in his way.Scream works because it is set in a world where horror movies do exist and teenagers know clichés. It is a self-aware horror film and has a lot of references to classic horror films like Halloween. Scream is forced to be inventive and Craven who is a master of the horror genre, so knew what he was doing with this film.Even if Scream was not made with a post-modern, self-aware horror with a comic edge, it still would have been an excellent horror film and one of the best slashers around. Craven and Williamson made sure their characters were fully developed, likable or at least normal. Sidney is a character with a lot of a baggage because of her mother's death and afraid to get close to people. She is a likable because is a friendly, smart, decent girl who is also tough. Sidney's friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) was tough no-nonsense girl who could have easily been the clichéd slut role, but that was avoided because she was a good friend and competent. Courteney Cox plays a unpleasant journalist who cares more ratings and book sales more then safety of people and emotional harm. She is not a journalist who is looking to report the truth or for the public interest. But she does come good at the end. The characters of Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Stuart (Matthew Lillard) offer a lot of comic relief particular because of their knowledge of horror films. And David Arquettte is solid as a competent police officer who has a typical brother-sister relationship with Tatum.Cavern made sure Scream was exciting with a lot of action, violence and creative deaths. I particular like his technique of using the camera to follow the victims and move it around the house, adding excitement and intrigue. He knows how to build suspects and he does keep you guessing. I don't get scared watching horror films but you do care for Sidney and the idea of being home alone at night can make you more tense.I do have a criticism. They does not seem to be much of a reaction at the school hearing about two of their peers being brutally murdered. Most people seem to be very causal about it and saw it as something fun, not worried about a serial killer being on the loose or just saw it as an excuse for a party. Come on, if they was a murder in a small town there would be more sadden, grief and worry. Personally I would have focused on this collective reaction, but I am a more serious person and possibly would have a thriller\/a social piece.Overall, Scream is certainly a worthy horror film, no manner what generation of horror fan you are.

Very quickly the town is thrown into turmoil, with the media reporting on it, but the teens do not seem to be worried. The killer, known as Ghost-face soon targets another Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the daughter of a victim, who luckily escapes. But Ghost-face is going to rest and goes on a mission to take down Sidney and anyone who stands in his way.Scream works because it is set in a world where horror movies do exist and teenagers know clichés. It is a self-aware horror film and has a lot of references to classic horror films like Halloween. Scream is forced to be inventive and Craven who is a master of the horror genre, so knew what he was doing with this film.Even if Scream was not made with a post-modern, self-aware horror with a comic edge, it still would have been an excellent horror film and one of the best slashers around. Craven and Williamson made sure their characters were fully developed, likable or at least normal. Sidney is a character with a lot of a baggage because of her mother's death and afraid to get close to people. She is a likable because is a friendly, smart, decent girl who is also tough. Sidney's friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) was tough no-nonsense girl who could have easily been the clichéd slut role, but that was avoided because she was a good friend and competent. Courteney Cox plays a unpleasant journalist who cares more ratings and book sales more then safety of people and emotional harm. She is not a journalist who is looking to report the truth or for the public interest. But she does come good at the end. The characters of Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Stuart (Matthew Lillard) offer a lot of comic relief particular because of their knowledge of horror films. And David Arquettte is solid as a competent police officer who has a typical brother-sister relationship with Tatum.Cavern made sure Scream was exciting with a lot of action, violence and creative deaths. I particular like his technique of using the camera to follow the victims and move it around the house, adding excitement and intrigue. He knows how to build suspects and he does keep you guessing. I don't get scared watching horror films but you do care for Sidney and the idea of being home alone at night can make you more tense.I do have a criticism. They does not seem to be much of a reaction at the school hearing about two of their peers being brutally murdered. Most people seem to be very causal about it and saw it as something fun, not worried about a serial killer being on the loose or just saw it as an excuse for a party. Come on, if they was a murder in a small town there would be more sadden, grief and worry. Personally I would have focused on this collective reaction, but I am a more serious person and possibly would have a thriller\/a social piece.Overall, Scream is certainly a worthy horror film, no manner what generation of horror fan you are.

But the 30s were also a decade of highly emotional and humanist cinema, fuelled by the hardships of the great depression. Lost Horizon sees what was for the time a rare marriage between burgeoning picture scope, in what was poverty row studio Columbia's most expensive production to date, and poignant intimacy in the source novel by James Hilton.Thank goodness for director Frank Capra, who seemed really able to balance this sort of thing. Capra could be a great showman, composing those beautiful iconic shots to show the magnificent Stephen Goosson art direction off to best advantage. But he also knows how to bring out a touching human story. In some places Capra's camera seems a trifle distant, and is almost voyeuristic as it peeps out through foliage or looming props. But rather than separate us from the people it is done in such a way as to give a kind of respectful distance at times of profound emotion, for example when Ronald Colman comes out of his first meeting with the High Lama. The camera hangs back, just allowing Colman's body language to convey feelings. At other times Capra will go for the opposite tack, and hold someone in a lengthy close-up. In this way we are given to just one facet a character's emotional experience, and it becomes all the more intense for that.Of course such techniques would be nothing without a good cast. There couldn't really have been anyone better than Ronald Colman for the lead role. Now middle-aged, but still possessed with enough charm and presence to carry a movie, Colman has a slow subtlety to his movements which is nevertheless very expressive. His face, an honest smile but such sad eyes, seems to be filled with all that hope and longing that Lost Horizon is about. Sturdy character actors H.B. Warner and Thomas Mitchell give great support. It's unusual to see comedy player Edward Everett Horton in a drama like this, and comedy players in dramas could often be a sour note in 1930s pictures, but Horton is such a lovable figure and just about close enough to reality to pull it off. The only disappointing performance is that of John Howard, who is overwrought and hammy, but even this works in a way as it makes his antagonistic character seem to be the one who is out of place.Lost Horizon is indeed a wondrous picture, and one that fulfils its mission statement of being both sweeping and soul-stirring. It appears that Capra, always out for glory, was out to make his second Academy Award Best Picture. But history was to repeat itself. In 1933 he had had his first go at a potential Oscar-winner with The Bitter Tea of General Yen, only for that picture to be ignored and the more modest It Happened One Night to win the plaudits the following year. Lost Horizon won two technical Oscars, but bombed at the box office, but in 1938 the down-to-earth comedy drama You Can't Take it with You topped the box office and won Best Pic.Lost Horizon was in no way worthy of such a dismissal, and is indeed a bit better than You Can't Take it with You. It was perhaps more than anything a case of bad timing. Audiences were only just starting to get used to two-hour-plus runtimes, especially for movies with such unconventional themes. If you look at contemporary trailers and taglines, you can see it was being pitched as some kind of earth-shattering spectacular, whereas it is more in the nature of an epic drama. For later releases the movie was edited down to as little as 92 minutes. Fortunately, we now have a restored version. The additional material that has been reconstructed is vital for giving depth, not only to the characters, but also to the setting of Shangri-La itself. With hindsight, we can look back on Lost Horizon as a work of real cinematic beauty.

A movie once repudiated as a filthy, trash and smutty experience trailed through images that distort your imagination, the movie is now looked at as something more. But how is it that today, even though it has sufficient cult status, is this movie overlooked by some of the fans of cinema? Heck, even some Horror Fans (as both fans of these things) have ignorantly, like myself, just been presented with this film.However, I finally got to see it this week to really gather up my thoughts on it. The beginning shot reminded me of the Warren Beatty movie Dick Tracy (1990) where everything is colourful, sensational and everything is filled with fluorescent lighting representing a very riveting and visually stunning opening to present us with the expectancy of our character, Mark Lewis played by Carl Boem, who just unexpectedly killed a prostitute on a film set; however, this killer is very unique in it that his weapon of choice happens to be the leg of camera. The movie uses fear as a real means of establishing the condition internally and externally; it's a thrilling, yet dull and simple idea, yet what Powell does with it is manifest it in ways that actually causes fear to Mark Lewis; he's a meek, easily shy and very rigid character, using his camera as a means of getting into his mind and flamboyance as a human; it's his comfort zone that really gives him his place with it.Helen (Played by Anna Massey) is really the onlooker and the individual capable of breaking his place outside normality; she does this in subtle ways; for example, she knows of his obsession being really overbearing to him, and she always tries to keep him on track; dating him and also trying to understand his traits. She and the Audience are witnessing incomprehensible images of him as a child, in his secret vault where he develops his films, where we see incidentally Powell's kid being used as a subject towards threat, his antics recorded for means of examining the human animal and timid ways of making him think; appropriately and fascinatingly, Powell is in the film, as if to create a forth wall element and also to show that we really are voyeurs looking through a microscope at the stripped images.Mark is an aspiring film maker, who is making a documentary that is evidently about himself and his obsessive compulsion with the death of women, as they slowly meet their demise within split seconds. But then we're presented with the notion that this guy is an innocuous character, who in his heart can create an escapist paradise Helen, who almost seems oblivious to him as a human being; even his Mum (which I found off) knows that he's something more even with her blindness; it's a metaphor for do you think we're blind? But it's still weird to put in the film. Mark is a perfectionist with the medium and craftsmanship and he and his friend always discuss things to do with cinema veirtie and general pop cult discussions, as they their selves learn the trade. Mark is a soft pornographer as well, and this gives us the genesis to his love with the camera and his deadly fixation with... you know.Powell's experience is really interesting and it is also a statement about the man himself and to the art of film making Personally I think it says that committing yourself to film is part of a whole growing impulse, an obsession and perhaps even a revelation about you as a human being (Mark does have an inkling to his own behaviour), but it also gives you the feeling that with everything at hand, you're truly the stager of something that spellbinds people; not only to the extent of spellbinding audiences but to the point where he excessively nauseates them, and only he can watch them at his own well.

","genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"1 July 2011","score":"","review":" This movie was on AMC this morning. At the time it played in theaters, most critics called it dull and predictable, but as a baseball fan and a fan of good movies, For Love of the Game should get credit for emotional performances from Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston and an engaging, well-structured storyline.A movie that combines baseball and romance has two strikes against it before it steps up into the batter's box because there have been so many middling or downright poor baseball movies made. For Love of the Game stands out because it is about love, sacrifice and commitment first and baseball second.The relationship between Billy and Jane is believable. During a flashback she goes to a game to see him and sits with all the player's wives. When one of them asks her Who are you with? and she tells them, a few of them snicker to themselves, one remarking Blond of the week. And Jane tells Billy later that she doesn't want to be a groupie. Billy works hard to convince her that he really loves her.The baseball action is 95% accurate and realistic, including the scene where an outfielder takes one off the head and it goes into the stands (and how he atones later). Congratulations to the producers on coaxing Vin Scully into doing the play-by-play, though purists may scratch their heads and say Huh? He's a Dodger's announcer. The angles for the action look great, as well as the gorgeous emerald checkerboard field.To be nit-picky, some of Kevin Costner's pitches looked like lob jobs that would get crushed by even an A league rookie.

This is a grand, monumental film. Its place in the history of motion pictures is secure. And so is its place in the hearts of so many millions who have enjoyed it all these years. Many movies are enjoyed. Few are truly cherished. This is one of those few. As new generations continue to discover the film Gone with the Wind just rolls on. It's a movie which will never die. After all, tomorrow is another day.Who, in 1939, could have imagined as immense an undertaking as what Gone with the Wind would prove to be was even possible? One man could, producer David O. Selznick. He had the audacity to believe he could pull something like this off and by sheer force of will he did it. He went through multiple directors, multiple writers, and a seemingly endless stream of potential Scarlett O'Haras. It was a production unlike anything Hollywood had ever seen, epic in every way. Somehow Selznick managed to pull it all together. Risk big, win big. Gone with the Wind was a monumental risk, it was either going to be an epic disaster or an epic triumph, there was no in between. What a triumph it would turn out to be.The love affair between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara is at the heart of Gone with the Wind but the film is so much more than that. It's a long, circuitous journey for Scarlett before she eventually finds herself in Rhett's arms. And what a fascinating journey it is. Scarlett O'Hara is quite simply one of the greatest characters in film history. From the film's opening moments, the sweetness of Fiddle-dee-dee, all the way to the end Scarlett evolves, grows and changes right before our eyes. She discovers an inner strength, a bravery and resolve she didn't know she had. Along the way, she certainly has her missteps. Her drive and determination lead her to do some things which are unkind at best. And the undying affection she has for the man she truly loves, who is not Rhett Butler, will cause nothing but heartache for all involved. But for whatever foibles she may have you can't help but root for Scarlett O'Hara. Even if you don't mind seeing her get her comeuppance now and again. The ups and downs of Scarlett's life make for one of the most compelling stories ever seen.Part of what makes Scarlett such a great, memorable character is of course the performance of Vivien Leigh. Perfect. Utterly perfect. One of the greatest performances in the history of film. Scarlett grows and evolves and Leigh traces the journey perfectly throughout. From Leigh's first moment on the screen you can't take your eyes off her. Her stunning beauty is immediately obvious. Her immense talent would reveal itself as the story plays out. Of course Leigh is not the only great performer on display. If you can't imagine anyone but Leigh as Scarlett the same can be said for Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, a true Hollywood legend in a role which suits him absolutely perfectly. There's also the brilliant Olivia de Havilland playing the incredibly good-hearted Melanie, a character who serves as a wonderful counterbalance to the at-times self-centered Scarlett. She may not be as glamorous as Scarlett but it's easy to see why any man who came to know her would fall in love with the wonderfully devoted Melanie. Which brings us to Ashley Wilkes. He marries Melanie and he no doubt loves her. But he has feelings for Scarlett too, trying to deny that would be useless. And Scarlett has more than feelings for him, she has an obsession. Leslie Howard plays Ashley and one minor nitpick with the film is that Howard is probably too old for the role. His performance is fine, he just doesn't fit his part perfectly as Leigh, Gable and de Havilland do theirs. There are plenty of supporting players who add a great deal to the film. Thomas Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel and Harry Davenport are just a few of the key performers in the generally excellent supporting cast which helps to bring this great story to life.Gone with the Wind is a movie of two halves. The first half, set against the backdrop of the Civil War is probably more dramatic. There's not as much action in the second half but there is plenty to appreciate in this part of the film as well as Scarlett and Rhett finally come together. It's a movie which manages to hold you spellbound for nearly four hours. No small achievement that. The story is wonderfully compelling and it's performed beautifully by the stellar cast. The film looks utterly fabulous, a real Technicolor marvel. The sets and costumes do so much in helping to tell this story, transporting us back to the Old South. Max Steiner's music is another perfectly fitted piece in David O. Selznick's mammoth puzzle. Selznick brought it all together to create a brilliant film which in its day was a monumental achievement and which to this day is still absolutely beloved. A timeless classic which will live forever.

For a quintessential movie buff, story is a mere peripheral element, and definitely not the most important construct of the movie. It is not the story, but the art of story-telling, along with acting, cinematography, music (especially if it is an Indian one) and other technical aspects which I do not completely understand and not even feign to understand make or break a movie. I agree to it, with the only exception that I consider story as also one of the central elements, though definitely not THE central element.

The tensed and apprehensive look in the faces of the town-men before the fight, the sense of relief with which they erupt in the streets after the fight, the unexpected intervention of Marshall's young wife in a crucial time in the ploy makes the affair memorable. While I watched the movie or even now while writing these words, I do not feel like a critic, but like a student of the world cinema. And when I look back and realize it was made 60 years ago, I can not but appreciate this simple beauty even though for its simple one-liner story-line. Well, will I watch it again?

The tensed and apprehensive look in the faces of the town-men before the fight, the sense of relief with which they erupt in the streets after the fight, the unexpected intervention of Marshall's young wife in a crucial time in the ploy makes the affair memorable. While I watched the movie or even now while writing these words, I do not feel like a critic, but like a student of the world cinema. And when I look back and realize it was made 60 years ago, I can not but appreciate this simple beauty even though for its simple one-liner story-line. Well, will I watch it again? Maybe yes, though not in near future. But definitely, I will never mind my bucks or time that I spent on this.

I also need to say something else before I go to the negative side. Kevin Bacon is the best actor in this film. He did a fantastic job with his role. He made you feel how angry he was for not being able to be visible, but he uses his invisibility to his advantage, especially when he decides to kill everyone off so he can live a normal life without no one ever knowing about what happened. Now, here is the negative, this film's plot is below average. It just seemed to take a predictable turn when Sebastian decides to kill everyone. I wish they would have done something different, or maybe even draw out the process of him becoming crazy just to make it more creepy to watch. Also, after watching this film recently I noticed another bad part of this movie, Elisabeth Shue. She is awful, and I mean awful in this movie! She was great in the 80s, but you can tell that she has lost her touch with this one. Every time an argument happens in this movie, she goes hey guys let's just go and celebrate!

My expectations were high and I have to admit, that it belied them. At this view, approximately 3 years ago, the performances shined out for me and I've not really engaged myself in the rest of this mediocre film.My second viewing was nearly 2 years back. Regarding the plot, I was very confused because the beginning stayed in my head the whole 188 minutes and at the end, I couldn't see a satisfying connection between it and the rest, especially between the beginning and the ending. I was expecting some 'Crash'-like connections between the characters.So I gave 'Magnolia' a third shot and I was blown away by it. Therefore, I give it 9 out of 10 and it's in my Top 10 movies of all time. First of all, I have to write about the incredible performances by the whole cast. Everyone is so much into his character and it seems that each actor was very free concerning his play. For example Julianne Moore plays the spouse Linda Partridge, whose husband Earl (Jason Robards) will die of lung cancer. She never loved her husband but now, he is in extremis and she discovers an unprecedented love towards him. Linda doesn't take care of Earl because she wants to smooth things over by reason of cheating on him several times. She takes care of him only because she really loves him. She even wants to change Earls last will although all of his money would be hers, just because she feels dirty concerning her past. The pharmacy-scene is very important to see how she feels. Linda doesn't want to be called lady, because in her own eyes she isn't a lady anymore after all the things she has done to her husband You ... call me lady? Shame on you! We only see Jason Robards lying in the bed but he manhandles the role perfectly not least because of the dialog. Julianne Moore proves that she can handle dramatic roles. Philip Seymour Hoffman (Phil Pharma, the nurse of Earl Partridge) shows that he can pull out a lot of supporting roles. Then, there is Tom Cruise who was nominated for Oscar for his role as Frank T.J. Mackey, Earl Partridges son. Mackey and Partridge are out of touch and Earls last will is, that Phil Pharma brings Mackey to Earls deathbed. Mackey is leader of his own seminar, in which he learns men how to seduce women with his program Seduce and Destroy. Philip Baker Hall, plays the show presenter Jimmy Gator who has an icky relationship to his drug-addicted daughter Claudia Wilson Gator (wonderfully played by Melora Walters).Last but not least, there's John C. Reilly. In my opinion, Reilly is the best of the cast. He plays the officer Jim Kurring who takes his job very seriously. He becomes acquainted with Claudia Wilson Gator and a relationship is about to start between these completely different humans. William H. Macy is Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, a Man who won in Jimmy Gators Show many years ago. His character is very curious, Smith robs money from his work to can afford a brace with which he, as he thinks, would be loved by a barkeeper who also has one. Jeremy Blackman, the youngest cast member plays Stanley Spector, a very intelligent child who is going to be the new Quiz Champion. He suffers under the severity of his father . You see, there are thematic overlaps between the characters, for instance education.The beginning is amazing, maybe the best I've ever seen. Three accounts are told and all are just too improbably to believe them. And at the end of the last account, the narrator says This was not just a matter of chance. This strange things happen all the time.At the end of the movie there are frogs falling from the sky. A frog-rain. There's a reference to the Bible's book Exodus 82, which says And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs. The numbers 8 and 2 are also present in different parts of the movie. So, after my first two viewing I have never seen a conclusion. After the third view, 1 week ago, I spent a lot of time discussing and analyzing this movie. I don't think, that God made the frog fall from the sky just because there's a line in the Bible which comes up with the same phenomenon. But i definitely think that there's a higher force. I have to say The frograin is really important for all of the characters. For instance Jimmy Gator wants to take his life because he will die of cancer and because of his vague past with his daughter (he doesn't know if he abused her or not). He puts the gun to his head and in the same moment a frog is falling into the kitchen, onto the gun and the shot goes into the television which starts to fume. Kurring is driving home and helps Smith to give the money back he's stolen before. Earl Partridge awakes because of the frograin and realizes that his son came for visiting him. And Stanley Spector is sitting in front of some textbooks, sees the frograin, smiles and says This is something that happens. And here, the circle is complete! There are things in life we can't believe. Things that are very unlikely. Not only natural phenomena also phenomena between human beings. At the beginning we hear This was not just a matter of chance. So that says that there is sort of an 'act of nature'. This is something that happens, and it's not a matter of chance.This was my first review, hope you liked it. I finally entrust 'Magnolia' to you and I hope you can enjoy it as I did.

But I don't care, for me this movie always reminds me of the American 4th of July holiday (I'm American obviously) which means summer and fun. I remember the media blitz in the US for this movie, it began months before the release date and all you saw everywhere were black billboards with nothing on them but ID4. The promotion for this movie was huge and very well done. It opened on July 3rd and my then wife and I went to see it that night. It was the only time before or since I've seen a movie on its opening night because usually it's too crowded but my wife actually insisted, she'd been dying to see it for weeks. And it was indeed very crowded but it was also fun, it was the start of the holiday weekend and the movie was playing in multiple theatres and the air of anticipation after that marketing campaign was palpable. It was an event. Did the movie live up to all of that? No, not really, it's not a great film, it's not in my top five or ten favorites. It's a popcorn movie, a check your logic at the door movie. But what's wrong with that? Those types of movies are fun too. And Independence Day is at the very least, good fun entertainment on a big scale. And on that night, at the beginning of the 4th of July weekend, it was perfect. Possibly if I had seen it at any other time I would feel differently but I didn't, and I don't.

She put the story of Madame Butterfly in its place, and then in the much larger context of the Vietnam war that was about to erupt. I do not wish to make any political remarks, but this film was layered very well -- the Madam Butterfly aspect had at least three parallels.Jeremy Irons is excellent, and it is nice to see him reuniting with Cronenberg. This does not have the science of Cronenberg, the flesh aspect, but as he says in a feature on the DVD, he leans towards odd communities as a filmmaker. And truly, there are some odd people here... is Song in love with Gallimard or just playing him? What is her secret? I loved the multiple twists and how smoothly they were revealed.Roger Ebert sees the big twist as obvious from the start, but I think this might be because he cheated. I have to agree with him on this comment, though Irons bases his performance on the understanding that erotic impulses are always completely humorless to those who hold them, even though they might seem hilarious to the observer. That, and Irons naturally has a very humorless persona -- even when he jokes, he is all too serious.I never saw the original play or read it, so I cannot make any educated comparisons to source material.

William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day.It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B.

Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture.From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production.

It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high.Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"1 July 2011","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Enjoyable and riveting comedy-thriller by master of suspense , the great Alfred Hitchcock .On the French Riviera a retired jewel thief nicknamed ¨The Cat¨ (Gary Grant) falling for a gorgeous American girl (Grace Kelly), a high society woman accompanied by her mother (Jessie Royce Landis) , she suspects he's up to his old jobs when a rash of jewel thefts happen. While newspapers publicize ¨The Cat prowls again¨. Then the reformed thief attempting to chase his impersonator .This elegant film contains suspense , emotion , mystery , and a wonderful love story . And of course full of distinctive Hitchcockian touches with red-herrings , dead-end trails and some typical jokes. Based on the novel by David Dodge , being well adapted by John Michael Hayes who writes a snappy dialog . Marvelous performances from main cast as Gary Grant as smooth and likable thief who returns his old tricks and wonderful , icely effective Grace Kelly whose coldness is gradually melted . Grace Kelly met husband Prince Rainero of Monaco during a photo shop while she was attending the Cannes Film Festival . Both of whom form a sensational couple with sparkling chemical . Furthermore , good secondary cast as the young girl Brigitte Auber and the veterans Jessie Royce Landis and Charles Vanel and of course John Williams who appears nicely dressed in black and posing as servant of two glamorous ladies in a bizarre , fancy costume ball with policeman awkwardly masquerading . There's a magnificent car pursuit throughout the Grand Corniche located on a Riviera hilltop road and shot from a helicopter. Deservedly Oscar-winning cinematography by Robert Buks , Hitch's usual, as he photographed ¨Strangers in a train¨ , ¨The Birds¨ and ¨Marnie¨ . Luxurious Oscar-nominating costumes by Edith Head and splendidly created for Grace Kelly . Spectacular and colorful scenarios with excellent production design by Hal Pereira also nominated to Academy Award , and outdoors filmed in French Riviera , Monaco , Cannes ,and Grand Corniche . Lively and jolly musical score by Lyn Murray. The motion picture is colorfully and stunningly directed by the genius Hitch . Rating  Above average , this Hitchcock effort proved to be as successful as his former popular movies.
