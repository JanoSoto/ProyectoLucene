[{"date":"16 November 1999","score":"","review":"  Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon were SO GOOD in this.  Witherspoon is SO perky you could just strangle her.  Even though he had a lot of limitations, I really related to Broderick's character feeling so warm and fuzzy towards over-achievers.  Lots of layers in the story that were nicely tied together by the end.  The rich get richer and the middle class, well they stay in the middle.  Loved the scene where Broderick chucks the soda can at the car, it was the perfect cap for the emotions displayed.
