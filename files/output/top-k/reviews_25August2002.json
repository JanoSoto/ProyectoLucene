It's my favorite scary movie to come out of theaters in a long while, no teenie-bopper s**t here, just pure horror.  The atmosphere and infectious score are second to none.  I love the small glimpse we get of the mansion, with the blowing leaves and evil crows.  It's also very claustrophobic at times and those are often the best horror films.  Paul Anderson's direction is perfect and he succeeds in doing justice to the video game.  The opening of the film is so tense (the elevator scene especially) I had to remind myself to breathe.  There were some other scenes where I just wanted to jump in and start whippin' some zombie tale.  The dog's were incredible and the train sequence was straight out of Resident Evil 2.  The in-joke was also great (Where'd all the bodies go?).  Upon viewing the trailer, the fight scenes looked very anime-esque.  I didn't think it was going to work. However, the flipping kicks and snapping necks make Resident Evil quite original.  It is easily comparable to a few other films though (but I'm not upset about this fact).  First off is the hallway scene with the lasers. Someone watched Cube before designing that sequence.  And then there's the bigger comparison  Aliens.  Both films share basically the same plot, with a strong female lead, but who cares.   The only things that don't sit right with me are the all-too-obvious CG Licker and the character of Kaplan; after all the crap he suffered through, that poor guy deserved to live.  Those things don't take too much away from the film however.  Resident Evil is an exceptional addition to the zombie genre and a great theater experience (I have not had an adrenaline rush like this since seeing Event Horizon, another Anderson classic). Can't wait for a sequel.Note for genre buffs  The newspaper at the end of the film reading The Dead Walk! is an obvious reference to George A. Romero's classic Day of the Dead.

As I was leaving the house, and driving across the river and entering the theater to see The Bourne Identity, I was having that quandary once again.  I'd read the Robert Ludlum novel almost fifteen years ago, and I recently re-read it, just to make things even more difficult for myself (I suppose I'm a glutton for punishment).  I'd liked the story.  I'd even kinda-sorta liked the Richard Chamberlain-Jaclyn Smith TV movie version in 1988.  The novel was a little melodramatic in parts, but on the whole, it was an intelligent, involving action story that incorporated techno-gadget spy-toys of the day (late 1970s) in a realistic fashion.  Moving that story forward twenty years while staying true to the source material would be a chal-lenge.I'll come back to that point shortly, but I also wanted to touch on some of the Develop-mental Hell this film went through in order to make it to the screen, and how all of that affected the finished product.  Those who follow the movie `business' know that this film was shot in late 2000 and early 2001, and meant to be released in the fall of 2001, but 9\/11 pushed that back.  Then, after test audience results came back unfavorably, cast and crew were recalled to European locations to shoot a new ending in January of 2002, and the release date was pushed back even further.  It is something of a truism that when such things happen, the movie is almost beyond saving and will probably stink.Oh, the story.  Man is pulled from the Mediterranean Sea, his body riddled with bullets, a microchip surgically implanted in his hip, and no memory of anything that happened before he was fished from the sea.  The microchip leads him to a bank in Zurich, where the first clues to his identity are revealed, and the more the man learns, the less he likes what it appears he is.  Picking up an unwitting accomplice in Zurich, in the form of a young woman who gives the man a ride to Paris, he ends up implicating her in whatever troubles his past self may have created, and relying on her to aid him.All that being said, The Bourne Identity, did the one thing that a film can do to avoid the novel\/screenplay conflict  it threw out the book, or at least most of it.  And considering the Hell that director Doug Liman and Universal Studios put each other through, the finished product is a well-made, entertaining and fairly believable action thriller.  Director Liman is known for his first two features, independently produced Swingers and Go, neither or which, unfortunately, I have seen.  This picture was his major-studio debut, and his reputation as a visually and structurally innovative filmmaker gave me hopes of something stylish and gritty, maybe like Michael Mann's work.  My guess turned out to be correct.The European locations -- Marseilles, Zurich, Paris, the French countryside -- are not shown in their travelogue-esque glitz and glamour.  It's winter; it's snowing and overcast most of the time, adding to the gloom of the title character's situation.  Liman's camera work does not disappoint, and Matt Damon delivers a top-notch performance that will add `action star' to his resume' of credentials.  The `romance' between Damon's character and his slightly-unwilling companion, played by German actress Franka Potente, is well-handled by the screenplay.  There's no roll in the hay for the sake of a love scene here; the film demon-strates how these two people, both cut off from their pasts in manners of speaking, seek comfort from their fear and learn to trust one another.  The action sequences are not the type seen in your average `bullets and profanity' pictures; they aren't gratuitous and, with one exception at the end (yes, in that re-shot, new ending), they're realistic.Of course, there were three Bourne novels written by Robert Ludlum, and Doug Liman has previously stated that he can envision shooting all three as a trilogy of films starring the Jason Bourne character.  I, for one, cannot see how that can be done, being how the first novel was all but ignored for the making of this film.  But, the James Bond franchise continues to this day, some twenty-five years after the producers of those films abandoned the source material.  Maybe Liman and Universal will surprise us.  However, for this summer, this film is worth your money, especially if you like your action stars not wearing tights or swinging laser-swords.

Picking up an unwitting accomplice in Zurich, in the form of a young woman who gives the man a ride to Paris, he ends up implicating her in whatever troubles his past self may have created, and relying on her to aid him.All that being said, The Bourne Identity, did the one thing that a film can do to avoid the novel\/screenplay conflict  it threw out the book, or at least most of it.  And considering the Hell that director Doug Liman and Universal Studios put each other through, the finished product is a well-made, entertaining and fairly believable action thriller.  Director Liman is known for his first two features, independently produced Swingers and Go, neither or which, unfortunately, I have seen.  This picture was his major-studio debut, and his reputation as a visually and structurally innovative filmmaker gave me hopes of something stylish and gritty, maybe like Michael Mann's work.  My guess turned out to be correct.The European locations -- Marseilles, Zurich, Paris, the French countryside -- are not shown in their travelogue-esque glitz and glamour.  It's winter; it's snowing and overcast most of the time, adding to the gloom of the title character's situation.  Liman's camera work does not disappoint, and Matt Damon delivers a top-notch performance that will add `action star' to his resume' of credentials.  The `romance' between Damon's character and his slightly-unwilling companion, played by German actress Franka Potente, is well-handled by the screenplay.  There's no roll in the hay for the sake of a love scene here; the film demon-strates how these two people, both cut off from their pasts in manners of speaking, seek comfort from their fear and learn to trust one another.  The action sequences are not the type seen in your average `bullets and profanity' pictures; they aren't gratuitous and, with one exception at the end (yes, in that re-shot, new ending), they're realistic.Of course, there were three Bourne novels written by Robert Ludlum, and Doug Liman has previously stated that he can envision shooting all three as a trilogy of films starring the Jason Bourne character.  I, for one, cannot see how that can be done, being how the first novel was all but ignored for the making of this film.  But, the James Bond franchise continues to this day, some twenty-five years after the producers of those films abandoned the source material.  Maybe Liman and Universal will surprise us.  However, for this summer, this film is worth your money, especially if you like your action stars not wearing tights or swinging laser-swords.

As I was leaving the house, and driving across the river and entering the theater to see The Bourne Identity, I was having that quandary once again.  I'd read the Robert Ludlum novel almost fifteen years ago, and I recently re-read it, just to make things even more difficult for myself (I suppose I'm a glutton for punishment).  I'd liked the story.  I'd even kinda-sorta liked the Richard Chamberlain-Jaclyn Smith TV movie version in 1988.  The novel was a little melodramatic in parts, but on the whole, it was an intelligent, involving action story that incorporated techno-gadget spy-toys of the day (late 1970s) in a realistic fashion.  Moving that story forward twenty years while staying true to the source material would be a chal-lenge.I'll come back to that point shortly, but I also wanted to touch on some of the Develop-mental Hell this film went through in order to make it to the screen, and how all of that affected the finished product.  Those who follow the movie `business' know that this film was shot in late 2000 and early 2001, and meant to be released in the fall of 2001, but 9\/11 pushed that back.  Then, after test audience results came back unfavorably, cast and crew were recalled to European locations to shoot a new ending in January of 2002, and the release date was pushed back even further.  It is something of a truism that when such things happen, the movie is almost beyond saving and will probably stink.Oh, the story.  Man is pulled from the Mediterranean Sea, his body riddled with bullets, a microchip surgically implanted in his hip, and no memory of anything that happened before he was fished from the sea.  The microchip leads him to a bank in Zurich, where the first clues to his identity are revealed, and the more the man learns, the less he likes what it appears he is.

Night Shamaylan, the man behind The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.  I expected spooky, creepy, jumpy, and I pretty much got all three, but not exactly in the way I expected, and I suppose that was Shamaylan's intention.  We've all seen the ad campaign for this movie, crop circles and what that may portend, but I'm pleased to say that the ad campaign has not given away too much of this movie, and in today's movie marketing, that's a very unusual feat.  I'm also very glad that even despite reading a couple of other reviews for this film before going, I don't feel as though anything was given away (well, nothing of significance, anyway).Mel Gibson, despite not even being visible on the movie's poster, is the star of the show.  He's a fallen Episcopalian priest, having lost his faith after the seemingly pointless death of his wife, leaving him alone with his two children and his brother, a failed minor league baseball player, played by Joaquin Phoenix.  He awakens one morning in his very empty-feeling house to the sound of his children screaming outside in his cornfields.  Rushing outside, he finds some of the crops depressed into an eerie pattern, a `Crop Circle' phenomenon that, as it turns out, is being repeated at various spots all over the globe.  What could it mean?  Is it some globe-spanning hoax? Are the E.T.'s finally about to invade?  Does it all really matter in the end?This picture has a pace and a mood that is unlike anything any other filmmaker is utilizing these days.  Shamaylan is an original, and in my opinion has yet to make a film that belies that label.  He can take premises that, on the surface, most moviegoers would write off as lighter fare and treat them with a weight that demands serious consideration on the part of his audience.  After all, ghost stories and comic-book super-abilities? Who would pay to see such movies?  Somebody sure has, since more than $400 million of combined box office can't be wrong.Shamaylan's use of comic moments is ingenious, using just enough of them and spacing them out just enough to put us at ease before something else jumps out and goes `boo.'  His use of silence is wonderful in conveying anticipation, which is often more frightening that what we end up seeing. The music in the film is sparse, primarily used in transition from one scene to another, leaving the sounds from the cornfields and the bumps in the night and the looks on his actors' faces to convey the tension of each scene.  I won't say this movie is Hitchcock-like, because Hitch never delved into the subject matter Shamaylan does routinely, but the effect is similar.We don't see much of what it is we're supposed to be afraid of in this film, and that's part of what makes this film so effective.  With all of the time and emotion these characters have to anticipate what it is they fear, we learn what it is that makes them respond the way they do and what issues they have to resolve.  Even when we do see what we're supposed to be dreading so, we don't see it\/them all that well as it\/they remain\/s almost ethereal.  There are so many idiosyncratic and seemingly ridiculous plot points that, in the end, all come together in an almost laughable logic that I kicked myself afterwards for not seeing it sooner.Of course, Shamaylan had help in this wonderful work in the part of his cast.  Gibson's tortured Graham Hess is likely his best pure acting job since Braveheart, but in a completely different way.  Gibson displays a quiet intensity I don't believe I've seen from him before.  This fallen man of God, claiming to have lost his faith, has probably not lost it so much as he just hasn't dealt with being angry with God for the first time.  He tells his brother at one point that if the events unfolding around them indicate the end of the world, no higher power will be at hand to help them.  Even when his brother tells him that he needs to curse and sound like he means it, Graham finds it difficult, and even is laughable in trying.  The two young actors playing Graham's children are wonderful, displaying an off-center emotional state one could believe coming from those six months removed from their mother's death.  The director himself even has a small but key role, and his one big scene is very gripping (but I certainly can't tell why).I wonder how Shamaylan would fare if he were to use his obvious talents in other genres, such as a slapstick comedy or a lush romance or a grand historical epic.  He has obviously mastered the spooky, creepy, jump-in-your-seat genre, so why not try something else?  But then again, why should he bother?

There are so many idiosyncratic and seemingly ridiculous plot points that, in the end, all come together in an almost laughable logic that I kicked myself afterwards for not seeing it sooner.Of course, Shamaylan had help in this wonderful work in the part of his cast.  Gibson's tortured Graham Hess is likely his best pure acting job since Braveheart, but in a completely different way.  Gibson displays a quiet intensity I don't believe I've seen from him before.  This fallen man of God, claiming to have lost his faith, has probably not lost it so much as he just hasn't dealt with being angry with God for the first time.  He tells his brother at one point that if the events unfolding around them indicate the end of the world, no higher power will be at hand to help them.  Even when his brother tells him that he needs to curse and sound like he means it, Graham finds it difficult, and even is laughable in trying.  The two young actors playing Graham's children are wonderful, displaying an off-center emotional state one could believe coming from those six months removed from their mother's death.  The director himself even has a small but key role, and his one big scene is very gripping (but I certainly can't tell why).I wonder how Shamaylan would fare if he were to use his obvious talents in other genres, such as a slapstick comedy or a lush romance or a grand historical epic.  He has obviously mastered the spooky, creepy, jump-in-your-seat genre, so why not try something else?  But then again, why should he bother?  After all, nobody ever asked Hitchcock to do a slapstick comedy, either.  ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"25 August 2002","score":"","review":"  I don't think it is.

All the comments of these people manifested one of those two. They just don't understand that the plot of Forrest Gump is almost totally figurative!

But when you get Forrest Gump, the most genius movie ever that servers you all the above mentioned plus much much more in the most original, creative, imaginative, emotions-evoking way, you cavil and scorn it, say it is boring, implausible, ridiculous celebration of stupidity, has insidious offensive messages... Come on!The superiority of this movie is how it makes a fictitious, fantastic, improbable story almost a believable one. But let's say you don't believe, ok. Then you go and look for messages, and what do you find? Right-wing\/American Dream propaganda? Patronizing southern\/black\/rebel people? Go on, dig some more, miss the real gist. Miss the opportunity to see what's our world like through the eyes of an innate virtuous man lacking grudge, greed and falsity, miss true love, honesty, loyalty, friendship, miss the force to overcome personal catastrophes, miss the different meanings of life, destiny, miss the MOST ORIGINAL CHRONOLOGY of the well-known American history events... and much more.

We report to our appointed place at the appointed time and do our assigned tasks, all the while wondering what it would be like to do something we enjoy, something that fulfills us, and get paid to do it.  After all, we don't say that we rise in the morning to go `play' or `be fulfilled'; we call it going to `work,' as in `toil' and `languish.'  We may even hope that our children will have better luck than we did in finding that situation.This isn't going to turn into some thinly veiled cry for psychological help; it's just the thoughts that weigh on my mind after seeing Road to Perdition, the sophomore effort from director Sam Mendes, the man behind 1999's Best Picture Oscar winner, American Beauty.  If you find yourself exasperated as you look at the movie listings this summer, wishing for more adult fare, then take heart; although the year is only half over, Road to Perdition is already a contender for several awards at next year's Oscars.In getting Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, two of America's biggest movies stars ever, in a film together, Mendes has achieved a casting coup.  Admittedly, Newman's role is the smaller of the two, but as the father-figure mob boss, the role needed some gravitas, and who better than Paul Newman to provide gravitas?  Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, an Irish immigrant in the Depression-era 1930s who had nothing when he arrived in America except a willingness to work.  Newman's John Rooney gave Sullivan a job, albeit one Sullivan wasn't particularly fond of, and a purpose in life.  Rooney comes to admire Sullivan, and even love him as a son.  Sullivan starts a family of his own, and does his best to shield his children from what he does to feed and clothe them, in the hopes that they will make an even better life for themselves.Rooney's blood-son, Connor, does not possess Michael's sense of loyalty and morality (`morality' being a relative term for a mobster).  He knows that Sullivan is the emotional son that his father always wanted, and is quietly envious.  When Sullivan learns Connor is embezzling from the family business, Connor commits an atrocious act and places Rooney in a position where the father must choose between the son he has and the son he wishes he had.One must be warned up front that this is absolutely not your standard summer-movie fare.  A line of dialogue uttered by Newman's character, referring to `the life we have chosen' is taken almost verbatim from The Godfather, and the tone throughout is very similar.  The sense of doom and foreboding is evident from the opening sequence in the film, and only grows as the story unfolds.  The first third of the move takes place almost entirely in darkness, be it the dark of night or the gloom of a rainy, wintery day.  It is only after the tragic events that send Sullivan and his eldest son on the run that we begin to see the light, literally and figuratively.  Hanks portrays Michael as someone who was probably once a good man, but realizes that he's sacrificed his own soul for his children's chance at a better life.  He may be good at what he does, as his reputation in the criminal underworld shows, but he certainly doesn't like it. Newman, of course, is masterful as the tormented father of one man and father-figure of the other, determined to uphold his sense of morality, despite how it breaks his heart.  Rounding out the above-the-title roles is Jude Law as the one character who very much likes what he does for a living -- a hit man sent after Michael who supplements his fees by taking photographs of his victims.I'm sure the tragedy of this film is supposed to be the loss we sometimes feel when our morals force us to do something against the wishes of our heart.  In this case, it's the disappointment Rooney has in his own son, even cursing the day he was born at one point, versus the loyalty he believes he must have for his own blood.  It's also Sullivan's thirst for revenge, even while knowing that such revenge will bring pain to his `father,' Rooney.  I saw it on an even bigger scale how living one's life against his own better judgment can only lead to heartache.  Sullivan lived the life he lived, even excelled at it to a degree, because he felt loyal to the man who provided it, despite knowing it to be wrong.  He hoped, perhaps foolishly, that by remaining loyal to that life while teaching his children something totally different, his hypocrisy would be rewarded.  Even Mr. Rooney's loyalty to his corrupt child is shown by the film's end to be foolishly misplaced.How appropriate it is that `perdition,' meaning `hell,' `loss of one's soul,' or `utter ruin,' is exactly where all of these characters are headed.

Not only does it include this great movie, but it also contains an interview with Quentin Tarantino on the Charlie Rose show, an interview with him and Michael Moore at the Independent Spirit Awards and even a Trivia Track.  It would've been way cool if it included director's or actors' commentary, but I still felt it was worth my money--especially since I got it for a good price at $19.99.Anyways, back to the movie.  This is an inspired, truly original work of art that doesn't appear like the traditional work of art.  This can be considered an art film, but it's not an art film that bores you with pretention after pretention and has almost no momentum to keep it going. This film has plenty of momentum.  Even at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I had trouble hitting the Pause button.First of all, the cast is topnotch.  As many know, this is the film that re-launched John Travolta's career.  And that's great, being that he's one hell of an actor, and this is one of his best performances--the ultra-cool Vincent Vega.  Ironically enough, he was only paid about 10,000 dollars (give or take) for this movie, being that it was shot on a modest budget--though it rarely shows.  And now he's a multi-millionaire.  I think Travolta owes more than a thank you to Mr. Tarantino.  Samuel L. Jackson is also terrific as the ultra-hip Jules Winnfield.  He has some of the best lines, which I will get to later.  Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances, showing that as well as a great movie star he's also a terrific actor.  Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are great in the opening and closing scenes, though I wish their accents could've been a tad less thick. Harvey Keitel makes a moderately short but memorable appearance.  Ving Rhames is thoroughly convincing as the terrifyingly evil Marscellus Wallace. Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette have some funny moments as Travolta's drug-dealing buddies.  And Uma Thurman--though not a very beautiful actress--is perfect as the free-spirited, coke-snorting Mia Wallace.My favorite element of this movie?  (And I'm sure I'm not alone on this one) The dialogue, of course!  Pulp Fiction has some of the most memorable dialogue in movie history.  Tarantino has an incredible knack for writing dialogue, as shown before in movies like Reservoir Dogs, True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawn.  After watching this movie twice (since purachasing the DVD), there are some lines I simply cannot shake out my head.  These are some of my favorite quotesMy name is Pitt, and yo a*s ain't talkin' your way out of this s**t.Does he look like a b**ch?  I said, 'Does he look like a b**ch!'(After the cab driver asks Butch--Bruce Willis--what his name means) This is America.  Our names don't mean s**t.Pulp Fiction is the perfect balance of dark comedy, crime drama, romance and action.  It's a wild, perfectly enjoyable ride that you will never forget.  OK, so this movie does go into the love-it-or-hate-it category. I personally love the movie, but there is the minority that don't think too much of PF.  Whenever you have a movie that's 2 hours and 30 minutes long, packed with dialogue, packed with profanity and doesn't bombard its audience with gratuitous visuals, you can't expect everybody to embrace it with open arms.  In a short while, I've fell in love with Tarantino's unique, realistic and profane writing\/directorial style.  Others can't quite handle it.  I still don't understand the whole violence issue.  In the average movie, you see about 20 guys getting blown away with machine guns all within a 3-minute scene.  Most of the violence here is left to the imagination. Well, I guess people have a strong imagination.My only criticisms are a few slow moments and one cheesy attempt at rear-screen projection (during the Bruce Willis cab scene) in which the cab is obviously not moving and you see black-and-white footage (probably from an old movie) in the background.  But I still consider this a great movie, and one I'm proud to include in my DVD collection.  I can't wait 'til the Special Edition of Reservoir Dogs comes out this week, so can buy it and the Jackie Brown DVD to complete my Tarantino collection.  And is the soundtrack great or what!  I actually bought the soundtrack before I bought the movie, and I fell in love with the music just as much.  It includes such greats as Al Green's Let's Stay Together and Jungle Boogie.  And who can forget that great Pulp Fiction theme?

Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are great in the opening and closing scenes, though I wish their accents could've been a tad less thick. Harvey Keitel makes a moderately short but memorable appearance.  Ving Rhames is thoroughly convincing as the terrifyingly evil Marscellus Wallace. Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette have some funny moments as Travolta's drug-dealing buddies.  And Uma Thurman--though not a very beautiful actress--is perfect as the free-spirited, coke-snorting Mia Wallace.My favorite element of this movie?  (And I'm sure I'm not alone on this one) The dialogue, of course!  Pulp Fiction has some of the most memorable dialogue in movie history.  Tarantino has an incredible knack for writing dialogue, as shown before in movies like Reservoir Dogs, True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawn.  After watching this movie twice (since purachasing the DVD), there are some lines I simply cannot shake out my head.  These are some of my favorite quotesMy name is Pitt, and yo a*s ain't talkin' your way out of this s**t.Does he look like a b**ch?  I said, 'Does he look like a b**ch!'(After the cab driver asks Butch--Bruce Willis--what his name means) This is America.  Our names don't mean s**t.Pulp Fiction is the perfect balance of dark comedy, crime drama, romance and action.  It's a wild, perfectly enjoyable ride that you will never forget.  OK, so this movie does go into the love-it-or-hate-it category. I personally love the movie, but there is the minority that don't think too much of PF.  Whenever you have a movie that's 2 hours and 30 minutes long, packed with dialogue, packed with profanity and doesn't bombard its audience with gratuitous visuals, you can't expect everybody to embrace it with open arms.  In a short while, I've fell in love with Tarantino's unique, realistic and profane writing\/directorial style.  Others can't quite handle it.  I still don't understand the whole violence issue.  In the average movie, you see about 20 guys getting blown away with machine guns all within a 3-minute scene.  Most of the violence here is left to the imagination. Well, I guess people have a strong imagination.My only criticisms are a few slow moments and one cheesy attempt at rear-screen projection (during the Bruce Willis cab scene) in which the cab is obviously not moving and you see black-and-white footage (probably from an old movie) in the background.  But I still consider this a great movie, and one I'm proud to include in my DVD collection.  I can't wait 'til the Special Edition of Reservoir Dogs comes out this week, so can buy it and the Jackie Brown DVD to complete my Tarantino collection.  And is the soundtrack great or what!  I actually bought the soundtrack before I bought the movie, and I fell in love with the music just as much.  It includes such greats as Al Green's Let's Stay Together and Jungle Boogie.  And who can forget that great Pulp Fiction theme?  It was interesting to find out that the song wasn't composed specifically for this movie, and that it did actually exist beforehand.My score  9 (out of 10) ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"25 August 2002","score":"","review":" This is the same movie again, same actors, same characters, except the boys have come home from college for vacation this time, and the climactic party is at a beach-house. They do a pretty good job of it too. Downsides are that some of the characters - crucial to the balance of the first one - are demoted and given little (or little useful) to do. Klein's character and Mena Suvari have already resolved their story, and they're still happy, are given little screen-time, and hardly needed to be there. The character who was the most anonymous of them in the first movie (who didn't have sex with his long-term girlfriend)is outstandingly boring in this movie, not that the actor concerned was given anything to work with. Similarly the chap who had the non-billiards-related pool-table experience with Stifler's Mom - a kind of off-centre intriguing change-of-pace character in the first movie, is a bore here too. As with the above characters he's trapped in a go-nowhere subplot, and his character (undeveloped here) is more irritating than anything else this time.On the upside they give Stifler a more prominent role, and most of the energy that's not from Jason Biggs' performance and character comes from him. I thought Stifler would get irritating in larger doses but you're grateful for the energy. (On the downside Stifler's forgotten younger brother turns up prominently towards the end, and does a singularly charmless variant on Scott Baio as Chachi in Happy Days, which wastes some more time.) Basically the movie is built around Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan, and Biggs is really handy at character-comedy. As they say about young sports guys, he could turn out to be anything. He seems to have talent to burn, and he's very funny in this. Alyson Hannigan is about the only woman in the movie who has to do much acting - and has some comedy burden placed on her character too - and she's really good. The other acting highlight is Eugene Levy as the dad of Biggs' character. Used to enjoy Levy a lot in Second City TV. Different sort of approach here - more realistic, more restrained - but the net effect is at least as good. He's funny every time he's on.The basic good-heartedness, tone, and main elements (romance counts\/fleeting best days of our lives setting\/young guys are sex crazy and it's OK) easily carry the rest. It's a fun movie, though it lacks the focus the first one had, because it doesn't have anything resembling the We've all got to score this summer gimmick which drove the original. It's all very well put together, with the exception of some minor mistiming in the direction and editing of some of the comedy set-piece stuff. If you liked the first one, you're almost certain to like this, and that's really why the movie was made, at a guess.

The African Queen is splendid fun and a must for Bogart fanatics like myself.  Bogart once again plays a rough around the edge everyman character, in this case Charlie Ulnet, a riverboat captain, who engages in an unlikely romance with Rose Sayer, an upper class missionary played by Katharine Hepburn.  She left alone and helpless when German troops overrun a mission run by her brother, and he takes her aboard out of pity.  She proves however to be far from helpless, devising a crazy scheme to get revenge on the Germans who are responsible, by sinking the Louisa a German warship that provides the primary German military presence in the area.\tThe character essentially recaps Bogey's role in Casablanca, he's a man who's a selfish and roguish outsider, on the surface, but he has the heart of a lion-hearted idealist.  Like in Casablanca, it takes the love of a woman to crack his cynical shell and make him into a paladin.  Of course in Casablanca, he was already in love with the woman who fills this role, and in fact her initial rejection of him was one of the things that turned him into a hardened cynic.  In Casablanca, also, the two lovers have to sacrifice their connection for the greater good at the end.  In the African Queen Bogey gets to cream the bad guys and get the girl, this makes the film less bittersweet, but also less complex.  (In case anyone was wondering the characters that Bogey plays in this one and in Casablanca were obviously the basis for the character of Han Solo in Star Wars).\tMost of the fun in the African Queen comes from the chemistry between Bogey and Hepburn.  It's a relationship that crosses class lines and as a result changes them both.  Like so many great movie relationships they begin as antagonists and a series of dangerous situations, survived by reluctant cooperation drive them together.  The process changes them both.  Sayer has a civilizing effect on Charlie, steering him away from his self destructive excesses, at the same time Charlie and the river itself drag Rose off her upper class pedestal, she is made tougher and earthier and infinitely more appealing by the ordeal.  Nevertheless, they retain their essential natures, no matter how she smoothes his rough edges, he remains wild and undomesticated, and no matter how much she weathers the elements, she retains an aristocratic elegance (Hepburn always has this).  The two have their lives redirected by their romance without loosing what makes them uniquely them.\tLike Aguirre the Wrath of God, and Apocalypse Now this movie studies the effects of being isolated with the forces of nature through a long ride down a dangerous river.  However this movie is almost the polar opposite of those films.  Herzog and Coppola assume that the wildness of nature and the oppressive claustrophobia of a people in close proximity will spawn hatred distrust, decay, and eventually self-annihilation. John Huston takes a far more optimistic view of human nature, believing that shared hardship will unite and strengthen people.  Which view is true?  `The opposite of a small truth is false; the opposite of a great truth is also true.'.  The African Queen, shows us one side of human nature, those later more cynical films, show us the other.
