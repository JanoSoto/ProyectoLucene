The first cartoon sequence explains &#150; in graphic detail &#150; how the character of 'Monkey Bone' got his name; and it is not something that can be repeated in this forum.Unfortunately, when I went to the matinée the audience was primarily children.When Stu Miley (S Miley &#150; get it?) is tricked into staying in the 'Downunder' (the place where people in a coma go to) to provide nightmares for the denizens of 'Downunder' the film becomes much too frightening for children; but more visually elaborate and stimulating for adults.The sound track starts out strong and only gets better.Brendan Fraser is wonderful as Stu the comic book author who has a very dark side to him. Bridget Fonda is underutilized as Dr Julie McElroy the sweet and good-natured girlfriend of Stu. Megan Mullally as Kimmy, Stu's sister who wants to pull the plug on Stu (though it is never real clear why) essentially reprises her role as 'Karen' from the television show 'Will and Grace' &#150; but she is always a delight to watch.Rose McGowan ('Scream') is a visual treat as Kitty &#150; the lone citizen of 'Downunder' that is willing to assist Stu in returning to the real world. Whoopi Goldberg is fabulous as Death &#150; just the right amount of sly wickedness that you would expect of an embodied death.But Chris Kattan does a real star turn as the Organ Doner &#150; his physical comedy and outrageous antics as a recently deceased gymnast are truly riotous and quite different from the characters he has played in past films or currently plays on Saturday Night Live &#150; it is worth seeing this film just for his performance.The plot is actually fairly complicated and the graphics and visual style are brilliant and mind-blowing; but again, this is not a film for children.

To have an event driven genre meet these requirements is incredibly hard, but two of the most famous of these battles already waged in the Hannibal universe succeeded in this gloriously and at the same time form this film's main enemies. One is the film Silence of the Lambs, through the fantastic performances of both Foster and Hopkins that are led through its universe by the hand of scriptwriter Ted Tally and the eerie directing skill of Jonathan Demme, that effortlessly returns as the conqueror in both wars. The second is the book that the film Hannibal is based on. I remember starting in the bathroom sometime in the afternoon and reading it cover to cover, skipping every meal until sunrise was nigh. An amazing tour de force that had me diving deep into the darkest ponds of the soul and sympathizing with one of the most ruthless killers ever invented while wondering more about the writer than the characters. It is not easy to join these ranks. In my opinion this film came close, but no cigar. The creative powerhouses in this movie all claim that one should judge it on its own merits, but during the movie, one can't help but noticing it still relies heavily on the memory of the viewer regarding its prequel. True, Scott, Zaillian and Mamet have made a serious attempt to capture Hannibal's playground adequately, true, Hopkins delivers memorable moments, true, Moore is a more than worthy successor to Foster, but frankly I think they haven't tried hard enough to win the war. In my opinion the Hannibal universe is equally character driven as it is event driven, but sadly, focus was put on the latter.  The script allows for generous leaps in the storyline and suffers from loss of the threathening peace and tranquility that made the book and its prequel so enormously good; the musical score is way towards orchestral overkill (they should have stuck with Howard Shore, instead of the incredible amount of people this uneven score took); and oddly enough, there is just, well, too much Hannibal and too little Mason Verger (who in the book after making Martini's out of childrens' tears after he psychologically tortures them immediately ranked among my top list of seriously evil characters). I would have liked it more if the focus of the movie was kept on Starling and if Verger was fleshed out some more. The 40 odd minutes of Hannibal in Silence were of incomparable quality; now, I found only about 60% of his screentime to be actually memorable. I would have liked smaller but more powerful dosages. This time the film was more of a Hopkins vehicle and that simply does not enough credit to the rest of the story. In its favor I should point out that I liked it for Moore's performance, Scott's dark directing skills and its clinical use of extreme violence that Scott has written the book on (although I would very much have liked to see how David Fincher of Seven, The Game and Fight Club, would have handled this one), Oldman as Verger who turned in yet another good show and sadly got way too little screentime, the pigs were there (not credited in Snatch) and oh, for readers of the book, also the dinner scene at the end, that I have to admit was actually one of the sickest things I have ever seen. All in all, a bit disappointing, but worth watching.

Okay, I can see the reasons, but they are too obvious. Both movies are about Starling and Lecter and both were based on a Thomas Harris Novel. But why don't they see that these are two separate movies? The story takes place about 7 years after 'The Silence of the Lambs'. It's a different time and a different director. Demme very much focused on the close-ups and on suggestion, Scott focused more on explicity. But I think Scott really held back in a very good way. The movie was far less gory than all the critics claimed it to be. Don't forget 'The Silence of the Lambs' doesn't refrain from gory details, like the dead body hanging on Lecter's cell, the cut-off face, the autopsy-scene and Jame Gumb's skills as a couturier. 'Hannibal' was not more or less gory. It was of the same calibre.'Hannibal' is a different movie in oh so many ways. Lecter is on the loose now and we simply miss the suspense of him being captured and still dangerous. Scottis very often being blamed for this lack of supsense but the man can't help it. If there's anyone to blame then blame Thomas Harris. But it would've been an almost exact copy of 'The Silence of the Lambs' and that would have been boring.Julianne Moore was absolutely breath-taking. Some people said she was too good as an actress to play Starling. I disagree. She is more mature than Foster. She's not Foster, she's the Clarice of the present. And Hopkins is Lecter, although he describes is as just a part. He carries the movie and provides some of the best scenes I have seen in a long time with a dark whimsical type of sarcasm and irony. He stays within the limits of parody and could have provided himself with a much easier job by simply copying the lines of 'The Silence of the Lambs'. He doesn't. He adds new things to his character. The movie adds new things to his character. One of the most unpleasant things (that I personally did not like) was the fact his sexuality is questions several times. We already get confused in the Mason Verger flash-back scene and he acts rather gay when he meets commendatore Pazzi while holding his cigar.Gary Oldman also deserves credit just as Giancarlo Giannini. The latter is rather impressive making his character human rather than a charicature.Zimmer's musical score is breath-taking and very effective and so is Patrick Cassidy's mini-opera, 'Vide Cor Meum'. And what was most striking about 'Hannibal' in general was its stunning Cinematography. Was 'The Silence of the Lambs' rather dark, 'Hannibal' is warm. It's not just Florence giving the movie its touch it's Scott's feeling for image (his trademark). The movie's opening credits are very original, reminding me a bit of David Fincher's 'Se7en'.Now is there anything negative to mention about this movie? Yes there is. It is far less creepy than 'The Silence of the Lambs', but as I mentioned before it is a different movie. The movie very faithfully sticks to the novel. And I thought the beginning of the movie, let's say the first 30-40 minutes was pretty messy. The scenes are too short and being switched too often to really make an impression. The movie's first big scene, the drugbust at the fishmarket was quite messy also but it was a good opener anyway.All in all a very good movie, with the occasional let down. I loved the shot of the lamb however. That is a merit of the movie it refers to 'The Silence of the Lambs' but it doesn't overrefer to it... it has its own identity.

The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'.  Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 February 2001","score":"391 out of 606 people found the following review useful","review":"  Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations.

Ranging from small ones to heavy ones -Some people may not like this movie for 2 reasons. The lack of plot and graphic violence and sex scenes. but the thing is the violence is hardly graphic (I think the most gruesome we get is when the serial killer swings an axe at someone and blood gets splattered on him and the floor). And the sex scenes... well they are graphic, but they are actually funny. Same with the murders. They all have this hilarious undertone that to me had me laughing through the entire 100 or so minutes.We start the movie off with black credits on the left of screen while on the right a red liquid drips down. We think it is blood since the movie is about a serial killer, but later on we find out it is actually a red berry sauce being served over a nice little meal at an expensive restaurant. Inside that restaurant we meet high power, 80's yuppie Patrick Bateman (the delectable Christian Bale). The movies anti-hero. Him and his fellow workmates talk about why they aren't getting served. Their thinking... because Patrick wont give the waiter oral sex. Later on we meet his fiance Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) as well as her best friend Courtney (Samantha Mathis), whom Patrick is having an affair with. Aswell as Courtney's fiance and patrick's workmate, who happens to be a closeted homosexual. We also meet another fellow worker on wallstreet Paul (Jared Leto).In a hilarious running joke through the film everybody thinks Patrick Bateman is really someone else who they talk about Patrick Bateman with. Saying he's stupid, annoying and down-right pathetic. The humour in American Psycho is very black. Infact it's probably safe to say that the humour is so black, it's impossible to ever gain colour again. BLACK! What do I mean by really black? For some reason I found myself in hysterics with a scene in which Patrick chases a prostitute around his apartment wearing nothing. Absolutely nothing... but unfortunately good ol' Mr. Bateman has a chainsaw covering his area and we don't see anything. Later on in the scene we have the girl running down the apartment stairwell and at reaching the bottom Patrick drops a chainsaw on her. Funny? Hell yes. Scary? no, not really.This movie isn't really scary. Scary as in Scream, Halloween etc because it is not a horror movie. it is a black comedy\/80's satire.All the performances in AP are good. But the movie does belong to Christian Bale who is looking very buff and sexy in the many scenes in which his he is shirtless or fully naked. Be warned straight men, there are a lot of shots of Christian's body while in a shower though we don't see anything too raunchy. Just a little backside.Chloe Sivigny does very good as a the doe-eyed assistant to Patrick. Who does the best silent job ever. In the final scenes where she looks at patrick's work organiser and sees pictures of dead people that Patrick has drawn she just stares and is shocked. Even though she doesn't say anything it is very powerful. Willem Defoe is always cool. Here he plays a cop investigating Jared Leto's disappearance. Even the movie's co-writer\/adapter has a role and a friend of Patrick.Over all this movie was great. Very well made but not for everybody. Mary Harron and co have done a very good job adapting the very nasty book (which I have not read). They should've at least been nominated for an oscar. And Christian Bale was robbed of an oscar this year.

We think it is blood since the movie is about a serial killer, but later on we find out it is actually a red berry sauce being served over a nice little meal at an expensive restaurant. Inside that restaurant we meet high power, 80's yuppie Patrick Bateman (the delectable Christian Bale). The movies anti-hero. Him and his fellow workmates talk about why they aren't getting served. Their thinking... because Patrick wont give the waiter oral sex. Later on we meet his fiance Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) as well as her best friend Courtney (Samantha Mathis), whom Patrick is having an affair with. Aswell as Courtney's fiance and patrick's workmate, who happens to be a closeted homosexual. We also meet another fellow worker on wallstreet Paul (Jared Leto).In a hilarious running joke through the film everybody thinks Patrick Bateman is really someone else who they talk about Patrick Bateman with. Saying he's stupid, annoying and down-right pathetic. The humour in American Psycho is very black. Infact it's probably safe to say that the humour is so black, it's impossible to ever gain colour again. BLACK! What do I mean by really black? For some reason I found myself in hysterics with a scene in which Patrick chases a prostitute around his apartment wearing nothing. Absolutely nothing... but unfortunately good ol' Mr. Bateman has a chainsaw covering his area and we don't see anything. Later on in the scene we have the girl running down the apartment stairwell and at reaching the bottom Patrick drops a chainsaw on her. Funny? Hell yes. Scary? no, not really.This movie isn't really scary. Scary as in Scream, Halloween etc because it is not a horror movie. it is a black comedy\/80's satire.All the performances in AP are good. But the movie does belong to Christian Bale who is looking very buff and sexy in the many scenes in which his he is shirtless or fully naked. Be warned straight men, there are a lot of shots of Christian's body while in a shower though we don't see anything too raunchy. Just a little backside.Chloe Sivigny does very good as a the doe-eyed assistant to Patrick. Who does the best silent job ever. In the final scenes where she looks at patrick's work organiser and sees pictures of dead people that Patrick has drawn she just stares and is shocked. Even though she doesn't say anything it is very powerful. Willem Defoe is always cool. Here he plays a cop investigating Jared Leto's disappearance. Even the movie's co-writer\/adapter has a role and a friend of Patrick.Over all this movie was great. Very well made but not for everybody. Mary Harron and co have done a very good job adapting the very nasty book (which I have not read). They should've at least been nominated for an oscar. And Christian Bale was robbed of an oscar this year. He simply deserves it... more so than Tom Hanks or Russell -tough guy- Crowe, who showed a lot more talent in The Insider.Anyway I loved this movie and hope you do too.And... with the much talked about ending. Try figuring it within a day... or week. I'm still scratching my head as too whether *all* the murders were real or imagined... blah blah blah I'm talking too long.10\/10 or A+ ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"23 February 2001","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  With one of Robin Williams' most delightful and gentle performances, the film shines with a goodness that is very, very rare.

Joely Richardson, Sean Pertwee, Richard T. Jones, Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Isaacs and Jack Noseworthy all do their parts oversatisfyingly well!The story is simple, but it doesn't mean it's not good. Event Horizon is a good demonstration of how you can do an extremely, terrifyingly good movie out of a fairly simple story.There are many scenes in this movie I will never forget, such as all the Core scenes, the scene with Dr. Weir inside the panel-tunnel-room(?) and many others.If you want to have a good, relaxing time in front of the telly with your mom and dad, DON'T see this movie!!! If you're looking for THE horror film to watch in your home-cinema DVD system on a dark and stormy night, this is the one.P.S.

As a kid it was hard for me to completely understand the plot, but as I grew older I was beginning to see the real value of the film! First of all I'd say that Annete O'Toole is definitely best possible replacement for Margot Kidder and I think she should have played in all four installments! The same goes for Robert Vaughn! They are both much more serious than Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman who played childish, stupid and naive characters all the way from the start! Also the whole idea of having an evil Superman for a change is the most original one if you ask me! In other parts it's very obvious who is against who and it doesn't require much brain to figure out the plot! But Sup 3 is full of original tricks (like the one with Pisa tower)! I agree that film asks for a little patience from the watchers, because there are many scenes of conversation and other stuff where Sup does not appear, but film also contains some really romantic scenes that just can't be seen in other parts!
