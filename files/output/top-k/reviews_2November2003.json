The sheer imagination, artistry, and detail in every frame of this work is breathtaking. I applaud Miramax for leaving the American release unedited, both for length and content.Of course, serious fans of Japanese animation will be watching the subtitled version in the original Japanese language.  But given that the majority of American viewers will go with the default dub, a few comments on that version are in order.  The voices are a mixed bag; Danes and Crudup are merely adequate; nothing any competent voice-actor couldn't have pulled off, but a bit lacking in passion at times.  When emotion is expressed, Danes can come off a bit on the whiny side. Thornton's southern accent, though he tries to conceal it, is a bit distracting set among the visuals of historical Japan. Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson are both quite good, however, and bring great gravity and dimension to their roles. Flawed as it is, it still stands as one of the best dub jobs imported anime has to offer (though not up to the standard of the excellent Akira dub on the special edition DVD).Thematically, this is like a return to Miayazaki's roots.  Its elements of man's declaration of war on the environment, and the environment subsequently fighting back are reminiscent of his first film, Nausicaa.  Of course, the animation, breathtaking background work, and sheer attention to detail bring a level of beauty that Nausicaa couldn't match in its day.  Also worth noting is composer and longtime Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi, who presents one of the best works of his career here.For fans of Miyazaki, the brilliance of this film will not come as a shock, but for everyone else, it should be quite an eye-opener. Just don't show it to your children expecting a Happy Meal cross-over with cute sidekicks and musical numbers.

Using Freely adapted as an excuse to attach the title and character names onto a CRUCIBLE\/LAST OF THE MOHICANS hybrid, the end result has about as much in common with the source material as SLEEPY HOLLOW has with Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'...but SLEEPY HOLLOW is a far better film.Okay, there ARE a few good points...John Barry's score is lush, if reminiscent of OUT OF AFRICA; Robert Duvall, as the psychopathic bigot Dr. Roger Prynne, seems to be having a ball affecting a British accent and chewing up the scenery; Joan Plowright, as witchy but sweet Harriet Hibbons is great fun; and Gary Oldman, playing tortured yet sensitive macho hero Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale, is such a 'stretch' from his usual villainous roles that he is almost worth catching the film just to see.However, Demi Moore, bringing twentieth century sensibilities to a 17th century woman, is simply 'eye candy', and from the opening scenes, as she lusts after the naked Dimmesdale as he bathes in a river, to her infamous 'bath' scene, as she runs water over her silicon-enhanced breasts, while fantasizing about him, to her hopping in the sack with him, after her husband is conveniently declared 'dead'...her Hester Prynne is straight out of 'Lady Chatterley's Lover', not Hawthorne! Her lack of respect for the novel was evident when she told critics it was okay to make the ending a happy one because not many people have read the book.

If you are watching THE SCARLET LETTER just to see Demi nude, rent STRIPTEASE, instead, as you'll see a lot more, without having to wade through all the bogus history to get to it.For a well-made and reasonably faithful retelling of Hawthorne's novel, the best version, by far, is STILL the 1926 silent version, with Lillian Gish and Lars Hanson.

Sure it was a B-grade `Scream' clone, but of all the slasher movies that sprung up after `Scream' proved there was an audience for this kind of movie this one was the most entertaining. The original was playful, visually stylistic, populated with a cast of likable actors (Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Jared Leto & Tara Reid - all before they were dubbed hip by teen magazines) and the endurance and tenacity  to follow its somewhat interesting concept for the entire course of the movie.Well, if `Urban Legend' was a B-grade rip-off of `Scream', than `Urban Legends Final Cut' is a z-grade rip-off of both `Scream 2' and `3'. The premise, once again centers around murders occurring based on urban legends. It's a pretty good idea for a slasher movie I must say. Yet, `Final Cut' is not content with just having it's teens be self-aware, but in making every single scene ironic or self-referential in some way. See, our heroes are in a film school program in which students compete to get their script ideas the coveted Hitchcock Award from the college and a shot at Hollywood fame. As the tagline might as well say, someone is willing to kill for it. Our lead (Jennifer Morrison) pitches and writes a script within the movie about &#150; ta da &#150; a serial killer who kills based on urban legends. It is, although, hilarious to think of this movie being as enthusiastically received as it shows her script being. Someone must have bought it as some point because, after all, here it is.  It's not long before the movie starts getting sick of urban legends and just starts killing people off the old fashioned unimaginative way. And so it falls into the usual traps a cast of young people whom we don't know (men we can hardly tell apart and girls only distinguishable by their different hairstyles) wandering by themselves into isolated locations, doing stupid things and getting killed. I've always said that criticizing slasher movies is like shooting fish in a barrel and that they should be judged on their own merits in-genera. But the characters in `Final Cut' do things that are even stupider than usual. The situations they get in and out of are so absurdly illogical that they become laughable even in a movie like this. At one point the killer beats someone to death with the movie's weapon of choice &#150; a video camera, I kid you not. Another finds our heroine running for her life in one scene and then putting herself back in danger as if it never happened in the very next. The movie finally flies off it's rails and into the water in the climax when the killer reveals himself and motives that make absolutely no sense in the usual gun-pointing  finale. It's like the ending to `Scream 2' only incapable of being played as a satire because it's not rooted in anything other than the character's own petty childishness. John Ottman is a decent musical composer (with his best work being `X-Men' and later `Eight Legged Freaks'), but even at that he is like a low-rent Marco Beltrami. After `Final Cut' I doubt he will get another shot at directing. Morrison makes a decent lead. In an early attack scene I was almost feeling for her &#150; not through any amount of development in her Amy Mayfield character, but out for fear of seeing any one of these other clowns take over the movie. Particularly annoying is the laughably incompetent campus security guard (Loretta Devine). Being the only hold-over from the original film, it's perplexing as to how she can bitterly remark about a past killing spree and then completely dismiss the idea it could happen again &#150; even when students run screaming toward her claiming they are being chased. I can't remember a previous film series where the only common thread was not the heroine but a hindrance to the plot. Her job is to show up at the wrong time, point her gun at the wrong person, and even go out for snacks letting kids die on her watch. If I were investigating she would be the primary suspect. Original `Legend' director Jamie Blanks went on to make the insufferable endurance trial `Valentine'. `Final Cut' is at least better than that. As costumes go the fencing mask is much creepier than the overcoat of the first movie (god lord, these killers need work on their costume). Why a fencing mask? We never know. The movie's best moments are when it's parodying something &#150; some are quite obvious and some are downright clever. At least this movie goes for older, more obscure references that reward the audience's horror movie knowledge instead of just a smarty line evoking whatever happened to be popular at the time. That's how you do it. They call back to Hitchcock in more ways then previously mentioned &#150; giving the same actor a chance to play his own dead sibling. Giving the movie the benefit of the doubt there also is what appears to be a reference to Victor Salva's `Clownhouse' and a conceptually clever bit where a gun is tossed into a pile of prop guns (I just can't remember what it's ripping off right now).

The original was playful, visually stylistic, populated with a cast of likable actors (Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Jared Leto & Tara Reid - all before they were dubbed hip by teen magazines) and the endurance and tenacity  to follow its somewhat interesting concept for the entire course of the movie.Well, if `Urban Legend' was a B-grade rip-off of `Scream', than `Urban Legends Final Cut' is a z-grade rip-off of both `Scream 2' and `3'. The premise, once again centers around murders occurring based on urban legends. It's a pretty good idea for a slasher movie I must say. Yet, `Final Cut' is not content with just having it's teens be self-aware, but in making every single scene ironic or self-referential in some way. See, our heroes are in a film school program in which students compete to get their script ideas the coveted Hitchcock Award from the college and a shot at Hollywood fame. As the tagline might as well say, someone is willing to kill for it. Our lead (Jennifer Morrison) pitches and writes a script within the movie about &#150; ta da &#150; a serial killer who kills based on urban legends. It is, although, hilarious to think of this movie being as enthusiastically received as it shows her script being. Someone must have bought it as some point because, after all, here it is.  It's not long before the movie starts getting sick of urban legends and just starts killing people off the old fashioned unimaginative way. And so it falls into the usual traps a cast of young people whom we don't know (men we can hardly tell apart and girls only distinguishable by their different hairstyles) wandering by themselves into isolated locations, doing stupid things and getting killed. I've always said that criticizing slasher movies is like shooting fish in a barrel and that they should be judged on their own merits in-genera. But the characters in `Final Cut' do things that are even stupider than usual. The situations they get in and out of are so absurdly illogical that they become laughable even in a movie like this. At one point the killer beats someone to death with the movie's weapon of choice &#150; a video camera, I kid you not. Another finds our heroine running for her life in one scene and then putting herself back in danger as if it never happened in the very next. The movie finally flies off it's rails and into the water in the climax when the killer reveals himself and motives that make absolutely no sense in the usual gun-pointing  finale. It's like the ending to `Scream 2' only incapable of being played as a satire because it's not rooted in anything other than the character's own petty childishness. John Ottman is a decent musical composer (with his best work being `X-Men' and later `Eight Legged Freaks'), but even at that he is like a low-rent Marco Beltrami. After `Final Cut' I doubt he will get another shot at directing. Morrison makes a decent lead. In an early attack scene I was almost feeling for her &#150; not through any amount of development in her Amy Mayfield character, but out for fear of seeing any one of these other clowns take over the movie. Particularly annoying is the laughably incompetent campus security guard (Loretta Devine). Being the only hold-over from the original film, it's perplexing as to how she can bitterly remark about a past killing spree and then completely dismiss the idea it could happen again &#150; even when students run screaming toward her claiming they are being chased. I can't remember a previous film series where the only common thread was not the heroine but a hindrance to the plot. Her job is to show up at the wrong time, point her gun at the wrong person, and even go out for snacks letting kids die on her watch. If I were investigating she would be the primary suspect. Original `Legend' director Jamie Blanks went on to make the insufferable endurance trial `Valentine'. `Final Cut' is at least better than that. As costumes go the fencing mask is much creepier than the overcoat of the first movie (god lord, these killers need work on their costume). Why a fencing mask? We never know. The movie's best moments are when it's parodying something &#150; some are quite obvious and some are downright clever. At least this movie goes for older, more obscure references that reward the audience's horror movie knowledge instead of just a smarty line evoking whatever happened to be popular at the time. That's how you do it. They call back to Hitchcock in more ways then previously mentioned &#150; giving the same actor a chance to play his own dead sibling. Giving the movie the benefit of the doubt there also is what appears to be a reference to Victor Salva's `Clownhouse' and a conceptually clever bit where a gun is tossed into a pile of prop guns (I just can't remember what it's ripping off right now). A cheeky final scene featuring a cameo from the original film ends the movie on its highest note.

Stanley Kubrick was one of the best directors that ever lived. Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors of today. A.I. is a film that Kubrick wanted to do for a long time but died before able to do it. He was going to be working on the film with Steven Spielberg and when Kubrick died, Spielberg took over. However, though Spielberg does many things right in this film, it still has a split personality. This was a project that interested them both. The problem is that Spielberg makes light entertainment Sci-Fi films like E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. His films, particularly E.T. have a cute side to them. Not so with Kubrick, whose Sci-Fi film was 2001(Im not sure if Clockwork is a Sci-Fi film), which was much more deep than E.T. and Close Encounters combined. Spielberg's films are enjoyable to the public (well atleast most of them), but Kubrick's films were not always that way. Even his biggest success, The Shining, was not enjoyed by everybody. The first two hours of A.I. border on great. Spielberg captures the perfect tone that Kubrick would have had without copying him. Theres a very emotional scene in the woods that almost had me in tears. The first 120 minutes of A.I. represent great filmmaking and could have possibly been a masterpiece. The problem is in the last 20 minutes of the film. Spielberg was doing the things the way Kubrick wanted without ripping him off, until the ending. You see that scene under the water would have been the ending Kubrick would have wanted. But Spielberg did not fully understand what Kubrick wanted and gave it a nice ending. These moments drag and you want it to be over.The flaw cannot be placed on the actors though. Halley Joel Osment does a solid job as David, there actually moments where we think he is human. Jude Law is excellent as Gigolo Joe, he is very charismatic in this role. Feances O'Connor does a nice job in her role. A.I. does well in the technical categories. The Visual Effects are first-rate. The Original Score is haunting in areas. Overall, A.I. is a good movie but with Kubrick it might have been great.

I have yet to see a good print of this film.It's one of the earlier talkies and is scratchy and blurry and a nuisance to watch and listen to. Sometimes the scenes -- even the action scenes -- have no sound whatever, not even wild sound, so it's like watching a silent movie without any musical accompaniment. And then there are subtitles, which aren't badly done, although some of the uniquely German curse words emerge in a milder form in print. (Well, maybe at that there's no easy way to translate something like Scheisskerln into anything other than swine or pig.) It's a nuisance to watch but a powerful and inventive film. Certainly it's got to be one of Peter Lorre's two or three best roles. He's pudgy and young here and it makes him seem vulnerable and helpless even while he's in the clutches of his murderous compulsions. The other roles are rather by-the-book and, if it may be said, sometimes the players overact. A police inspector is not only surprised to hear some news. His cigar and its holder must drop out of his mouth in a cloud of smoke and when he picks it back up his hands must twitch spastically. But it's not any particular role or any particular piece of business that gives this film the impact it has. It's the plot itself. Both sides of the law slowly closing in on a man who cannot keep himself from assaulting and murdering little girls. (There is no violence on screen. When Lorre kills a young girl he's just walked off with, we know it has happened because we see the balloon he's bought for her floating away, catching for a heartbreaking moment in the telephone lines.) Lorre's speech at his mock trial by the underworld is moving in its inarticulateness. The man can't describe his motives. He's not a philosopher but a creature controlled by forces he can't identify. When he's being pursued through the building he's hiding in we can almost smell his fear.Lang manages to introduce a bit of humor into a pretty grim story. Our introduction to the Inspector in charge of Homicide includes a shot from under the guy's desk, so we see his bulk from between his legs, his waistband pulled up to his Hitchcockian chest. And the police capture one of the thieves and interrogate him, trying to find out what the gang was after. They lie to him, telling him that one of the guards who was conked on the head died, and that he's now charged with murder. Lang gives us a quick cut to a shot of the perfectly healthy guard sitting at dinner and stuffing himself full of wurst and gulping from what appears to be a gallon-sized glass of beer. There is some interesting stuff about police procedures too. Good Lord, what thoroughness! They take it step by step, while the underworld uses beggars to track Lorre down. It's a movie without much in the way of subtlety though. None of the characters is very introspective except Lorre. Nobody suffers from self doubt. When they get together for a talk, the characters shout at one another. And the disrespect shown for authority figures is shocking. But maybe the most striking feature of the film is its almost total absence of sentimentality. Little girls are being serially murdered, but Lang doesn't dwell on a mother's grief. And the underworld, although disapproving of the crimes themselves, are primarily annoyed at the murderer for getting the police aroused enough to interfere with their criminal enterprises. When the criminals stage a kangaroo court to try Lorre, the drunken defense counsel rises to make his statement, and he begins with something like, I would like to address the honorable judge who has, I believe, three murders to his own credit. That has nothing to do with this case!, exclaims the judge.It occurred to me while watching the movie that it would be a good film to show in any social science class. It shows a society almost completely alien to ours -- Berlin in the early 1930s -- in which horrible murders take place and the director shows us a society organizing itself against the killer, but without any pathos whatever. Lang doesn't manipulate the viewer by letting us get to know the victims or their families, or by forcing us to listen to long speeches about how terrible these murders are. He lets us TAKE IT FOR GRANTED that the characters on both sides hate the murderer. It's almost a compliment to the viewer. Lang assumes that you already know evil when you see it, just as the characters in the movie do -- so why go on about it? It may be an alien culture but the judgments made are universal in their application. At least in this respect, these people are just like us.

It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course) (but nothing beats the pristine quality DVD). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to.The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist\/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film, acting-wise, above the others in the trilogy by giving Ford a genuine acting equal (let me put it this way, he's only half a notch below Harrison Ford\/Indy in charisma and appeal if that tells you anything). The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises.The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention to characterization. The delightful opening scene (all three movies really open with a bang, don't they?); which details how young Indy got his scar, whip, hat, and fear of snakes; makes for a better prequel than Temple of Doom (and any of The Adventure of Young Indiana Jones, for that matter).The story is engrossing because there's a lot of fun clues offered towards the location of the Grail and, thus, there's a lot of engaging little discoveries (love the X marks the spot scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen this movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up. Either way, it speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances.Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg's career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie's effectiveness is that it's able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that's even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).The supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he's far more menacing than Paul Freeman's Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri's Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne's performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.Harrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance (maybe even his best performance, period) in this particular adventure. With the addition of Connery as his father, it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven't seen before. It's his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond. That, coupled with the superb action and thrills, solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment.

A parody movie is made or broken at its basic concept with the filmmaker's understanding of how a good parody movie works and a knowledge of what it is parodying. From that understanding the movie is pretty much all or nothing. 'Scary Movie' gleefully flaunts itself ignorance around for 80 minutes and invites it's audience to revel it their own ignorance as well. This turkey doesn't know the first thing about parody, its supposed objects of ridicule or even how to ridicule them. And it just gets worse as it goes, dragging out a barrage of eye-rolling, groan-inducing, shock value based jokes that aren't really jokes but the appearance of a joke.It amazes me that the `scene specific parody' is even considered a legitimate subgenera by most critics (Roger Ebert gave this garbage 3 stars!). It's content is simply to lazily recreate scenes from other movies and change them up just enough to avoid having to pay royalties. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and co-written and co-staring brothers Shawn an Marlon Wayans (fresh from the recently cancelled WB sitcom) the movie seeks to poke fun at `late '90s slasher movie conventions' - all to obviously meaning the resurgence of the genera since 1997's `Scream'.The Wayans seem blame that resurgence on `Scream' and devote much of this movie to recreating scenes from that trilogy, sometimes without changing anything at all (Matthew Lillard's 'Psycho' quote is repeated verbatim). It is so blatant it recalls Gus Van Sant's reworking of 'Psycho' in which he simply gave Joseph Stephano scriptwriting credit.  Where `Scream' tapped into the 11th (or Y) generation's ironic sense of humor, all `Scary Movie' does is assume teens like sex jokes\/gross out humor. The `jokes' in 'Scary Movie' are the changes themselves (such as Carmen Electra stopping to strip off her clothes while running from the killer through a sprinkler, or a disembodied head talking back to its killer) with no regard to putting any substance or bite beyond an intrinsic level. Its base level pandering to the lowest common denominator display a `joke' about sex or drugs or recreate a popular catch phrase or trailer moment from another movie and the audience will laugh it up on cue like a pack of Pavlovian dogs.The problem with `Scary Movie' is on its basic level it doesn't seem to understand what `Scream' was about and doesn't know how to parody it. The Wayans brothers view the series as part of the cliché universe of slasher movies when it was actually a self-mocking satire of those clichés. They think `Scary Movie' is clever when it's just being a redundant parody of a smart parody that already covered this same territory. All the Wayans brothers have done here is created a parasite that's stand-alone purpose is to live off and suck out the vibrant life, wit and timely social commentary of a great movie. (Mostly, I speak of `Scream' and `Scream 2' as great since they where the movies that inspired the late-'90s rip-offs and the 3rd merely rode the wave across the finish line with it's early 2000 release.)But there's more. The movie doesn't stop at `Scream', `I Know What You Did Last Summer' & `The Blair Witch Project' (2 movies so bad they set up ample targets to be mocked and the Wayans still can't hit them), but the assembly line writers attempt to take on anything that was popular at that time. Yes, actors lean back and dodge flying plates in slow motion, run around desperate to loose their virginity, and look into the camera and tell us they see dead people for no other purpose than that it would look good taken out of context in a trailer. If you ever wanted the ending of `The Usual Suspects' ruined for you this is the movie to see. It is all so scattershot and without vision that it appears all the writers wrote it separately and then threw their drafts together without giving it a once over to see if anything fit together. There are even moments that the jokes double back on themselves such as when a killer claims his motive is lack of sex despite having sex in the previous scene.The Wayans brothers don't get that the fun of a parody is when it is slipped in subtly with an existing story and the audience is able to feel clever when they pick up the double entendres based on their own movie knowledge. The more subtle and well woven the parody, the more satisfying and funny it is for those of us that recognize it. The more we feel the movie is talking directly to us. Think `Dogma' (or any Kevin Smith work), `Seinfeld', `The Simpsons' or, well, `Scream`. `Scary Movie' doesn't talk directly to anybody. It casts it's net far and wide laying out things as plain as day so that no one will feel left out. The dirty little secret here is that you don't even have to have seen the movies in question to get the references. Who doesn't know that the phrase `I see dead people' is from 'The Sixth Sense'? The only people who will think this movie is clever or funny will need to have been living under a rock, going out of their way to ignore every trailer, commercial, fad and catch phrase of the past 2 years.

With the inmates taking bets on which one of the new prisoners will fall victim to the harsh environment, the movie evolves into a blossoming friendship between the convicted murderer and the prison handyman.  With a growing trust and bond that will stand forever they begin to share in their experiences and over time the new prisoner becomes much more than just a friend; he becomes a man with vision and determination whilst also using the system to his benefit by applying his professional experience within the prison.  The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece portraying the issues that we expect a movie of this calibre to portray, whilst also developing sub-plots with such precision that the entire movie felt like it passed in double quick time.  Rarely do I get the feeling that a movie was totally seamless, but this was one instance.  The acting was first rate, with both Robbins and Freeman putting in the performances of a lifetime.  I must admit I haven't see much of Robbins' work, but if all his other performances slump to deep mediocrity he will still be remembered for his part here.  Freeman was superb as the inmate who has come to terms with Shawshank, believing that hope springs futility and that Shawshank becomes an institutionalised aspect of a mans' character, whether inside or out.  To focus on just two people would be ludicrous, there are a number of other outstanding contributions from the prison rule makers and the band of men that keep morale high enough to contemplate living on through their sentences.  The movie triggered a number of responses personally, the obvious responses of sadness and happiness can be taken for granted.  But emerging through the obvious were issues of friendship, trust, betrayal, hatred, anger and injustice.  So too was there joy and relief, and a new perspective on what life and prison means to many people that I previously hadn't thought of.  Personally, one of the saddest moments I can remember from all of the movies I have seen involves an old book-keeper who has to come to terms with freedom.  For those that have seen it you'll probably concur that it was deeply touching; for those who haven't seen the movie you may see a fresh insight into prison life.  It is a wonderfully crafted film, and whilst I hate banding extreme and blind accolades at movies that can be taken as fads, this will probably stay in my top five favourite movies for it's enjoyment, its direction and it's comprehensive grasp of so many of it's focus points.  An outstanding movie.

Freeman was superb as the inmate who has come to terms with Shawshank, believing that hope springs futility and that Shawshank becomes an institutionalised aspect of a mans' character, whether inside or out.  To focus on just two people would be ludicrous, there are a number of other outstanding contributions from the prison rule makers and the band of men that keep morale high enough to contemplate living on through their sentences.  The movie triggered a number of responses personally, the obvious responses of sadness and happiness can be taken for granted.  But emerging through the obvious were issues of friendship, trust, betrayal, hatred, anger and injustice.  So too was there joy and relief, and a new perspective on what life and prison means to many people that I previously hadn't thought of.  Personally, one of the saddest moments I can remember from all of the movies I have seen involves an old book-keeper who has to come to terms with freedom.  For those that have seen it you'll probably concur that it was deeply touching; for those who haven't seen the movie you may see a fresh insight into prison life.

With the inmates taking bets on which one of the new prisoners will fall victim to the harsh environment, the movie evolves into a blossoming friendship between the convicted murderer and the prison handyman.  With a growing trust and bond that will stand forever they begin to share in their experiences and over time the new prisoner becomes much more than just a friend; he becomes a man with vision and determination whilst also using the system to his benefit by applying his professional experience within the prison.  The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece portraying the issues that we expect a movie of this calibre to portray, whilst also developing sub-plots with such precision that the entire movie felt like it passed in double quick time.

It focuses on a woman in her thirties who, being married to a dullard with children, finds a new, exciting, yet adulterous love with a doctor. Being set in the 1940's, the shamefulness of adultery is even greater in society, and seems almost as if it does not exist. This, therefore, is why the relationship is doomed from the start, and both lovers are unfree to let their passion and love overtake. A previous reviewer of this film appeared to detest the film for it's lead female star's performance, the dialogue and basic storyline, for reasons that suggested they did not understand, or were unaware of the behaviour of society, and different social classes during the period it was filmed and set. Although opinions vary, I think I can safely say that this film is fantastic, and beautifully acted, written (Noel Coward), shot and directed (David Lean). If you are oblivious to what you should expect from this film, at least give it a chance. So many people believe this to be one of the greatest films ever made, and certainly Britain's finest classic. The archaicness of the language, although very British and very proper, gives the film part of its superiority and integrity; and if you really can't get to grips with it, then just have a little giggle at it instead. Another contribution to the film's beauty is the location and how it is shot. Naturally a black and white film, it is set mainly at a railway station, where the unfortunate lovers first, and often, meet. Shots of the steam engines passing in and out and racing by, silhouettes of the characters on lamp lit streets and various camera angles representing the character's state of mind, make this film particularly unique.The diegetic music is that of the classical Rachmaninov concerto, which only makes the film more dramatic and poignant. Also, the occasional powerful sound effects of the trains, contribute to the feelings of the main female lead character, mostly when she is guilt ridden and fearful about the affair. This brings us to the performances. Trevor Howard plays Dr Alec Harvey, whilst Celia Johnson plays Laura Jesson. Howard acts to perfection, with a handsome charming look, and flawless gentlemanly qualities, adding slight sneakiness, which allows his character to persuade Laura into confessing her mutual love for him. Yet it is without a doubt a film dominated by the graceful screen presence of Celia Johnson. She is magnificent as the distraught lovelorn woman, who can make any female viewer completely relate to the feelings of loosing the man they truly love. The grief in her voice reveals her pain and a sense of drained, non feeling acquired after having to let go of Alec, and never seeing him again. She is a natural beauty with, what Alec mentions, her wide eyes, and despite the previous reviewer disagreeing, an outstanding, well pronouncing speaking voice, projected mainly(and most memorably)in narration throughout the film. You may more than likely find the idea of a man and woman, who know very little about each other, falling in love a bit far fetched, however you may also let that slip aside, as the love between them becomes tragic and heartachingly painful due to the circumstances, and because both characters are restricted from taking it too far, and have to learn to let go.Please give this film a chance, as I'm sure you won't find anything else quite like it.

The films is more refreshing that its prestigious contemporary `Goshford Park', and refers to a genre originated in `Grand Hotel' (Edmund Goulding, 1932) in which a series of characters assemble in one place and are tied together around a particular incident. This type of film allows a degree of character study and multiple points of view, according to the character whose story we're following. The whole builds from bits. If the characters have secrets, the better; if the characters are Hollywood celebrities of the golden era, the better for Bogdanovich.It all circles around the death of director Thomas Ince on board `Citizen Kane' William Hearst's boat during a weekend in 1924. Some of the characterization is in the level of caricature, like Chaplin or Louella Parsons. No doubt these two were infamous and non sympathetic. The problem is that Bogdanovich doesn't separate them from their representation. Therefore the characterization becomes infamous, and unbearable on the screen. On the other hand, Hearst is the most successful creation, because Bogdanovich inspired it more in Kane than in real-life Hearst, it was built with the aid of a film archetype. During the scene where Hearst searches Marion Davis's room, this parallel is more than evident.The film also suffers from its lack of pace, maybe because it is based on a play. There is an effort of adding movement by making the characters walk around the entire boat continually or simply by dancing charleston. The story is well built and the dialogue is witty, but a witty line from any of these snobs is not a witty line by the snobbiest of snobs, George Sanders as Addison de Witt in `All About Eve'. Bogdanovich's try to depict Hollywood as a modern Babilonia fails because the director is too affected by his defeat by Hollywood.

Many people thought she didn't deserve it, but when she won for this film it was very well deserved.  Her performance as Martha is probably the best of her career as she deglamorized herself to play a woman who was obviously worn down after several years in a loveless marriage.  However, not only was Liz great in this film, but the entire cast made this film what it was.  Too bad Richard Burton didn't win.  He was one of the greatest actors of his time and he was constantly denied the biggest prize in his profession.However, this film is not for the faint at heart.  If you aren't used to verbal brutality and high tension, this is not the film for you.  This is still a very disturbing film that pretty much went against the grain of films that portrayed marriage as happy and loving.  It is a very powerful film that deserved all the accolades it got.

Let's start with Carrie, herself okay, she's an outcast and she's sheltered, did we really need King to write her as being so distant from reality to the point of being ignorant of everyday common-sense things?  Where's the subtlety?  Why doesn't King go all the way and have her wear a sandwich sign that says `I'm REALLY sheltered' so there's no doubt any viewer (and I mean any viewer) can get it?  He pushed Carrie too far in his attempt to make us sympathize with the poor girl who doesn't know anything . . . and it made me not sympathize with her.Carrie is the most developed, rightly so since the movie is named after her, no one else comes across as anything more than props (cliché props at that).  In a nutshell, the opening scene and credits barely introduce all the characters and then we're off to the prom for the inevitable.  In other words, the movie doesn't really spend time with any characters nor does it take time to be with any characters except Carrie.  What little development there is with all the other characters is a collection of writing gimmicks that were overused when King wrote the book. So if the film doesn't care enough to develop these guys and the situation, why should I care about them? If King or De Palma bothered with developing the characters period, and developing them in a non-cliché way, I'd of been much happier with renting this film.  Heck, and if either of them took some weird yet original twist to the development process, I'd applaud them for their creative and artistic integrity.  The fact is, nothing in this film is developed very well.De Palma's trademarks are here in all their overused and annoying glory.  There's a thing called restraint . . . it's not in this movie.  Really cool techniques are only cool when used right.  Things like the split screen and the camera-rotating-around-its-subject-endlessly got old faster than the CG in Star Wars and the Bullet Time in Matrix Reloaded.  I do admit De Palma has a fair amount of artistic flair, but like Quinton Tarintino, there's just too many aspects (technique wise) going against him for me to get into the film.I generally like Stephen King, and I have a lot of respect for him.  But I did not like this movie, and I really hate to say it, but I feel its success deals more with it being an early De Palma film, an early King novel, and the first novel to make it to the big screen (our society is obsessed with people's creativity degrading over-time . . . the first are always the best.)  And now especially, it was the first (big) teen-telekinesis film made in the 70s which be default makes it old school `classic' horror and makes it `good' by definition.  Theories on its success aside &#150; now for facts.  It did succeed, and I still don't like it.
