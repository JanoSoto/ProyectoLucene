First off, the story. A lonely boy befriends a 50 foot, metal-eating robot from outer space and has to keep him secret from his mum, the government, and the US Army. I really liked the story, it was well-thought out with lots of funny and touching parts in it. And I liked that it was set in the Cold War, because that is when alien sightings were most common. And the way the boy teaches the Giant about life and death and how killing is wrong was the part that really got me, along with the ending. Overall, I liked the storyline and the film's setting. The characters were very believable and very well-played by the actors. Christopher McDonald as the government agent Kent Mansley made a really believable villain, Harry Connick Jr as the junkyard beatnik Dean was very funny and quite cool, Eli Marienthal as the boy Hogarth was quite funny. But Vin Diesel as the Iron Giant was just amazing! I've always wondered what he would sound like if he was voiced by Peter Cullen, but Vin Diesel was superb! His facial expressions and speech made him very believable and cool. Overall the voice acting was brilliant. Finally, overall for me, I really loved this film. It's incredibly touching and very funny with cool action scenes. The acting is great which makes the characters very believable and realistic. Plus the anti-gun and the you are who you choose to be messages were the parts that really made me tear up. In total, I highly recommend this movie! It's a brilliant touching family film for all ages!

I got confused for I didn't remember it as that good; thus,I decided to rent it to see if I discovered something new. Quite honestly, I ended up disappointed because this time I watched it from a much more mature, less sensationalistic, and more critical perspective.The result? I found it utterly boring! There were very few good moments and the actors' performances were OK, but they were never great. In fact, Jaws was fatalistic, totally unrealistic, and very slow . The first 30 minutes were truly tedious. There was not a story, just a shark moving around, and killing people out of nothing. Oh...! this too! Was the mayor so stupid to believe that hiding the presence of the shark from the press and public would not affect tourism? Honestly? How ridiculously silly is that??? Even the greediest businessman would have actually done the opposite,for ignoring the danger would have meant his ruin and the ruin of the whole town if someone else got killed!!! But of course such idiotic behaviour can be seen only in bad movies, and we should not forget that Jaws was based in that nonsensical plot.Furthermore, the shark wasn't really horrifying or threatening but it looked pretty fake. Don't misunderstand me...that wouldn't matter much to me if the plot was logical and attractive -but it wasn't- or if the characters were interesting and well developed- but that was not the case either. Sadly, I never felt particularly connected to any of those characters...I never cared about their fate, because there was no depth there; they were almost caricatures of real people!.So, yeah, JAWS is a classic, and perhaps for many, it was a great movie. Personally, I believe its popularity is due to the fact that it was the first big 'horror' blockbuster; however, there are lots of thrillers\/horror movies even older than this one that show much better plots, characters, photography, and are also much more original and interesting than this film (e.g The Birds). Perhaps many of the reasons why people still find it so 'great' is because of the romanticism associated with the idea of the 'classic movies'. We tend to idealize them.

Take it from someone who loves everything about film and is trying to become a prominent film director when I say you can learn a lot from watching Mr.Brooks film.

Overall, after watching Citizen Kane I kinda became bored of watching old-school films but Elmer Gantry has restored my enjoyment of old- school films once again.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"12 April 2012","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a fairly good action film with some excellent sequences in which a bear stalks and attacks 3 stranded men in the Alaskan wilds. I kept wondering How did they get that shot? There are some amazingly good effects. I did wonder whether or not the roar of a bear is like the sounds we were given here. It sounded a little much to me.The bear and Anthony Hopkins are the main stars of the show, and Alec Baldwin does a creditable job with a character that is written to be weak and not very smart.The adventure element is concocted. One can raise many questions about the sequence of events too. Making a big circle in the way they did was very implausible, since they scaled a mountain. In addition, this film follows the usual Hollywood rule that held in the old days and still holds, which is basically to kill off the black man. There must be dozens of similar adventure and war movies that follow this rule.In this case, the black man is an utter weak wimp who does nothing but complain. He is also very stupid. What a horribly written part! Baldwin's character is not far behind. Hopkins' character is at least sensible enough to have some idea of what to do in the wild, even if he ignores the fact that the sun rises in the east, but then it does get cloudy sometimes.With such weak characters, I kept thinking back to earlier adventure movies such as Five Came Back. Were men so wimpy in those old movies? Or is this yet another manifestation of the juvenile characters that seem more frequently to people today's movies? The script telegraphs the key plot points a little too well in the opening sequence. The music at times is too syrupy and grand when more danger and challenge should be in the air.The character arc of Hopkins is only subtly hinted at, because we don't know much about him at the start. I like his line at the end about all of us face serious challenges but we don't know when or what form they are going to take. But I dislike his final line shortly thereafter that the other men died saving his life. Why should he lie? He has confronted himself and nature in his essence. He has even realized that he has little to go back to. He has seen truths, but then he lies. The two men died because they made grievous mistakes in their choices. At best they died bravely or like men. He might have said They died like men.The strong point of the movie is not its philosophy. It's the conflict between men and a bear. The conflict between Baldwin and Hopkins over his wealth and his wife didn't really ring true as it was written, although Baldwin did, as I said, quite a good job with the part.Let me elaborate a bit on the above. First, too much is given away at the outset. Low-flying birds can bring down an airplane, and this happens subsequently. There is a bear trap, and, sure enough, it plays a part. Bears become man-killers, we are told, and sure enough, act 2 involves just such a critter. Hopkins is given a watch and a knife and, sure enough, they are important later. It's all too pat.It was evident far before Hopkins said that he would kill the bear that this would have to be done. The line went through my head before he spoke it. Meanwhile the Baldwin character was whining worse than the black man had done earlier, and that guy was so inept that he stabbed himself in the leg -- a deep gash mind you -- while trying to sharpen a piece of wood into a spear. Very smart going, mate. Well, this is really Mamet's fault. He could not write a plausible screenplay with the wilderness elements?? He had to concoct this?Now, was Hopkins so dense that he could not pick up, well before this cozy little trip, that his right hand man was deeply hostile toward him? And that he was going with his wife? This is a man who sees all and remembers all. He's a billionaire. He must have an organization that he created. His wife and Baldwin are far from discreet, but Hopkins is that blind? It's all done by writer Mamet so superficially and so lazily. When Baldwin gets around to trying to kill Hopkins, Hopkins does nothing to stop him from loading the rifle. Why? Meanwhile, Baldwin insists they go outside. Why? And once outside, he hesitates and then backs himself up. Why? He is incredibly weak, so weak that I wonder what Hopkins ever saw in him to have him around, and what his wife saw in him. And having saved the life of Hopkins earlier, you would think that maybe his psychology would change. He might even expect rewards, but no, his bitterness actually increases. Why?Mamet lost it in this one as compared with some of his earlier work. We are dealing here with noir-type betrayals, and they are not easy to handle. In films like Too Late for Tears, Out of the Past, Ace in the Hole, and many others, it takes careful development of the characterizations to sell them, i.e., make them believable. Mamet has not done this in The Edge. He has not used the interactions generated by the action scenes to do it either -- the direction of the movie didn't bring it out. So that this aspect of the movie, which is a major part of it, is a failure. The viewer is left grasping for understanding and meaning, rather than feeling these people are real and the events real and the meaning central to human experience.

One can raise many questions about the sequence of events too. Making a big circle in the way they did was very implausible, since they scaled a mountain. In addition, this film follows the usual Hollywood rule that held in the old days and still holds, which is basically to kill off the black man. There must be dozens of similar adventure and war movies that follow this rule.In this case, the black man is an utter weak wimp who does nothing but complain. He is also very stupid. What a horribly written part! Baldwin's character is not far behind. Hopkins' character is at least sensible enough to have some idea of what to do in the wild, even if he ignores the fact that the sun rises in the east, but then it does get cloudy sometimes.With such weak characters, I kept thinking back to earlier adventure movies such as Five Came Back. Were men so wimpy in those old movies? Or is this yet another manifestation of the juvenile characters that seem more frequently to people today's movies? The script telegraphs the key plot points a little too well in the opening sequence. The music at times is too syrupy and grand when more danger and challenge should be in the air.The character arc of Hopkins is only subtly hinted at, because we don't know much about him at the start. I like his line at the end about all of us face serious challenges but we don't know when or what form they are going to take. But I dislike his final line shortly thereafter that the other men died saving his life. Why should he lie? He has confronted himself and nature in his essence. He has even realized that he has little to go back to. He has seen truths, but then he lies. The two men died because they made grievous mistakes in their choices. At best they died bravely or like men. He might have said They died like men.The strong point of the movie is not its philosophy. It's the conflict between men and a bear. The conflict between Baldwin and Hopkins over his wealth and his wife didn't really ring true as it was written, although Baldwin did, as I said, quite a good job with the part.Let me elaborate a bit on the above. First, too much is given away at the outset. Low-flying birds can bring down an airplane, and this happens subsequently. There is a bear trap, and, sure enough, it plays a part. Bears become man-killers, we are told, and sure enough, act 2 involves just such a critter. Hopkins is given a watch and a knife and, sure enough, they are important later. It's all too pat.It was evident far before Hopkins said that he would kill the bear that this would have to be done. The line went through my head before he spoke it. Meanwhile the Baldwin character was whining worse than the black man had done earlier, and that guy was so inept that he stabbed himself in the leg -- a deep gash mind you -- while trying to sharpen a piece of wood into a spear. Very smart going, mate. Well, this is really Mamet's fault. He could not write a plausible screenplay with the wilderness elements?? He had to concoct this?Now, was Hopkins so dense that he could not pick up, well before this cozy little trip, that his right hand man was deeply hostile toward him? And that he was going with his wife? This is a man who sees all and remembers all. He's a billionaire. He must have an organization that he created. His wife and Baldwin are far from discreet, but Hopkins is that blind? It's all done by writer Mamet so superficially and so lazily. When Baldwin gets around to trying to kill Hopkins, Hopkins does nothing to stop him from loading the rifle. Why? Meanwhile, Baldwin insists they go outside. Why? And once outside, he hesitates and then backs himself up. Why? He is incredibly weak, so weak that I wonder what Hopkins ever saw in him to have him around, and what his wife saw in him. And having saved the life of Hopkins earlier, you would think that maybe his psychology would change. He might even expect rewards, but no, his bitterness actually increases. Why?Mamet lost it in this one as compared with some of his earlier work. We are dealing here with noir-type betrayals, and they are not easy to handle. In films like Too Late for Tears, Out of the Past, Ace in the Hole, and many others, it takes careful development of the characterizations to sell them, i.e., make them believable. Mamet has not done this in The Edge. He has not used the interactions generated by the action scenes to do it either -- the direction of the movie didn't bring it out. So that this aspect of the movie, which is a major part of it, is a failure. The viewer is left grasping for understanding and meaning, rather than feeling these people are real and the events real and the meaning central to human experience.

But let me tell you something you probably know, most of the films' inclusions are based on pure 'classical' criteria rather than ratio of laughs-per-minute, and I believe Airplane! owes its place to its pioneering value on the spoof movies' sub-genre, but to say that this is the funniest spoof movie ever made is a stretch. For my part, I believe that Jerry and David Zucker, with their acolyte Jim Abrahams, the ZAZ trio, made the funniest comedy ever with Top Secret! and that Airplane! doesn't hold a candle to The Naked Gun or This is Spinal Tap from Rob Reiner, or a movie hysterically offensive called Man Bites Dog (a Belgian laugh riot and masterpiece of dark humor).But you know (you probably don't, and probably don't care), I used to love Airplane! whose title in French is even more hilarious because it means, Is There a Pilot in the Plane? I used to watch the film so much I could recite it by heart, then after a few years, I saw it again, and many gags fell flat. I tried to figure why I thought the film was 'slower' than the other ZAZ installments. And today, I think I can finally say 'Eureka!', I have diagnosed the problem with Airplane! and it' s a big one, believe me, the kind that can really undermine the quality and\/or the overall appreciation of a film.

For some, it would be Captain Oveur asking Billy if he likes movies about gladiators, the nonsensical exchange between Victor, Oveur and Roger with the operating tower, scene- stealing performances from Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges who picked the wrong week to quit smoking, drinking and sniffing glue the irritating Johnny, the little girl who takes it black like 'her men' (and the boy's priceless WTF reaction), Leslie Nielsen trying to reassure the passengers or slapping a panic-stricken woman, the jive- talking guys, the nun, the sick little girl, Leslie Nielsen having lasagna, how could I forget Otto, the automatic pilot and the 'Putana Da Seatbeltz' signal. I can go on and on, Oveur and Oveur again (yeah, I can do lousy puns, too) but didn't you notice there are two characters cruelly missing?Yep, Michael Hayes as Ted Stryker, the aviator and war-veteran and Julie Hagerty as Elaine Dickinson the flight attendant &#x85; the leads, the actors are good, don't get me wrong, but they're just good. The film features such a colorful and great gallery of supporting characters (even the passengers were funnier) that I couldn't believe it would feature such a dull romantic couple. Seriously, don't you feel like the real star is Leslie Nielsen (R.I.P), and that the directors probably remarked his comical potential? And that Hayes and Hagerty didn't make much a career in comedies after this film (I don't even want to mention the dull sequel) is a credit to my theory that Airplane! could have been better wit other actors. Am I alone who hated the flashback parts, not unfunny but too long without bringing much to the film, it distracted from the gripping atmosphere inside the plane to feature some 'meh' scenes.God, the dreadful flashbacks! As much as I loved Elmer Bernstein's opening score, I couldn't stand the romantic tune that was overplayed ad nausea. Just because Airplane! features a hilarious script and gags that sound great on the papers, I don't think it means you should take your casting for granted, some parts begged for a funny gag to work as the pay-off rewarding our patience but no.

I really didn't understand much of what was going on, and declared it was boring. Now today I decided to watch the film, forgetting that I was just a little kid, and was fully prepared to absorb myself into mature emotions that I never understood back then... And surprisingly, I was in for an experience, because Good Will Hunting is like a more understanding version of Shawshank Redemption. While that movie can be good in it's own ways, this one contains realism alongside the emotions, which is better already. So the acting, as you can already tell, is going to be brilliant. Robin Williams (if he's not playing in a children's film) gives the film it's best, and does it best. I love Matt Damon as well, and he basically carried the film with Williams. The supporting cast was great as well. Everything else was great too, but instead of praising the film we already know is GOOD, I want to point out my annoyances that brought down the score. The film tends to get a little corny. Now don't get me wrong, the film is well-acted, but some scenes totally trashed this idea.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"12 April 2012","score":"","review":" Paradise Lost The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills (1996) **** (out of 4) Heartbreaking, shocking and at times disturbing documentary about three teens (Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, Jr.) put on trial for the murder of three 8-year-old boys in West Memphis, Arkansas. The documentary, running 150-minutes, digs into the pre-trial hype surrounding the case and goes all through the trial up to the conviction of the teens. PARADISE LOST THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS is a film that got a lot of attention when it was first released but I missed out on it. In fact, I really hadn't paid too much attention to the case, although I had certainly heard about it. Going into watching this I was unaware of any of the evidence or lack thereof and I also wasn't certain about anything in the story. I'm not going to sit here and say the boys did or didn't commit the crimes but you really do have to wonder about the motives for them being found guilty. I do think the word evidence is very loosely used here and for the life of me I can't help but think things like heavy metal music and black clothes got them convicted. People are so terrified of those who dress in black yet I'm sure this redneck town had heard of Johnny Cash and I don't think they'd look at his clothes and see Satan worshipper. What impressed me most about the documentary is how open they are to all of the families involved. This includes the family of the three kids who were murdered as well as the families of the three teens convicted. The filmmakers did the right thing by not placing one over the other. While it's clear that they do paint that there's a lot of strange things going on throughout the trial, not once do they take away from the victim's families and this here is very important. The entire backwoods world is probably going to strike many as weird. The families say some pretty strange things. They act or say things that some might object to but I think what's so fascinating is that we're really seeing these people as they try to get on with their lives after losing their kids. Some of the victim's parents talk about killing the teens themselves and we even hear one guy talking about what he wants to do to them. Some might be turned off by this but I think it's an honest reaction to having your kid stolen from you and you wanting revenge. Even some of the teen's families come across saying bad things but it's good they're in the movie because it's an honest reaction to hearing your loved ones have been found guilty of something you don't think they did.Directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky have taken a truly grisly triple murder and turned it into some of the greatest drama you're going to witness. The events of the murders are just so chilling that you want to see justice done but at the same time the evidence on which the three were convicted is so questionable that you can't help but think that more crimes have been committed. Again, I don't know the truth. Perhaps the three teens did have something to do with it but there just wasn't any evidence. Perhaps they're innocent and have been found guilty because of the way they look. Either way, PARADISE LOST shows the pain of families who have had their children taken away from them in one way or another and the human drama here is something painful to watch but at the same time fascinating. The movie certainly gives one a lot to think about and discuss.

He tried to explain to the cashier what the deal was when I left he was still scratching his head. The manager had to close down the line for a while.

Was Simon just an evil entity or a demon that took possession of who ever enter the room after Mary died? Why did we see Hank in the stairway only to see him a few senses later in a dark tunnel... Way to much was left open and not explained very well. And the haunted asylum bit is getting a little old. But what the story was lacking the acting made up for, and the cast in this feature was actually great. I don't believe the movie was a waste of time, just a little to open for my tastes.

Yes, the plot is nothing groundbreaking. Yes, the acting is a little wooden. Yes, some of the optical effects are looking a little dated. But, this is one of those classics that just never grows dull even after multiple viewings. The story is quite thin, but is fast paced and when the action does happen, it happens with bells and whistles on! The characters are all well defined and likable in a macho muscles and guns kind of way. And of course there is the Predator itself, which is a true classic of monster design. The creature effects are just outstanding, especially the unmasking sequence which is going to be one of those movie clips that will be shown in many years to come. Even though this is an Arnie vehicle, he just plays second string to the title character, and it does make a change to see him get the absolute crap kicked out of him. All in all, this is a stand-out movie, and if by some small reason you have never seen it, you really need to go and buy it on DVD now!

The tone of the movie is all over the place, aiming for wacky and scary by turns, but that sort of approach (familiar to Abbott and Costello fans) takes finesse that is not on display here. The production designers worked hard to create an attractive and convincing modern monster movie setting and mostly succeeded, but the script has a too-many-rewrites-by- committee feel and the material is very weak for the most part. Geena Davis has a very appealing bit as a beautiful vampire wannabe, but most of the supporting performances are not well fleshed out and are occasionally just absurd. Joseph Bologna, as always, chews the scenery outrageously as a mad scientist, plus Michael Richards is just annoying and unfunny as a clumsy bellhop. There are a few genuine laughs here and Davis' first appearance in vampire gear is worth a rewind, but most of the movie is just exasperatingly unfunny and tiresome. Avoid.

Who really cares about what happened to Rubin Carter? Who knows whether he was innocent or guilty? The movie suggest that his arrest and conviction was unfair, and maybe it was. But how does that translate into something dramatic? The criminal justice system is not perfect, and miscarriages of justice happen. Now, do these miscarriages of justice make for good drama? The answer is no, because of the highly bureaucratic nature of the criminal justice system which reduces even the most explosive situations down to case files and case numbers, which perhaps is the way it is supposed to be. Mr. Carter's case was initiated, processed, and finalized, and while he was going through the process, many other defendants were going through the same process too. For each defendant the process is dramatic because their life is being affected, but for everyone else, it's just a case. If Mr. Carter was in fact wrongly accused and convicted, then that is a tragedy, but one the depth of which cannot be conveyed in a movie. The injustice is smothered by the sheer weight of the paperwork which highlights the essential indifference of an unfeeling bureaucracy which reduces its subjects to case numbers and treats them accordingly.
