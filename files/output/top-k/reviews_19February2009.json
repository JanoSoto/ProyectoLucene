[{"date":"19 February 2009","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Supposedly (David Zucker) is one of my favorites. His name was over so many good, actually super good, comedies whether as a writer, director, or producer. Such as  (Airplane! - 1980), (Top Secret! - 1984), (The Naked Gun's series), (Brain Donors - 1992), or even (High School High - 1996). But the fact of him being the writer, director and producer of (BASEketball - 1998) is totally a disaster ! It's the worst of him (till that time). The basic factor to make you laugh here was the assumption that all the characters is gay, sexually gay. Look closer to understand the very easy method; starting from (Ernest Borgnine), to the silly sidekick, ending with the 2 leads themselves having a sickening kiss (even the cameo of Robert Stack !). This tune isn't the only truly nasty thing, the whole movie is trying to be as dull and dirty as it can be. The sad matter is not my own annoyance out of the name of gifted artist I love being on detestable work like this, but also because the main idea was so smart in its core. The BASEketball sport could've been something creative indeed, especially with the witty satire against the media or the sport industry, but the movie as a whole was dead set to not think at all while it deals with thoughtful issues !! It was a good idea and plot however the process after was way lower. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be exactly  a buddy-comedy in the era of post-Dumb & Dumber (1994), or a farce about the sport world. It managed eventually to be something too zany to stand, and too nasty to be droll. Save (Robert Vaughn) who I've never imagined that I would like him one day and through a comedy, the performance was totally obnoxious; for little example (Dian Bachar) as (Squeak) was unbearable to the extent that I hated every second he was in. (Trey Parker) looks terrible in this long yellow hair and (Matt Stone) seems repugnant more than funny to say the least; actually both as the leads were between weak and average. The super gorgeous (Yasmine Bleeth) looks really stray (they didn't try to make a laugh out of her ever ?!), I think she's one of the real stars that were never given the chance to be a real star, and she'll live the rest of her life appearing in lousy TV movies, shows, or idiot movies like this one. It gets on your nerve badly when you watch the posters and find no presence for her at all (they put Jenny McCarthy instead ???!!!). Overall there is a hilarious spirit but sure the comedy doesn't hit the mark much. The real good parts are few and swift. The details in the background (like Airplane previously or The Simpsons after) weren't well-made or made in the first place, it's some sign that this comedy was brain-dead itself. If the main point was making a vulgar, squalid, and emetic comedy, then (Zucker) succeeded. Yet it's paltry, crazy, and sick like hamburger caught the mad cow disease !

","genre":"Comedy, Sport"},{"date":"19 February 2009","score":"","review":" There were a myriad of reasons for viewers in 1960 to be wary of a cinematic adaptation of H.G. Wells' timeless science fiction parable The Time Machine, despite its dramatic adventure storyline suggesting perfect fodder for an enthralling movie experience. Nonetheless, no matter how dramatic the storyline, the concern would remain, as with many such literary adaptations, that the translation would either remain overly wordy and suffer cinematically as consequence, or, through an attempt to Hollywoodize the text, overly deviate from what made the source material such a success. Similarly, even with recent advances in special effect technology, it would be easy to see the power of the novel diluted through campy, sub par visual effects, even for viewers at the time. A final fear would have been that, given the general trend of movies attempting to be bigger and better to lure viewers away from their television sets, the philosophical and introspective dimensions of Wells' text would be lost in favour of showy spectacle. However, as miraculous it may seem, director George Pal's The Time Machine, while far from a perfect film, manages to refute all of the aforementioned concerns and still excel as a highly enjoyable product of its time.Like most classic science-fiction films made during the cold war era, the film ends up morphing into a non-violence morality play (a poignant statement is made when Wells stops his time machine twice in a row, in 1917 and 1940, believing the same war to still be going on), but despite the supposedly cheery Technicolor trappings, dares to push the envelope to envision a particularly bleak future tantalisingly close to the external real life context of the time, predicting worldwide nuclear destruction only six years after the movie's release. However, there is an ironic inconsistency in such an anti-violence message, considering that during the climactic segment taking place in the extreme future (the year 80,000) it is only through the time travelling Wells' introducing the notion of violence to the naive, childlike race of human descendants, the Eloi, that they can finally rise above their cannibalistic Morlock oppressors. This climactic end battle also leads to a vaguely troublesome moral stance when considering the savage Morlocks are also descendants of current day humans, making Wells' instant opposition to them akin to a form of racial discrimination when taken out of context. David Duncan's screenplay, while delivering a reasonably faithful adaptation of H.G. Wells' source text filled with appropriate gravitas and awed astonishment, also works in moments of satire and humour, some welcome (an ironic comment on the dawning of capitalism is made by Wells' companions discounting his astonishing time machine invention due to its having no immediate commercial or military use) and some less welcome (a cringe-worthy, out of place and overlong joke as supposedly childlike Weena asks how women wore their hair in the year 1900). Despite being a mostly sturdy piece of writing, the film does come across as being occasionally clunky and poorly paced, and there is an interesting attempt to shoehorn in a happy ending out of what, upon further reflection, actually comes across as quite bleak. Nonetheless, the film denotes a landmark in the evolution of cinematic special effects, with early usage of time lapse photography serving well to depict the time travelling effect (if only director Pal had resisted the urge to accompany it with a gruesomely asinine sound effect), and the expansive sets and props (the immortal design of the sled-like titular machine itself being the highlight) add an acceptably enthralling tinge to the adventure aspect of the film, making The Time Machine, despite the occasional fumbling of thematic material, far too enjoyable to resist. Rod Taylor brings a suitable Victorian pompousness as well as impassioned lust for discovery and knowledge as the time travelling H.G. Wells surrogate, his spunky charisma and frantic bursts of enthusiasm carrying the film with ease. Making her film debut, Yvette Mimieux, despite subscribing to the school of if you can't act, look good, makes the most out of shallowly written Eloi love interest Weena, with her occasional sparks of energy and charm denoting an acting talent beyond one worthy of being dismissed due to her looks. Finally, Alan Young is both boisterously charming and appropriately foreboding as Wells' 'voice of reason' figure friend and his own son (in the future), working with the potentially cumbersome pseudo-profundity of the subject matter with a comfortable confidence. Despite the occasional patchy logic or ethics of the film, Pal's moments of thematic daring or simple willingness to let the film ride along in an enjoyable and occasionally thought provoking manner, make the film a hit, albeit if it boasts such an earnest immediacy that its Technicolor audience baiting excesses do sometimes get the better of it. Nonetheless, The Time Machine results as an overall highly satisfying and watchable version of Wells' classic tale, if not the genre cornerstone it could have been. -8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 February 2009","score":"","review":" There were a myriad of reasons for viewers in 1960 to be wary of a cinematic adaptation of H.G.
