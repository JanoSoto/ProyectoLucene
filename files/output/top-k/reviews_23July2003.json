I found the DVD of this movie on the shelves of my local county library, and brought it home to watch with my 14-year-old neighbors, Emily and Natalie. Jim Carrey is perfect as the Grinch. It's a story that has been around for a long time, everyone knows it. The critic Ebert describes the movie fairly accurately, but gives it a lower rating than I do. Aside from Carrey, I especially enjoyed Bill Irwin, a virtually unknown and underrated actor who has great body movements and facial expressions. The DVD is of course sharp and colorful with great 5.1 sound. It also has a number of very nice extras for those of us who like to go behind the scenes to see how a film was made.

Like many I also bought the soundtrack.  I agree with all the accolades given this film and I too heartily recommend this wonderful film.  The Mission is one of my favourite movies of all time and I was dumbfounded when it lost the Best Picture Academy Award honour to Platoon (a decent film admittedly but really not in the same league as The Mission).  The Academy really makes me wonder sometimes, like when Shakespeare In Love beats out Saving Private Ryan.***** Minor plot spoiler ahead *****Although the De Niro & Irons stories are the focus of this movie, one subplot really struck me as being very profound, and because no one has mentioned it yet, I thought I'd bring it up.  The Bishop who is visiting to make the decision regarding giving the Catholic Church's approval of the transfer of control of the territory to the Portuguese knows that doing so will have dire and possibly fatal consequences for the Indians.  However, not to give the Church's blessing will hurt the Catholic Church in Portugal. So, he knows right from the beginning that he will end up approving this transfer of control of the land, and, given his knowledge of the consequences that will follow, he knows it is the morally wrong decision. And yet, he does it anyway.  I found this very interesting - a man of God consciously making an immoral choice.  Yes, I know I shouldn't be surprised by this given the problems in the Church recently (we are after all, all imperfect) , but this was an interesting subplot that struck me during the movie and stayed with me afterwards.If you haven't seen The Mission, do yourself a favour and rent this gem. I always appreciate coming across a truly great film, given that there really is so much dreck out there.  After watching this film I believe you'll be happy you didn't waste your money and cerebral cortex on some recent release that does nothing more than occupy two hours of your time and is then immediately forgotten.

But it still stands solid as one great Bruce Lee film and boasts the greatest fight scene ever in my opinion. Bruce plays Tang Lung who travels to Rome to help his family battle local gangsters who are trying to take over their resturaunt. Bruce almost plays a Charlie Chaplin type role here which would later be more fitting to Jackie Chan's slapstick style. Much like the Big Boss the first Bruce fight scene is way into the film but in my opinion this good because it creates a good build up, the nunchuka scene is second only to the one in Fist Of Fury or the uncut Game Of Death. The fight scene in the Roman Colliseum deserves the credit it gets because of one simple reason, its a simple fight, there are no gimmicks, sure its set in the colliseum and the fight is supposed to reflect two roman gladiators but there are no weapons and no sweet talk.  It truly has epic scale. The thing that also makes this fight scene work is the end when Tang Lung out of respect covers Colt with his Karate jacket. There may have been better fights since on screen and I havn't seen many Hong Kong films with Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen etc but this is the first great one on one fight, therefore it set the standard.There will indeed never be another Bruce Lee. I find it fascinating to imagine what Bruce would have done if he had lived, the 80's and 90's would have been very different if Arnie, Stallone, Wiilis, Seagal and Van Damme had Bruce to compete with, Bruce is sometimes critcised for being a bad actor, but i disagree, if anyone has seen his episodes of `Longstreet' or `Marlowe' they will see that Bruce could convincingly carry a dramatic scene given the right script and no dubbing and he oozed charisma, and he showed glimpses of good acting in Enter The Dragon.Being a Bruce fan i kind of wish that Jet Li would do the films that bruce did or was planning on doing, Jet's early work in Honk Kong like the Shaolin Temple or more recent stuff like Fist Of Legend(remake of Fist Of Fury) and Once Upon A Time In China was very promising and it seemed he was the successor to Bruce but instead now he's doing crap in Hollywood with DMX and Jason Statham. Strangely the mediocre Lethal Weapon 4 is Jet's best Hollywood film, Maybe Jet should do a project with John Woo, it would be interesting and they'd probably get the best out of each other.

However, at the time this film was first released, as was with his still best picture 'Pulp', he was regarded as a filmmaker who makes violent movies, filled with violence, chock full of violence, too violent (if there ever could or should be such a thing in movies), etc.  This is unfair.  True, Tarantino writes and works his actors to such an intensity that the feelings that go with violent acts and violent tension is there, and true he shows the blood, he lets us hear the cries of agony and despair, and indeed there are times that bullets fired into people are shown as such right in frame.  Yet he never exactly displays any truly violent acts (he decided to leave the shot of Masden slicing the ear on the editing floor, unlike a director like David Lynch who gets right inside the matter) - his technique is to evoke and strive for all of the emotions one would feel in such asituation, movie or in real life, to the most honest, near heart-wrenching limits, and thus to someone who may have even not even seen the film the images that appear in a trailer or on a video box bring the notion of this being an overly violent movie immediately.  That the images we see throughout the film, bloody or not, stay with us long after the credits roll, is a testament to his dedication, and obvious trust, to his craft being as it is.The plot, while lifted from a Chow-Yun Fat film from the mid-eighties, is the first one to include his trademark non-linear storytelling design.  Sure, this is not uncommon in most films, but since each scene has a meaty quality to it, with line after line of (purposeful, to story as well as character) dialog is spoken, you really don't know what to expect.  A crime boss (Lawrence Tierny) assembles different criminals of different backgrounds, removes them of their given Christian names, and gives them pseudonym colors as the heist comes up.  The robbery itself has a big hitch- cops are alerted sooner than thought, shoot-outs occur, some colors are wiped away, and the remaining assemble in the rendezvous to sort out what went wrong and who's to blame.  For most films with such an ambitious and grounded script, nearly every performance is a crucial asset to the film's success, and Tarantino knows this in his bones, as well as in the casting of the right parts (i.e. Steve Buscemi auditioned for Mr. White but got Mr. Pink, makes sense doesn't it) Keitel and Tierny are like old pros merely portraying old pros; Roth has a true breakout performance as Orange; Busemi himself proves why he's needed in film today; Chris Penn makes for a fine supporting role; Masden is one of the most convincing of the 90's psychos; even Tarantino makes a perfect monologue for himself in the opener.  Right away these actors give off the only impression they should - these are people that we can care about, despise, or watch in a lack of judgment as they float away in a flash - they've got to be human all the way.  So, is Reservoir Dogs for everyone?  Not necessarily- children under the age of nine or ten, I'd suggest, should stay away even if they can understand and take the violence since it's really an film for maturer mindsets.  But, for the passionate movie-goer, or for thrill seeking screen nuts, it's worth the ride.  For one thing, I'll never think of Stuck in the Middle With You, or Steven Wright for that matter, the same way again.

I first watched this movie about 10 years ago and I enjoyed it.  Then, I watched it last night again. This time, it was much more personal to me, and I still enjoyed it,only in a different way. The relationship between Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss was portrayed wonderfully. The selfishness he felt when seeing her and Ted together for the first time was so very honest and painful. The pain she feels at moving on with her life, the love and concern John Goodman shows her, the uncertainty of her future and the way she will handle it kept me on the edge of my seat. The emotions were so real and many of them were the same ones I have felt over the past 2 years.  The scene where Dorinda dances alone yet with Pete simply sent me to the tissues. When she is putting out that last fire, and is contemplating the rest of her life alone hit home as well. I cried for almost the entire movie this time. The actors portrayed their characters as real as can be, and I truly felt their pain and confusion.  I read the book years ago and I feel that this is one of the few times the movie is as good as the book. This time after watching it, I actually was able to find a little peace in my life situation.

When I first saw it I was too young to understand the themes, and was bored to tears, mainly because I was comparing it to Star Wars. Viewing it as an adult has changed my opinion - it's a visually stunning movie, with very profound themes and a prophetic grasp of space technology. However, it is by no means the best sci-fi film ever, or Stanley Kubricks best film, and in truth has not aged particularly well. But enough about that just now. Whats good about the film?It boasts some of the most brilliantly composed shots I've ever seen, right from the beginning with the slow reveal of the Moon, the Earth and the Sun to the iconic strains of Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra. The zero gravity settings and the various methods used to combat the effects of zero-g enabled Kubrick to play lots of cool tricks with the camera with people walking upside down or seeming to walk on the ceiling. Then of course there's the famous cut from the ape throwing the bone in the air to the satellite floating in space - it's effect is somewhat lessened due to the fact that everyone knows about it now, but back in 1968 it must have been a startlingly original edit.The choice of music in the film is superb - probably the best collection of sourced classical music that exists. The music so perfectly fits each scene that you would think that each piece had been written especially for the film, rather than selected from a record collection. In particular, aside from the above mentioned Also Sprach Zarathustra, there's Khachaturyan's Gayne Ballet Suite, which perfectly conveys the crushing loneliness of space travel (and was of course lifted by James Horner for use in the Aliens soundtrack), and Ligeti's Requien for Soprano, which after the Ark of the Covenant theme in Raiders of the Lost Ark is probably the creepiest piece of music I have ever heard in a film. I could probably do without the Blue Danube, but that's just my personal opinion of that piece, and it does lend the shots of satellites circling the Earth an almost balletic quality.Arthur C Clarke's story is incredibly prophetic in it's grasp of developments in space technology, even if he was a bit too optimistic in the timescale within which he thought it could all be developed. Every ship looks like it could exist, and of course the film showed a lunar base a year before the first Apollo landing. This is all very much science heavy science fiction, rather than being a fantasy set in space a la Star Wars - the ships make no sound in the vacuum, unlike almost every other celluloid space ship. Clarke also of course predicts the development of Artificial Intelligence in HAL, and there are numerous other little touches of technological foresight - note what look like thin plasma screen TV's that the Astronauts watch the BBC broadcast on.The themes of the story are incredibly profound, dealing with the evolution of man, and can be debated endlessly. For instance, am I the only person who noticed the symmetry of the monolith giving the ape intelligence, which it then uses to commit murder, and the development of self awareness in HAL (presumably due again to the monolith), who then goes on to murder the crew of the Discovery?In addition, all the scenes with the apes are great - how would have thought to fill the first fifteen minutes of a sci-fi film with a short story about the family life of a group of early hominids? Also, Bowman shutting down HAL feels incredibly tragic, as the computer reverts to its 'childhood'. Of course, the infinitely weird ending can be puzzled over till the cows come home, but is again beautifully shot.Writing all this makes me think I've been unfair to 2001, but being objective about it, I must say that the film shows its age. No doubt the special effects were stunning in 1968, and in truth still look great today, but the endless shots of spacecraft floating at a snails pace through space just take forever, and become mind numbingly boring after only a few minutes. I am a University graduate and consider myself reasonably intelligent, and am quite prepared to commit my attention to films which don't feature endless action scenes, but it's very hard to appreciate the themes in 2001 when for long stretches of the film absolutely nothing seems to be happening. It's not artistic, it's just boring. And to be honest, the sequence when Bowman goes through the Stargate just smacks of the psychedelic hippiedom of the times the film was shot in, and again seems to take forever.Having said all this however, it must be acknowledged that 2001 is a groundbreaking film without which modern sci-fi films in all probability wouldn't exist, and probably deserves to be seen just for that reason alone.Rating - 7\/10       ","genre":null},{"date":"23 July 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  *******some spoilers*******2001 is a movie which I have watched several times in my life, and each time I try harder to 'get' it.

The film has patience and a huge scope, but spreads itself a bit thin with too many characters not satisfactorily developed enough.  Sometimes hard to hear the dialogue too, and the US DVD has no English subtitles.  But it's gritty, beautiful stuff, and the actors play it like it's real -- it almost has a documentary feel to it.  A surreal, long, foggy film.  The landscapes are beautiful and the film stock is wonderfully saturated, like dust and gold and old newspaper.  I enjoyed it quite a bit; Walken is very good, and his introduction is one of those great, dark Western moments.  Watch out for Mickey Rourke in a bit part.  Some of the facts from the real Johnson County War are fudged over for the film, but it was all meant to further the narrative.  Wanted so badly to be a masterpiece that it could not help but fall somewhat short. Watch it and then read Steven Bach's Final Cut for a good, solid lesson on the ins-and-outs of the filmmaking business.  You'll discover just how so many bad movies actually get made, and why.

A group of working men out there trying to earn a living just like everyone else. The film takes us inside the pressure cooker of a second-rate Chicago real estate office and the world of dead-beats, sits, streaks, and Cadillac boards. Where if you don't close, it's your job. Where desperate, angry men will do anything to get ahead, to get the premium leads. When two people talking and speaking about something mean different things, and listening can make you a criminal. When a man can look at the office across the street and see heaven, but in truth it's no better than where he's standing...just different. It is fascinating material, all the more so because I happen to be a salesman. GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is the film that introduced me to the work of Chicago playwright David Mamet. I have since become endeared to the profane scherzo of the dialectic, the use of obscenity in a gritty realistic way; the cadence, the tempo and meter. Mamet, who wrote the script based on his lean play, uses small details to set a character up, instead of falling back on clichés. There are no flashbacks or other tricks here, the information is supplied by what the character says in the throw-away lines and quick asides. In addition, Mamet has fleshed out the story line quite a bit for the film. Including the addition of Blake (Alec Baldwin), the guy from downtown, from Mitch & Murray, whom Mamet uses to introduce the sales incentive, which serves as the catalyst of the drama third prize is you're fired. In his brief scene Baldwin chisels a realistic and frightening performance.The rest of the cast speaks for itself an inspired Jack Lemmon as the powerfully desperate Shelly The Machine Levene; Al Pacino as the seductively slick Ricky Roma; Ed Harris in a bravado performance as Dave Moss, George Aronow, the hapless, but likable everyman played by Alan Arkin; Kevin Spacey as the street-lame office manager; and Jonathan Pryce in an effective role as a cuckold client. Each of the gifted cast members fall into the vibe of the speech and action that Mamet brings to the story. The director, James Foley, and his crew stay out of the way of the actors. With that much energy in a cast, to overstage the scene would have been distracting, throwing off the balance of the language. Foley knows it's about the characters and not about his personal style as a film maker; for that I give him credit. GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is lightning in a bottle, a unique film with a great cast.

K. Rowling is focusing much on the new Harry Potter movies, and I wouldn't doubt it soon if the sixth or seventh movie(s) came out before the book(s).But I'm not here to talk about the books, I'm here to talk about the movie.  To discuss how this movie translated from the book would be unfair, so I'll wipe the book from my memory for now.First of all, I must say that John Williams was the worst person for scoring the music.  Williams has done great things in this area, and has been entirely innovative about his craft.  However, the entire soundtrack of this movie is cliche.  It sounds like something from a very, VERY old seventies movie.  Example  The notes of the orchestra have a spiraling up and down feeling, giving the impression of something out of an old horror movie.  The themes are practically not new.  Williams was trying to go for themes, when what it really needed was an ominous feeling.  Not this magical stuff that could be found in old Disney movies.  It seems Williams is losing his luster, and I'd have preferred Elfman or possibly even Goldsmith to score this movie.The first thing one will notice upon watching this movie, other than the bland score, is the tasteless acting.  While I can understand most of these people are young, never-before actors, it can be quite annoying.  It seems the directors MEANT to put Hermione up to saying things in a cliche, I'm-better-than-you, tone.  Ron is a total whiner, and can't seem to control emotions.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is probably the best of the three in this first movie (luckily, the sequel patches up the acting, so it's obvious the problems arose simply because they're new--and, like I said, understandable).Some of the acting is great.  Dumbledore is obvious a top-notch actor (his performance in Gladiator is a good example of his previous, outstanding talent).  Hagrid and his, Nope, shouldn't have said that, uh-uh... is totally believable, and I find him to be one of the better actors in the movie.However, probably my favorite actor in the entire movie goes to the person who has only about five lines in the script.  Filch.  God, how I miss the screams.  His character is just creepy, and the actor puts him into such a great tangible experience.The plot is nice, as its taken from the book (ah, forgive me!).  I'd like to say that it loses some of its charm from its adaptation... but I promised I wouldn't go into that.Anyway, it has a nice villain, believable central plot (although the movie doesn't seem to explain quite as well as the book... seems to be some holes, but oh well, read the book).Probably the worst thing about this movie is that it manages to use every single cliche imaginable.  Harry flies down from his broom, clutching Neville's Remembrall, and a swarm of young children are cheering simply because he caught the little ball while Williams' heroic music plays.  That scene is actually sickening... it reminds me of some young children beats up the intelligent, corporate tough man movie.  Harry says a few words to a snake, then immediately says, Can you hear me?  Ron states heroically (after Harry asks what happens after the white pieces move their pawn), Then... we play.  Once again, Williams' music only serves to heighten the corniness.  It's annoying.All in all, the movie was an annoyance.  Simply geared for younger kids, which cause older viewers to cringe at the sheer stupidity.  Good effects, good plot, good story, and some good characters... but those factors can't make up for the total childishness of the movie.

That said, if (as another reviewer has said here) you haven't laughed after 5 minutes, just give up - it isn't for you.While Tap has muted backhanded affection for heavy rock while simultaneously ripping into its absurdities, The Castle completely LOVES its characters as much as it makes them look utterly ridiculous.  The entire cast are superb, there are a hundred quotable lines, and the simple story may seem clichéd, but is nevertheless executed to warm-hearted perfection.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"23 July 2003","score":"","review":"  Horror movies are sworn to three principles 1.) Our character(s) are constantly surrounded by imminent threat. 2.) Almost all characters (if not everyone) must die 3.) Explicit death sequences. This is what separates Horror from Suspense\/Thriller\/Mystery movies. In 1968, George Romero, through the endangered yet provocative element of black and white film making, managed to combine these three attributes brilliantly setting the standard for any future horror movie to follow. I still get chills every time I watch the opening sequence, in the cemetery, when the director himself repeats the lines, They're coming to get you Barbara! Look! Here comes one of them now! followed by S. William Hinzman's bone chilling performance revealing the capacity of the living dead. From there the movie rarely stops for breath as the day transcends to night. Our heroine finds her only salvation in a lone country house where she soon befriends a select congregation of survivors. Surrounded by these merciless savages they must find a way out together, if they don't kill each other first.This movie crosses many lines in a year where crossing lines was the 'IN' thing to do. The exceptional amount of violence and defamation of the dead still to this day would not receive less than an 'R' rating. Another bold move was casting an African-American for the lead role, for which Duane Jones delivers a powerful leader persona. This is the other truly virtuous quality of NOTLD, the acting. This quintisential ingredient is often diminished if not forgotten in today's horror flicks. The true terror arises in the audience when they begin to identify and place themselves in the characters' shoes. The acting in this movie is far above par considering its low budget. Within the struggle for safety from what lies outside a new threat arises from within the house allowing no safe territory. (Obvious inspirations for the situations in '28 Days Later'). The movie sub-plots a social commentary on survival and what measures man will take to maintain such.Bottom Line One of the top three horror movies of all times. Eerie scenes of ill-determined zombies, well acted plots of desperation, and of course gore. You may never want to walk through a cemetery again.
