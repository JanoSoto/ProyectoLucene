He believes that he was fired only because his employers somehow found out he had it, and discriminated against him. He seeks the help of Denzel Washington, his last resort, and he eventually and hesitantly takes the case. By the end they actually become close friends. A lot closer than Washington's character would probably like to admit.Even though it's barely even 10 years old, Philadelphia seems a bit dated. It was made at the time when AIDS was increasing, and new things were being learned about it all the time. It used to be believed that only gays could get it, but now we know that's just not true.

It's definitely one of my favourites. After reading some of the cynical and ignorant comments made by others I felt I had to defend the film.The acting is brilliant all round. Some of the performances are under rated but that's what's needed in a film like this. Michael Clark Duncan is especially good in a surprise performance. The direction is competent and engaging. The dialogue is believable and the characters certainly aren't 1-dimensional despite what others think. This is an all round amazing film. I never give films 10\/10 but this film almost made it. It was moving, funny, frightening, shocking, thought provoking, involving... the list goes on.*spoilers*Now that I've praised the film, I'm going to defend it. How anyone can say this is a sentimental, shallow, ostensibly moral film is beyond me. Only a cynic could say such a thing. Is there something wrong with good nature! Is it unbelievable that there are still some nice people in the world. Not all prison guards are nasty and brutal. Not every prisoner on death row is evil. Not every white person in Louisiana was a racist in the '30's. These are narrow minded ideas. John Coffey is not used to represent a black man whose only role is to help white people despite having supernatural powers so he can help himself. The fact that he is symbolic of Jesus shows that he is a meant to be a great character despite his simplicity and misfortunes. The guards hold him in high regard. How can anyone consider this to be a racist film.Some comments are a little unfair, but understandable. The film is long and is slow to begin with but the story and characters have to be introduced and developed. The beginning and end are good as the beginning shows how memorable the events in the film are to Edgecomb(e.g the dream and the reaction to the film) and the end shows us how things don't always work out for the best (e.g Coffey's execution and Edgecomb's speech) and a blessing might turn out to be a curse (or vice-versa) so things aren't always what they seem (e.g Edgecomb's speech). There are too many films with happy endings. Although I've already argued that some people are cynical (see above) I would have to say that I'm fed up with every single film having a happy ending - no matter what. As sad it sounds, bad things do happen to good people and the reason for the sad ending is to show why capital punishment should be stopped and to demonstrate that Edgecomb is being punished for letting Coffey die.I have to say, the only problem I have with the film is the religious undertones. Being anti-religion I would've preferred them to have been left out, but the film isn't promoting religion (the guards are religious but this is '30's Louisiana, of course they're Christians, and it's never confirmed that Coffey is a miracle of god).

A gloomy slasher\/family drama, it starts off nicely -- very nicely.  Then it goes on a bit too long.  Then it collapses in upon itself while trying to surprise the viewer with unexpected twists.Paxton directs with understated flair.  Directorial razzledazzle is absent -- no shots with loud signposts pointing to the director's identity.  Instead, there are little touches, barely noticeable sometimes, that add flavor to the goings on.  A man in cuffs is being taken to a police car.  The agent opens the rear door and reaches for the passenger's head to protect it from banging against the roof.  The man, having seen lots of cop movies, pulls his head away sharply and says, I got it.  As the cop, actually an FBI agent (Powers Booth), is driving the suspect over a wet noctural highway, the man in the rear launches into a flashback.  Cue the arpeggios on the harp?  The dreamy dissolve?  Pages flying backward off a desk calender?  Nope.  Paxton moves his camera deliberately from Booth's profile in the front seat to the rolled-up window on the driver's side and gives us a most attractive pattern of wind-blown raindrops tracking rearward like powder-blue tears.  When Dad freaks out and begins drawing up a list of demons consisting of the names of real people, the younger brother draws up his OWN list of demons who have been teasing him at school and hands it enthusiastically to his father!The acting is more than adequate.  I wish we could have seen more of Powers Booth, an underrated actor.  Paxton the actor is okay, his face a bit more worn than it has been in the past, which gives it some character.  He gets the character's torment across effectively.  The two young boys are good as well, particularly the older one, Fergus or Merkin or whatever his name is.  Children in movies can often be a nuisance.  They always seem to be getting diseases, or they're misunderstood, or abused, or they need kidney transplants.  These boys are okay, though.  How can actors be so convincing at the age of eleven?  Plaudits to the older brother.The plot is gripping for the first half of the movie.  It is less a slasher movie than it is a family drama.  The question it raises is how two youngsters can escape from a loving father who is nuttier than a fruitcake.  These kids find, as they would in real life, that it's not easy.  Imagine the ways in which this script could have gone wrong.  For starters we can change one of the boys into a juicy blonde nymphet and have her run through the rain in her skivvies.  (She would be to this movie what Kristie Swanson was to Flowers in the Attic.)  Practically all of the violence takes place off camera.  Bystanders aren't even splattered with blood from the blows of the axe.  Come to think of it, perhaps this flick should not be shown to children under the age of, say, sixteen -- it's too nonviolent.  The script could have been rendered imitative and generally dumb by introducing some kind of queer pattern to the serial murders which the police would then have to puzzle out.  Maybe the killer might be choosing victims according to their names, in alphabetical order, beginning with somebody like Alexander Balthazar Cust.  No, wait, that's already been done.It's too bad this atmospheric movie went on so long.  After the kid's been locked in the dungeon long enough, we come to feel as if we're locked in the dungeon too.  And it would have been nice to have a more comprehensible ending.  I'm still half guessing at who's who and why's why.  A couple of other bothersome things.  Here is Powers Booth in his spooky office visited by an ominous sounding guy who claims to know a lot about buried bodies in a high-profile case.  The only other agent in the deserted building stops by and asks if he should stick around during the interview, and Booth dismisses him casually.  Why?  Situations can change character quickly enough even when they seem normal.  I remember hitch-hiking near Las Vegas at night and being picked up by a nice normal couple in a clean sedan and an infant sleeping in the back seat.  There was a nice normal chat.  Then, after a rather lengthy pause, the driver turned to the woman and asked in a flat tone of voice, Where do you think we ought to ditch this hot car, honey?  (I quickly pointed out that they shouldn't do it around here because the state police were ominipresent.)  Well -- okay.  But the problems in this movie just go on.  The suspect\/witness knows that Booth killed his own mother and decides that Booth too is a demon who needs killing.  How does the suspect\/witness know that?  Nobody else knows it.  And when the suspect\/victim -- whose name I think is Adam -- lets Booth know that he's in on Booth's crime, Booth loses his cool entirely.  First of all, there is no evidence against Booth, just the word of an obvious maniac against that of a respected FBI agent.  On top of that Booth is holding a pistol on him.  And yet Booth attacks Adam with his naked hands and is quickly overpowered and becomes part of the internationally famous Thurman Rose Garden.  (People come from yards around to see it.)  None of this makes any sense at all.  Nor does the last shot of Adam in a sheriff's uniform hugging the pregnant Becky.  Unless -- unless the whole psychic religious revelation business were REAL.  But I can't imagine we're meant to go that far.  Would you rather be remembered for the good you've done or dismembered for the evil?

The question it raises is how two youngsters can escape from a loving father who is nuttier than a fruitcake.  These kids find, as they would in real life, that it's not easy.  Imagine the ways in which this script could have gone wrong.  For starters we can change one of the boys into a juicy blonde nymphet and have her run through the rain in her skivvies.  (She would be to this movie what Kristie Swanson was to Flowers in the Attic.)  Practically all of the violence takes place off camera.  Bystanders aren't even splattered with blood from the blows of the axe.  Come to think of it, perhaps this flick should not be shown to children under the age of, say, sixteen -- it's too nonviolent.  The script could have been rendered imitative and generally dumb by introducing some kind of queer pattern to the serial murders which the police would then have to puzzle out.  Maybe the killer might be choosing victims according to their names, in alphabetical order, beginning with somebody like Alexander Balthazar Cust.  No, wait, that's already been done.It's too bad this atmospheric movie went on so long.  After the kid's been locked in the dungeon long enough, we come to feel as if we're locked in the dungeon too.  And it would have been nice to have a more comprehensible ending.  I'm still half guessing at who's who and why's why.  A couple of other bothersome things.  Here is Powers Booth in his spooky office visited by an ominous sounding guy who claims to know a lot about buried bodies in a high-profile case.  The only other agent in the deserted building stops by and asks if he should stick around during the interview, and Booth dismisses him casually.  Why?  Situations can change character quickly enough even when they seem normal.  I remember hitch-hiking near Las Vegas at night and being picked up by a nice normal couple in a clean sedan and an infant sleeping in the back seat.  There was a nice normal chat.  Then, after a rather lengthy pause, the driver turned to the woman and asked in a flat tone of voice, Where do you think we ought to ditch this hot car, honey?  (I quickly pointed out that they shouldn't do it around here because the state police were ominipresent.)  Well -- okay.  But the problems in this movie just go on.  The suspect\/witness knows that Booth killed his own mother and decides that Booth too is a demon who needs killing.  How does the suspect\/witness know that?  Nobody else knows it.  And when the suspect\/victim -- whose name I think is Adam -- lets Booth know that he's in on Booth's crime, Booth loses his cool entirely.  First of all, there is no evidence against Booth, just the word of an obvious maniac against that of a respected FBI agent.  On top of that Booth is holding a pistol on him.  And yet Booth attacks Adam with his naked hands and is quickly overpowered and becomes part of the internationally famous Thurman Rose Garden.  (People come from yards around to see it.)  None of this makes any sense at all.  Nor does the last shot of Adam in a sheriff's uniform hugging the pregnant Becky.  Unless -- unless the whole psychic religious revelation business were REAL.  But I can't imagine we're meant to go that far.  Would you rather be remembered for the good you've done or dismembered for the evil?

Then it goes on a bit too long.  Then it collapses in upon itself while trying to surprise the viewer with unexpected twists.Paxton directs with understated flair.  Directorial razzledazzle is absent -- no shots with loud signposts pointing to the director's identity.  Instead, there are little touches, barely noticeable sometimes, that add flavor to the goings on.  A man in cuffs is being taken to a police car.  The agent opens the rear door and reaches for the passenger's head to protect it from banging against the roof.  The man, having seen lots of cop movies, pulls his head away sharply and says, I got it.  As the cop, actually an FBI agent (Powers Booth), is driving the suspect over a wet noctural highway, the man in the rear launches into a flashback.  Cue the arpeggios on the harp?  The dreamy dissolve?  Pages flying backward off a desk calender?  Nope.  Paxton moves his camera deliberately from Booth's profile in the front seat to the rolled-up window on the driver's side and gives us a most attractive pattern of wind-blown raindrops tracking rearward like powder-blue tears.  When Dad freaks out and begins drawing up a list of demons consisting of the names of real people, the younger brother draws up his OWN list of demons who have been teasing him at school and hands it enthusiastically to his father!The acting is more than adequate.  I wish we could have seen more of Powers Booth, an underrated actor.  Paxton the actor is okay, his face a bit more worn than it has been in the past, which gives it some character.  He gets the character's torment across effectively.  The two young boys are good as well, particularly the older one, Fergus or Merkin or whatever his name is.

Nia Vardalos stars as a Greek woman who just seems a bit out-of-place in her not always normal life. She is shy, reserved and ashamed of her heritage. Some makeup, a few college classes, stylish clothes and a travel agency job away from her father's restaurant are just the tickets to help her come out of her shell. Soon high school teacher John Corbett is entranced by her and they start a sweet love affair. Naturally she keeps the secret from her parents (Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan) and the sparks fly when they eventually find out. They want their daughter to marry a Greek man and have lots of children, but Vardalos has other plans for her life. Corbett's love knows no bounds though as he makes it clear that she is the one he really wants. My Big Fat Greek Wedding happened due to good timing and lots of luck. Vardalos was struggling when Tom Hanks' wife (Rita Wilson) went to see the small play that the film is based upon. Wilson happened to see an advertisement for the show in the newspaper one day (the only day Vardalos could afford to run an ad) and the rest as they say is history. The film cost very little to make and usually second-rate director Joel Zwick ended up running the show. Vardalos' screenplay (Oscar-nominated) was the catalyst that put the film on the map and kept it there permanently.

A stylish Hollywood casting agent mounts a cab in L.A., in New York it's a hapless poor man trying to get home, in Paris we encounter a blind woman, in Rome a priest and in Helsinki a bunch of drunks will tell their story. Yes, indeed. Stories are told, because each episode is an encounter with the respective cabbie, who all have a life and a past of their own.Wynona Ryder's performance of the 20-year-old, chain-smoking taxi driver does not work very well and also makes for the least interesting story. But Armin Müller-Stahl as an East-German refugee and former clown, who is awe-struck and belittled by the bustling NYC around him makes up for a lot. His helplessness when trying to communicate with his passenger, played by Giancarlo Esposito, almost becomes tangible when it manifests in his complete inability to steer the taxi. Within very few minutes the two men develop an utterly deep and good-humored trust and friendship between them. I'd call it the funniest portion of the movie, but in Rome we encounter Roberto Benigni as an always talking, sex-obsessed cabbie. His is the story we get the least emotional or intellectual outcome from, but, hey, welcome to the Benigni Show! If you are open-minded enough to laugh about a few surprises in the field of sexual experimentation (which we don't see but only hear described without too much detail), this one will stay with you as one of the brightest twenty minutes in your life. Before Rome we visit Paris with the most mysterious, yet most catching segment, a curious story about the afore-mentioned blind woman and a black cab driver, who - we can't be sure - might be going blind himself (he's very short-sighted and therefore has problems with driving his taxi) and has a lot of questions to ask. The woman, however, is not interested in conversation, yet we get the impression she opens up more than the driver realizes. In Helsinki a group of drunks tell the story of their sleeping friend's worst day. The cab-driver listens to it. It's a terrible story about a horrible predicament and the poor fellow's life basically lies in ruins. And yet the cabbie tops the story with one of the saddest things you'll ever have heard.The concept of the movie thinks of night as a place rather than a time, because all of the stories begin at the same moment in time but in different time zones. We move east in the process of the film and so we experience sunset in Los Angeles and early morning in Helsinki. Each of these times lends a special atmosphere to the story it tells, which becomes the most effective in the Helsinki story, which is utterly sad, however ends with a new day starting. People leave their places and go about their lives - the world moves on, none of the stories has an ending, life for each of the characters (except one) will continue.What's so great about this movie is that it tells such different stories with such different characters who all have different pasts and intentions, each accommodating the place of action (even visually - in L.A. even the buildings appear to be candy-flavored, while in Helsinki the city is cold, drab, yet hopeful) and it all comes together to this huge picture, which reminds us that we are all different but all live on the same planet and know similar things about life, death and everything in-between. I wonder what this movie would have been like, if Jarmusch had also considered taxis in non-western countries.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who... Oh, blast!

I recommend this movie to everyone.

A stylish Hollywood casting agent mounts a cab in L.A., in New York it's a hapless poor man trying to get home, in Paris we encounter a blind woman, in Rome a priest and in Helsinki a bunch of drunks will tell their story. Yes, indeed. Stories are told, because each episode is an encounter with the respective cabbie, who all have a life and a past of their own.Wynona Ryder's performance of the 20-year-old, chain-smoking taxi driver does not work very well and also makes for the least interesting story. But Armin Müller-Stahl as an East-German refugee and former clown, who is awe-struck and belittled by the bustling NYC around him makes up for a lot. His helplessness when trying to communicate with his passenger, played by Giancarlo Esposito, almost becomes tangible when it manifests in his complete inability to steer the taxi. Within very few minutes the two men develop an utterly deep and good-humored trust and friendship between them. I'd call it the funniest portion of the movie, but in Rome we encounter Roberto Benigni as an always talking, sex-obsessed cabbie. His is the story we get the least emotional or intellectual outcome from, but, hey, welcome to the Benigni Show! If you are open-minded enough to laugh about a few surprises in the field of sexual experimentation (which we don't see but only hear described without too much detail), this one will stay with you as one of the brightest twenty minutes in your life. Before Rome we visit Paris with the most mysterious, yet most catching segment, a curious story about the afore-mentioned blind woman and a black cab driver, who - we can't be sure - might be going blind himself (he's very short-sighted and therefore has problems with driving his taxi) and has a lot of questions to ask. The woman, however, is not interested in conversation, yet we get the impression she opens up more than the driver realizes. In Helsinki a group of drunks tell the story of their sleeping friend's worst day. The cab-driver listens to it. It's a terrible story about a horrible predicament and the poor fellow's life basically lies in ruins. And yet the cabbie tops the story with one of the saddest things you'll ever have heard.The concept of the movie thinks of night as a place rather than a time, because all of the stories begin at the same moment in time but in different time zones. We move east in the process of the film and so we experience sunset in Los Angeles and early morning in Helsinki. Each of these times lends a special atmosphere to the story it tells, which becomes the most effective in the Helsinki story, which is utterly sad, however ends with a new day starting.

'Memento' is one of those movies. The first time I watched it in a cinema I was blown away. Subsequent viewings (I'm probably up to my fourth) take a little bit of the shine off it and the essential gimmickiness of it become more obvious. It also becomes apparent that Shelby's memory disorder is a bit too contrived and only seems to kick in (or not) at the most dramatically convenient moments. Some closer scrutiny will see the whole thing quickly fall apart. Still, there's no real point in being too picky with this movie. If you accept the premise at face value you are guaranteed a fascinating and involving film experience. Australian soap actor Guy Pearce ('Ravenous') is brilliant as Shelby, easily the best role of his career to date. The backwards story telling of the movie (nicked most likely off Harold Pinter) was much talked about but it is Pearce's performance which really sells it. Joe Pantoliano ('The Sopranos') has too often been stuck in b-grade movies, so it's really good to see him given a more rewarding part. He seems to relish it and his chemistry with Pearce is really enjoyable. Likewise with Pantoliano's co-star in 'The Matrix' Carrie-Ann Moss. Moss can really act, and I hope this leads on to some substantial work for her in the future.  The underrated character actor Steven Tobolowsky ('Thelma And Louise') is also excellent in the important supporting role of Sammy Jankis, and a couple of actors I really like Mark Boone, Jr ('Trees Lounge') and Callum Keith Rennie ('Hard Core Logo') are both worth keeping an eye out for along the way. The hype surrounding 'Memento' may put many people off, but that would be a real shame as it just about lives up to it, and it's a very, very good movie. Highly recommended.

I never liked Pasolini but I did find this film much better. Certainly more interesting than some have said. Liliana Cavani does have a focus point to this story and even though its an old fashioned one, its surrounded in an unconventional manner. Dirk Bogarde is Max.

One day he notices a woman that is staying in his hotel and its a women that was his prisoner in a concentration camp and he had a sado-masochistic relationship with. Charlotte Rampling plays Lucia and at first she is stunned and wants to leave after seeing him but then she is unsure. One of the more remarkable scenes is when Max confronts Lucia and yells at her and slaps her asking why she had to pick his hotel. Lucia shows both hate and love in her reaction. It shows the viewer what kind of a strange but powerful bond was developed years earlier. Bogarde is terrific. His character is very neat and orderly and demonstrates his loyalty to the people staying at his hotel. Bogarde says so much without speaking and just using his fingers to run along edges of things. Ramplings beauty is needed in this film and her acting is also top notch. She does get very quiet towards the end but she has always been a brave actress and its needed here. Another scene that stands out is when she is a teenager in the concentration camp and in a skimpy leather Nazi uniform she performs Like Marlene Dietrich as Lola.  ****SPOILER ALERT**** Later in the film other former SS officers learn of Max and a former prisoner and they want to get rid of her since she is a witness and Max refuses to give her up. Both of them are targeted and they hole up in an apartment. Cavani doesn't seem to care about how these two found each other or the circumstances, she does though want to show that despite all the things that are going on nothing will separate them again. The last scene in the film shows this. They are dressed exactly the way when they first met. She in a dress for young girls and he in his Nazi uniform.

It is the early-1930s and crime boss Paul Newman (Oscar-nominated) rules the community with a quiet dominance. His son (Daniel Craig) and his top assassin (Tom Hanks) are the most-trusted in Newman's small circle. Hanks' is basically a second son to Newman and they have an unmistakable love and admiration for one another. Within Hanks' real family is wife Jennifer Jason Leigh and sons Tyler Hoechlin and Liam Aiken. Leigh knows of her husband's business but the two youngsters really have no clue. One day Hoechlin decides to hitch a ride with his dad (with Hanks not knowing) and the youth learns of his father's true colors. This is when Road to Perdition begins its long and imperative story. Hanks and Hoechlin know that they are in trouble now and must flee to save their lives. Along the way they become hunted by the sadistic Jude Law (a crime photographer\/mafia assassin) and must make amends with Chicago syndicate Stanley Tucci in order to avoid Newman and his evil son. Road to Perdition comes from a graphic novel and it is very apparent here as the production values are as high as they can possibly be. The late Conrad L. Hall won a posthumous Oscar for his amazing cinematography and that was well-deserved. The score by Thomas Newman is one of the best of recent memory and director Sam Mendes (who nearly reached greatness with American Beauty) does an outstanding job keeping the entire project together. Road to Perdition is a great film for everyone, but the production caters even more to loving fathers and sons who have a spiritual bond that cannot be ignored or denied. 5 stars out of 5.

There's a deep psychological seduction underneath the sixties garb and the nineties toilet humor that makes this strangely satisfying. For my part however I could only bear to watch it all the way to the very, very end in the hope that (PG-13 rating aside) that Hurley would disrobe a little and I could get a glimpse of that exquisite bod. But they teased me, especially in the matrimonial bed scene with the pineapples and the melons and the spice rack--whatta rack! Ha, ha, ha, ha.Remember as you watch this it is not as bad as it looks.

Get it at Amazon.)This is a James Bond spoof aimed at retro nerds so that we might find an identification in our deprived lives. Hey, in this movie we get to cozy up--in your dreams, retard!-- to Elizabeth (drooling all over myself) Hurley. The flick sparkles (if that's the right word) with lame-o jokes and semi-sophisticated satire.Mike Myers wrote the script and stars as both Austin, the man of mystery (right, like the toe jam smell at the bottom of your closet is a mystery), and the cartoon villain Dr. Evil, who might be Dr. No cleaning his teeth with his pinkie. Speaking of teeth, he has the better teeth of our disjointed duo, speaking of which, notice that Hurley (would that Emma Peel had anything like her figure, but she too was English) doesn't actually soul kiss Austin. I mean, there are not only LIMITS, but contract clauses. I think Hurley was afraid that if she actually swapped tongues with him she would catch some horrid fungus amongus and THAT wouldn't be good for her career. However, check this out for her next Austin Powers opus, The Spy Who Shagged Me she got $3-million up front.Look at it this way if she could make flirty-flirty eyes with Rancid Teeth Man, she could conceivably, in your wildest dreams find YOU attractive, at least as the last man on earth. You and Elizabeth Hurley as the last two humans on earth! Eat your heart out, Sean Connery. Heck, all he had in Dr. No (1962) was Ursula Andress. (Come to recall yummie, yum, yum.) And you too, Roger Moore. Bond, James Bond, yourself.Myers makes himself as disgustingly nerdish as possible, but still the chicks swoon. There's some right-on satire here about the mystery of feminine desire. What DOES a woman want? The nerds never know but James Bond, Harrison Ford and (gulp) Mike Myers don't have to ask.All right, there is a plot to this Batman-like take off on the sixties become the nineties 007 spy diversion. But it's so familiar that I won't bother with it here. Some of the characters are interesting. There's Alotta Fagina played by Fabiana Udenio recalling Octopu**y and Pu**y Galore. (Well, she's not interesting, but her name is.)

The usual clutch of commercial popcorn movies were hurled at us from those big wigs at Hollywood and one that stuck in my mind was this effort. Not because it was the best. Oh, no. Because it was undeniably in my opinion the biggest load of garbage since 'The Phantom Menace' three years previously.Over the years George Lucas has released wave upon wave of movie as a producer that was not as big as the good yet over rated star wars movies(Apart from the Indiana Jones movies). The 1986 effort of Howard A New breed of Hero was a huge turkey of a movie that flopped big time at the box office. The fantasy adventure movie he produced which Ron Howard directed, called 'Willow' with Val Kilmer was a better effort but also failed to bring in the audiences.So why people went to see this drivel is any one's guess.Personally I believe they were hoping for an improvement. Don't get me wrong. I was one of them. Having seen both trailers for Episode II for free(I work in a cinema)I was quite hopeful from the look of them. Boy, was I wrong.This segment in the Star Wars saga concerns the young Anakin Skywalker (Played here by new comer Hayden Christiensen). No longer the little boy we saw in Episode I The Phantom menace, but a nineteen year old Padawan apprentice to now, Master Jedi Obi-Wan-Kenobi(Ewan MacGregor reprising the roll).Ten years have passed since the battle of Naboo and the two Jedi are given the task by the Jedi high council of protecting Padme Amidala (Nathalie Portman), once ruler of Naboo she has now become  a senator to her home world. Her life is being threatened by a separatist movement lead by the enigmatic Count Dooku,(Christopher Lee) a former Jedi Master who detests the ever growing corruption in the galactic senate and plans to put a stop to it by what ever means he sees fit.The reason for the threat on Padme's life is the fact that she plans to put a vote in the senate that will enable the senate to build a grand army of the republic to combat against the seperatists. The Jedi's number are not strong enough to cope against the many that are out there. As Jedi Master Mace Windu states, 'We are keepers of the peace. Not soldiers.'Of course as always things are not quite as they seem and the events of the movie will lead Anakin back to his home planet of Tataooine and the grim realisation of what has become of his mother. Not only that but we witness the first unsubtle steps he will take to joining the Darkside.Sadly however, the promise that the movie had is compeletly lost in a badly written script with characters who are never well enough drawn out. Anakin who is so woodenly portrayed by Canadian new comer Hayden Christiensen does not come across as a idealistic young apprentice coping with the enormity incredible powers, so much as a spoiled brat who forever has a hissy fit when he doesn't get his own way. You constantly wonder why Obi-Wan as he states in the previous trilogy, loved him so much.Ewan Macgregor does a slightly better job as Anakin's supposed friend and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.Now no longer the rebellious apprentice he was in the Phantom Menace he is a wiser more medetive man. However Macgregor can't seem to fully convince as the younger Obi-Wan.He is unable to harness Alec Guinesse's mannerism's voice and the character is so different. Too different from the older man he becomes. Never the less Macgregor does apear to have fun in the roll.Nathalie Portman like Christiensen is undeniably flat in her portrayal. She lacks the charisma to make Padme the fully memorable character that Princess Leia was in the earlier film's. But then that's probably down more to the writing of the script than her boring performance.The rest of the supporting cast with the exception of maybe Christopher lee is absoleutly terrible. A normally reliable Samuel L.

Since then i haven't gone a day without thinking about it. I would reccomend this to everyone not because it's a happy movie, but because you have to see it.  I don't know about showing it in school, it's a lot to handle especially unrated, but what a great message it has.  I don't know who wouldn't think twice before injecting heroin in there arm after watching this.  A great story with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Not only was the acting great, but the directing stood out especially when they take the drugs.  The music at the end also is very moving and powerful. I would give this movie a ten out of ten and i reccomend it for everyone, you should watch it with an open mind and see it for what it was worth.

Bono helped write and produce this messy film and with all the talent involved you would think a more coherent film could have been made. They're is a lot of improvisation used in this film and unless your Robert Altman then it can backfire. Altman uses some improvisation but still has a solid story to base everything on. Here in this film its the opposite. Improvisation seems to be the bases and the main story (Such as it is) comes secondary. Mel Gibson is an FBI agent sent to investigate the death of a politicians son in a seedy hotel inhabited by people with mental defects. Reminded me a little bit of King of Hearts. Gibson has this metal neck brace on and has a crewcut. Kind of like Joe Friday meets The Twilight Zone. If I can say anything good about this film then it would be Jeremy Davies who looks very comfortable improvising his role. On the other hand, Mel Gibson does NOT look comfortable. He's not that type of actor. The two styles of acting just don't mesh. Milla Jovovich has been in so few good films in her career that you can count them on one hand and have a few fingers left over. And this is another blemish on her already disappointing resume. Peter Stormare spends the entire film talking like Ringo Starr and Gloria Stuart yells the F word several times! Bud Cort just hangs out and he looks happy to just be working. Tim Roth shows up at the end in a cameo. Film is just trying to be avant garde and be something of an exercise in style. But an exercise in style still has some bases for a story and the blending of acting styles just doesn't work. At best its futile!
