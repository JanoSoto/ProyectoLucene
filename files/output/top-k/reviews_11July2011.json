It took a decent premise and distorted it into a misguided, oversimplified yet somehow horribly contrite and contrived outing that should be left to the bargain bin. The warning signs appear early, as we find Portman's character knocked up by her AGGRESSIVELY distasteful beau, who couldn't be more stereotypical white trash if he wore confederate flag underwear. The audience is clearly supposed to dislike the guy, but the amazing part is how much this movie dislikes him and prevents him from any sort of happiness at every turn. Oh, but it actively dislikes all the other characters as well, and it TRULY despises the audience. Let it be quite clear Novalee Nation is a Saint. Everyone she meets immediately loves her (not counting her immediate family), she effortlessly balances her job and raising her child with pursuing her love life, and to top it all off, she looks like Natalie Portman without any effort. IN SPITE OF THIS, life hits Novalee and those around her with tragedy after tragedy for no apparent reason other than to bring some life to this limp, monotonous film. Not that any of these tragedies have any IMPACT on Novalee, OH NO. She is a plucky go-getter (who doesn't real go-get anything) who just plows on and lives her puny little life as if we're supposed to care. The most laughable example of the moronic melodrama she's put through is the tornado scene, which is drawn out far too long and features the worst CGI tornado in recent memory. The 'disaster' serves no real purpose other than to give one character an off-screen death and show off Novalee's impressive upper arm strength. I don't really blame Portman for any of this, I blame the insipid writing, amateurish directing and horrendous editing. As this film approaches the two hour mark (an hour and a half too long, if you ask me), it hits a cacophony of barely related scenes that never congeal to form a coherent picture. Portman is just stuck in this perfect storm of agony and makes due. The only inspiration evident in this film is the beginning, where Novalee is stranded at a Wal-Mart by her baby's daddy (can you GET more classy?), and must scavenge for supplies in the untamed aisles of the store. Its a fun for a little while, but it all comes crashing to a halt with the delivery of her child, AMERICUS Nation. Why this name was chosen never becomes clear, as it has no significance to anything or anyone beyond inducing a snicker every time its used on screen. Far from an inspiring tale of survival and recovery, Novalee is shown essentially riding on everyone else's coattails and somehow profiting from disaster. These disasters include Americus being kidnapped by religious fundamentalists for some reason (she turns up fine within minutes), Novalee's best friend beaten, and her daughter raped (both recover just fine, and the friend ends up marrying a guy later on), and her pseudo-boyfriend's sister's death, which is arguably an good thing and somehow ends up in a romantic tryst in a motel room. Sprinkled amid this tragedy salad are stale croûtons depicting the scuzzy impregnator who abandoned Novalee as he raises to meteoric heights as a country music singer (which isn't saying much) only to crash down again for no apparent reason. The ending to his (unnecessary) saga must be seen to be believed. His legs are cut off by a train and he ends up in a hospital where Novalee shows up and forgives him, then he's never heard from again. THERE, I saved you the pain of seeing it for yourself. Aside from being ridiculous, none of this has ANY bearing on the story other than to have somebody ELSE to dump tragedy upon.Ugh, I could mention the laughably stilted romance between Novalee and and James Frain, which spends most of the movie going NOWHERE and when it finally gets where it was going, you wish it would go back where it came from. All the side characters are either despicable pricks or angelic saints, and the only way to tell them apart are whether they are nice to Novalee or not. None of these characters are deep, they have no background, no purpose, and most of them aren't likable. It is bad, VERY bad when you're laughing at the pain a character is experiencing.I really could go on, but I can hardly bear the strain. This movie has no moral, no direction, no purpose to the goings on. It has bright patches but they are so few and far between its like they don't exist at all. Characters come and go and the whole film is literally DROWNING in melodrama. If you like Natalie Portman, you MIGHT be able to bear this cross with a straight face, but I'm pretty sure viewing this movie is considered cruel and unusual punishment.Out of respect for yourself, your loved ones, and for decent movies everywhere, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.

He lives merely to go bowling, but is taken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with calamitous results. We all know people like the Dude, and so, supposedly, do the Coen brothers. They rooted the character in a producer named Jeff Dowd. Both dudes rely on lateral thinking much more than orderliness.The Dude is paid a visit by two enforcers who obviously have the wrong Lebowski, but before they discover that, one has already peed on the Dude's rug, sparking intense hostility That rug really tied the room together, the Dude laments. John Goodman's Walter Sobchak leads the vendetta. Sponging lines straight from Bush 41, he declares that this aggression will not stand and insists the Dude draw a line in the sand. The Dude drops in on the real Lebowski, leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself solicited into the millionaire's conspiracies.Rich Lebowski, wheelchair-bound like General Sternwood and staring into a fireplace like Major Amberson, wants the Dude to deliver his wife Bunny's ransom. This plot is countered by Maude, Lebowski's eccentric daughter from a past marriage. Julianne Moore, who played a porno actress in the great Boogie Nights, here plays a largely dissimilar sort of erotic artist, swathing herself in paint and launching herself through the air in a leather harness. L.A. in this film is a menagerie of idiosyncratic characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus. The Dude is prone to lively fantasies when he's punched out or knocked unconscious, which occurs frequently, and one of them turns into a musical comedy set piece featuring a beautiful POV shot from within a bowling ball.The Big Lebowski tears across all trajectories and never goes anywhere. That isn't so much a failing as its technique. The Dude, who rocks a lot of ganj,' swigs White Russians mixed with half-and-half, begins each day full of determination, but his devices steadily melt into a fog of lost chances and misconstrued intent. The atmosphere is set up right at first, when the narrator begins sufficiently well but ultimately admits he's lost his own gist, a droll curveball drawing our attention to the incidence of screenwriters who will never be unwilling to remove all support from us even after it has been literally soiled by a shaggy-dog-story character we may or may not ever see again in this chaotic plot.This could never equal its predecessor Fargo, but it's bizarrely winning, like its hero, played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, potbelly, ponytail and Bermuda shorts so bulky they may have been scrounged from his sounding board and bowling partner, Walter Sobchak. Their other teammate is Donny, who may not be too sharp-witted, but it's difficult to know as he's never permitted to finish a sentence. Set at the time of the Gulf War, here are characters whose language was created by earlier times, Vietnam, flower power and the Twilight Zone. As with Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski shows us a protagonist whose doofus-y simplicity appears to be his sole defense from the real world. He and Walter's very idea of real life may be wrought by the narrow ways they have to express it. Bridges does more with his downcast physical expression than countless comics can manage by laying it on thick.From its opening credits, The Big Lebowski indeed appears and feels like a shuck-and-jive. That's why the recognizable premise of a staged kidnapping complete with betrayals is only outwardly commonplace. Crime and reason are not the concerns here. What matters is how hard-wearing the two or three characters we're most concerned for are, despite the misfortune generated by their own ineptness. The Big Lebowski---a surrealist farce cooked up by the unruly Coens out of odds and ends of the deep-rooted and the new-fangled, the philosophical and the primal, in a fraction of LA where heightened reality crashes with autistic character interaction---amounts to noticeably less than the sum of its frequently lively and entertaining parts.

He lives merely to go bowling, but is taken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with calamitous results. We all know people like the Dude, and so, supposedly, do the Coen brothers. They rooted the character in a producer named Jeff Dowd. Both dudes rely on lateral thinking much more than orderliness.The Dude is paid a visit by two enforcers who obviously have the wrong Lebowski, but before they discover that, one has already peed on the Dude's rug, sparking intense hostility That rug really tied the room together, the Dude laments. John Goodman's Walter Sobchak leads the vendetta. Sponging lines straight from Bush 41, he declares that this aggression will not stand and insists the Dude draw a line in the sand. The Dude drops in on the real Lebowski, leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself solicited into the millionaire's conspiracies.Rich Lebowski, wheelchair-bound like General Sternwood and staring into a fireplace like Major Amberson, wants the Dude to deliver his wife Bunny's ransom. This plot is countered by Maude, Lebowski's eccentric daughter from a past marriage. Julianne Moore, who played a porno actress in the great Boogie Nights, here plays a largely dissimilar sort of erotic artist, swathing herself in paint and launching herself through the air in a leather harness. L.A. in this film is a menagerie of idiosyncratic characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus. The Dude is prone to lively fantasies when he's punched out or knocked unconscious, which occurs frequently, and one of them turns into a musical comedy set piece featuring a beautiful POV shot from within a bowling ball.The Big Lebowski tears across all trajectories and never goes anywhere. That isn't so much a failing as its technique.

It gives Jack Nicholson one of his paramount roles, as a retiring detective who makes a vow and struggles to honor it. It sees the longing for justice running wild and growing treacherous. The story has the rudiments of a crime thriller---cops, suspects, fatalities, evidence---but ultimately it's a character study, and in Detective Jerry Black, Nicholson crafts a character we can't turn away from en route to the dusk of his compulsion.Jerry is retiring in Reno. He's from a bygone age band glancing around for ashtrays in the offices of non-smokers. News arrives that the disfigured corpse of a girl has been discovered. Dedicated Jerry wants to work out his last day, and ultimately finds himself bearing the heartbreaking information to the parents. This scene, set by Penn on the couple's turkey farm, is astonishing in its backdrop and its effect. Nicholson weaving through thousands of turkey chicks, finally holding a crucifix made by the slain Ginny, he promises by his soul's salvation that he'll catch the murderer. This is the eponymous pledge, and in due course it consumes him.It seems initially that the murderer has been caught. Benicio Del Toro plays a Native American, clearly retarded, who was witnessed fleeing from the scene. Evidence appears to connect his pickup truck with the atrocity. Show-off detective Aaron Eckhardt extracts a confession, with Jerry fidgeting behind the glass and saying the Native American doesn't understand the question. Then the Native American takes matters into his own hands, quite literally, cementing his guilt in the minds of the police. Except for Jerry.

Was he connected to other unresolved slayings of little children? Now Penn, carving from Friedrich Durrenmatt's novel and the adaptation Jerzy and Mary Kromolowski, seamlessly start the film's gradual plunge into Jerry's obsession.

He meets mother Robin Wright Penn and her young daughter, and they share an intuitive compassion that buds into something more. After a couple of divorces, Jerry finally experiences what a content family life can be. We instantly grasp that the daughter is would-be prey, if the killer is in fact still on the loose. We believe Jerry realizes this, too. Though certainly he wouldn't draw on this lovely little girl as a lure? The core predicament of Jerry's pursuit is that he's the sole person who has confidence in it. His ex-contemporaries assume he's gone over the edge. Even chief Sam Shepard, an old comrade, looks despondently at Jerry's deranged fanaticism. His gas station ruse may be a gamble, or the work of a seasoned top-drawer cop, or just confirmation that he's losing sight of reality. The final act of the movie is where most police stories go on self-steer, with compulsory chases and mass fights. That's when The Pledge becomes most forcefully gripping. Penn and Nicholson take chances with the material and exalt the movie to another, surprising, poignantly lingering altitude.What is unmistakable about Penn as a director is that he finds no appeal in making conventional films. He is enthralled by characters under great tension. He's jaded by run-of-the-mill genre exercises. The character of Jerry here is not just a good cop, but a retired man, palpably of a particular generation, a man overcome by a cast-iron notion. He's capable on one hand of conveying charisma and permanence, one incentive for the younger woman being that he bids tranquility after her aggressive marriage. But we intuit murkier, more grave undercurrents, and concerns he isn't entirely alert to himself. By the end, the tension pivots by and large on Jerry himself, and the resolution of the crime is a profoundly haunting axis for the unforgettable images of him that bookend the film. It's here that Nicholson's talent is most crucial, and most valued He has to illustrate for us a guy who has embarked on a shocking and lonesome mission into the mystifying spaces of his psyche.

It gives Jack Nicholson one of his paramount roles, as a retiring detective who makes a vow and struggles to honor it. It sees the longing for justice running wild and growing treacherous. The story has the rudiments of a crime thriller---cops, suspects, fatalities, evidence---but ultimately it's a character study, and in Detective Jerry Black, Nicholson crafts a character we can't turn away from en route to the dusk of his compulsion.Jerry is retiring in Reno. He's from a bygone age band glancing around for ashtrays in the offices of non-smokers. News arrives that the disfigured corpse of a girl has been discovered. Dedicated Jerry wants to work out his last day, and ultimately finds himself bearing the heartbreaking information to the parents. This scene, set by Penn on the couple's turkey farm, is astonishing in its backdrop and its effect. Nicholson weaving through thousands of turkey chicks, finally holding a crucifix made by the slain Ginny, he promises by his soul's salvation that he'll catch the murderer. This is the eponymous pledge, and in due course it consumes him.It seems initially that the murderer has been caught. Benicio Del Toro plays a Native American, clearly retarded, who was witnessed fleeing from the scene. Evidence appears to connect his pickup truck with the atrocity. Show-off detective Aaron Eckhardt extracts a confession, with Jerry fidgeting behind the glass and saying the Native American doesn't understand the question. Then the Native American takes matters into his own hands, quite literally, cementing his guilt in the minds of the police. Except for Jerry. He's been doing this too long.In retirement, he persists in probing the case, in time discovering that the departed Ginny had befriended a giant she called The Wizard. Who was he? Was he the culprit? Was he connected to other unresolved slayings of little children? Now Penn, carving from Friedrich Durrenmatt's novel and the adaptation Jerzy and Mary Kromolowski, seamlessly start the film's gradual plunge into Jerry's obsession. He oddly buys a gas station convenience store flanked by two townships where he believes the Wizard might've killed similarly. Analyzing doodles by Ginny, he believes he knows what vehicle the killer might've driven The store is an unassuming snare.An unanticipated thing occurs. He meets mother Robin Wright Penn and her young daughter, and they share an intuitive compassion that buds into something more. After a couple of divorces, Jerry finally experiences what a content family life can be. We instantly grasp that the daughter is would-be prey, if the killer is in fact still on the loose. We believe Jerry realizes this, too. Though certainly he wouldn't draw on this lovely little girl as a lure?

That's just wrong. But that's just what Tootsie is. Hoffman in drag. And lo and behold it was a huge critical success that garnered multiple Oscar nominations including best picture, as well as an Oscar win for Jessica Lange. The film is about out of work actor Michael Dorsey, played by Dustin Hoffman. Dorsey has built his reputation as one of the most difficult actors to work with and so now he is hopelessly desperate for a role. He is so desperate that he dresses up as a woman and becomes actress Dorothy Michaels. He tries out for a role in a soap opera as Dorothy and scores the part, becoming a media icon and a role model for empowered women everywhere. The film sounds absurd and impossible but it is surprisingly believable and very entertaining. It's the sort of film with a wide audience appeal and a crowd pleasing attitude that comes off so well that it is hard to criticize the film harshly. Instead you just want to enjoy it and have a good time.The nice thing about this film is how tasteful it is. The story is told in a friendly and respectable manner that I'm not sure could be twisted into something offensive and tasteless no matter how hard you tried. The film is not exploitative in any way and instead it is a human story about love and life. It's a story with a message that we are all fond of and can easily warm our hearts, only in a very unconventional way. It's a film full of spirit and life that transfers so well to the audience. The film has a sharp script that I can buy into every detail of, never feeling my intelligence insulted. This isn't easy to do when you have a plot as outrageous as the one in Tootsie so the film deserves a ton of credit for pulling off a feat like that.I will say on a more personal note that, despite the quality of this film, it's not exactly my style. This isn't a film for me to fall in love with and the romantic aspect doesn't really intrigue me or draw me in. Instead I just have to sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is. These are things that can't be changed because that is what the movie is. It is a romantic comedy told in an amusingly unorthodox manner. I did enjoy the quirkiness of it and I did find it funny, but overall this isn't a film that I would die for or call a masterpiece. But it is a good film, don't get me wrong, and I can respect the quality in the script and creative storyline, and, most of all, the acting.Dustin Hoffman truly delivers one of his best performances. As Michael Dorsey he is determined and stalwart, playing a character motif he plays a lot of the time. It is the typical hard headed Hoffman that we are all familiar with. But as Dorothy Michaels he is something completely different. For one, he plays a female almost too well. He dons one of the most convincing accents ever, as well as hitting the mannerisms of a southern belle so perfectly. His makeup is impressive, as he really does look like a woman in this film, but everything aside from the physical aspects is perfect as well. He shines in such an odd way but it works all too well. The supporting cast is excellent as well with fine actors such as Jessica Lange and Bill Murray. Murray plays one of the funniest characters in the film. He is Jeff, Michael's roommate who doesn't want any involvement in Michael's shenanigans yet always enjoys throwing his own opinions into what Michael is doing with lines that guarantee copious amounts of laughter. It is obvious that this film wouldn't be complete without all of its fine actors.Tootsie is a well acted, well written, well put together film, but it is not one I would watch again. I enjoyed it as a fun and entertaining use of two hours of my day but that's it. I don't see the film sticking with me but I have undying respect for its quality. Hoffman's performance is incredible, the film is so hilariously unique, and it actually elicited quite a few laughs from me.

The film is powerful, provocative, intense, disturbing, and violent. At the center of it, is a powerful, landmark performance by Robert De Niro as a mentally disturbed ex-Vietnam vet-turned-nighttime New York City taxicab driver named Travis Bickle.In a city of well over four million people (and counting), De Niro's Travis Bickle character is so lonely, so unable to relate to other human beings, and so isolated from the rest of society that he might as well as not even exist. He takes to driving around a cab a night in an attempt to deal with an intense bout of insomnia. He also seeks a cure for his loneliness by attempting to date the pretty Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign volunteer for an aspiring presidential candidate who's running on a platform of radical social change. But his plan goes sour when he takes her to a porno theater and she refuses to speak to him afterward.This tiny mishap pushes Bickle over the edge.He's taken a radical dislike to what he sees as the scum of the earth the crime, the violence, drug distribution, decadence, sleaze, perversion, prostitution and general amorality that is causing the city to decay from the inside-out, both morally and spiritually. And it doesn't take long for him to begin to act on his violent impulses, since he now has an outlet for his rage. He embarks on an intense physical fitness regimen and eventually purchases a series of illegal firearms to aid him in his mission of ridding New York City of society's undesirables. That's why he's currently gunning for Sport (Harvey Keitel), the slick-talking pimp of teenage runaway-turned-prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster), which ultimately culminates in a bloodbath ending that truly has to be seen to believed.Taxi Driver was widely acclaimed upon its release in 1976, especially after claiming the prized Palme d'Or at Cannes. But it was also heavily criticized for its controversial subject matter that included its ruminations on the violent thoughts of its mentally disturbed lead character and gore-laden climax. It is also not enough that Paul Schrader's screenplay was reportedly inspired by the private diaries of Arthur Bremer, the gunman behind the attempted assassination of George Wallace in 1972. It is also not enough that the screenplay is semi-autobiographical in more ways than one - not just because of its relation to a real-life would-be assassin, but also because the anger, rage, frustration, and isolation behind the life of screenwriter Paul Schrader also feeds into the film's pervasive anger, grittiness, paranoia, and oft-violent mind-set.Taxi Driver may have reached the peak of its controversy - more like, infamy - when John Hinckley, Jr., a noted obsessive of the film, attempted to assassinate then-President Ronald Reagan in 1981, in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, whom he had an obsessive romantic infatuation with. Talk about life imitating art, since in the film, Bickle makes an attempt on the life of the politician Betsy is working for (like Hinckley would try to do for Jodie Foster in just five years' time). Whether or not Bickle did this to get her attention in the film, is not totally clear.Taxi Driver is my favorite picture by Martin Scorsese, who also appears in a not-so-self-serving-and-actually-pretty-effective cameo in the middle of the film as a man on the trail of his adulterous wife, whom he plans to kill when he gets the chance. After this film, I would consider Scorsese's next great pictures (in order) to be The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Goodfellas (1990).

It's an overly elaborate story, unashamedly building to the simultaneously-filmed follow-up, that has neither the steady pace nor the genuine charm of the original. Plot holes the size of a steam engine are the least of its concerns, given that the first film managed to be such a success in spite of similar problems.

In all seriousness, it pains me to think that there may come a time when this movie, shot in black-and-white and with nary a special effect and with all the limitations of the technology of its time (1942), will seem so primitive and unnatural that instead of being a classic, it will be considered a curiosity. That will be a very sad time indeed.Bogie and Bergman are immortal, not just because of this film, but I cannot imagine a time when people who see Casablanca will fail to be affected by their story in the film. Bergman is indelibly and incredibly beautiful, completely believable as the woman caught between two men that she loves equally in very different ways. Bogie is the man that women want to be with, the man that men want to be smart, suave, completely cool, admired and respected by everyone and feared by those who have a reason to fear him. And in this place called Casablanca, with the world crashing into war around them, they play out a story that's both intensely personal and yet universal.The mythology that's sprung up about this movie is a story unto itself, and maybe some day someone will write a movie about that. Suffice it to say that the way the pieces came together, you have to believe that this was as movie that was meant to be.Casablanca was made back in the days when movies and live plays were pretty much the only games in town when it came to entertainment (other than sports), and since every small town had a movie theater but only big cities had live plays, EVERYONE went to the movies. I don't think young people who have so many options for entertainment now can quite understand what a big deal a movie like this was, and how beloved and what a stir it created.

In a way, this is the goal that the four main protagonists in Boorman's film indirectly try to reach. They decide to go down the river in a canoe to go back to their roots and to take advantage of a rural place that is bound to be swallowed up by a dam. At first, Boorman seems to be on their side. The film depicts numerous shots of a gorgeous river and imposing landscapes. Details reinforced by a slow, contemplative rhythm and a discreet editing. Moreover, Drew (Ronny Cox) tries to communicate with a muted peasant through music.But little by little, Boorman reveals to the audience that elements of these beautiful landscapes make nature dangerous and hostile to the four adventurers. One can note down that before the apparition of the two silly peasants, Lewis (Burt Reynolds) had animal instincts in him. After the killing of one of the two men, he chooses to bury the corpse and not to call the police. From this watershed onwards, Boorman manages to create an intense tension that won't subside. On the contrary, it will increase with the other misadventures endured by the four men. None of them will be spared and all of them will keep physical or moral scars from this sad trek. The message conveyed by the filmmaker is clear man must accept society and his return to nature can only damage his personality. A must see film.

I did not like her character. She was annoying I also hated Alicia. Her purpose in the movie was just to Make Grissom mad. Everything else she was involved in was pointless.I'm giving it an 8 because it is incredibly entertaining. Every time I watch it(and that's a lot) I still get surprised by how entertaining it is.And the performances by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson is excellent. Jack Nicholson didn't play the role of the joker as well Heath Ledger but still great. As for Keaton, he is the best live action Batman. The best Batman is Kevin Conroy, voice of Batman on the animated series.Overall, it is entertaining, funny, and a few memorable performances ","genre":null},{"date":"11 July 2011","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Don't get me wrong, I love this movie, but it has its flaws. The plot for me seems a little stupid, but picks itself up by the end, but honestly it's not enough to make it a ten.Also, Kim Bassinger is annoying. Sure she's cute, but she is very annoying. I did not like her character. She was annoying I also hated Alicia. Her purpose in the movie was just to Make Grissom mad. Everything else she was involved in was pointless.I'm giving it an 8 because it is incredibly entertaining.

Like its predecessor, it's traditional formalized amusement with a full-size cast and opulent locales. The difference is that here, there is more than mere stylistic commemoration of a time, place and tradition. It's actually an intensely realized story on screen. Director John Guillermin maximizes the interesting settings and employs a cyclical flashback method to build likely disparities on how the crime happened. The reenactments in this movie are almost surprisingly unnerving and the cast is very compelling.Sleuth playwright Anthony Shaffer's adaptation doesn't have a single fallacy. When Ustinov finally exposes the culprit in the ultimate drawing room scenes it comes as an absolute revelation. Each of the dozen characters hovering down the Nile is a suspect. Every one on the ship could have and might have bumped off Lois Chiles, the condescending millionairess who has thieved her best friend's fiancée.Shaffer has also rendered several knowingly overstated characters to harmonize Peter Ustinov, the fourth actor to play Belgian consulting detective Hercule Poirot. There's Angela Lansbury's inebriated depiction of a romance novelist. Bette Davis as an oppressive and pompous Washington lace curtain and Maggie Smith as her resentful company. Jack Warden as a frantic Swiss doctor. I.S. Johar in a richly offbeat performance as the caretaker of the ship on which the homicides transpire. David Niven as Poirot's associate Colonel Race. Jon Finch as a Marxist radical. Nevertheless the star is Ustinov and the piercing wits of our stuck-up hero.
