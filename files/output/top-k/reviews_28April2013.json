The film does not tell the story of Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), an Mexican police struggling to keep its distance from the corruption that seems to follow him everywhere; is not the story of Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) and Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), two DEA agents trying to transform the drug dealer low Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) against drug cartel chief; is not the story of Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of the innocent cartel drug boss who suddenly discovers that her husband really is, and what he does for a living; is not the story of a new head of the DEA, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a man so involved in his mission end the war on drugs, he fails to realize that his own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is becoming addicted to crack. It's not only one main story, it is all these stories that construct the film in a fantastic way, showing the traffic world from various perspectives. And much like in the real world, the events of each story, directly or indirectly affect each other.In terms of history, Traffic is absolutely brilliant, Stephen Gaghan (screenplay) uses a writing so incredible, delivering over 100 scenes of dialog between the characters and their stories. They all serve even as an anti-drug message, and the direction Soderbergh helps complement everything.The film is so well directed that the public feels suffocated. There is no background music at all, leaving the viewer feeling as if witnessing scenes of real life, not just watching a movie. These techniques to make a very personal experience for that Soderbergh, as in previous films, uses various shades of color specific to enhance a mood or a feeling of awareness of what is about to happen in each story of a character.The film's cast is totally flawless. There is no better or worse in the film, each and every character adds something significant to the history of film, and each actor is excellent. But three actors, in particular, stand out Benicio Del Toro simply superb gives a performance so realistic and PERFECT to his character; Don Cheadle fantastic as always; Catherine Zeta Jones delivers a performance so complex and gets better with every passing minute.A stunning movie, Traffic has a steady gaze hard on called war on drugs, which is perfectly clear and uncompromising. Director Steven Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan stand up the various points of view of the drug culture, ranging from users, traffickers, police and politicians. And weaves his characters and their different stories into one story that is deep in his ideas, but very simple to understand with pure realism that the film manages to show. In terms of history, direction and characters, Traffic is easily the best Soderbergh film to date, and one of the best films made in recent years.

The performances in this film are marvellous Robert De Niro plays a likable, youthful priest who encourages a little misfit in the boys he looks over, but also tries to mould them into men who are prepared for the realities of life; Kevin Bacon knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the sadistic, sick guard who watches the boys when they are sentenced to the boys detention centre in upstate New York, and even though it is tough to watch his character is played to perfection; when the boys grow up, we get some good turns from Jason Patric, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, and Brad Pitt, as scarred older men who all want some sort of justice for the abuse they suffered at the hands of guards when they were locked up. The story is great. We get a look into the lives of these boys before their incarceration, and then we see the repercussions of what happened to them while they were in the boys detention centre, which echo heavily through all their new lives. I felt much of the dialogue was very natural, and it never seemed to stray out of its world to make any grand statements; the script simply lets the story tell itself, and doesn't try to become an allegory for anything larger, which is totally fine because this plays as a dissection of how when a system fails to do what it is intended to do, those who have been damaged by that system end up either trying to tear it down, or using it against itself. It just lets the story happen, and this is how we come to understand its aim without any metaphors or parallels to anything else; sometimes simple works best.All in all I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because Sleepers is absolutely solid through and through. If only it could have been longer to get more of all the characters in, but there Levinson tells the story he wanted to, and I enjoy it every time I watch it over again.

This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film.The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men.Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life.One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular.The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing.

As a devout Horror fan, my favorite anthology is the Saw series, and watching Cube really give me a clue as to where it got its ideas from.The film has a very short exposition, basically showing us people stuck in the cube. Every room either has a death trap, or doesn't. The prisoners must figure out how to get out, or die trying. The screenplay\/story is original, compelling, interesting and exquisitely smart, excellent job by the writers. We even get a few twists, though not really shocking ones, mostly about the group dynamics of the prisoners. Some smarter twists could have really made the film even better. The acting is excellent by the entire cast, all characters are portrayed perfectly. Personally I've been most impressed with Andrew Miller as Kazan. Making a single-location film is always a challenge, to which Cube has stood up in the best way possible.Cube leaves many questions asked, and I doubt the two sequels answer them.

And since it has Gina Gershon in her prime as this tough and yet hot lesbian with a nude scene. But despite that as this movie progressed I just quickly started to lose interest, maybe about 40 minutes in. The plot is about these two lesbians trying to steal from the mafia and one of the two lesbian is one of the mafia members girl named Violet(Jennifer Tilly). Who I just couldn't stand, Jennifer Tilly is good at playing these slightly ditsy character but I just could never get used to her voice. And the other a tough and yet hot ex-con who works as a painter and a plumber named Corky. And the mafia guy who they are trying to steal from is a guy named Caesar(Joe Pantoliano). Joe Pantoliano will also star in another role as Cypher which is a role that he will most likely be known for throughout his career. This is one of those movies about the girls overcoming the guys and staying stronger, which is fine. But it's done is a predictable and dull manner. I was expecting few curve balls but it just goes in a very predictable direction. During some scenes it just has way too much of a perfect timing to the point it becomes just plain out silly and ridiculous and this happens multiple times throughout this movie. Also none of the characters are likable in this movie. Corky is a ex-con by choice and Violet is just a mafia guy's girl that is just unsatisfied. She wasn't abused or anything like that and claims she just couldn't stand being with a man that breaks the law and stuff and yet goes along with a ex-con instead. But that just seemed like a excuse because she is a lesbian. Sure Corky is less malicious compared to Caesar but just couldn't sympathize with any of the character. And sure Caesar is the bad guy of this story but he just didn't seem all that sadistic or evil and seemed to actually love Violet.

In fact even Jackson's adaptation of THE HOBBIT suffers in comparison with his earlier masterwork . I went in to Ridley Scott's LEGEND not expecting much . It's a film that rather mediocre reviews on its release in 1985 and cemented the director's reputation as an artist only interested in visuals to the detriment of emotion and narrative Certainly on a visual level there's little that can be criticised even in a cinematic post LOTR world and one can't help thinking that perhaps Jackson has borrowed the visual look from Scott when he adapted the Tolkien books . There is a subtle difference and that is Scott shoots a few too many medium shots in comparison to Jackson . Jackson concentrates on an ambitious sweeping spectacle that shows off the sets and locations to the best of their function where as Scott seems to lack this ambition . This isn't perhaps not a fundamental criticism since one doubts if Scott was allowed the laissez faire artistic control Jackson was allowed . The New Hollywood attitude of film making had ended in near disaster for the studios about three or four years earlier and one can understand the studio producers wanting to be charge of a production rather than the director And this is where LEGEND fails . It's a film that gives the impression that the producers don't know who to market the film for. LORD OF THE RINGS is a rare film that celebrates Aglophile culture where as LEGEND seems to be a film that is trying - and failing to appeal to a trans-Atlantic multiplex audience . Tom Cruise has never been prettier but seems miscast as a hero who is rather rather wet as opposed to heroic . Likewise the whole file suffers from a lack of focus as to who the film will appeal to . The somewhat unrealistic nature fantasy based nature of the film won't appeal to a more mature audience while the very impressive make up and demonic characters will absolutely terrify young children .

Tom Hanks has never been better and there is great support from Paul Newman, Jude Law ( his best performance) and Daniel Craig. Special mention must also go to Tyler Hoechlin as Hanks son who puts in a well measured and very believable performance as he tries to gain the love and respect of his father.The film is beautifully filmed and there is a real brooding atmosphere throughout with highly stylised bouts of gun fights adding to the well paced drama.What really elevates this film to brilliance though is the portrayal of the relationship between father and son. Rarely have I seen such a realistic and honest portrayal of the bond between father and son. The ending is heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time and I am not ashamed to say that it brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it.I can't praise this film highly enough.

Some people's standards for a movie must be really, really low.First of all, I have to say that I have not seen The Matrix, which was referred to in several users' reviews. So I am not comparing this movie to anything else. My opinions are based on this movie all by itself.It was a mystery. It kept my attention. I wanted to solve the mystery. I kept watching to get an explanation of what was going on, but explanation there was none. During the first part, I thought it was going somewhere. At first, the scenes seemed to make some sense. But as the movie proceeded, the scenes were just made-up incidents that had no relationship to each other or to anything. The movie never did explain things, and as the credits rolled, it still didn't make any sense. The ending just throws the viewer into a complete state of bewilderment, as if all of what went before wasn't bad enough. I mean, you thought you were getting some kind of explanation there for a while, but then the ending just blows that up in your face.What does the title have to do with the film, anyway? If it had anything to do with it, it went past me.The plot idea sounded like a good concept when I read the plot outline. But I was extremely disappointed in the movie. I think you could say that this film only laid out the plot idea but never developed it. It most certainly did not tie loose ends together. I don't understand how anyone could write so poorly. If the plot makes no sense or is otherwise poor, then you have no movie. You just have a bunch of scenes. This so-called movie had a bunch of scenes that were mostly unrelated and that went nowhere. It's a complete waste of time to watch such a so-called movie.

We must remember that this is a comedy of a war movie. This film has an all star cast, great dialog and directed by an Academy award winning director. The setting is in a WWII German prison camp where U.S. servicemen try to find a way to escape. But the Germans seem to be one step ahead and foil these attempts. In the mix of all of this is a great comedy performance by actors Robert Strauss and Harbey Lembeck, two of the camps clowns. Not to forget the Academy award winning performance of William Holden who barters his way around camp for those extra items or for extra curricular activities. There's a serious side to this film which is why Billy Wilfer again won't disappoint. It's a must-have film to add to one's movie library.

Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men.You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the lower Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here.Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw Giant. Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless.Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see Giant for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

The dramatic scenes, it gives you a glance of how it is in prison, the emotional scenes. It is all a masterpiece, there is a reason to why it is the best movie I have ever watched and probably will ever watch. The amazing acting, plot and moderate length. The last scene, with Red walking up the beach towards Andy and the credits slowly rolling in, it makes you beg for it to never end. When it comes to movies I can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie, which Shawshank is. It definitely deserves the spot as #1, I cannot understand how it didn't win an Oscar.I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend, but get a load of potato chips and soda, since you will finish it all up very fast.
