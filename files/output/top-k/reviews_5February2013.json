Because the characters in his films are so fascinating, we share his fascination with these people as well. While his 1964 mystery Marnie may not bare comparison to his very finest films, you can at least be sure that the story being told and the characters on screen are probably going to be interesting enough to make the experience worthwhile. Tippi Hedren plays the title character Marnie, a mentally unstable young woman who has an intense fear as well as hatred for men, thunderstorms, and the color red. She's also a thief who steals money from the companies she works at and changes her identity every time she does. She successfully gets new jobs at other companies with her fake identities and resumes. One day, she gets a job at a company run by someone (Sean Connery) who knows a bit about her activities and she gets caught by him when she tries to pull off another theft. But he admits to falling in love with her to the point where he won't turn her to the police under the condition that she marries him. Although she reluctantly agrees, he begins to suspect something may not be mentally right with her after all and that he needs to know why she is acting the way she is. Marnie has an impressive premise and for about its first half to two thirds, it delivered on the promises it made and the plot twist at the end was well built up. I thought Hedren and Connery were solid in their roles since they incorporated enough intrigue into the people they played. There were also some well directed scenes including one where Hedren's character was trying to rob the vault inside Connery's character's office that is solely done through visuals and no sound. That scene had a great build-up and was well timed in its execution. The direction in the film's last third to half did lose its momentum a bit and some unnecessary plot complications ensued. One of which was Diane Baker's character who is supposed to be the former sister-in-law of Connery's character, but I don't know what her purpose in the plot was. She's kind of made out to be some sort of antagonist, but she isn't well developed enough to be called that for certain. For that matter, she served no purpose to the plot since she didn't really do anything therefore making her pointless.I'd be lying if I said the narrative was completely clear since it started getting too complicated when the two main characters get married. The story became more heavily layered to the point where it becomes more difficult to follow the story. Furthermore, I didn't think there was any real reason why the plot needed to become more layered in the first place since a handful of scenes don't even have a purpose to them. There's a scene where Marnie puts an animal in danger that wasted valuable time. The film's special effects are very unconvincing. There are some shots in which Hedren is riding on a horse or Hedren and Connery were riding in a car that were obviously fake. I could tell because the green screen effects were completely dated. Whatever props they were using to film those certain scenes felt really fake for me. Marnie isn't one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films because of those certain pet peeves with the plot and the special effects. But for Hitchcock fans, there are a handful of things to like about Marnie such as the creative premise and some well directed scenes that should keep us fans satisfied enough.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"5 February 2013","score":"","review":" By 1983 the horror sub-genre of slasher films were dwindling, offering largely imitations of the hugely successful Friday the 13th series (in 1984 Friday had it's 'Final Chapter' that proved to be eventually false), with films such as Curtains, The Forest or Sleepaway Camp. Whilst the majority of these films expressed the vapid nature of teenagers as throwaway avatars for murder, they continued with the conventions set out by John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), but added very little in originality or invention. Of course, Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street was not the first slasher to involve a supernatural villain - Uli Lommel's ridiculous The Boogeyman (1980) - along with Halloween's Michael Myers - had utilised these elements before, but Craven's nightmare hook turned what could have been a standard early- '80's horror film into something quite original and filled with socio- political ideas.Wes Craven at this point in his career had made the notorious (and still quite shocking) debut, The Last House on the Left (1972), the mediocre, yet well known The Hills Have Eyes (1977) and the failed mystery, Deadly Blessing (1981) - amongst other inferior projects. He had yet to display his intelligent subversion of horror conventions that are now well known though the Scream franchise (1996 - 2011), but within the foundation of his slasher screenplay, was a concept inspired by a real-life mystery that he embellished, creating what is now an icon of the genre. Craven read in the newspapers about a young Asian boy who was fearful of sleep, telling his parents that someone was after him in his dreams. One night his physician father gave him sleeping pills, and the boy violently died in his sleep. So, what if there was someone attempting to kill a group of teenagers in their sleep? Well, it would surely make for an interesting narrative, and one that would equally be frightening, smart and original.In this context, Krueger represents America's violent past, from the decimation of native Indians, through the depravity of civil war, to the embarrassment of the failed war in Vietnam. Reagan wanted to present the nation as a clean-cut, progressive society, and with the religious right now on his side (before 1980, state and religion were separated by the constitution, until Republicans realised the number of voters that could be gained by preaching god and country into their policies). In the first real introduction of Krueger proper in the film, the young Tina (Amanda Wyss) stands in an alleyway, and he enters at the other side, his Fedora hat in silhouette, he stands like a figure from the old western frontier, the music suggests the genre conventions of a John Ford film. But this is an outlaw figure twisted to reveal to the youth of the '80's that they are no longer able to believe the lies and deceits of parent and government. But Krueger is also a spectre of the past, who will correct the wrongs by eliminating the future, tearing apart the fabric of the fallacy created to whitewash any infractions of history.Aside from subtextual concepts that run through the film, there is ample room for inventive, bloody deaths. The supernatural infuses the script and lets fantasy become overindulged. From the horrific death of Tina, whose body, slashed with the finger knives, is dragged onto the ceiling where she screams for life, to Johnny Depp's screen debut, where his body is pulled into his bed, gushing out blood at an impossible rate, the bloodletting is both horrifying and informatively original. In Nancy we have the standard final girl of the sub-genre, but she is far more intelligent than previous girls. Langenkamp portrays the strong-willed female with confidence. But fundamentally, unlike films such as Friday the 13th or Halloween, the monster seems to have purpose, his vengeance almost justified by the legality of his murder; legitimised by a troubled past. In a way, Krueger looks over the teenagers, like the incredibly effective scene where his claws and face push through the wall above the sleeping Nancy, he peeks into the wrong bedroom, but he wants to expose the fabrication of history.I first saw A Nightmare on Elm Street on video in 1985 (a friends brother rented it for us - I was 9), and it was one of the first modern horror films I was introduced to. To be honest it was a bit of a revelation, and I can easily state that it probably changed my life, in the sense that I saw a film that played with film form, and presented the concept and atmosphere of a dream\/nightmare in such a primal and effective way. It is certainly a film that has stayed in my sub- conscious ever since. The impact of the film, and its central, monstrous conceit (Krueger), has been watered down with seven inferior sequels (which I will be reviewing over the next few months), and has therefore lost the thing that made it work on so many levels. But, watching this film as a stand alone narrative, it still has a powerful, deeply disturbing idea - we all sleep, we all dream. What if that activity that we all need to survive could kill you? The only real failure of this first movie is the multiple, farcical endings that time has been unkind to. It seems that director and producer, Robert Shaye, were unable to agree on a suitable end, but resolved to use them all. But it is still a film of interesting beauty and mood, and a film that I will no doubt return to in the future.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"5 February 2013","score":"","review":" By 1983 the horror sub-genre of slasher films were dwindling, offering largely imitations of the hugely successful Friday the 13th series (in 1984 Friday had it's 'Final Chapter' that proved to be eventually false), with films such as Curtains, The Forest or Sleepaway Camp.
