But in 1931, a bit like 3D now, there was still much confusion over to how make films, with directors, producers and actors alike, were still moving over from the suddenly dated silent era, with varying success.Tod Browning was a man who would unfortunately find little success in the sound era, but not necessarily because he couldn't move with the times, but because his career was derailed a couple of years later by his disturbing horror pic, Freaks.Dracula was shot THREE times. One, this one, was the conventional sound version that we all know. An other was shot at night and in Spanish for the benefit of that audience, which the studio supposedly preferred. This was quite common at this time, but little known nowadays. And the third was a straight forward silent version for the many theatres still un-equipped to handle sound.But the styles of the silent era are all over this film. From the long silent reactions shots and the over acting, especially by Bela Lagosi in the titular role. This was also the adaptation of the stage adaptation of Bram Stoker's chiller, and was faithfully adapted from that source, hence the lack of more complex special effects, with bats on strings and fog machines, over more cinematic effects.The transformation scenes for example, where the Count morphs from a bat to the undead human occur off-screen, rather than some form of cross fade etc. Is this a choice driven by lack of money? Lack of cinematic ambition of a choice to stick to the stage material? To be honest, I have too little knowledge or experience of Tod Browning's work to suggest a reason, but when all's said and done, it did work.Let's be honest, this is 80 years old and is not the least bit scary and it is hard not to laugh, but in context, I'm sure it worked well at the time and the story is well conveyed. Lagosi's undead performance is hammy by today's standards but he was somewhat likable. He was very deliberate, slow and the silent era has certainly left its scars, as the subtly of sound performing was yet to take hold.But this is the sort of film were silent melodramatic acting still worked. This is of course a piece Gothic Horror, the home of melodrama if ever there was one. This is surly a product of its time, both as the industry went through one of it's most dramatic changes, which ended so many careers as well a created so many new ones, but it's also, let's not forget, the first direct adaptation of Bram Stoker's book, besides the 1922 German version, Nosferatu, which changes a fair few details to try to get around the copyright, failing to do so mind, resulting in failed bid to have every copy of the film destroyed.This is the film that ingrained the image of the Dracula that we know today into popular culture.

Well somewhere around ten years old anyway, the Terminator franchise has never been particularly good at establishing a timeline and sticking to it. Anyhow, as was the case the first time when Sarah Connor was the target, the new Terminator has not come back through time alone. The future human resistance has sent back someone to protect the Terminator's target. Of course the leader of that future resistance is John Connor. The Terminator's target is John Connor. So yes, John Connor has sent someone back though time to save John Connor. The first time around John sent a human back to save his mom and, no small detail this, ensure he would be conceived in the first place. Which makes very little sense if you think about it so I guess the best advice is don't think about it. Anyhow this time John doesn't send back a human to stop the Terminator. He sends back another Terminator. Oh, this is going to be good. Two Terminators from the future, a good one and a bad one, running amuck in Los Angeles. Lots of gunfights, lots of explosions, lots of beautiful mayhem.Arnold Schwarzenegger of course returns as the Terminator...with a twist. He's not the cold, ruthless killing machine of the first film. He's the good guy, John's protector. And he has more than met his match in the new and improved Terminator, the T-1000. If you thought the first film's Terminator was indestructible wait until you get a load of this thing. Shapeshifting liquid metal polyalloy, the T-1000 is an unstoppable villain. Robert Patrick, ordinary looking guy, plays the part of the T-1000 and manages to be more fearsome than big, bad Arnold ever was. But Arnold puts up a good fight. And, much more so than in the first film, Arnold actually gets to act. This time around his Terminator's got some heart to him. He's learning. He's almost...human.The conflict between the two Terminators is set up to be something spectacular and right from their first interaction the film doesn't disappoint. Schwarzenegger and Patrick both embody their killing machines wonderfully and, with the T-1000, the film's by now legendary visual effects add so much to the proceedings. Full marks to director James Cameron and his effects team for so brilliantly and seamlessly integrating their dazzling effects into the picture. They set the standard for generations to come.The film is not without its flaws. Edward Furlong never entirely convinces as young John Connor. Furlong gives a performance which gives off a spoiled brat vibe. Often it's very hard to see John Connor, as he is portrayed here, as a future leader of humankind. Furlong was new to the whole acting thing at the time and it shows. Throughout history we've seen plenty of mature film performances from child actors. This is not one of them. Linda Hamilton, again playing Sarah Connor, has a much harder edge to her than she did in the first film. Perhaps a little too hard of an edge at times one might feel but it's understandable for what the character has been through and for what she knows of the doomsday future. The two Terminators and John and Sarah are left to pretty much drive the plot forward by themselves, other characters serve as little more than window dressing. And at times the four main characters aren't enough to really keep the film moving along. Things sometimes get bogged down as we wait for the next inevitable confrontation between our two killing machines. Of course when those confrontations do come they are spectacular. Terminator 2 was in many ways a revolutionary film and, though not perfect, it is an enjoyable one. And for whatever quibbles you may have with the film there is no denying that it is a rather awesome spectacle.

I pretty much love the guy's work whether it's written or being put to film. I loved Midnight Meat Train more than most, I still think Hellraiser is one of the creepiest movies ever, and I always find myself getting lost in whatever Barker book I stumble upon. One of the first books I read by Barker was the Books of Blood Volumes 1-3. There were several stories that stood out, but one of the main ones that has always stuck with me over the years was Rawhead Rex. It's powerful, it's engrossing, and it's considered to be one of Barker's best short stories. So a film version of one of Barker's best should already have enough momentum to at least be decent at the end of the day. Unfortunately that isn't the case. Somehow Rawhead Rex became incredibly lame and plagued by 80's clichés somewhere in between its transition from novel to film.Did you ever used to watch Doug? The animated series on Nickelodeon with Porkchop, Quail Man, Roger Klotz, Patti Mayonnaise, and Skeeter? There was an episode called Nightmare on Jumbo Street where a horror movie hits the neighborhood where everyone in town sees it and is talking about it, but Doug closes his eyes and misses the ending. He stretches out seeing it again because he's scared, but when he finally gets around to seeing the ending he realizes you can see the zipper on the back of the monster's costume. That's kind of the way Rawhead Rex is except you basically see the metaphorical zipper as soon as Rawhead shows up. He looks terrible. It basically seems like a wrestler running around in a glorified ape costume. The mask looks like it's made of rubber except the facial features twitch occasionally, he's cross-eyed all the time, has two mouths in addition to one of those plastic sets of pecs and abs to make him look ripped, and his fingernails grow and shrink at will. Rawhead Rex basically looks like an ape raided Vernon Wells' leftover Road Warrior outfits and then decapitated and hollowed out the head of George, the King Kong-like character in the 1986 (made in the same year as the film) arcade game Rampage and wore that as a mask. Any of this sounding awesome yet? Oh, it's just getting started.I'm about to spoil the hell out of this movie mostly because it's out of print and practically impossible to find. Nearly all of Rawhead's kills end in some sort of obviously fake appendage or mannequin being used. Low budget films can be incredible, but it's usually when they're able to hide the fact that they were made so cheap. Rawhead Rex decides to embrace this fact while saying, Let's show Rawhead trying to bite this guy's neck even though his mouth doesn't open wide enough, it appears as if he's nibbling on the victim's cheek, and Rawhead looks like he's barfing blood on the guy rather than the blood coming from the victim's flesh wound. The monster is also territorial, which doesn't sound so bad until his territory is a trailer park. Rawhead not being creative with his kills doesn't really help matters either. It's pretty much all decapitations and claw swipes. One of the more bizarre moments in the film is when Rawhead Rex kills a man at his home and then goes after the man's wife. Rawhead destroys the inside of their home, but spares the woman when he realizes she's pregnant. The monster leaves and a friend of the couple shows up. When the friend finds the wife, he asks if she's alright. The woman clinches her fists and GROWLS at him before pausing for a moment and bursting into tears. That reaction should be used on unwelcome Jehovah's witnesses who come knocking at your door.The last half of the film is even worse. A magic rock saves the day. It's kept in a glowing red box in the Ireland church. Once the rock is used to help stop the monster, it uses the cheesiest 80's special effects imaginable. So if I'm a chick and I lift this rock over my head, I'll have a laser light show right in my own back yard? Righteous! The stone makes an appearance in the original story as well, but it's at least used in a way that comes off slightly less ridiculous than a rock that shoots lasers. The film just plays out in the worst of ways. A man tries to save a woman that Rawhead is about to slaughter, but winds up tearing her dress instead and we get our only nudity shot in the film. She bumps into a tree and dies. She's supposed to be thrown, but the impact is about as rough as accidentally bumping into somebody in public. Rawhead Rex is nothing like the source material. I was surprised they kept the vicar's baptism scene in there.Rawhead Rex is the type of film that gives horror a bad name; it's cliché, the monster is obviously a man in a rubber suit, it's predictable, and it's basically just meaningless gore. It's like the film tries to throw a little bit of the actual story in there near the end of the film, but it's too little too late. The damage has already been done. Rawhead Rex is pure cheese, but it's not even good cheese. It's like that hunk of cheese you've had in the fridge for a year and a half that's covered in three inch thick green mold. This film is out of print for a reason. Don't hunt it down unless you're a die hard Clive Barker or major horror fan. I implore you though to give the exceptional short story a read or to read it again if you have already.

The monster is also territorial, which doesn't sound so bad until his territory is a trailer park. Rawhead not being creative with his kills doesn't really help matters either. It's pretty much all decapitations and claw swipes. One of the more bizarre moments in the film is when Rawhead Rex kills a man at his home and then goes after the man's wife. Rawhead destroys the inside of their home, but spares the woman when he realizes she's pregnant. The monster leaves and a friend of the couple shows up. When the friend finds the wife, he asks if she's alright. The woman clinches her fists and GROWLS at him before pausing for a moment and bursting into tears. That reaction should be used on unwelcome Jehovah's witnesses who come knocking at your door.The last half of the film is even worse. A magic rock saves the day. It's kept in a glowing red box in the Ireland church. Once the rock is used to help stop the monster, it uses the cheesiest 80's special effects imaginable. So if I'm a chick and I lift this rock over my head, I'll have a laser light show right in my own back yard? Righteous! The stone makes an appearance in the original story as well, but it's at least used in a way that comes off slightly less ridiculous than a rock that shoots lasers. The film just plays out in the worst of ways. A man tries to save a woman that Rawhead is about to slaughter, but winds up tearing her dress instead and we get our only nudity shot in the film. She bumps into a tree and dies. She's supposed to be thrown, but the impact is about as rough as accidentally bumping into somebody in public. Rawhead Rex is nothing like the source material. I was surprised they kept the vicar's baptism scene in there.Rawhead Rex is the type of film that gives horror a bad name; it's cliché, the monster is obviously a man in a rubber suit, it's predictable, and it's basically just meaningless gore. It's like the film tries to throw a little bit of the actual story in there near the end of the film, but it's too little too late. The damage has already been done. Rawhead Rex is pure cheese, but it's not even good cheese. It's like that hunk of cheese you've had in the fridge for a year and a half that's covered in three inch thick green mold. This film is out of print for a reason. Don't hunt it down unless you're a die hard Clive Barker or major horror fan. I implore you though to give the exceptional short story a read or to read it again if you have already.

I pretty much love the guy's work whether it's written or being put to film. I loved Midnight Meat Train more than most, I still think Hellraiser is one of the creepiest movies ever, and I always find myself getting lost in whatever Barker book I stumble upon. One of the first books I read by Barker was the Books of Blood Volumes 1-3. There were several stories that stood out, but one of the main ones that has always stuck with me over the years was Rawhead Rex. It's powerful, it's engrossing, and it's considered to be one of Barker's best short stories. So a film version of one of Barker's best should already have enough momentum to at least be decent at the end of the day. Unfortunately that isn't the case. Somehow Rawhead Rex became incredibly lame and plagued by 80's clichés somewhere in between its transition from novel to film.Did you ever used to watch Doug? The animated series on Nickelodeon with Porkchop, Quail Man, Roger Klotz, Patti Mayonnaise, and Skeeter? There was an episode called Nightmare on Jumbo Street where a horror movie hits the neighborhood where everyone in town sees it and is talking about it, but Doug closes his eyes and misses the ending. He stretches out seeing it again because he's scared, but when he finally gets around to seeing the ending he realizes you can see the zipper on the back of the monster's costume. That's kind of the way Rawhead Rex is except you basically see the metaphorical zipper as soon as Rawhead shows up. He looks terrible. It basically seems like a wrestler running around in a glorified ape costume. The mask looks like it's made of rubber except the facial features twitch occasionally, he's cross-eyed all the time, has two mouths in addition to one of those plastic sets of pecs and abs to make him look ripped, and his fingernails grow and shrink at will. Rawhead Rex basically looks like an ape raided Vernon Wells' leftover Road Warrior outfits and then decapitated and hollowed out the head of George, the King Kong-like character in the 1986 (made in the same year as the film) arcade game Rampage and wore that as a mask. Any of this sounding awesome yet? Oh, it's just getting started.I'm about to spoil the hell out of this movie mostly because it's out of print and practically impossible to find. Nearly all of Rawhead's kills end in some sort of obviously fake appendage or mannequin being used.

There're also background sound effects and the musical number near the end is given voice too. However Chaplin's little tramp central character and Paulette Goddard's the Gamin utter nary a word and indeed old- fashioned title cards are used to convey speech as well as scene-changes.There's little to criticise here other than an episodic feel to the narrative, like so many silent-sketches knitted together, bit when the quality of the sketches are so well-done, this can be forgiven. Even Chaplin's much-criticised over-sentimentality is reined in somewhat (and Goddard never does get reunited with her two younger siblings who are put under the care of the court) with an open-ended finishing fade of the two-against- the-world deciding to take the hard road back to fight for the conventional house-on-a- hill dream of most Americans, all the more so given the background of The Great Depression.Some of the scenes are sheer genius, including Charlie's depiction as a cog in the inner- workings of the industrial machinery, his guinea-pig forced participation in the automated feeding process experiment if a dotty inventor, his foiling of the prison jail-break, the hilarious protest-march, his French song and dance routine near the end and so much more. In fact the only comedic scene which missed its mark for me was the tummy- rumbling scene with the visiting senator's wife. I also liked the more adult humour he introduces to give the lie to his cuddly family image as his traumatised factory-worker looks to tweak the dress-buttons-as-nipples of a passing female's clothing.Chaplin's direction show him at home in combining old-time fixed-camera slap-stick with sight-gags using combinations of imaginative camera-shots. His body movements and facial expressions are wonderful throughout. Goddard is beautifully fresh-faced throughout and successfully acts older, which thankfully lessens the cute factor, if not quite belying the old criticism of his penchant of employing too young an actress as hi female lead.For me then, this movie shows Chaplin confronting the modernising of society (and Hollywood itself) with complete mastery and redoubtable courage, not to mention plenty of laughs too.

She even has to live in one country and work in another due to a scarcity of employment. Of course, her behavior is inevitably noticed and it garners her a harsh punishment. The same happens to an honest teacher who attempts to impart lessons about the failings of the capitalist way of life to high school children and (to a lesser degree) to the environmentalists who attempt to run an organic farm. The technical aspects of the film are fairly well handled, although some of director Alain Tanner's choices were puzzling. He frequently splices in real life footage and he also switches to brief monochrome shots at fairly arbitrary intervals. This seems to have been an attempt to add a Cinéma vérité feel to the venture, but whatever the reason for its implementation, it often falls flat. Still, there are some strangely affecting images here, particularly in the bicycle sequence that incorporates some of the film's only landscape shots to make the human built structures appear forlorn and dingy against the natural backdrop. Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 is captivating but uneven, thought provoking but not profound.

Session 9 is a film that goes beyond the physical and dives deep into the psychological. If you are a fan of horror films that do not offer the conventional gore and mayhem, but penetrate you to the very core by examining the horror hidden within the human psyche, then you'll watch this again and again.Gordon (played perfectly by Peter Mullan) and his asbestos clean up crew get the highest bid by compromising safety and sanity to finish the job the fastest. The job is a gigantic closed mental hospital that was known for its use of the lobotomy and other experiments in the 1940s. The hospital slowly manipulates each of the men by drawing them in from their deepest fears and curiosities. A cleverly written screenplay features T.V actor Stephan Gevedon as a failed law student who is led to find an old reel reel tape recorder and the recordings of 9 sessions of a doctor and his schizophrenic female patient. He becomes obsessed with the recordings as they unravel each of the patient's personalities. The ninth and final session reveals the final personality that calls itself Simon. Meanwhile, one of the crew begins murdering the others. Not to give away who Simon is, or who the killer or killers are, but the ending is a brilliant final piece to the puzzle. Everything about this film is uniquely disturbing. Hats off to Director, Brad Anderson for his terrific use of lighting, sound, and subtlety that just really gets under the skin and stays. The huge abandoned hospital in Massachusetts is so creepy just in itself, and the set design effectively creates mood and negative atmosphere. The uneven blend of sound effects induce such fear and tension. The blips in the tape recordings, distorted voices, chirps, drips, and creaks all contribute to a sense of discomfort and paranoia. This is psychological horror at is very finest! This is not just a disturbing look at a haunted hospital with a past, but a portrait of a part of the human unconscious that is capable of evil. its interesting to see the characters fall victim to their curiosities and inequities all confined within the walls of the asylum. The cast handles it well playing believable characters with common issues, and Mullan, (who's scene at the end talking on his broken cell phone to his dead wife still gives me the chills) is excellent. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys an intelligent, mind-bending, truly disturbing movie with an interesting look at human nature and evil. The DVD has a good making-of documentary where the actors discuss the film and incidents on the set.

Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau was just such a one. He loved camera movement, superimpositions, attention-grabbing shot compositions, stylised theatrical acting &#x96; the full works. Now, things like this will absolutely ruin a good drama, but if your subject matter is just as fantastical as your technique you can just about get away with something truly wonderful. Faust, the archetypal German fairytale, provides Murnau with the opportunity he requires to indulge his love of trickery and showmanship.Murnau was by now very good at this sort of thing. Eschewing any form of naturalism he stages Faust operatically, carefully controlling the rhythm and flow from shot to shot. The rhythmic touch is present and precise in every single moment, giving extra zip to even little things, such as the young Faust's eyes suddenly snapping open when his image is first glimpsed in a bowl of water. His images are often exaggerated and painterly, a particularly fine example being when the plague-ridden acrobat collapses dead over the edge of the stage. And in Faust's world of magic and mystery, the shimmering special effects and expressionistic shadows work, while the rather unconvincing puppetry has a theatrical charm to it that is totally in keeping with the spirit of the whole piece.Just as the direction is operatic, so too run the performances. Master of disguise Gösta Ekamn makes this a Faust of grand gestures and stylised movements that are almost musical. Jolly fat man Emil Jannings is especially good at this form of acting, hamming it up grandly but still keeping up the cheeky comedy persona for which he was best loved. You can see how much control Jannings has over his movements in his first appearance at the crossroads. He doffs his cap in an extremely smooth motion, in a manner that is very eerie but also rather comical in its unexpectedness. The exaggerated performing doesn't suit everyone however. Leading lady Camilla Horn alternates between twitching like a startled gazelle and plodding about like a zombie. Generally though the stylised acting works here because it is all a part of the twisted fairytale world in which the story takes place.As Faust shows, style over substance does have its place. And yet a picture like this, with very little to it apart from pretty pictures and neat effects, is under a lot of pressure to be consistently dazzling and engaging. Unfortunately, Faust does start to get a little tedious after the first hour. An extended comedy sequence between Jannings and French comedienne Yvette Guilbert is particularly disruptive to the overall flow, and only demonstrates that the picture's humour works better when it occurs in by-the-way fashion amid the action.

Since the first film was based on the sixth book in the Ian Fleming series, the filmmakers decided not to follow movies in same order and could choose any book they wanted to film. They chose the fifth book after President John F. Kennedy had said it was one of his favorite books. Terence Young returned to direct the movie and Sean Connery returned to reprise his role as James Bond. This is also the last Bond movie Ian Fleming got to see before his death. The British Secret Service receives a word from young Soviet clerk Tatiana Romanova, who is willing to help British to get a highly advanced decoding machine Lektor for themselves, if they send James Bond to meet her in Istanbul. The British suspects it's a trap set by the Russians but can't resist a chance to obtain Lektor. What they don't know is that it's not Russians who are pulling the strings but the international criminal organization SPECTRE who not only want Lektor for themselves but to kill James Bond as well.From Russia with Love is not only a vast improvement of already good Dr. No, it's also the best of Sean Connery's Bond films and, in my opinion, one of the very best Bond films ever. This has all a great Bond film needs great actors, memorable villains, beautiful girls, suspenseful plot and great action. The action is already considerably more imaginative here than in Dr. No while still not going as over the top as in many later films. The helicopter and boat chase are both still impressive, especially since you know no computer effects were used at the time.Connery is at his best shape and brings even more edginess to his character.

It induces a thirst in the soul, for justice or love, then quenches it by the end. We understand that if we go without water we will be doubly sated by a drink of it. In this mode of film we are mere vessels or instruments whereby a sin is conveyed, so we can live through the redemption that eludes us in life. This is the realm of emotion, and great cinema for me must envision beyond.All great films, the truly important ones, must enter the mind, where emotion is generated. Most of them do in one form or another. They need to be where our perception of reality is formed, not merely show us images that describe it but the mechanisms that control the images.The few truly gifted artists will then depart the mind, with wisdom and insight. One of these wisdoms is that, having understood structure, they can become the architects of thought so we can see in turn. Godard and Bergman never made it. Antonioni then is perhaps the greatest filmmaker to have lived because he moved his cinema outside both perception and non-perception, observed how these qualities (ego, feeling, desire) cease and change, and emerged mindfully from this attainment. He had, essentially, attained nirvana.Solyaris is Tarkovsky's turn as the cosmonaut who will enter for us what is beyond perception. Having left the worldly prison behind by tunnels spiraling out of it, he makes the film by which we will enter the place where the formations of life begin. Here we can begin to meditate, actually meditate.This is preceded by a marvellous scene where as an audience watching a film, we are watching an audience watching a film where another audience is watching one. Watching Tarkovsky, in fact. One of the characters deep in this film-within turns to ask, why did you film clouds?.Then we can be rocketed into the mind, where swirling formations that defy our understanding beckon at us with elusive, eloquent mystery, where the price exacted is precisely to be lost in them.Now we are where the objects of desire manifest, the images of memory. The device that permits the inner descent, a journey outside into space, is one of the most intelligent in film and I had to hold my breath a little as it happened. The duality of microcosm and macrocosm is thus shattered, shown to mean one thing. By comparison, Kubrick (a pupil of Antonioni, who was taught but learned little) was merely windowdressing in 2001.I read a lot of complaints that the film is lifeless, but it is valuable for me that it is. We cannot meditate when wracked by impulse and emotion. The filmmaker here abets our stillness of mind, our concentrated silence.The film's biggest handicap and perhaps genius, is that having entered this dimension where consciousness is infinite, with the capacity to have our yearning for a love that died be satisfied so that we may face the same inscrutable dilemmas all over again, which is the function of memory, Tarkovsky seems uncertain what these visions ought to mean. Whether or not this memory ought to be cherished and held on to, whether the real world should be abandoned so that we can live more meaningfully among these chimeras of the mind and are they really chimeras or not. And whether this love is in fact a suffering which ought to be abided, accepted as inherent in life.This is a terrifying insinuation, that we should be trapped there. Thankfully Tarkovsky emerges from it, but I wish he was a braver artist, willing to embrace the nothingness he encountered. As with Rublev hearing the voice of god in the ringing bell, the protagonist here is set free of another's accord. The choice mercifully made from him, he can be redeemed. Or can he? The shot that closes this is one of the most poignant resolutions I've encountered in my travels through cinema, where the son having offered his penitence to receive forgiveness and love, we zoom out to see where he really stands. How, one desire that trapped the soul vanished, it has been substituted by another, one for fatherly forgiveness.Meaning there are barriers to this awareness, but Tarkovsky recognizes them in part. We see in Solyaris how the past qualities that we understand as the self change, what in Buddhist thought is understood as the transience of inter-dependent creations. How these qualities, having been, come into play again. What we don't see is how these qualities, not having been, come into play. And how, having been, they vanish again.

Rooted in real-life happenings, the film vibrantly envisions and unearths the plotting behind the 1963 assassination of a Greek social democrat and pacifist. It made the reality of political murder cinematically existent, as no Hollywood film by that time would risk.Not even John Frankenheimer's classic The Manchurian Candidate was a box-office success. It took a Greek with a WWII Resistance-fighting father who was imprisoned upon being labeled a Communist, and as well as a mastery of cinematic technique (which was not allowed to study in the U.S. due to his father's Communist stigma), to modernize the political thriller in ways both profitable and imperative.Keeping the practice of the politically conversant films of Francesco Rosi, which concentrated topical policy into multifaceted, absorbing cinematic mythology, Costa-Gavras would continue to enhance the political thriller toward a fashionable form. His work paralleled Gillo Pontecorvo's, whose political renderings were also approachable as action adventures. This style was different from such solemn earlier film movements as Italian neorealism and Russian formalism in that it allowed socially alert, politically provoked artists to follow personal causes, dirtied with the exhilaration of the era's New Wave aesthetic.With this material, Costa-Gavras contributes to tackling the predicament of his native soil. Since WWII, internal strife between Communists, conservative leadership, military and royalty had kept Greece in chaos, which comprised Lambrakis's assassination and a martial takeover. In Z, Costa-Gavras reacts to the dictatorship, although from afar, with this French-speaking production that used but one Greek, Irene Papas as Lambrakis's wife, emblematically addressing the Lambrakis murder and ensuing overthrow, and supporting the reinstatement of democracy, which eventually occurred. The vital, exciting score by Mikis Theodorakis, who was under house arrest in Greece yet rebelliously allowed Costa-Gavras to use his music, characterizes the film's mutinous life-force. Costa-Gavras elucidated all that real-life crisis while effecting his talent with revitalized intent.This ingeniously edited Edgar-winning dramatic thriller is not a treatise specifying the dogmatic disparities that made Lambrakis a martyr of the conservatives grabbing control. Really, Costa-Gavras and screenwriter Jorge Semprún use Lambrakis's assassination to sound the bell on a dishonest and vicious commandeering of control. Their approach is genuine and heartfelt instead of party-line, attracting leftist agreement while providing a down-to-earth grasp of the ethics behind backbiting. The Dr. Strangelove-esque beginning finds the colonels suffering a fellow right-winger's comparison of liberalism to mildew, and establishes the staccato Costa-Gavras pattern. To stage how civil liberties are in unvarnished danger, Costa-Gavras and Semprún cunningly, without derision, esetablish the crime scene a Lambrakis-like spokesman, played by Montand, resists the obstructions that local authorities elicit to holding an undersized rally.This anxious night has noirish boundaries, with Montand's valiant assistant, shy bureaucrats, executive military officers, the rally planners, and a ragtag crew of rent-a-thugs with anti-Communist backing. When the rally is compelled into a less obliging hall, the chance for disaster increases. Anarchy explodes out of this pressure, and Costa-Gavras, with cinematographer Raoul Coutard, interpret the catastrophe with profundity and fluency. The precision is virtually dreamlike, seeming as inescapable as divination and as recognizable as history, immediately legendary. When later repeated in slow motion, the scene remembers the experience of recycling an unreal fact.Society's collapse is inherent in scenes of the assassins' heart-pounding getaway and the establishment's callous cover-ups. Z is a howdunit rather than a who. Its absorption derives from brusque battle with the unstable actions of political enemies. It has animal impact when a henchman (the unforgettable Frog Two from The French Connection) brawls with an organizer on the back of his truck. Proficient at the workings of the thriller, Costa-Gavras hones our social awareness with both political precision about the trauma of fascist subjugation, established through the scared military and the distrustful organizers, and journalistic frankness, characterized by the reporter who observes the assassination and records his own inquiry. Since Z is as thrilling as it is informative, the movie illustrates the influence of political activism beleaguered by pig-headed conservative coercion.By meeting that shocked era's bewilderment regarding political deception, Costa-Gavras creates a near-perfect parable for the dangers of political uprising. The assassination and investigation are told through curtly ordered mystery, tension, surprise, and jurisprudence.Jean-Louis Trintignant's probing magistrate, the fair-minded prosecutor, offers a stable, clear-headed ballast to Costa-Gavras's aggressive, histrionic action sequences the staccato mosaic of police rundowns that quickly produce scenes of military grillings where Trintignant declares an axiom shortly to become an image of ground-breaking, recuperative impartiality. It's an important feature of Costa-Gavras's technique to embed ideas in us of community honesty by concurrently notifying and amusing us.Concluding with a stimulating, unconventional reckoning of fascist tighten-ups on liberty of demonstration and fine arts, Costa-Gavras twists his depiction with a scary afterthought that summarizes the continuing political fight.

To stage how civil liberties are in unvarnished danger, Costa-Gavras and Semprún cunningly, without derision, esetablish the crime scene a Lambrakis-like spokesman, played by Montand, resists the obstructions that local authorities elicit to holding an undersized rally.This anxious night has noirish boundaries, with Montand's valiant assistant, shy bureaucrats, executive military officers, the rally planners, and a ragtag crew of rent-a-thugs with anti-Communist backing. When the rally is compelled into a less obliging hall, the chance for disaster increases. Anarchy explodes out of this pressure, and Costa-Gavras, with cinematographer Raoul Coutard, interpret the catastrophe with profundity and fluency. The precision is virtually dreamlike, seeming as inescapable as divination and as recognizable as history, immediately legendary. When later repeated in slow motion, the scene remembers the experience of recycling an unreal fact.Society's collapse is inherent in scenes of the assassins' heart-pounding getaway and the establishment's callous cover-ups. Z is a howdunit rather than a who. Its absorption derives from brusque battle with the unstable actions of political enemies. It has animal impact when a henchman (the unforgettable Frog Two from The French Connection) brawls with an organizer on the back of his truck. Proficient at the workings of the thriller, Costa-Gavras hones our social awareness with both political precision about the trauma of fascist subjugation, established through the scared military and the distrustful organizers, and journalistic frankness, characterized by the reporter who observes the assassination and records his own inquiry. Since Z is as thrilling as it is informative, the movie illustrates the influence of political activism beleaguered by pig-headed conservative coercion.By meeting that shocked era's bewilderment regarding political deception, Costa-Gavras creates a near-perfect parable for the dangers of political uprising. The assassination and investigation are told through curtly ordered mystery, tension, surprise, and jurisprudence.Jean-Louis Trintignant's probing magistrate, the fair-minded prosecutor, offers a stable, clear-headed ballast to Costa-Gavras's aggressive, histrionic action sequences the staccato mosaic of police rundowns that quickly produce scenes of military grillings where Trintignant declares an axiom shortly to become an image of ground-breaking, recuperative impartiality. It's an important feature of Costa-Gavras's technique to embed ideas in us of community honesty by concurrently notifying and amusing us.Concluding with a stimulating, unconventional reckoning of fascist tighten-ups on liberty of demonstration and fine arts, Costa-Gavras twists his depiction with a scary afterthought that summarizes the continuing political fight. He sidestepss hippie buoyancy and predicts modern skepticism with a simple thriller tool a caution. Z contains the aftershock of that cultural transferal from illumination to mistrust in all of its astutely conceived conventions from familiar genres. Costa-Gavras communicates the worry and alarm of political conspiracy that troubled the democratic and anti-war movements of the 60s, and continually does.

Love it love it love it.But I know that not everyone loves musicals. So if you find the musical genre contrived or unnatural or kitschy, if it's just not your thing, then don't bother with this movie because it is unabashedly and outstandingly a MUSICAL.The songs Food, Glorious Food, Consider Yourself, You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two, just for starters. These are wonderfully singable, indelibly memorable, and they move the plot and action along the way musical numbers in a film should. This is a lost art now, I'm convinced, although maybe with the TV series Glee! now riding a wave of popularity, there will be some talented musicians and lyricists who will revive this art-form. Anyway, suffice it to say Oliver! is the musical at its best.The actors Oh my lord. Here we have Ron Moody in the role of Fagin, and he is INDELIBLE. He doesn't just act the role, he doesn't just sing it and dance it, he slips into the character's skin and he IS Fagin, in a way that makes it impossible to imagine anyone else in this role.Jack Wild as the Artful Dodger. He's just superb, audacious and sassy and swaggering, and you can't help but like him even as you see him cheerfully taking up a life of crime. He makes us accept the character as someone basically good-hearted who is just adapting to the life he has to live. Matter-of-factly and without malice, and leaping to grab joy when the opportunity presents itself.Shani Wallis as Nancy tender and tough, tough and tender, she has the virtues of loyalty and honesty even as those values become hindrances to survival. She is who she is and she doesn't apologize for it, she's key to saving young Oliver.Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. I love Oliver Reed, always have, and he dominates every scene he has in this movie. You look at him and you see what the Artful Dodger would turn into if he had malice in his soul. Sikes is dangerous; he has no code but survival for himself, and he'll throw anyone else to the wolves without pausing to think about it if it serves him to do so. Oliver Reed really makes the movie work, because he brings genuine menance and sexuality to his role, which serves as a counterpoint for the sweetness of the musical as a whole.And finally, Mark Lester. He is beyond winsome as the title character, a completely believable innocent who is without guile and imbued with a natural sense of goodness. I just love looking at Mark Lester, he's such a beautiful and dreamy-looking child.This movie is about as good as a musical gets it's visually stunning, in the sets and the cinematography and the costumes, and in the staging of the musical numbers. The characters are wonderful, they're classics. The plot is pared down to the basics and conveys the material as Dickens wrote it without being slavish or getting bogged down in detail.When I saw this movie for the first time, I laughed and I cried and I sat at the edge of my seat, and when it was over I wanted more. Since the first time I saw it, I've seen it more than a dozen times more, and it's a movie I can watch again and again and again.As a musical, it's tops. But not everyone likes musicals. Maybe because not every musical is as good as Oliver! on every level.Maybe, just maybe, we'll see a renaissance of the genre soon, and more people who don't like musicals because they've only seen bad ones will understand that when a musical is good, it's really, really good.
