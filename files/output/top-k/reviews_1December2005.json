He got an Oscar for it. He was globally recognised as being a dead ringer for the most peaceful man on earth.Ben Kingsley also played a man called Don Logan, who is not a peaceful man. Don Logan is the only fictional creation I have ever feared might lean out of the screen and kill me in an unnecessarily painful way. I am actually afraid of him. I watched this film in a constant state of fear. Not fear for the other characters in the film - fear for ME PERSONALLY.There's no way I can describe Don Logan to you in a way that will accurately convey his psychosis and terrible screen presence. And when I say 'terrible', I use it in its truest sense - that which inspires terror.Don Logan argues with himself. He pees on the floor of other people's houses. He is foul-mouthed but mostly soft-spoken. He says funny things but has no discernible sense of humour. He is shorter and smaller in frame than Gal (Ray Winstone), but utterly dominates him without question for the entirety of their scenes together. He swings from quietly jovial to a raving monster, always a second away from extreme violence, crackling with maniacal energy. He's a terrifying man, and perhaps his most frightening trait is his persistence. NOTHING can turn him away from his objective. Jesus, I watched this last night and I'm still shaking. It's half past three in the afternoon and I'm still shaking.Of course, Kingsley as Logan isn't the only thing in Sexy Beast, and not the only good thing either. In fact, everybody in this film turns in a great performance. Ray Winstone toning down his massive screen presence is quite an achievement. He's far from the two-snooker-balls-in-a-sock Daddy he was in Scum. Here he's still a cockney geezer, but he's retired from crime and lives only for two things his beautiful ex-porn star wife Dee Dee (the gorgeous Amanda Redman), and lying in the Spanish sunshine, roasting.The plot of the film, not that it's really that important in a film with characters like these, is the hoary old 'one last job' scenario. But, as we all know, everything's been done before. It's how you use the material differently that matters. Ostensibly, this is a heist movie. But the actual heist is only on screen for about five minutes. The rest of the film is Gal being menaced by either Don Logan or Teddy Bass.Ah... Teddy Bass. Now, Teddy Bass is played by Ian McShane. Now, for readers outside the UK, Ian's major acting role before Sexy Beast was 'Lovejoy', a TV series about a cheerful, scheming antiques dealer with quite a hardcore mullet and a nice line in witty asides to the camera. The most menacing he got in that was a half-hearted frown and a 'never mind, tomorrow's another day' shrug.In Sexy Beast, McShane plays Satan.Teddy Bass is not as immediately frightening as Don Logan. He works his magic slowly, turning up the frighteners gently so that you don't realise you've been terrified of him until you look down and become aware you've peed in your pants. He is like a refined version of Logan - dapper, urbane, quiet, and infinitely more dangerous. After all, Logan works for this man, not the other way round.If Teddy Bass told me to pull my own head off I would, because the result of disobeying him would be far, far worse. Need proof? Watch the end where he asks Gal for £10 change from his twenty. A simple thing like that becomes a matter of mortal danger. Incredible.But still, the most kudos has to go to Logan for his inventive excuse for being thrown off a plane for smoking. I challenge you not to crack up in nervous laughter when he describes the male flight attendant's attempts to 'touch me on my front bottom'. Or when he uses the sentence 'I had to sit down, I was so perturbed'.Overall, this film is good, but no classic. Kinglsey's performance, and to a very slightly lesser degree, McShane's, ARE classic, however. Kinglsey was nominated for an Oscar for this and only the fact that 'Iris' was about somebody dying of a lingering disease (and was therefore extremely Oscar-friendly) meant that he missed out. McShane deserves recognition too, but then, I don't suppose there'd be any Al Swearengen from 'Deadwood' without Teddy Bass, so I suppose you get what you deserve in the end. And Don Logan will be a performance talked about for years to come. If genuine audience appreciation means anything to Ben Kingsley, he'll be perfectly happy for a good while.Good stuff.

It had an attention-grabbing cover shot of the leather-clad, cycle-helmet-wearing lead character brandishing a flame-thrower, and it looked a lot more tempting than the battered old copy of STRAW DOGS which sat next to it on the shelf. But don't be fooled by the legend or the myths, this film is truly rank. After an attention-grabbing opening sequence set in the swampy hell-pits of Vietnam complete with be-headings (none too realistic, but be-headings all the same), explosions, dramatic helicopter rescue stunts, none-more-evil villains and gunfights, THE EXTERMINATOR shifts gear into...what? It's not exactly clear at first. There's a soft, folkish, John Denver-style song on the soundtrack, which momentarily made me think that David Hess (LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT) was somehow involved, and aerial shots of New York City by night. It's like DEATH WISH, only cheap-looking. Then the 'plot' kicks in. Our hero (Robert Ginty, a terrible actor who always looks dyspeptic) and his war buddy have got steady jobs loading and unloading grocery deliveries from trucks, and the boss is being leant on by some underworld goons. But that's the least of his worries - we're barely out of the title sequence and the drug-addled gangland thugs are on the loose already, picking a fight with Ginty and his family-man friend who is held down and paralysed a couple of scenes later for having the nerve to fight back. By now, you've probably gathered that this is strong stuff, and it just gets nastier. And more ridiculous.When the paralysed victim is lying comatose in a hospital bed, who informs his wife? The police? The doctors? No - Ginty himself. And the exposition scene is horribly flubbed - why did the director insert stock footage of inner-city slums halfway through Ginty's stone-faced explanation of his friend's fate? It adds NOTHING to the scene. My guess is that there was some trouble with the film stock (or another rogue microphone dropped into shot - this happens a few times) and a substitute shot had to be found in a hurry, so a quick raid on the archives was necessary. Now it's time for Ginty to bring down the street scum. Yes, it's DEATH WISH meets TAXI DRIVER, on the budget of an 8mm porno loop. But what this film lacks in originality (or indeed subtlety) it makes up for in terms of sheer nastiness. So we get graphic scenes of women having their breasts scarred with hot irons, fat blubberheaps raping tethered teenage boys, thugs being eaten alive by rats, Mafia hoods being ground up in industrial mincers...on and on it goes. It's like watching an open sewer disgorging human waste for the best part of two hours. To add insult to injury, it's technically poor, there are NO good performances, the direction is sluggish and if you make it to the finale, there's another horrible folkish song to sit through...which has squat to do with the repugnant dreck that preceded it. Cut or uncut, THE EXTERMINATOR is like being trapped without respite in the brain of a very sick individual, and you'll feel like a long shower to wash off the filth when it's done.

Miffed that I had allowed the opinions of others to steer me away from it until it came out on DVD. What a lovely bitter sweet\/sweetly bitter film. After seeing The Story Of Us and talking to others about it, I came to the pejorative conclusion that the folk I spoke to just didn't get the film because they simply had not been there. I realized that no one I talked to at first had shared his or her lives with anyone for any more than a few years. This film deals with the daily wear and tear of ANY truly long-term relationship. It is an accurate, albeit theatrical, portrayal of the way high ups and devastating downs that can come to two people who love each other &#133; hate each other &#133; need each other &#133; want each other desperately &#133; hate each other some more and finally love each other again.

Though I've never read the actual shooting script to Husbands and Wives, I can see what he means. I've seen the film several times, if not all the way through then usually when it is on TV, and it always strikes my attention the frankness of it all, how it follows almost no rules. It shares a kinship with another Woody masterpiece, Deconstructing Harry, also about a neurotic writer and the relationship problems around him. Here he focuses not only on himself, but also on another married couple, played by Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis (the later of which one of Woody's best in his quasi stock company), and what he calls the discombobulated characters. It is funny here and there, but in reality this is a great film of dramatic sincerity and occasional intensity.Woody himself is in his final collaboration with his ex-wife Mia Farrow, who themselves in the film play a married couple working through some issues. There is also the sensitive, passionate man between the two couples played by Liam Neeson, who acts as a good mediator between the two intertwining story lines. And Juliette Lewis is surprisingly good as a young would-be author who befriends the author\/professor Woody plays in the film. What works to make all of these relationships, with warts and all, is that the dialog is always totally, without a doubt, believable. One can see people like this around the New York city upper-middle class landscape, with the neuroses as intriguing as they are frank and even a little disturbing.While the film shares a kinship with some of the dark, brooding themes of Interiors, and quintessentially European (in a good way) attitude towards editing and composition to Deconstructing Harry, it also has (also 'Harry's' DP) the eye of Carlo Di Palma. Di Palma, who also worked with Antonioni on Red Desert and Blowup, works with great ease with the aesthetics of the scenes. This time the camera-work is practically all hand-held, lit with nearly (seemingly) no artificial lights, and with a kind of intensity that is sometimes lacking in other Woody films. In wrong, amateur hands this style could falter, but with the material given, the constant interest and conviction in the performances, and Allen directing, it works. Having Di Palma as a cinematographer is as good a bet as having (a mentally-all-together) Marlon Brando as your star, and because of the documentary realism involved it always remains interesting. I could watch this movie, at least most scenes, just as easily as I could with films like Manhattan or 'Harry', because it is one of those special times in the filmmaker's career where everything comes together, however how raw it may be.

Then, about half way through, everyone became so earnest and noble and pretty much any hope of this film expressing any genuine emotion disintegrated (It became the visual equivalent of listening to a Bono speech). These are also the qualities which I've always found the least attractive in real music. It became an obvious ego-trip for certain parties (JImmy Nail?, you bet) and the fabulous talents of Stephen Rea and Bill Nighy were all but wasted. The comedy became pretty thin too, the writers (who have been brilliant in the past) just refused to stretch themselves, resorting to every cliché in the book... Worst of all tho'?

Lost Highway is an inspired piece of complicated story telling and weird characters. What the film lacks in sense, it makes up for with depth, visual gratification and style. Lynch bases his films on imagery and Lost Highway is very powerful on this front, with full intent to shock and excite the audience. Even for those who are not fans of this genre, Lost Highway is definitely an experience.As well as having one of the most talented and creative film makers there is, Lost Highway also boasts a very strong cast. Bill Pullman gives a great, almost sedated, performance, parading a great range of jealousy, rage, desperation and love. This is the Bill Pullman we want not President alien killer! Balthazar Getty is a little out of his depth in this film but comes across very well as a passionate, confused character. Patricia Arquette gives the best performance in the film; playing two characters. She is sexual yet lovable, vulnerable but domineering and caring yet selfish. Her role is so challenging and intense but Arquette raises the material with her performance. This is the role that put Arquette in the leading lady category and she's never looked back since. The rest of the cast is a mix of the weird and wonderful, ensuring Lost Highway is packed full of imagination.This film is the pinnacle of David Lynch's career and it is amazing that after Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart that Lynch has managed to keep being so creative. No one can match Lynch on imagination and visual flair, not even Terry Gilliam or David Cronenberg, and it is these elements that give Lost Highway that something special. Lost Highway does suffer from being a little over confusing and it is questionable whether it is possible to understand this film at all but it really doesn't matter. The plot manipulation is second to none and ensures the audience is never comfortable, exactly how Lynch planned it. Lynch is notorious for making dark films and they don't come much darker than this. Lost Highway is definitely not for the faint hearted and goes to great efforts to explore voyeurism, jealousy, power and the grotesque.One of the truly great films, Lost Highway is an explosion on the eyes and brain that is so powerful, that it overcomes confusion. There is a strong theme about the walls of reality closing in, and I like that very much. By far, David Lynch's best film, one of the films of the 90s.

This dark, twisted, self-indulgent, musical version of Fellini's 8 1\/2 seems to be Fosse's exploration of his own personal demons as he lays his life out there for all to see in a not too flattering light as a career-driven, hard drinking, smoking, womanizing director\/choreographer who is alive when he's on a Broadway stage creating dances or behind a camera lens but is clueless on how to deal with regular life and the little imperfections that most regular folks are able to cope with and accept. Roy Scheider delivers a brilliant performance as the Fosse alter-ego Joe Gideon, who is trying to stage a new Broadway musical and put the finishing touches on a movie he directed and the stress of all this work puts him in the hospital after a heart attack. This story was based on the period in Fosse's career when he was beginning to mount the musical CHICAGO for Gwen Verdon and was still editing his 1974 film LENNY with Dustin Hoffman and had a heart attack shortly afterwards. This film sucks you in from the beginning with shots of dancers warming up onstage as the opening bars of George Benson's On Broadway begin to fill the audio. Soon the camera pulls back to reveal hundreds of dancers onstage as Gideon weeds out the dancers he wants to cast in NY to LA, the fictionalized version of CHICAGO. This number is just brilliant and is a wonderful introduction into the world of NY theater auditions for the uninitiated. Fosse, is, more than anything, a choreographer, and his dance direction in this film is nothing short of astonishing. I can watch the Take Off With Us\/Air-Rotica scene over and over again and never tire of it. I also enjoyed when Ann Reinking (as Joe's girlfriend, basically playing herself) and Erzsebet Foldi (playing Joe's daughter, Michelle (Nicole))do a dance for Joe to Peter Allen's Everything Old is New Again in his living room. Joe's fantasy production numbers after he enters the hospital are also dazzling, especially long-legged Reinking's rendition of You Better Change your Ways. There are also small quiet moments in the film that are equally effective, in particular a lovely scene in a dance studio with Joe and his daughter where she tries to talk him into getting married and giving her a little brother. This is not a side of Gideon we see much of (Fosse either) and it is a lovely moment. Jessica Lange's ethereal quality was used to great advantage in her small but showy role as Joe's Angel of Death. Leland Palmer (who starred in Fosse's PIPPIN on Broadway) registers as Audrey Paris, Joe's ex-wife and Michelle's mother, a fictionalized Gwen Verdon. Her scene with Scheider in the dance studio where she calls him on his constant infidelity is a gem. Cliff Gorman scores as Davis Newman, the star of Joe's film, THE STAND UP (this film's version of LENNY), who is seen visiting Gideon in the hospital and psychoanalyzing him at the same time. The Bye Bye Love finale is a little over the top and WAY too long but I like the end of it when he says goodbye to everyone before his death (especially loved the looks exchanged with John Lithgow and his hug with daughter Michelle). All in all, ALL THAT JAZZ is a must for Fosse-ites and fans of musical theater..whether it's stage or screen. Not as good as CABARET, but still a unique movie experience to be savored.

The main symptom is that the sufferer becomes ever more radiantly beautiful the closer she approaches death.The script of Love Story is, of course, a mass of traditional Hollywood clichés, but director Arthur Hiller was determined to give those clichés a modern gloss. The boy is Oliver Barrett IV, the rebellious son and heir of a wealthy Boston family so grand and patrician that they have taken to adding Roman numerals after their names as though they were royalty. The girl is Jenny Cavalleri, the daughter of an impoverished Italian-American pastry cook, who meets Oliver while they are both studying at university (he law at Harvard, she music at Radcliffe). The film is at pains to point out just how Modern and Nineteen-Seventies its two main characters are. They do things not normally done by the heroes and heroines of earlier Hollywood romances. They sleep together before their wedding; indeed, it is implied that Oliver has slept with plenty of other girls before meeting Jenny. They refuse to have a church wedding, disappointing Jenny's devoutly Catholic father, on the grounds that they do not believe in God (although Jenny is later seen acting as the local church choir mistress).What seems to have shocked seventies audiences most, however, was the fact that they use bad language. Profanity might have been OK in a crime thriller or war film, but the public obviously had difficulty in accepting it in the context of a romantic weepie. Jenny in particular has a weakness for referring to the excrement of male cattle. Oliver does not swear quite so often, but is fond of speculating that his father, whom he detests, may in fact be the offspring of a female dog.Although the two protagonists are clearly supposed to be appealing, I found them both rather unsympathetic. During the first half-hour or so Jenny is quite deliberately smart and cocky, playing games of verbal volleyball with Oliver. Everything he says is immediately met with a sarcastic put-down. The idea is to show that Jenny is using a cynical, flippant exterior to hide a sensitive, caring nature, but even later in the film, after the two have fallen in love, elements of her former persona kept coming through. Ali MacGraw never really made me believe in Jenny's sensitive side; I was left with the impression that she was using a cynical, flippant exterior to hide a cynical, flippant interior.The more unpleasant side of Oliver's character came out in his dealings with his father. Certainly, Oliver Barrett III is not an easy man to love. He is cold, authoritarian and snobbish, the sort of father who insists that his son call him sir. (That is not, perhaps, as absurd in an American context as it would be in a British one, but even so it does not suggest a relaxed or easy-going character). He reacts angrily to his son's marriage to Jenny, cutting off his allowance, but does at least later make efforts to heal the rift, all of which are rebuffed by Oliver.This difficult father-son relationship, in fact, tends to detract from the love story which the title suggests should be at the centre of the film. This was probably not the intention of the film-makers, but it did strike me that Oliver did not love Jenny as much as she loved him. Ryan O'Neal's rather angry performance did little to dispel the suggestion made by Oliver's father that his marriage to a girl from a poor, Catholic family had as much to do with a deliberate act of rebellion against his own privileged, Protestant background as it did with love. The sacrifice Oliver makes on Jenny's behalf never struck me as being too onerous. He might have lost his allowance from his father, but this did not mean he was reduced to poverty. Unless, of course, one's definition of poverty includes living off one's wife's income for a couple of years in a charming apartment in a historic district of Boston before taking up a position with a prestigious New York law firm.Thirty-five years on it is difficult to understand why this was such a cult movie when it first came out. Apart from the charms of its pretty heroine and even prettier hero, it has two things going for it. The first is the fine photography of Harvard University and New York; many of the scenes were shot in winter against a background of snow and misty grey skies, presumably in order to create an atmosphere of gently melancholy. The second is Francis Lai's famous musical score, reminiscent of a Mozart piano concerto, which well deserved its Best Music, Original Score Academy Award. All those other Oscar nominations, however, seem incomprehensible today. Thank goodness it didn't actually win any further awards. The Academy are often suckers for sentimentality (as they showed in 1984 with another manipulative tearjerker, Terms of Endearment, and with Million Dollar Baby this year), but a Best Picture award for Love Story would have been difficult to live down. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 December 2005","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Boy meets girl, boy marries girl, girl dies of MacGraw's Syndrome, a condition which frequently afflicts young female characters in films.

I enjoyed playing the games but was never that into them. Suffice to say I found the first Mortal Kombat, to be fairly entertaining. Mild stuff really, verging on almost could be cool if... A real four stars out of ten fiasco, but one that wouldn't offend.MKA however became a pastime for us at University, when we were in that frame of mind, to throw it on and laugh ourselves silly with the absolute shambles that is this film. It is tragic. Enough said. This film has nothing going for it. Everything has taken a step backwards.The special effects are woeful. Instead of three characters with mild in-depth studies, they jetisoned that for seven main characters, each with their own personal demons to overcome. Riveting. The script is what I have the most problem with. Pour example1) A new Raiden. Lambert, gave the role some credibility in the original and was responsible for giving MK a moderate turn over. Inevitably he wasn't going to do a second. So inevitably they had to bring in someone else. The audience knows this. The actors know this. The writers know this. But please don't have the character you created know this. He's supposed to be the same person, so to have him say i've had a haircut rar rar is a tragic way of saying i know i'm not lambert so I did something different. 2) Robin Shao...Oh Robin. Many nights have been wiled away laughing at his demise from ewokian heights. A tragic actor, only in for his mild kung-fu knowledge, on the premise he could act. Carried in the first film by Lambert and the chap who played Shang Tsung (don't remember his name but he was in Rising Sun). In this one, he's supposed to hold it all together...and fails miserably. To be fair, again however he has no script with which to work. At one moment, before the final confrontation, it is claimed Lui Kang is the only one left who can defeat Shao Khan. So your characters mantra is i want to do it, but i'm not ready, and you layer over that with dialogue, meanings, symbolism, action etc etc...you don't have your character say those words!!! Talk about a mickey mouse operation.

A real four stars out of ten fiasco, but one that wouldn't offend.MKA however became a pastime for us at University, when we were in that frame of mind, to throw it on and laugh ourselves silly with the absolute shambles that is this film. It is tragic. Enough said. This film has nothing going for it. Everything has taken a step backwards.The special effects are woeful. Instead of three characters with mild in-depth studies, they jetisoned that for seven main characters, each with their own personal demons to overcome. Riveting. The script is what I have the most problem with. Pour example1) A new Raiden. Lambert, gave the role some credibility in the original and was responsible for giving MK a moderate turn over. Inevitably he wasn't going to do a second. So inevitably they had to bring in someone else. The audience knows this. The actors know this. The writers know this. But please don't have the character you created know this. He's supposed to be the same person, so to have him say i've had a haircut rar rar is a tragic way of saying i know i'm not lambert so I did something different. 2) Robin Shao...Oh Robin. Many nights have been wiled away laughing at his demise from ewokian heights. A tragic actor, only in for his mild kung-fu knowledge, on the premise he could act. Carried in the first film by Lambert and the chap who played Shang Tsung (don't remember his name but he was in Rising Sun). In this one, he's supposed to hold it all together...and fails miserably. To be fair, again however he has no script with which to work. At one moment, before the final confrontation, it is claimed Lui Kang is the only one left who can defeat Shao Khan. So your characters mantra is i want to do it, but i'm not ready, and you layer over that with dialogue, meanings, symbolism, action etc etc...you don't have your character say those words!!! Talk about a mickey mouse operation.

I suppose I'd be in the middle to lower end of the love it category, as this wasn't really aiming to entertain a woman in her late 30's.I suppose one of my bigger beefs with this movie is that I'm not sure who gave the young African American man(Eric) the go-ahead to play his character as an oversexed, hip hop homeboy. He's like one of a handful of minorities in a small predominantly white town...not saying he needs to act like Carlton Banks from the Fresh Prince show, but as an African American woman who grew up in a similarly small town, it was kind of embarrassing to see him acting out that way.I'm not trying to make this a big racial statement; actually, it's more to the contrary. Not all of us who grew up in those circumstances turned out to be one extreme or the other-we just found somewhere that was comfortable in the middle. I mean, come on...the kid's name was ERIC for crying out loud! Was he over compensating for not having a more ethnically oriented name? The only time that I witnessed Eric as more as an honestly portrayed teen and less as an ethnic caricature was toward the end when he and Landon were having heart to heart chat by that lake in back of Landon's house.Granted, guys his age are little more than totally raging hormones walking upright in society, but he seemed to be embarrassingly over the top compared to the other guys. It made me cringe.And as for the play-within-the-movie...shouldn't the dialogue even remotely have made sense? There were times that it did, but then you were just like, What is Landon talking about? And what was up with the cloak on the mysterious female singer Jamie was portraying...was that cloak supposed to add that element of mystery? It just felt like the movie was trying too hard to accomplish something and ended up basically killing time to set up for the beautiful song that Jamie sings.Again, remember these are comments made by a woman who is nearly old enough to be the mother of the target of this movie's audience, so my comments should be taken with a grain of salt.
