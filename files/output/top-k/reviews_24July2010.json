Seeing such a top notch actor in a film like this was a little surprising really. Maybe he liked the script when he read it. I do know..after reading about the film...that a lot was left out...some of the more gruesome details being one. It was suppose to be a dark movie...but became a campy one instead. If the film was made today..in 2010...Merricks' character would be considered very creepy...even perverted..since he was almost stalking Buffy by following her around. I did think it was odd that even though so many people in the film were disappearing without a clue...yet no one seemed too concerned..even the adults that were briefly shown here and there. Like most teen films..the ones here don't have a clue about anything the kids are doing. The principal of the school was a hoot...thinking he was in touch with the kids..when he was anything but cool.

Seeing Pee Wee Herman in this was funny too...it was difficult to think of him as a vicious killer who drank blood..without something goofy coming out of his mouth. The best part of the movie...to me...is the dance at the end.

Finally, Mom rushes to Regans side and explains, She's been sick. Then she slams Regans face down into the puddle of urine and begins to beat the back of her head.That was pretty funny because until that point you didn't know which direction the movie was headed in. But the introductory section ends in showers of vomit involving the two priests and Regan. Except for its residual shock value, it's about as funny as a pie fight.The rest of the movie, after the credits, is mainly a take off of The Haunting, a fine film in its original form, directed by Robert Wise, and no more than a special effects extravaganza in the remake. Let's see. There is a lascivious poltergeist who is evidently a male and who chases a young girl across the ceiling after forcing her to have oral sex with an invisible penis. Which teen-age horror movie is that from? The ones with Freddy Kruger?

I was hoping to come out of this with a deeper understanding and appreciation of Tibetan Buddhist spirituality. Unfortunately, aside from learning that Tibetan Buddhists respect all life and won't harm it (down to and including the lives of worms) I really didn't find much reflection of Tibetan Buddhist spirituality here. There were a lot of Tibetan customs portrayed, but I personally found little depth and no real explanation or exploration. (And, even the Tibetan Buddhist commitment to reverence for life and non-violence is obviously conditional, since the Tibetans apparently had no qualms about forming an army in a desperate attempt to beat back the Chinese.) One gets a picture here of the deep reverence in which the Dalai Lama is held by Tibetans, and of the somewhat xenophobic attitude of the Tibetans, but I found little more.The movie revolves around the experiences of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who, on the eve of World War II, sets out to conquer one of the highest mountains in the Himalayas to plant the Nazi Swastika flag on its summit. Harrer was a difficult to define character. He certainly didn't come across as a devout Nazi (he insisted on calling himself an Austrian rather than a German) and he seemed to have little interest in the swastika flag that was presented to him to plant. While there might be some admiration for him on that basis, he's also an unsympathetic character as the movie starts, leaving his wife and yet unborn son in the midst of a difficult relationship. Failing to conquer the mountain, his team descends to India just as the war breaks out and he's arrested by the British as an enemy alien and sent to a POW camp, from which he escapes and makes his way to Tibet - his time and experiences there being the primary focus of the movie. Harrer clearly finds himself (if I can use that term) and becomes attached to the country, the people and the Dalai Lama in the process. As the movie ends, this takes on an overtly anti-Chinese (or, at least, an anti-People's Republic of China) feel, as the Chinese brutally invade and conquer Tibet - an occupation lasting to this day.)Brad Pitt was good in the role. I have no complaint with his performance. In fact, all the performances were good, especially that of the young actor who played the 14 year old Dalai Lama. There's some spectacular scenery (which, unfortunately, is not actually of Tibet, the mountain scenes being shot as I understand it in Argentina and Canada.)

Unfortunately, aside from learning that Tibetan Buddhists respect all life and won't harm it (down to and including the lives of worms) I really didn't find much reflection of Tibetan Buddhist spirituality here. There were a lot of Tibetan customs portrayed, but I personally found little depth and no real explanation or exploration. (And, even the Tibetan Buddhist commitment to reverence for life and non-violence is obviously conditional, since the Tibetans apparently had no qualms about forming an army in a desperate attempt to beat back the Chinese.) One gets a picture here of the deep reverence in which the Dalai Lama is held by Tibetans, and of the somewhat xenophobic attitude of the Tibetans, but I found little more.The movie revolves around the experiences of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who, on the eve of World War II, sets out to conquer one of the highest mountains in the Himalayas to plant the Nazi Swastika flag on its summit. Harrer was a difficult to define character. He certainly didn't come across as a devout Nazi (he insisted on calling himself an Austrian rather than a German) and he seemed to have little interest in the swastika flag that was presented to him to plant. While there might be some admiration for him on that basis, he's also an unsympathetic character as the movie starts, leaving his wife and yet unborn son in the midst of a difficult relationship. Failing to conquer the mountain, his team descends to India just as the war breaks out and he's arrested by the British as an enemy alien and sent to a POW camp, from which he escapes and makes his way to Tibet - his time and experiences there being the primary focus of the movie. Harrer clearly finds himself (if I can use that term) and becomes attached to the country, the people and the Dalai Lama in the process. As the movie ends, this takes on an overtly anti-Chinese (or, at least, an anti-People's Republic of China) feel, as the Chinese brutally invade and conquer Tibet - an occupation lasting to this day.)Brad Pitt was good in the role. I have no complaint with his performance. In fact, all the performances were good, especially that of the young actor who played the 14 year old Dalai Lama. There's some spectacular scenery (which, unfortunately, is not actually of Tibet, the mountain scenes being shot as I understand it in Argentina and Canada.) I simply would have liked a more fulfilling look at Tibetan Buddhist spirituality, and so came away somewhat disappointed with this.

Let's compare, shall we?Both take place in an insane asylum. Both have a blank stare blonde. Both have a doctor who doesn't believe up front, but starts to both side and help the main star. Both have a heroine that strangely looks like Heather Langenkamp. Both also have a character named Kirsty (yeah, I realize she was named that originally, but it's still too close.) Both involve a labyrinth of one's darkest fears. Both have a wise-cracking villain, including a new baddie who has clay-mation snakes, with blades, no less, coming out of his hands. Both have bad lightening affects. Heck, both have mute inmates with powers integral to the plot.Wow, I didn't know it was that many. Probably more, but suffice to say, Pinhead's first sequel, the only one in the long-running series that's a really a direct continuation, Hellbound Hellraiser II isn't as bad as I've portrayed it, but it's not up to #1's standards. They didn't even improve on the computer-generated flashes of light that causes more laughter than fear.Taking place seconds, then hours after the first one, Kirsty (Laurence) is magically in the aforementioned asylum being questioned for the deaths, including her father, in her late uncle's home. Quickly, the good doctor, Channard (Cranham) intervenes as he's a Brain Doc who knows how crazies work. It's obviously, up front, he's got ulterior motives for Kirsty, her next room over neighbor, the puzzle-solving mute, Tiffany (Boorman) and the objects in Kirsty's outlandish story of the Attack of the Cenobites.For plot's sake and the audience who may have not seen the original, Kirsty suddenly knows more than her character could possibly about the magical doorway opening box that calls upon the Cenobites and their motives&#x85;and what all happened at the house she just escaped when her family was wiped out in the first movie. Oh, and conveniently, not only is her love interest out of the picture, but she doesn't give him a second thought.So, let's see, she gets a message from her father, who's now in hell and it's not too difficult to tell that may not, in fact, be from her real father.

Her transformation from the red mattress that's only fit for a Motel 6, into real flesh and blood kind of fast forward's the process that seemed to take a lot longer in #1.After the obvious parallel with The Bride of Frankenstein, or is that Bride of Re-Animator?, he willingly enters Hell's Maze to, I guess, learn more than his education allowed.There's a lot more, and I've only skimmed the surface.

There's one big twist as to who the undercover cop is but I didn't find it much of a surprise to be honest.

Why did Joe go to the warehouse if he thought Mr. Orange was a cop?Almost entirely dialogue driven with very little on screen action or violence I will give Tarantino credit for making a film where not much happens yet still manages to hook the audience & have an impact. The notorious ear slicing scene is very tame in reality, literally nothing of the cutting is seen & while there's some bloody gunshot wounds not much else. There are no female speaking parts in Reservoir Dogs at all which is unusual for a film. Mr. Blue is never seen beyond the opening sequence & his fate was meant to have been filmed but the budget didn't stretch that far & it was never shot in the end.With a low budget of about $1,500,000 it's said most of the actor's wore their own clothes, well shot with some nice cinematography the production values are good. Tarantino wanted James Woods to play a role, Christopher Walken turned down the part of Mr. Blonde while David Duchovny, George Clooney & Samuel L. Jackson apparently auditioned for roles.

Not by today's standards, 23 years later, but I'm sure it was near the top of the list from 1987 backwards. One positive about the gore they didn't just rely on that, as most slashers\/torture porn does since. This had one, uh, hell of a story here.That said, it wasn't perfect; there were a lot of plot holes including a quick wrap up in the last third that made Kirsty the thrown in heroine who could unconvincingly solve the puzzle in a few heartbeats and bargain these big baddies, lead by Pinhead. This is when all others, who actually know about them, actually call upon them, can't outmaneuver a flying hook. Also, they did a good job of introducing the Cenobites, but spent so little on them, it begged for a sequel, or more, to explore their storyline.Furthermore, it almost seemed like the creator, Barker, was anti-Christ as there were plenty to mock Jesus, even going as far as reference him in a quote from the Bible at the most inopportune time. But, in their defense, I think they did a good job of showing true evil, whether be it from the walking sadomasochistic demons or worse, man. It's hard to watch, but so was The Passion of the Christ. Both films show the true evil of men; they didn't sugar-coat\/Sunday School what lies beneath our skins.It's definitely 1980s. It's a good start on the Pinhead legend. It's for gore fans or for people reminiscing about the 1980s horror franchises. And it's a recommended for a more thoughtful look at pure evil.

Jeff Bridges is the staff psychiatrist (and hypnotist!) at the hospital who takes an interest in Spacey's Prot, testing his knowledge about astrophysics but always coming up with more questions than answers. The other patients on the ward are a friendly, movie-colorful lot, and Spacey and Bridges manage a comfortable give-and-take (though the hypnosis scenes are strenuous), so why was K-PAX so maligned by professional critics? This smoothly-handsome film, adapted from the novel by Gene Brewer (also the associate producer), may be an unabashed commercial product but it isn't a cop-out. The tall tale weaves a squirrelly spell on its audience--a spell that may seem silly once it wears off--however it is an entertaining and satisfying endeavor for the time it's on. Bridges is controlled and professional, while Spacey gets some nervous highs and contrite lows (a dream for any actor). It would be easy to put down such a picture for its outrageous qualities, and I didn't much care for the opening where Spacey is seemingly arrested for no reason (nor a later one involving a freak-out at a holiday gathering). Nevertheless, the movie does find its voice, it manages a solid final act, and the character Prot is a memorable one. K-PAX isn't Oscar material, but it isn't campy or weepy, either.

Wilcox and stars Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen. Screenplay is written by Cyril Hume from an original story by Irving Block & Allen Adler (original title being Fatal Planet). It is a CinemaScope production out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and is shot in Eastman Color (not Metrocolor as suggested on some sources) by cinematographer George J. Folsey. The piece features a novel musical score (credited as electronic tonalities) by Louis & Bebe Barron. Loosely based around William Shakespeare's play The Tempest, the story sees Nielsen and the crew of the C-57D spaceship sent to the remote planet of Altair IV. Where once was a colony of Earthlings, now the only inhabitants are Dr Morbius (Pidgeon), his daughter Altaira (Francis) and Robby, a highly sophisticated Robot that Morbius had built. It transpires from Morbius that all civilisations on Altair IV was wiped out by an unseen force, but not before he himself was able to use some of the knowledge gained from the Krell race to build Robby and the Plastic Educator. However, it's not before long something starts stalking and killing the men of the C- 57D. They must get to the bottom of the mystery or they too will be wiped out. The 50s was of course the decade of the B movie. A decade where science fiction schlockers and creaky creature features ruled the drive in theatres. As paranoia of potential nuclear war and technology spiralling out of control gripped America, film studios grasped the opportunity to make a cash killing whilst providing an entertainment stress release courtesy of science fiction based movies. Be it giant insects, creatures or alien invaders, there were some fun - some bad - and some rather smart movies that hit the silver screen. Falling into the latter category is Forbidden Planet, an intelligent and excellently produced movie that is one of the few that genuinely holds up well over 50 years since its release. To delve further would be unfair to potential newcomers to the film, but in short the piece carries interesting motifs such as sexual awakening, the power of the sub-conscious, or more appropriately the perils of a repressed conscious. It's a Freudian twister, and then some. Also lifting Forbidden Planet a long way above those men in rubber suit movies of the decade is the production value of the piece. True, the budget was considerably larger than what was normally afforded the genre (almost $5 million), but every penny is up there on the screen. The CinemaScope really brings to the front the sets and visual effects, while the Eastman Color fully enhances the animations and matte paintings on offer. The whole look and feel of the movie points to it being later than 1956, so it's no surprise to see musing on the DVD extras such luminaries like Spielberg, Lucas, Cameron & Scott, since Forbidden Planet has influenced as much as it has enthralled. With one of the cleverest stories in the genre, one of its best ever robots (Robby would become a star all on his own) and certainly the best spaceship landing ever, Forbidden Planet is a genre high point and essential viewing for those interested in said genre pieces. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 July 2010","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Forbidden Planet is directed by Fred M.

Finally saw it and while it is, as some suggest, trashy, this is one of the most entertaining films I've seen in quite some time.I've always admired the talent of Mr Corman and his production of BBM is, for me, one of the highlights of his career. I've no illusions that his fans will suggest otherwise however this is a film that grabs you by the lapels, if one has lapels that is, and doesn't let go! Steve Carver takes a VERY low budget and gets the maximum out of it, there are some performances in this movie that will demonstrate the talents of some of your favorite actors that other, more popular and acclaimed films will NOT. As someone who is NOT a Tom Skerrit fan I've got to admit he was the standout actor in this, (I refuse to refer to actresses as 'actors', he really is a talented man. However the standout is the truly gorgeous Angie Dickinson, I knew she could act, I just never realized just how beautiful and sexy she really is, until this film. She singlehandedly transcends the material and thereby lifts BBM out of trash into a slam-bang adventure\/crime\/sex romp that is stunning.

The thrill is in Stone's pacing of the film, the rapidness and short lived childhood in New York before the branching out into a tour of Vietnam during the war and finally slowing the entire piece down as the injuries sustained on that tour take their physical and mental toll on our lead; a toll born out of a certain president's foreign policies and their encouragement of the youth of the day to engage in activities that'll, supposedly, make a difference. I suppose the film is a part of Stone's 'rage' cannon of the late 1980s, early 1990s which saw a flurry of films released little more than twelve months or so apart from one another that attacked all manner of things America stood for; the centre piece here resembling something like John F. Kennedy's speech of it not being a case of what your country can do for you, but something resembling vice-versa and the ill affects if that.Kovic was drawn into the world of the U.S. Marines by way of Kennedy's speech as well as a band of recruitment officers whom visited his school campus. Fittingly, by the time another former U.S. president has arrived onto our screens, it is in the form of Nixon and by this time, we feel Kovic has found his voice in amongst all the hardships after having Kennedy essentially lead him in. Kovic's childhood is constructed as this eerily picturesque existence which comes chock full of utopian iconography representing; the winning shot in a baseball match as parents watch on is balanced with a very American celebration of Americanism and patriotism in the form of Independence day marching complete with bands and the honouring of war heroes of past. His gaze is captured as he sits atop his father's shoulders looking on at these Second World War veterans, a degree of morbid fascination perhaps filling his mind as he watches the adulation these people receive but perhaps failing to spot both the results of war some of them sport. Additionally, a war game in the opening scene descends into chaos amongst kids creating a sensation that it certainly felt like a good idea at the time, but bickering and bad form take over. As Kovic's childhood moves into adolescence, the man develops into this odd conventional figure of blind patriotism combined with Christian values and the sort whom rushes to one's school ending prom, in the rain, just in time to have this perversely romanticised dance with a childhood sweetheart.Tom Cruise plays the role of Kovic from around this age and upward, his rough and ready look years on from his teenage years consisting of enlisting and so forth displaying a real sense of maturity in the man's acting at such an early age way back when. The innocence, or stupidity, of youth is captured when Kovic and his pals discuss military enrolment and confuse the action with links to masculinity, labelling being able to fight with other men and hold rifles as 'manly' things as the one voice whom rejects such a proposal belonging to Steve (Levine) talks of his wishes to stay behind and engage in activity of a more culinary nature, specifically the running of a diner; actions perhaps more associated with the female of the species, if looking through the narrow slats possessed by the majority of these boys. Stone shoots most of these early exchanges colourfully and lovingly, sprinkling Kovic's life with the odd come-down in the form of a defeat to a rival school in a mat wrestling match after so much training and graft; foreshadowing the let down or frustration born out of believing in something so much to a point, with his post-Vietnam life resembling a greater extension of these thoughts and feelings.Our first look in at a kind of post Vietnam existence is a grimy and colourless Bronx set hospital for the veterans, a systematic look at how veterans of said war are both treated and how many of them struggle from the off in their dealing with this new found scenario. Twinned with this is the guilt Kovic himself carries with him following an accidental shooting of a friendly marine out in Vietnam in the aftermath of a firefight. Where Kovic finds solace in this new existence, after the establishing of how he must now lead his life following paralysis from the waist down, is political rallying and making things known to those ill-informed on events in the war. This is a result of a domestic disagreement with a family member as well as with Steve, who has since gone on to carve a decent enough life out of staying behind, like he said he would, to work at a diner. Stone directs the piece masterfully, changing gears in tempo and pace to suit the ease and toughness in which life travels by; shooting parts of Mexico the Vietnam veterans descend to in order to drown out life's newfound problems with this very warm, very welcoming feel; of which the segment begins with a deliberately appealing establishing shot of a good looking beach before we head on in and get more involved with what sordid activity is going on. A veteran of said war himself, and here emotionally bringing to life the experiences of another, Born on the Fourth of July is a weighty and involving film of impressive magnitude from Stone.
