They then argue like typical religious nuts who are mentally disturbed, about weather they should murder the baby or not, even knowing they can't find it. Then the Pope declares they will NOT kill the baby. First off why even discuss it if it's clear you can't find the baby? Are you going to go through the name it's given to you in some 2000 years ago, and start secretly murdering every one on the planet with that name? But you believe in God and are peaceful like God is made out to be right?So the baby is born and these weird Satan guys take her from the delivery room and have some snake blood put on her. This also begs the question. if the evil guys were there when the baby was born, why not take her then and raise her to be prepared for her destiny?So then we see some weird cloud come up in New York City, go into a bathroom and suggest itself into Gabriel Bryne. I guess it's Satan. So he goes out and kisses some woman in front of her husband before walking out of the place and having it explode. Guess the director figured we were bored this far in the movie, so they give us this useless action scene to get our attention again.So when we do meet Arnold Schwarzenegger he's a suicidal down on his luck cop, that has mental problems. To show his job, we have a senseless action scene, someone shoots at Gabriel Byrne. Arnold hangs from a helicopter and we sit there a mindless action scene we know nothing about or care about, except for the Y2K, December 31st 1999 posters, papers, everywhere I guess to remind us a million times what this movie is about.So far into the movie, if you're not bored you probably feel something is really wrong and this movie is going to fall apart at any second.The cops find the guy who was shooting the guns and he's some mentally disturbed priest with his tongue cut out. So we meet the grown up baby again, who hallucinates some very strange scene on a bus just so we can hear a 4 letter word over and over, since this film has to be explicit. We learn Arnold's name is Jericho Cane. Well why don't we just name him Moses? At this point it sounds like an angry 13 year old wrote this after bible study one day. So while we have to see Arnold Schwarzenegger crying his eyes out (And for the record, this also shows how easily he cannot act a serious dramatic role) Gabe Bryne, I mean Satan has a weird nasty fantasy that exploits that 4 letter word we had to hear earlier, and to give us something of entertaining to people who are bored out of their mind so far.Then we also get a stupid scene of Satan running into a kid with a shirt that says Satan Rules and in typical Satan fashion, he lets him die by a bus accident. I don't understand what this scene was meant for. Was it suggested that people who listen to Satanic Music should die? Why not just have a kid wearing a shirt of ANY heavy metal band and have them die since the writers of this film have an obvious problem with some group of individuals out there who may listen to dark versions of Heavy Metal.We learn that Christine York is who Arnold is looking for, I mean Christ can you get any worse names than this? This is where the movie starts to officially fall apart. This is the moment when plot hole after plot hole after plot hole after plot hole become so many holes that I can't list them all so I'll make it short.The dialog in this movie is more laughable than anything. You have Arnold's one liners that get all serious and sound stupid like this one.You're a choir boy compared to me! A CHOIR BOY! (Not he's saying this to Satan, I can't imagine a more stupid, rushed line in history of Arnold's terrible one lines)Arnold survives some things that no other regular human being would survive. (Rioters beating him to death, and crucifying him, falling from a window a dozen stories high, some how managing to survive many explosions that would have killed anyone not in the movie) There's a church that Satan cannot see. Arnold don't believe in God and blames him on his problems for no apparent reason. Satan does some out of character stupid silly things. And the list goes on. I can't list them all but you get the flow.The movie tries as hard as they can to build you up to the ending. Yeah we're ready to get it over with! NONE of the characters are very likable. I guess they tried to build up some momentum at the end and fix some plot holes, but it still didn't work. Actually the ending is rather laughable.

","genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"25 June 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This controversial debut film from director Larry Clark was made from a screenplay written by Harmony Korine when he was eighteen. Many of the actors in the film were close friends of Korine and not actors at all, or if they were actors, it was to be their first film. And what a movie to start your career... many of the teenagers in this film never had successful careers afterwards. Leo Fitzpatrick, who plays the protagonist Telly, decided that he didn't like acting and Justin Pierce, who plays his best friend Casper, tragically would commit suicide a couple of years later. Kids today is still as controversial and as important as ever in the message that it implores. It's an honest and brutal film that holds no punches in covering a 24hr period in a group of teenagers lives one hot summer in Manhatten. The film has a very documentary style feel to it, which contributes to the authentic feel it has and the amazing performances from it's young cast are some of the best performances I've ever seen from teenage actors.Telly, the films protagonist, is seventeen and the film begins with him seducing a much younger girl who can't be any more than thirteen or fourteen. He talks her into having sex with him, and as he explains in the narration, he has taken to only having sex with virgins. He refuses to wear condoms, so he tells himself that if he has sex with virgins he won't get diseases, and also it has become an obsession for him to deflower as many virgins as possible. Afterwards, he hits the streets where his best friend Casper is waiting for him. Telly then explains his recent 'conquest' in graphic detail and the pair set off for a day of drinking and smoking weed. Telly boasts to Casper that by tonight, he will have deflowered another girl, which he plans to do at a party. His next target is a sister of one of their friends, who is only thirteen. Meanwhile, Jenny, discovers that she is HIV positive. The only person she has ever had sex with was Telly, so she desperately tries to find him during the course of the day to tell him, and also to save the next girl from the same fate...It's hard not to come away from this film feeling sickened, and at the same time, completely blown away. Larry Clark directs this brilliantly, throwing us from scene-to-scene carried along by the graphic and obscene language and conversations of the teenagers. It all looks improvised, but apparently the film follows Korine's script very closely. In that case then this was one very real and well written script. Leo Fitzpatrick plays one of the most foul and disgusting characters I've ever witnessed on screen. He is a total scumbag, and the only problem I had with this movie was how easily he was able to talk his way into the girls pants. In fairness, he is nothing to look at. And are the girls that naive and stupid that they'd fall for what he was telling them? OK, they are very young, but I'm the same age as Telly, and I can honestly say that if he were from the town I've grown up in, he would have gotten his head kicked in a long time ago. And that's for being the p**** that he is. Also, not one girl I know would have fallen for his charm - they'd have seen what he was before he even opened his mouth and I'd hate to be him then if he tried anything. But I couldn't help wondering watching this, don't people talk? Surely Telly would have a reputation by now.The sex scenes are very graphic and realistic - they actually look real to be honest. The scene where Casper and the gang beat the man up in the park was very brutal, but could have been worse if they didn't have a stupid song playing over the entire scene. It's a shame that Leo Fitzpatrick decided not to pursue a serious acting career after this, because I sincerely think that he had talent. He was brilliant here, and how refreshing it was to have teenage actors playing the teenagers, and not some twenty-something year-olds that we usually see. The ending is brilliant, and the last line does pretty much sum up the entire movie. An excellent soundtrack accompanies the story and the superb cinematography; no one ever pays much attention to this but if you watch the film closely and forget what is going on, you'd almost forget that it was happening in New York City, because the camera pretty much stays on the ground giving us a 'fly-on-the-wall-view' feeling.Kids is a very important movie that I think every teenager should see...well, not all of them. There are after all some young men like Telly and the others portrayed in this so a film like this might only serve to encourage them. But it's a shocking wake-up call to what can happen if you sleep around without proper protection - STD's and HIV. I really felt sorry for Jenny in this film, and the rest of Telly's victims who are unaware to what has happened to them. One has got to remember though when watching this that not all teenagers are like this. Only a small minority are as vicious and primitive as some of the characters portrayed in this film. Kids reminds us how vulnerable and confused teenagers really are, and how apathetic life is for them and I think Telly gets it perfectly here - When you're young, not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got.

The film has a very documentary style feel to it, which contributes to the authentic feel it has and the amazing performances from it's young cast are some of the best performances I've ever seen from teenage actors.Telly, the films protagonist, is seventeen and the film begins with him seducing a much younger girl who can't be any more than thirteen or fourteen. He talks her into having sex with him, and as he explains in the narration, he has taken to only having sex with virgins. He refuses to wear condoms, so he tells himself that if he has sex with virgins he won't get diseases, and also it has become an obsession for him to deflower as many virgins as possible. Afterwards, he hits the streets where his best friend Casper is waiting for him. Telly then explains his recent 'conquest' in graphic detail and the pair set off for a day of drinking and smoking weed. Telly boasts to Casper that by tonight, he will have deflowered another girl, which he plans to do at a party. His next target is a sister of one of their friends, who is only thirteen. Meanwhile, Jenny, discovers that she is HIV positive. The only person she has ever had sex with was Telly, so she desperately tries to find him during the course of the day to tell him, and also to save the next girl from the same fate...It's hard not to come away from this film feeling sickened, and at the same time, completely blown away. Larry Clark directs this brilliantly, throwing us from scene-to-scene carried along by the graphic and obscene language and conversations of the teenagers. It all looks improvised, but apparently the film follows Korine's script very closely. In that case then this was one very real and well written script. Leo Fitzpatrick plays one of the most foul and disgusting characters I've ever witnessed on screen. He is a total scumbag, and the only problem I had with this movie was how easily he was able to talk his way into the girls pants. In fairness, he is nothing to look at. And are the girls that naive and stupid that they'd fall for what he was telling them? OK, they are very young, but I'm the same age as Telly, and I can honestly say that if he were from the town I've grown up in, he would have gotten his head kicked in a long time ago. And that's for being the p**** that he is. Also, not one girl I know would have fallen for his charm - they'd have seen what he was before he even opened his mouth and I'd hate to be him then if he tried anything. But I couldn't help wondering watching this, don't people talk? Surely Telly would have a reputation by now.The sex scenes are very graphic and realistic - they actually look real to be honest. The scene where Casper and the gang beat the man up in the park was very brutal, but could have been worse if they didn't have a stupid song playing over the entire scene. It's a shame that Leo Fitzpatrick decided not to pursue a serious acting career after this, because I sincerely think that he had talent. He was brilliant here, and how refreshing it was to have teenage actors playing the teenagers, and not some twenty-something year-olds that we usually see. The ending is brilliant, and the last line does pretty much sum up the entire movie. An excellent soundtrack accompanies the story and the superb cinematography; no one ever pays much attention to this but if you watch the film closely and forget what is going on, you'd almost forget that it was happening in New York City, because the camera pretty much stays on the ground giving us a 'fly-on-the-wall-view' feeling.Kids is a very important movie that I think every teenager should see...well, not all of them. There are after all some young men like Telly and the others portrayed in this so a film like this might only serve to encourage them. But it's a shocking wake-up call to what can happen if you sleep around without proper protection - STD's and HIV. I really felt sorry for Jenny in this film, and the rest of Telly's victims who are unaware to what has happened to them. One has got to remember though when watching this that not all teenagers are like this. Only a small minority are as vicious and primitive as some of the characters portrayed in this film. Kids reminds us how vulnerable and confused teenagers really are, and how apathetic life is for them and I think Telly gets it perfectly here - When you're young, not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got.

The film was certainly ahead of its time in regards to special effects, and I must admit, I was initially impressed by the space sequences and the various other pre-CGI special effects. The main theme (Also Sprach Zarathustra) is amazing too.But for me to truly enjoy a film, I need to feel connected to it somehow, whether it be intellectually or emotionally. 2001 almost lost me in the first 3 minutes. Literally. The film opens with 171 seconds of pure darkness, a blank screen, with a mere droning sound in the background. I thought my DVD player had broken. What a way to start a movie; panicking about the fact your DVD player may be broken.Then the film starts, and the opening titles were great.

I was waiting for that moment where I became engrossed in a rich, unique science fiction experience; the moment where my eyes opened and I realized the sheer genius of Kubrick's master-piece.That moment never came, and I was so over-whelmed in disappointment at the film's conclusion that I broke down in tears. I'm not even kidding. I wept, sobbed, and cried. I'd wasted 130 minutes of my life watching a tedious, pretentious science fiction film.

They'd tell me that I shouldn't go sticking my down-turned nose into such a high-class film like 2001, and that I should stick to the Transformers movies. To which I'd reply, but Stanley Kubrick was my favorite director prior to watching this film.Which is true, by the way. A Clockwork Orange may be one of my all time favorites.

Perhaps it was the fact that I found it too slow, too abstract, or perhaps it wasn't quite what I was expecting. Still, the film is not entirely worthless in my eyes. It did contain a number of special effects that I found to look impressive even in this CGI-infested day and age, and the film does also feature some interesting music and imagery.

The general consensus now say that Once Upon a Time in America was revived after its experience in the abattoir, a.k.a the editing studio that butchered up the movie from its premier cut, and that this movie is brutal, hard hitting, an emotional roller-coaster, a poignant journey and a very bittersweet rendering of characters who we are kind of forced to identify with, even though they're bootlegging alcoholic substances.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"25 June 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I gave this movie a 6 as from my previous experiences of it, I have always felt that the problems with it really are embedded in the macabre-esque feel that it has; macabre doesn't fit something of which is realistic; or at least replete with something along those lines and yet it actually does work in places. The movie, I think, does owe slightly to King Vidor's Crowd with respect to camera techniques; not really in the plotting, but rather the scale of the plotting, where everything is altered to people mystifying and rather unrequited in their care towards anybody; then it boils down to the odd ones out. Likewise with this movie - the beginning centres on the body (which was wasted by the spoiler that this is Henry Serial Killer and the famous Yeah. I kill my Mama slur that is associated with the film). Henry is released from prison and is back taking the job as an exterminator and the beginning chronicles on his car isolating it from all of the other cars, as the camera panels around his car and it's as if he's chasing somebody and certain chained events sort of alarm us that he is... And then he hinders his journey, but we're now in his spot and knowing he is a ticking time bomb.I will also address, to any purists looking for the truth out of the story, that it was BASED on true events and that John McNaughton is working with this story in his reconstruction of the events in dramaturgical ways; I understand if this does misguide people, as it certainly misguided me in a view ways, which is the reason why I think my experience was modified by knowing how crudely this movie was sold (I got it with a quote saying He's not Freddy. Or Jason. He's real and then it just all entailed and actually was better then my expectations were stalled up in being... First of all, it's all about the surface; I was rather disappointed with this approach as it could have been a bit more profound and perhaps even lyrical for the audience to really feel the character's psyche, but we know it's been done before (Not in a biopic of a man, though, but it may have been pretty interesting to witness).Positively to me, it really is a signature movie outside of the others like Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers, Norman Bates - Movies like Omen, Rosemary's Baby - any horror movie that was circulating at that point which almost distinguishes itself from any other horror, which will most likely disappoint horror fanatics.I can look at this movie on its merits though; It is oblique and bleak in its plot which I think is a way of making us interested in understanding the character; the gritty, old fashioned style of film making, while old, shows how successful Halloween was in low budget movies being able to push the bar for movies, like this, that are not quite as schlocky. It was said that actors were employed with people who had no acting experience, so I did find this to be a new take on it.

Leone takes his time to let things play out, and lets the music do the talking instead of voices.As usual, the soundtrack is incredible, arguably perfect. In a film with such little dialogue, the music has far more responsibility. Each major character has a theme, expressed through a tune. Each is great. I believe the best music occurs when Frank rides towards Harmonica at the end. Very emotional.The dialogue, while few and far in between, is excellent. They are delivered well, but more on that later. But the content is fantastic. One example is the three dusters bit said by Harmonica. Also, one line in particular has the most mind-blowing foreshadowing that I didn't realise until I had finished the film. I won't spoil it.This is a 3 parts + 1 movie. Two of the actors play badasses, and being a badass doesn't warrant extra-special acting. Then there's Frank, played by the iconic Henry Fonda. I've never seen a Henry Fonda movie only through the IMDb did I learn of his good-guy reputation. But look at the guy he just looks like a saint. Like Jimmy Stewart. He cannot be bad. But he is. He's evil. Which makes his acting exceptional. A gripe though is that viewers see two explicit actions of evil, one early and the other a flashback.

Session 9 is a film with a good idea and a good execution that has a few flaws along the way. It's about an asbestos cleaning crew who are working in an abandoned mental hospital. Tension amongst the group rises as it begins to look like the the hospital's disturbing past is coming back to haunt them, driving the group's boss to the brink of insanity. This is a surprisingly smart film for what it's worth and the horror aspect of it is actually pretty chilling. It isn't terrifying but it also is nothing to scoff at because it will easily creep you out.Where this film really succeeds is in its execution of the horror and chills which it possesses. The film isn't particularly scary, but it is undeniably spine tingling. A lot of the chills in this movie are brought about by audio. Disturbing sounds and horrific descriptions of terrible events are what fuel the horror this film brings about. This leaves a lot of the visual aspects to the viewer's imagination and, as is the case most often, what we can muster up in our own minds is much scarier than what the film can accomplish. We aren't allowed the luxury of being able to put a face or an image to the evil of this film, making it a lot creepier and much more unsettling. Not enough films comprehend this method of instilling fear, so I have to give Session 9 for getting it right.Where this film falters is... everywhere else. That was mean. The film has a good story that, when it finally picks up, is quite clever and is of a higher quality than the average horror film. But the film suffers from a weak script, disjointed pacing, and a sub-par cast. I personally see David Caruso as one running joke due to his plethora of awful one liners in CSI, but even in a completely different atmosphere I still didn't care for him all too much. Plus it doesn't help that I felt no compassion or care for the characters. They were all unlikeable and I didn't care much about what happened to them, I only hoped it would be chilling and smart. And it was that, so I guess the film succeeded in a way. Also, something just seemed very off about the pacing and progression of the story. Perhaps it was because the story gets fairly convoluted and is at times difficult to follow because of time jumps, or maybe it was simply a rocky story structure. Either way, the film is far from perfect.Despite these things, it would be unfair for me to knock this film based on the things that don't matter as much. This is a horror film, not a complex character story that demands high quality performances. Session 9 greatly succeeds where it matters. It is chilling and disturbing and it pulls these things off with intelligent integrity that can't go unnoticed. It is far from perfect, but also far from terrible. It is definitely a good watch if you are looking to be creeped out and aren't looking for a masterpiece.

Tension amongst the group rises as it begins to look like the the hospital's disturbing past is coming back to haunt them, driving the group's boss to the brink of insanity. This is a surprisingly smart film for what it's worth and the horror aspect of it is actually pretty chilling. It isn't terrifying but it also is nothing to scoff at because it will easily creep you out.Where this film really succeeds is in its execution of the horror and chills which it possesses. The film isn't particularly scary, but it is undeniably spine tingling. A lot of the chills in this movie are brought about by audio. Disturbing sounds and horrific descriptions of terrible events are what fuel the horror this film brings about. This leaves a lot of the visual aspects to the viewer's imagination and, as is the case most often, what we can muster up in our own minds is much scarier than what the film can accomplish. We aren't allowed the luxury of being able to put a face or an image to the evil of this film, making it a lot creepier and much more unsettling. Not enough films comprehend this method of instilling fear, so I have to give Session 9 for getting it right.Where this film falters is... everywhere else. That was mean. The film has a good story that, when it finally picks up, is quite clever and is of a higher quality than the average horror film. But the film suffers from a weak script, disjointed pacing, and a sub-par cast. I personally see David Caruso as one running joke due to his plethora of awful one liners in CSI, but even in a completely different atmosphere I still didn't care for him all too much. Plus it doesn't help that I felt no compassion or care for the characters. They were all unlikeable and I didn't care much about what happened to them, I only hoped it would be chilling and smart. And it was that, so I guess the film succeeded in a way. Also, something just seemed very off about the pacing and progression of the story. Perhaps it was because the story gets fairly convoluted and is at times difficult to follow because of time jumps, or maybe it was simply a rocky story structure. Either way, the film is far from perfect.Despite these things, it would be unfair for me to knock this film based on the things that don't matter as much. This is a horror film, not a complex character story that demands high quality performances. Session 9 greatly succeeds where it matters. It is chilling and disturbing and it pulls these things off with intelligent integrity that can't go unnoticed. It is far from perfect, but also far from terrible. It is definitely a good watch if you are looking to be creeped out and aren't looking for a masterpiece.

And at this very time where the atom could annihilate life and civilization, when the two blocks on both sides of the iron curtain had the nuclear weapon ready to be used, any human being could have legitimate reasons to look at the future with fatalistic eyes. This paranoid state lasted during almost one decade reaching its paroxysm with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Legend has it that the Soviets had indeed a nuclear weapon aimed to destroy the world in an extreme case. Anyway, the Cuba crisis, had it escalated to a no-return point changing the temperature of the Cold War, could have meant the end of humanity, or in the best case, World War III. I needed to remind the context because it's still very hard to believe that all these elements inspired one of the funniest and most classic cinematic comedies. But I guess, it's no surprise that the only film-maker who has successfully gone through this challenge is the one and only Stanley Kubrick.The first time I watched Dr. Strangelove, I had no idea about what to expect. I knew it was a political satire but having the iconic image of Major Kong riding the bomb in mind, I thought the movie would be inhabited by such goofiness, it would deviate it from the level of sophistication I expect from the Master. How wrong I was! If one thing, Dr. Strangelove strikes by the seriousness of its humor. It's almost a psychological introspection into the ability of serious people to inspire our laughs. These are adult men, reasonable, moderately competent, who are confronted to a political crisis initiated by a lunatic Brigadier Jack Ripper. This man, between some solemn cigars' puffs, reveals the sacred mission he'd be entrusted with, preservation of precious body fluids. Sterling Hayden is so damn serious and believable, I admit I bought it. But when you go into the film in depth, a sentence that should be a motto with Kubrick's films, is there ever a reason not absurd enough to justify war? Dr. Strangelove doesn't use absurdity for comedic purposes but more to denounce with subtlety, its eternal dichotomy with War, as the highest level of absurdity human mind ever reached. Could something be more absurd than fighting and destroying one population for the survival of another, when contrarily to animals who do it for survival, both can technically live in peace? Jack Ripper sets the tone that the rest of the film will never contradict. And it brought up one of the most classic ironical movie lines when the General 'Buck' Turgidson, a hysterically funny George C. Scott in an Oscar worthy comedic performance, violently confronts the Russian Ambassador Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is the War Room, shouts an patronizing President Muffey. The Cold War is almost reduced to a bunch of adults fighting like kids. Indeed, all through the film, there is a disturbing feeling that war is playful and the political leaders are like playground monitors incapable of keeping the lowest instincts of their troops under control. War is too serious to be left to politicians precisely because they simply can't handle their military troops, while the planes are going with Johnny Come Marching Home Again as musical background. That's the irony of civilization, its excess can't handle the barbarity. The unforgettable Red Phone conversation is probably my favorite and funniest moment from the film. Muffey very casually tries to appease his Russian homologue as if they were talking of a simple incident, not something that would eradicate any trace of life on the surface of earth. Hilariously disturbing.This psychological element is omnipresent in Kubrick's as to insist on one of the very paradoxes of our species, our dehumanizing humanity being so sophisticated, so powerful, so civilized that it alienates in the conviction that these accomplishments, science, power can be used to kill other people in the name of self-preservation. The iconic ending where Dr. Strangelove's arm raises spasmodically as to make a Nazi gesture reminds that the Cold War carries the worst aspects of whatever World War II has taught us. The lesson hasn't been learned obviously, and the way, the psychotic Dr. Strangelove talks and seems to be listened with interest, would be tragic if it wasn't so damn funny. Of course, I couldn't go on without mentioning the genius of Peter Sellers, who managed to capture the absurd roots of evilness through Strangelove, while portraying the straight man as Muffey, the symbol of civilization's impotence.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"25 June 2011","score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Species, for its time, was an extremely well executed Sci-Fi Thriller, with action packed WoW-in special effects work. It is extremely underrated as most people's first recollection was that they were taken aback at how much skin Henstridge's shows throughout the movie. I mean, c'Mon... she's a horny alien, trying to propagate, for chrissake... and yes, your husband was thinking about alien sex later that night with you, ladies.Okay, I'm losing my train of thought, let alone my focus...; This is what most people do when you bring up this movie, most viewers soon forget how awesome, by definition of the term... that the movie really is, and therefore, it's NOT just some trashy R-rated B-movie, like so many were from the mid '80s to the early '90s.The story balance is very well kept from beginning, with solid character development... throughout the crazy plot, to the climax, and quickly to a unexpected, yet fitting finale. Natasha played the role to a T, with her almost, perfect appearance, and bright, and justly glowing & huge green, also already (alien-ish), eyes. Action scenes, and special effects are top notch, as is standard execution by Steve Johnson, who created costumes, robotic structures, prosthetics and effects for this and a cache of blockbusters like Spider-Man 2 (Easily arguable as the pinnacle of the trio), War of the Worlds, the 1989 classic - The Abyss... and definitely not to be unlisted here, Pet Semetary II, the best one in my opinion, and a personal favorite scary thriller of this reviewer. Sorry for the TLDR; run-on movie-geek splashing there.Check out those Green eyes http\/\/tinyurl.com\/6hntl7qOverall, Species follows the winning recipe for great Sci-Fi Action Thriller, by combining great complimentary casting in Kingsley, Whitaker, and Molina, oh, and Micheal Madsen... shoot! That's a Sci-Fi cast, what? Something must've smelled good, right! oDThe acting and follow-through by scriptwriters from story-2-screen, showed balance... extremely important for movies of this genre. It also stands up to the test of time, which for many of these Special FX Blockbusters, expected to explode all over the tail-bone of a 3-day weekend release for maximum payoff and publicity, it usually does NOT hold true. I'm gonna watch this right now! AND, I want you to watch it again for the 3rd time, but you need to pay for it; you can even watch it on Amazon... see the free preview on IMDb first and get your mouth watering for 'Ol Green-Eyes gonna get ya! - Sir SmokeAlot.Reruns on FX while cooking dinner for the kids doesn't count.
