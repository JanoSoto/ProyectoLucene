It's not a critique or condemnation of that 'scene'. Antonioni--although his roots are in documentary--tends to use locations for their visual impact and whatever moods they may invoke and not, in his films of the 60s, to make political statements. He chooses the fashion scene of London because of its preoccupation with surface (literal surface) and a kind of primary-color palette. Thomas, (David Hemmings) seems to function as an 'artist' in this scene, but is very clearly not engaged with it artistically. It's something he does by rote, offhandedly and (very importantly) without PASSION (as a number of famous scenes show. Ironically, these scenes were exploited to sell the film as 'erotic'). The director had much of Thomas's neighborhood in the film repainted to intensify the bright, primary color scheme. A scheme in which red seems to dominate, but not symbolically. Red (as well as blue) just identifies Thomas's milieu. When the photographer goes into the park, he enters a world of green. Beautiful, almost intoxicating green (a real feature of the DVD transfer, by the way, is the brilliance of the color in this film). Green connects obviously to nature, even in a park landscaped by city planners. But, again, it's not really symbolic (Antonioni does not tend to use symbolism in any conventional sense, if at all, until perhaps the end of this film). Rather, it establishes this alternate environment where Thomas will make a significant discovery.Earlier in the film, we meet Thomas's neighbor, a painter named Bill (John Castle) who introduces the notion of looking at a work of art and seeing something in it after it's complete (he demonstrates this in his own painting). When Thomas develops his photos of Redgrave and her lover in the park, he begins to notice other details that are far more interesting. This leads to an investigation that sort of encapsulates, or stands in for the long wandering segments of Antonioni's previous films a gradual discovery of some kind of knowledge or truth. What does Thomas discover? Perhaps that there's something under the surface of life that we don't want to think about, rushing around in our driven lives; perhaps it's mortality, or just something that SEEMS to be serious and important. When he pursues the investigation by going to see the actual body, the film takes on an almost frightening aspect. There is something primitive and slightly disturbing about the nearly silent scene of Thomas finding the body, accompanied only by the soft rustling of wind through the trees. He's shaken by it. Yet the whole experience has awakened a passion in him, not so much as an artist but as a human being. When the body has disappeared on his second visit, Thomas seems deeply disillusioned. Was any of this real? Does it matter if it was or not? But for a brief moment this jaded young man cared about something that did appear to be serious and important. The encounter with the mimes actually does seem symbolic, and it's a fairly obvious move on this director's part. Here's where it all gets so subjective, that it's deliberately up for grabs what, if anything , do the mimes stand for? Why does Thomas join their game and then disappear? To some, it's a surrender to the illusory nature of being, so complete that he no longer needs to even exist himself.

The birds themselves may be a metaphor rather than just a peaceful creature gone bad.What might these birds symbolize&#151;women (bird is British slang for a young woman), peace (doves), love (love birds), nuclear war (a bird is a guided missile and always ready to be fired), or maybe humans who are no longer rational and go into panic mode (like birds that are no longer peaceful and become ruthless predators)? Has anyone ever flipped you the bird? There seems to be the strongest connection between the birds and the women in the film. The movie begins with a boy whistling at Melanie&#151;the human equivalent of a bird mating call. Mitch has three birds circling him&#151;his mother who wants no other women in his life and to rule the roost, Annie who longs for Mitch to return to their nest and Melanie who is really, really, really cooing for Mitch.

Braveheart is an ambitious film starring and directed by Mel Gibson about about William Wallace, a 19th century Scottish rebel who led an uprising against tyrannical King Edward of Longshanks (played by Patrick McGoohan). The movie has its moments as it explores such time-honored themes as courage, honor, romance, and nobility, but overall Braveheart comes across as shallow and intellectually unsatisfying. The main problem I have the film is its mostly one-dimensional characters You are either a good guy or a bad guy, and there is no in-between. On one end of the spectrum you have the protagonist William Wallace, who is the embodiment of everything good (as listed above) and is so perfect that you cannot find a single fault with him. On the other you have Edwards of Longshanks, the ruthless and evil tyrant who has no redeeming moral values. I always have problem with such general characterization since I believe human beings to be more complicated, and sometimes what separates good from evil are the choices that we make. I would appreciate the movie more had Gibson done more to explore the strength (good) and weakness (bad) of both men instead of his over-simplified depiction of good versus evil. As a director Gibson also takes abundant historical and artistic licenses, something I do not have a problem with since I hardly expect Hollywood movies to be 100 % historically accurate. I only wished that he had taken the time to explore the characters more deeply and make them more interesting.

I'd seen Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie beforehand, which was probably helpful.The translation of the title reads, that obscure object of desire which is as relevant a title as could be. It's a surrealist film, which is only directly revealed not in the strange dream-sequences Charm employs, but rather in a very simple technical element the use of two actresses for a single female lead. The two actresses are interchanged with seeming complete subjectivity. The only easy thread to denote is perhaps that one actress plays the more French side whereas the other plays the more Spanish side -- as though the character is meant to be Spanish, she grew up partially in Paris. I've read some theorizing that the one of the sides was emotive, & the other distracting -- which is also plausible.However most of what I want to discuss goes to the core of the meaning of a surreal film. My mom, it must be said, does not care much for the surrealists. I must admit, I never was crazy about Salvador Dali. The problem I think both of us have had to varying degrees is our own base level of empiricism that surreality ignores. Obviously, one woman can not be two women in any literal sense. But I think this is where the value of surreality can be appreciated. Surrealism has an ultimate primacy of being able to discriminate completely against insignificant time (as I posted on before) & even the ability to flaunt insignificant time as significant time. The film itself I feel must be read as symbolic. Neither characters are particularly sympathetic in the sense that neither is particularly human. The male archetype is presented as Mathieu older, richer, & wanting sex. The female archetype is presented as Conchita (which is short for the Spanish name Conception) young, beautiful, virginal, but sexually aware. My mom projected literal psychology on both characters as being the opposing parts of a sadomasochistic relationship, with Conchita as the sadist. I don't think it's that simple.Conchita continually asserts a nearly narcissistic if not wholly so appreciation of her self & independence. Whenever she feels Mathieu could own her she spites him with her assertions she is physically capable of providing for herself. Mathieu, in turn, desires Conchita greatly but does not seem to love her. He makes no overtures of marriage, & in fact seems very resistant to the idea. Conchita is threatened by her love of Mathieu, & the loss of independence it would engender, & Mathieu is obsessed with his physical desire for Conchita.Throughout the film Bunuel seems to throw in irrelevant information about terrorism, which is only made more silly & surreal by its treatment (one of the groups is called Revolutionary Army of the Baby Jesus, with a pantheon of other silly acronyms under it) & his seemingly repeating this device from Charm. The film, I believe, depicts what obsessive desires about self do to blind us to the obvious reality around us. In this case Conchita's narcissism & Mattieu's lust make the fact that their world is falling apart seem totally unimportant. Bunuel uses this right up till the final scene.Before I talk about the final scene, however, I want to establish another subtle surrealist thread through the film. Mathieu carries around a bag through several of the scenes. It is very out of place because it is a cheap rucksack (Mathieu is rich) and is never given an obvious purpose. It is just a seemingly random rucksack. We find out at the end that this rucksack is filled with lace & lace nightgowns some of which are ripped & bloody. Mathieu & Conchita drop this rucksack off at a shop, & Mathieu gestures in amazement how an middle-aged woman stitches up a hole in a beautiful blood-stained lace garment shut, as if it'd never been ripped.The implication is not difficult to read, especially when we see Conchita's reaction, which is one of utter disgust. Mathieu is carrying around his past sexual experience, & trying to show Conchita that to be deflowered (Conchita's virginity is a topic of much conversation) does not mean one's delicate feminine beauty is ruined forever. Conchita reacts to this comment by running away from Mathieu. He catches up to her and here is where Bunuel reminds of the outside word they are both blown up in a terrorist bombing. Their explosion is the finale.Bunuel uses surrealism to give a prescriptive ethical message if you are concerned only about your needs, you will be destroyed by the outside world, which does not concern itself with you. My mom didn't like the idea that this was about gender types because she said it doesn't really apply to any men or women she knows. I feel this is a bit denying, but I can admit it's not a literally applied dynamic. It is merely a symbolic message if we took these gender roles to their extremes we would treat each other horribly, & have no consideration for the greater good. I admit this is a somewhat simple, even didactic message. But I disagree that it doesn't have meaning for reality because it does not represent reality.

It starts by introducing a group of six friends, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), Ann Crook (Joanna Page), Liz Stride (Susan Lynch), Annie Chapman (Katrin Cartlidge), Polly Nichols (Annabelle Apsion) & Kate Eddowes (Lesley Sharp) who all happen to be prostitutes & supposedly look out for each other. One member of the group, Ann Crook is now the Mother of a young baby, has recently married into money & promises the girls that she will give them four quid to pay a Victorian pimp named McQueen (David Schofield) & his men. Shortly after the girls then witness Ann, her husband Albert (Mark Dexter) & their baby being dragged screaming from a flat by Ben Kidney (Terence Harvey) & his men who all work for Scotland Yard special branch, later on that night Mary is warned not to mention to anyone what she saw. Also that night Polly is brutally murdered, she has her throat cut from ear to ear & her body is horribly mutilated. The drug addicted Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp), Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) & Scotland Yard's finest are on the case. Annie Chapman is next to be brutally slain by the killer who has become known as 'Jack the Ripper', getting absolutely nowhere with his investigations Inspector Abberline seeks the advice of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) & his protégé Dr. Ferral (Paul Rhys). Together they agree that the 'Ripper' is probably an educated man & very knowledgeable about human anatomy & the use of surgical instruments indicating that he may be a Doctor. As Abberline gets closer to unveiling 'Jack the Rippers' identity he faces resistance from his superiors, special branch, falls in love with Mary & uncovers dark secrets & conspiracy's that go to the very highest levels of Royalty & Government...Executive produced & directed by Albert & Allen Hughes as The Hughes Brothers I thought From Hell was an OK mystery thriller but nothing to get too excited about. The script by Terry Hayes & Rafael Yglesias based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore & Eddie Campbell is far too long & becomes dull to watch as it neither works as a factual reconstruction of the 'Ripper' events or as a fictional horror\/thriller, this feels like a teen slasher based around a few of the more well-known Ripper elements. There are massive inaccuracies between what takes place in From Hell & what happened in reality, the prostitutes never knew each other & if this is the case then the entire explanation that From Hell gives must be wrong & therefore most of From Hell is pure fiction straight away & this alone destroys any sort of credibility that it tries to achieve. Inspector Abberline was nothing like Johnny Depp & he lived until 1929 & had a distinguished career, & I'm not too sure if the real Inspector Abberline would have had psychic visions of the murders before they happened! I'm positive that there are loads more too. From Hell falls also flat as a fictional tale because it is just far to intricate, there are too many characters who do very little, not enough screen time is given to the 'Ripper' or his motives & far too much time is given to the group of moaning filthy prostitutes. I also thought the semi-happy ending & Jack's eventual motive were well off the pace. But the thing that really sinks From Hell in my humble opinion is that it is just so slow, dull & uneventful. In fact I actually fell asleep about 20 or so minutes before the end & had to rewind the tape so I could catch the end, I shouldn't have bothered really. On a positive note From Hell has exceptional production design, the filth, squaller & nastiness of the back streets of Victorian London are wonderfully recreated in great detail. From Hell is also a visually strong film with some flashy camera techniques like when the Ripper stabs a girl in a pitch black archway where at first the only thing we see is the silver blade of his knife as it catches the light but the blade starts to turn more red each time it re-catches the light after disappearing for a second, editing tricks & nice use of CGI to enhance certain imagery & some of the cityscapes of Victorian London with a shot of Big Ben in complete shadow at night & a gorgeous looking red sky behind it particularly springing to mind. The violence & gore was mostly implied & mostly consisted of graphic shots of dead bodies although there is one of the best on screen slit throats it's been my pleasure to view... Technically From Hell is top-notch throughout, but then that's the least I expect from a film with an estimated budget of $35,000,000, the acting is very good from all involved & a special mention goes to the fantastic Robbie Coltrane who is just brilliant & makes his character very likable. Overall I thought From Hell was an OK way to pass a couple of hours & I can't in all honesty call it a bad film but it could have been done with being 15 or 20 odd minute's shorter which would have increased the pace & helped maintain my interest. As it stands I don't think I'll be in any hurry to watch it again anytime soon. Worth watching if you can find a copy going cheap or catch it on TV for free.

Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt. It did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content, but it disappointed in every other way.Caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick. It fails miserably in its ambition, subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds. The film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect, and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real, graphic sex. But in setting this sex in the context of Caligula's depraved reign, it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie. Sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of Caligula. In it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. In the present day, it is somewhat common to hear words like sin and depravity used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it.The historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. They only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium. Rarely has a film proved so boring. The sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fades, only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture.Rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence. While many films more violent than Caligula have been made, few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence. Apparenly, unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized Caligula's emperorship. The violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex.A review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells. I understand why someone would want to see this film; after all, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review, by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not. My high school criminal justice teacher described police work as hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror. This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You have been warned.

Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt. It did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content, but it disappointed in every other way.Caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick. It fails miserably in its ambition, subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds. The film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect, and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real, graphic sex. But in setting this sex in the context of Caligula's depraved reign, it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie. Sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of Caligula. In it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. In the present day, it is somewhat common to hear words like sin and depravity used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it.The historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. They only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium. Rarely has a film proved so boring. The sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fades, only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture.Rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence. While many films more violent than Caligula have been made, few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence. Apparenly, unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized Caligula's emperorship. The violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex.A review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells. I understand why someone would want to see this film; after all, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review, by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not.

I do remember being a bit disappointed but being freaked out by what looked like a stone baby. However I'm a huge Jerry Goldsmith fan and the soundtrack to this film is an outstanding piece of work. It always amazes me how a composer can take a second rate flick (or by some of the comments a third rate flick) and still manage to infuse it with genuine passion and beauty. The horror cues are suitably scary with demonic whisperings and chants and the music that accompanies the build up to the second coming is on a scale much grander than the director ever managed to achieve. I actually rate this score higher than the Oscar winning score for The Omen. Films not as good though!

It may have been the longest hour and a half i have ever spent watching a movie. I wondered after watching why anyone would have made this piece of trash. I can't believe that Micahel Caine and the actress who played LV's mom were both nominated for awards. i like and respect Michael Caine, but this has to be a sympathy vote. He played a sleazy guy. The character wasn't at all complicated. And the mother? She was annoying. It was like the writer took everything about women that was bad and put it into a character. This was horrible and a waste of time. It was so clichéd. All the characters were hollow and just stereotypes. I would never watch this film again. Ever. I saw it because Ewan MacGregor was in it and he's a favorite actor of mine. He was good in it, but he is always good. Do not rent this unless you like watching fairy tales that have been told better before.
