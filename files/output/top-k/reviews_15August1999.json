The only way a horror film can scare you is if they make you believe what is going on.  Alfred Hitchcock did that, and that is why he is the king of horror.  I am not comparing Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick to Hitchcock, but they did do a great job with their cast.  Heather Donahue plays, well, Heather Donahue.  Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams also play themselves.  I guess forty thousand dollars cannot buy you different names.  Or maybe it just added to the realism. Heather Donahue is great.  In a present day where leading ladies are hard to come by, Donahue takes the cake.  The problem with most women taking leading roles is that they cannot be believable, something this whole film is based on.  But, Donahue plays the role in stride.  Her character is the one making the documentary, getting help from Williams and Leonard.  She is demanding, hard nosed and the leader and I believed it.Michael Williams plays his role terrifically as well.  When the film starts, you think he will be the minor character.  All he is there for is the sound.  Well, think again.  He lets his role flourish.  As the group of three meshes, his role standouts, which becomes much more important as the film roles on. Joshua Leonard plays the sort of, peace hippie who tries to keep everything under control.  Surprisingly, he is the first one to disappear. His role complements the others as well.  None of the cast stands out because they all give great performances and they all mesh.  Whatever egos they may have had were checked at the door because this cast is about getting the film done, not giving the best performance.  This makes their performances even better. The plot is the best part of this film.  Despite the great acting and realism, all horror films still need a scary plot.  This one is based on three filmmakers who want to make a documentary on the local legend of The Blair Witch.  I will not spoil too much, but lets just say that The Blair Witch is a person\/creature who supposedly killed children years ago. Then, after interviewing a few locals, they head out into the woods. They start filming in the woods, finding places that are spoken of in the legend.  They are disappointed, but still film, looking for more answers. However, they soon find a portion of the woods littered with The Blair Witch symbol.  This is where things start to go wrong.  They start hearing noises in their sleep; first everyone believes it could be an animal or some sort of prankster.  But, as they start to believe it could be The Blair Witch, we start to believe as well.  And as things progress, they lose such things as the map and Joshua.  That is about as far as I should go, but let me just say that when you see the ending, prepare for a haunting experience. Is there anything wrong with The Blair Witch Project?  Yes, but nothing major that holds it back from being a four star film.  The only flaws I saw in this film were with two things.  Mike kicks their map into the river, claiming it was not getting them anywhere.  At this point in the film, they are nowhere near crazy, which is why I do not believe this part.  The other flaw is nothing major and actually enhanced the experience for me.  But, for those of you who cannot stand shoddy camerawork (i.e. your home movies) then do not see this film.  The camera goes everywhere and even has times when the screen is completely black and all you hear are voices.  This added to the realism for myself, but might make other people just suffer motion sickness. Overall, this is the best film that I have seen this summer.  It has humor in the beginning and then progresses to have you believe the scenario. Then it blows your mind with an innovative and haunting ending.  And, ironically, it is a sharp contrast to the effects laden blockbusters that plague us every summer.  Fortunately, The Blair Witch Project was made with forty thousand dollars, plus a lot of heart, hard work and creativity. This makes it one of the best films of the summer and of the year.

More importantly, I was hoping that it was going to be the movie that Eddie Murphy finally breaks out of his acting slump. It's been a long time since I've seen Murphy do a truly funny movie and I can happily say that he's finally done it.The movie revolves around Steve Martin's character, Bobby Bowfinger, a down and out small time movie director hoping to find that one script that will launch him into director stardom. He finally finds a script that he believes is 'the one' and proceeds to put together the best filming crew and cast that $2000 can buy, which is needless to say, a hodgepodge of people. His one trump card is Kit Ramsey (Murphy), the movie industry's biggest action hero actor. With him, the movie is a guaranteed success. But unfortunately Ramsey refuses to do the movie. Bowfinger then decides that he can shoot the movie with Ramsey in it by filming around the actor's daily life without him knowing. Along the way, Bowfinger meets up with Jifferson and decides to use Jifferson as Kit's double for some of the shots. The rest of the story I'll leave to you to see.This movie definately belonged to Eddie Murphy. The first part of the story, we meet Murphy as Kit Ramsey. He plays Ramsey as a paranoid actor that will do anything, including belonging to a religious cult, to solve his paranoia problems. His fast talking, loud brash character is amazingly funny but his true talents shine as he plays the dim-witted Jifferson. His ability to play Jifferson as an incredibly sweet but naive character makes Jifferson all that more endearing and unbelievably funny. Steve Martin is his usual crazy self and provides a few laughs but Murphy is definitely the attention getter.Despite the great performance by Murphy, there were some rough spots though. At times, it felt that Martin's writing and directing was trying to be too smart. There's no doubt that he is an intelligent man and that he was obviously poking fun at a variety of aspects of the Hollywood life but in some of the situations, it almost felt like he was trying to make too subtle of a statement. This resulted in some parts that were rather slow or dull. The beginning took a little while to get into and to some audiences, this may start them off on the wrong foot.Overall, ride out the slow points and enjoy Eddie Murphy's best performance in years.

You felt his pain and his glory. There were some holes in the storyline, such as athlete John Dixon's switch from secretiveness to aloofness about their relationship, but then he was pretty confused. I read one review that probably said it best - John had much more to lose by revealing his orientation than Steven Carter. Still, I love characters that show bravery that I probably never would in the face of the same situation. While I teetered on whether Brad Gorton's performance was really all that great, I really enjoyed that of the two other principles - Charlotte Brittain (Linda) and Stacy Hurt (Jessica). Though a stereotype, Brittain played it to the hilt and Hurt hit just the right chord of sweet and jilted. Director Simon does a superb job with the camera. The dance scene was mesmerizing in the way it was presented with the hand-held cam. Beautifully photographed. Some of the music was a bit overdone however.

I mean let's face it, many people over the age of 18 have had it at least once and many people are consumed by it.  And as long as it is consentual, protected sex and intentions are never misleading, then what is wrong with sex, even if it is with someone that you are not in love with.  Sex can be a powerful thing. Because if you think about all the feelings that you can experience during the act, they really range perhaps more than any single act that you can think of. Everything from pure lust to passionate love can be felt at one time or another during sex.  And I find it funny that certain institutions or groups try to deny or at least restrict people from fulfilling one of the most basic needs they have as an animal.  Nine 1\/2 Weeks explores the power of sex.  It examines it and doesn't shy away from what it wants to say. And for a film that is almost 14 years old, I have to applaud it for pushing the envelope of what is acceptable and what is loathed.Kim Basinger is a successful but lonely woman living in New York City. She meets a stranger who buys her an expensive item that she could never afford. But he buys it because he can.  This starts the intrigue between the two. He is the tall dark mysterious man that doesn't really reveal much of himself.  He is obviously incredibly wealthy, but it is not really revealed what it is that he does.  And that feeling of subserviance is paralleled when the blindfold scene is presented to us later in the film.  He controls his life by controlling others.  He has his world under his control and that includes his sexuality towards her.Some say that this film doesn't really have a point or that it has no plot but to show a lot of soft core sex scenes.  But look at it a little more carefully and you will see that it does have much to say.  It just has to say it about sex, and many people can't handle that.  Sex is topic that is taboo.  It is something that shuold stay in Pandora's box buried in some ancient Egyptian catacomb, never to be unleashed on mankind.  But Adrienne Lynne is a bit of a renegade, that, or he grew up in Europe where sex is like eating.  They are both necessary to live.This film also has a perfect mood setting soundtrack.  Songs like Slave to Love and Eurasian Eyes are just as important to the film as the lighting and the set design.  Then there is Joe Cocker's famous  You Can Leave Your Hat On melody that is the perfect song for Basinger's strip tease.  These songs heighten the mood and make you feel a part of the world that you are voyeuristically watching.I'm not going to comment on the plot and the acting and the direction or tell you what this film is about.  It is a film about a relationship that is doomed because of it's sexuality, that is all you need to know.  Judge for yourself how good or how bad it is.  I personally liked this film very much and I do recommend it.  It has a lot to show and a lot to say about our psyche when it comes to doing it.  But don't take my word, make up your own mind.

Sex can be a powerful thing. Because if you think about all the feelings that you can experience during the act, they really range perhaps more than any single act that you can think of. Everything from pure lust to passionate love can be felt at one time or another during sex.  And I find it funny that certain institutions or groups try to deny or at least restrict people from fulfilling one of the most basic needs they have as an animal.  Nine 1\/2 Weeks explores the power of sex.  It examines it and doesn't shy away from what it wants to say. And for a film that is almost 14 years old, I have to applaud it for pushing the envelope of what is acceptable and what is loathed.Kim Basinger is a successful but lonely woman living in New York City. She meets a stranger who buys her an expensive item that she could never afford. But he buys it because he can.  This starts the intrigue between the two. He is the tall dark mysterious man that doesn't really reveal much of himself.  He is obviously incredibly wealthy, but it is not really revealed what it is that he does.  And that feeling of subserviance is paralleled when the blindfold scene is presented to us later in the film.  He controls his life by controlling others.  He has his world under his control and that includes his sexuality towards her.Some say that this film doesn't really have a point or that it has no plot but to show a lot of soft core sex scenes.  But look at it a little more carefully and you will see that it does have much to say.  It just has to say it about sex, and many people can't handle that.  Sex is topic that is taboo.  It is something that shuold stay in Pandora's box buried in some ancient Egyptian catacomb, never to be unleashed on mankind.  But Adrienne Lynne is a bit of a renegade, that, or he grew up in Europe where sex is like eating.  They are both necessary to live.This film also has a perfect mood setting soundtrack.  Songs like Slave to Love and Eurasian Eyes are just as important to the film as the lighting and the set design.  Then there is Joe Cocker's famous  You Can Leave Your Hat On melody that is the perfect song for Basinger's strip tease.  These songs heighten the mood and make you feel a part of the world that you are voyeuristically watching.I'm not going to comment on the plot and the acting and the direction or tell you what this film is about.  It is a film about a relationship that is doomed because of it's sexuality, that is all you need to know.  Judge for yourself how good or how bad it is.  I personally liked this film very much and I do recommend it.  It has a lot to show and a lot to say about our psyche when it comes to doing it.  But don't take my word, make up your own mind.

And every summer we always see these films get toasted by critics and never live up to their full potential. At the beginning of the summer, Mystery Men was shaping up to be another blockbuster film with a great cast, and we were waiting to see if it would fail or not.  Unfortunately, this clever comedy got lost in the mix of The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense.  What got lost was a very clever and innovative comedy, which spoofs superhero films.The graphics in this film are great and add to the spoof.  They are very colorful and outrageous, which adds to the comic book feel of the film. It is in a futuristic setting with Captain Amazing, played by Greg Kinnear, as the protector of Champion City.  Then, there is the trio of Mr. Furious, The Shoveler and The Blue Raja, played by Ben Stiller, William H. Macy and Hank Azaria, respectively.  They are the superhero wannabes.  Things go afoul when Captain Amazing starts to lose popularity.  He has done such a good job that there are no superheroes left to take out.  Therefore, Captain Amazing sets up a plan to set his arch-nemesis, Casanova Frankenstein, played by Geoffrey Rush, free.  Chaos ensues as Casanova traps Captain Amazing and it is up to the wannabes to help Captain Amazing.  They do some recruiting and eventually add Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), The Spleen (Paul Reubens), The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) and The Sphinx (Wes Studi) to their team.As stated before, the cast is nothing short of excellent.  Movies can always enlist A-List celebrities, but they need to mesh in order to be successful.  In Mystery Men, the cast blends perfectly.  Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo are the perfect combination and they interact terrifically. Hank Azaria stands out as well as The Blue Raja, whether it be practicing his cutlery or arguing with his mother.  William H. Macy gives another strong performance as The Shoveler, and his demeanor and wit will have you chuckling throughout the film.  But perhaps the funniest performances come from Paul Reubens, a.k.a. PeeWee Herman, and Wes Studi.  Reubens plays the flatulent Spleen and Studi plays the prophetic Sphinx.  These performances are great and contrast the clever humor of the rest of the cast perfectly. Unlike Ben Stiller's last comedy, There's Something About Mary, Mystery Men is a clever and innovative comedy.  It will not have you rolling in the aisles, but you will still be impressed and laughing.Are there any problems with this film?  Of course.  This could have been a great film, but despite the two-hour length, it could have benefited by being longer.  The script is underwritten due to the great cast.  They are so funny they need more time.  Kinka Usher, the director of this film, tries to get each cast member his or her own amount of screen time, which takes away from the film.  In particular, Stiller and Macy could have used more screen time, along with Janeane Garofalo.  Despite all of this, the rest of the cast usually delivers with comedy when they are featured on screen. And the other detraction from Mystery Men is the ending.  The spoof ends in the last ten minutes.  Instead of having a spoof ending, which would have been funnier, they have a typical superhero ending.  In this case, each member of the cast gets to shine in their own particular way.  This detracts from the rest of the film considering the rest was a spoof. Overall, Mystery Men is a very enjoyable experience.  It is a spoof of not only superhero films, but also blockbusters as a whole.  This may be one of the few A-list casts that meshes together so well, so you do want to check this film out.  Unfortunately, stiff competition from films like The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense and Runaway Bride will keep Mystery Men from achieving the box office results that it truly deserves.

A moneyshot is a term from the porn industry  the close-up of the male climax is apparently the high point of most straight male porn flicks, and in the industry they call it the moneyshot.  I got to thinking how most horror, book and film, uses moneyshots  the teacher turns into a multi-tentacled alien, the vampire appears in full glory and starts killing folks off, the demon is summoned and holds the severed virgin's head in its hand.  Whatever.  Oates deliberately avoids moneyshots in her fiction, leaves the reader a little bit frustrated, never resolves the tension she builds -- and the horror is all the greater.Seems to me that that's what the BWP is trying to accomplish, and that's a major reason why a lot of folks don't like it.  There's barely any moneyshots in the movie.  The tension builds, but the directors never let you release the tension.  There's never an appropriate moment to scream, so the screams stay on the inside.Some folks have criticized the characters in the film for acting unrealistically.  I wonder how many of these critics have gone camping with cityfolk?  In unfamiliar environments where they're incompetent, folks can get crazy real quick.The camerawork functioned very well.

It's 2001 for action fans.The plot (skip to the next paragraph if you don't want spoilers) goes like this  synthetic people called replicants, stationed on the off-world, are upset with their second-banana position in society and their limited life spans (apparently they were becoming too human), and rebel.  They kill a bunch of their human supervisors -- by the way, all this happens before the story begins -- and head to L.A. to meet their maker (get it?), to ask him to extend their life spans past four years.  Rick Deckard (sourpuss Harrison Ford), once a champion hunter of replicants, is called back from his retirement to go out and take them down.  Along the way he falls in love with a replicant named Rachel (Sean Young -- one of the rebels?  we're never really told), but still pursues his quarry.  In the end he kills all but one replicant (Rutger Hauer, who's very good here).  That replicant has killed the orignal replicant designer, but saves Deckard's life.  After this, he (the replicant) expires and shuts down.  Deckard returns to his apartment to see if Rachel is still alive.  The ambiguous ending tells us that the couple may or may not be hunted by Gaff (Edward James Olmos, playing the Claude Rains role).For those who find the Greater Meanings to messy, inconsistent, disorganized and overcooked (like me) can still enjoy those primo visuals, and maybe even the Vangelis score, but they probably won't have much fun otherwise. There isn't much in the way of action sequences, though Ridley Scott does include plenty of shooting, bone breaking, skull crushing and eye gouging, and the story is pretty illogical (part of that can be blamed on the altering of some of Philip K.

This movie had no plot, no actors, no script, no scares, and absolutely no business being on the big screen.  It was a childish attempt at horror. The actors made the lines up as they went along and you could tell.  The best they could come up with is f this and f that.  That took a whole lot of talent. NOT!  As for the horror factor, three idiots running around the woods with a video camera screaming at each other is not scary.  The way they handled the camera, I'm surprised no one had to leave the theatre to throw up from motion sickness.  You were never shown anything that could actually scare you.  Hand prints on a deserted houses walls is not scary. Noises in the woods barely audible is not scary.  Twigs tied together is not scary.  A chicken heart in a hanky is not scary. What is scary is all the over rated whoopla that has been made about this thing.  What is even scarier is people spending that kind of money to see it.  And finally what frightens me the most is the money I paid.  I wish the witch would have taken me away from the movie.  Oh wait, she couldn't because there wasn't one or at least none the movie showed.  IT STINKS!

This movie had no plot, no actors, no script, no scares, and absolutely no business being on the big screen.  It was a childish attempt at horror. The actors made the lines up as they went along and you could tell.  The best they could come up with is f this and f that.  That took a whole lot of talent. NOT!  As for the horror factor, three idiots running around the woods with a video camera screaming at each other is not scary.  The way they handled the camera, I'm surprised no one had to leave the theatre to throw up from motion sickness.  You were never shown anything that could actually scare you.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"15 August 1999","score":"","review":"  This film, on first viewing, instantly became one of my favorite films.  Never having been one to not see beyond errors or limitations of films, the angst and joy in this sci-fi love story is a study in major toying with your emotions.  It was sort of reminiscent of the emotional ride you took with Jack and Rose in Titanic.  Definitely a formula film, but does reach your heart (assuming you have one).Jane Seymour is so perfect in the period role, you can't help but fall in love with her.  She seems born to it.  He character is charming and beguiling and beautiful.  I've always wondered if she had a pact with the devil, she looks the same now as then.  Christopher Reeve would not be my first choice to play the male lead.  He is, at best, adequate.  It seems looks to match Ms. Seymour's were more important than acting ability.  Both are very rarely found in the same proportion that Ms. Seymour possesses.  This may magnify the acting mismatch.  She steals the movie.The haunting musical score, although a bit sappy and perfect for this sort of movie, draws you deeper into the love story, providing you with plenty of emotional cues.  If you've never cried at a movie, you won't like Somewhere in Time.  If you can let your heart go, you'll love it.......
