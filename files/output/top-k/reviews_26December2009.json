I called the theater and hear the choices and then went to the internet to watch excerpts. Galaxy Quest had this odd scene with rocks and a great line. That was enough! I had to see that movie. I've seen it 5 times since on DVD. Life can be fun and simple and this movie provides pleasure poking fun at Trekites....All the acting works....there is a charm to this movie. Just watch to have a good time and you will. The emotions were there. Silly...happy...dumb...serious...sad...crazy....I scratch my head wondering why there was no sequel. It's been 10 years...and every year I'll watch this movie just to have fun. And so will you....or my name isn't Phineas T. Bluster!

As a 12 yr. old, I was glued to my front row seat at our neighborhood theater in East Aurora, NY! (a suburb of Bflo., NY!) And had nightmares for months! Producer George Pal created a quality movie and cast, with an effective soundtrack. (I'd later work 17-yrs. for Billboard Magazine in L.A., Vegas-&-here) and meet one of thee greatest Hollywood composers, Jerry Goldsmith. (Alien, A Patch of Blue, Star Trek!) Fun fact Legendary costumer\/multi-Oscar winner Edith Head, was uncredited for this film! So sit back & enjoy The War of the Worlds! The remake, with Tom Cruise, is OK, but seems less personal and real than this version. After living & working in L.A., it's-a-kick to see several familiar shots of local areas, such as the nearby mountains & certain bridges.
