Once there Alan and Ellie find out it isn't any ordinary park, but a park filled with live dinosaurs. The storyline of the film is a nice sci-fi tale about cloning and being able to genetically manipulate the extinct species of the dinosaur race, though there are small curse words in the film and some obvious death scenes as well the film can still be enjoyed by children of course with a bit of parental discretion. Now from the beginning to end, the story begins to developed better and has you changing moods to the situations our protagonists find themselves in, one can feel the suspense during the kitchen scene with the raptors and the children, you also feel the delight that Alan and Ellie feel when they see a real dinosaur for the first time. As for the direction Steven Spielberg does a nice job in showing off some nicely executed scenes, giving us a full perspective on the entire island and of course some very original and classic shots such as the t-rex chasing the jeep scene, which is definitely one of the most influential scenes I've seen (aside from several others).&#x95;Acting\/characters\/interaction between them Now Sam Neil is not a bad actor, not the best there is but he ain't a bad actor, he does a nice job of giving Alan Grant to life, he is able play very well during the scenes and has us believing he is really being attacked by dinosaurs, as for his character, Alan has some nice development through out the film as at first he does not really like children and is excited about the idea of the park being made but by the time the film is near an end Alan becomes more fond of children and obviously is no longer supporting Jurassic park at all. Now I could name another actor but they're not the main appeal of the film (not that they're not great) the ones that really have you at the edge of your seat are the dinosaurs, man, this film was made in 1993 and the visual effects are still awesome, the dinosaurs look so realistic, still these visuals are so much more breath-taking than films like district 9, star trek, avatar, terminator salvation, (all of which I really liked), etc. Now another aspect of the realism of the dinosaurs is how the actors interact with them, when Tim is on the tree and begins to pet the brachiosaurus did seem very natural, and also their struggle when running away from a t-rex or when they're fighting the velociraptors . And between the actors their interaction was pretty nice, you felt these characters were real people trapped in this situation.&#x95;Visual effects Now man, the visuals are awesome, even today I'm amazed this film was done the way it was and the sound of the dinosaurs stomping through the park and pushing the vehicles against the wall, I mean man these visual effects and all of the sounds are just great you hear the roars and the falling cars so well I mean you feel you're there with them.Overall this is a very exciting film with some great visuals and very incredible sounds as well as a nice scifi story with good acting, to me its the best film I've ever seen.

His key problem had always been his inhibiting bashfulness when dealing with people. However, his strongest distinction has always been his shrewdness. Fans of Lucas see his sovereign autonomy as a significant countermeasure to the supreme control of Hollywood, his idealized enterprise to spend (and make) his own money on new innovations and projects that have benefited the rest of the industry as something to be commended. Dissenters, nevertheless, lose hope in what they perceive as a dominating juvenilization of the American film industry in the wake of Star Wars---the watershed that proved that Jaws and Close Encounters were no flukes but the real thing---holding Lucas and Spielberg specially accountable for the gaudy spin-off merchandise-driven summer-blockbuster mentality that has steered the business for the past three decades.I'm somewhere in the middle. More clearly, I'm guilty of ranting in favor of the dissenting argument on several occasions yet I'm aware of the validity of the former argument. I look at Star Wars now and see a film that barely holds a flame to at least a dozen or so other American films of its decade. I think what makes Star Wars, even as a stand-alone film, strike more thunder than virtually any other film in decades before or after it is its television series-scale mythological content. The fact that it was meant to be a saga spanning several films was something scarce even in a decade when Jaws 2's and French Connection II's were beginning to pop up here and there. The scope of Star Wars' story must've been as much of a shock to the system as the enormously ground-breaking FX.It's basically one of the quintessential Good Vs. Evil Sagas. It's classic in that sense. What I like about its universe is that it depicts a civilization a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, suggesting that we here on Earth were likely cavemen or conquistadors when they'd already spanned an interplanetary life-sustaining geography, had technology that not only begets robotic slaves and laser dogfights in space that mix the mass of a warboat and the agility of a fighter plane, but weapons of mass destruction that don't just nuke entire cities or countries but whole planets. The presumably human characters are able to speak languages spanning countless planets' worth of alien species. Lightsabers. Regardless, it's all on the verge of a cataclysmic struggle between a totalitarian regime and a rebel organization. The rebel organization is seemingly apt to be weaker without heroic figures who believe in an omnipresent energy that gives them purpose and power. The totalitarians, on the other hand, and more interestingly, use this omnipresent Force to motivate their evildoings. I wonder maybe if this Force is at the heart of the problem.Nevertheless, civilization has consolidated into a clear-cut case of good, wearing white, and evil, wearing black, May the Force be with you and the Dark Side. As much as I love the concept of intelligent life in the universe far more advanced than us and sharing parallels, I feel like Good Vs. Evil is too archaic to be the general philosophy of everyman in a civilization that could possibly be millions of years more advanced than us. Then again, maybe that's the most significant clue What if in a future far ahead, we're advancing technologically at the same rate as we are now, so life has expanded much further, yet we're still preoccupied with fighting over the same platitudes and ideologies as now? You can't help but quibble in your head over which religions would be the good guys and which ones would be on the Dark Side.Or maybe that's just the classical sort of tale Lucas wanted to tell. After all, his supposed influences, some I've noticed and others I guess I trust, range from Kurosawa epics to John Ford westerns, from Buddhism to abstract metaphysical theories. These aren't bad sources of inspiration, and many share, to some degree, a sense of hero worship, feelings of power directed, to whatever extent, toward fighting evil. Regardless, no other Star Wars character holds a candle to its villain, Darth Vader. Yes, Obi-Wan comes in close, but we all know what happens to him and who does it.There's still much more to say about the movie, but unfortunately it's limited by its low rank on one's priorities. Perhaps my real favorite character is the music, the immortal symphony we all know by heart. And my theory as to why the acting of Vader's generals, admirals and underlings tends to sound like a pub scene in a bad werewolf movie is because half of acting is who you're acting off of, and Vader's James Earl Jones voice is what gives him gravity, not whoever was under the actual helmet. As for the Special Edition additions, I don't know. Completely unnecessary Jabba the Hut scene, although it adds foreshadowing for Han Solo's arc. The world\/creature details and CGI shots have a much different look than the comparatively realistic remaining film, making me more conscious of watching the movie than its story and immersive atmosphere. Lucas had great ideas and lots of unassuming pluck, but as the propeller of not only blockbuster but franchise mentality, sequels, prequels, reboots, remakes, revisiting the 20th-anniversary tampering, the joke's somewhat on him.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"16 June 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The irony of George Lucas' career is that he started out making experimental avant-garde short films and became, not always of his own volition, the closest thing the modern film industry has to an authentic classic mogul. His key problem had always been his inhibiting bashfulness when dealing with people. However, his strongest distinction has always been his shrewdness. Fans of Lucas see his sovereign autonomy as a significant countermeasure to the supreme control of Hollywood, his idealized enterprise to spend (and make) his own money on new innovations and projects that have benefited the rest of the industry as something to be commended. Dissenters, nevertheless, lose hope in what they perceive as a dominating juvenilization of the American film industry in the wake of Star Wars---the watershed that proved that Jaws and Close Encounters were no flukes but the real thing---holding Lucas and Spielberg specially accountable for the gaudy spin-off merchandise-driven summer-blockbuster mentality that has steered the business for the past three decades.I'm somewhere in the middle. More clearly, I'm guilty of ranting in favor of the dissenting argument on several occasions yet I'm aware of the validity of the former argument. I look at Star Wars now and see a film that barely holds a flame to at least a dozen or so other American films of its decade. I think what makes Star Wars, even as a stand-alone film, strike more thunder than virtually any other film in decades before or after it is its television series-scale mythological content. The fact that it was meant to be a saga spanning several films was something scarce even in a decade when Jaws 2's and French Connection II's were beginning to pop up here and there. The scope of Star Wars' story must've been as much of a shock to the system as the enormously ground-breaking FX.It's basically one of the quintessential Good Vs. Evil Sagas. It's classic in that sense. What I like about its universe is that it depicts a civilization a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, suggesting that we here on Earth were likely cavemen or conquistadors when they'd already spanned an interplanetary life-sustaining geography, had technology that not only begets robotic slaves and laser dogfights in space that mix the mass of a warboat and the agility of a fighter plane, but weapons of mass destruction that don't just nuke entire cities or countries but whole planets. The presumably human characters are able to speak languages spanning countless planets' worth of alien species. Lightsabers. Regardless, it's all on the verge of a cataclysmic struggle between a totalitarian regime and a rebel organization. The rebel organization is seemingly apt to be weaker without heroic figures who believe in an omnipresent energy that gives them purpose and power. The totalitarians, on the other hand, and more interestingly, use this omnipresent Force to motivate their evildoings. I wonder maybe if this Force is at the heart of the problem.Nevertheless, civilization has consolidated into a clear-cut case of good, wearing white, and evil, wearing black, May the Force be with you and the Dark Side. As much as I love the concept of intelligent life in the universe far more advanced than us and sharing parallels, I feel like Good Vs. Evil is too archaic to be the general philosophy of everyman in a civilization that could possibly be millions of years more advanced than us.

A lot of his films- some might say the bulk of his oeuvre- focuses on this, from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to Moby Dick. Sometimes, it might seem, a man has both the writhing worm of ambition and promise and the potential for complete failure in a single bound. He excels at this, not because he has to but because he needs to tell these stories of men like this - his heroes were manly male stories by the likes of Melville, Kipling, Hemingway and Hammett, but one can also sense the spark of criticism, of questioning what makes such men the way they are. The Man Who Would be King is no exception, and may be the pinnacle of such a tale, where we see two men, formerly failed soldiers, make themselves into the rulers of a nothing country right off of Afghanistan in the 19th century - one of them becomes a God by luck (or destiny) - and how it eventually ruins them. Whether Huston's film, by way of Kipling's story, is meant as a cautionary tale or a wicked satire (or maybe both), it's still tremendous storytelling, acting, direction and musical composition, etc. In the film, two ex-soldiers of the Royal English Army are in India, Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine). They both tell the impressed if a little doubtful Rudyard Kipling himself, merely a journalist at the time (Christopher Plummer by the way), that they, being pretty much without any real place to go or things to do as disgraced soldiers (lots of crimes such as theft and blackmail), have a plan to go to Kafiristan, which is a country few know exists and hasn't been inhabited by any kind of real ruler since Alexander the Great. In short, a great place to rule and take charge with their skills as soldiers.After braving the terrain, in some brief but effective scenes showing how much of a duo Draven and Peachy are in battling the weather and a few stray wanderers, they arrive at the country, which is in shambles, and they train some of the locals to fight their way against their rules (the one guy who is sort of, kinda ruling things wants Terrible to follow his name, not Great as it were). But somehow Draven stands out - first when he is hit by an arrow and it doesn't hurt him or draw blood (since, yeah, it struck a part of his shield), since this shows that he is automatically King. Next, when the High Priest calls him out, he happens to have around his neck a Free-Mason symbol, which sets off the High Priest to declare him a God (since, well, it's the same image as on a tablet or something). For all of the riches now at Draven's disposal, over a short period of time - that is, he really starts to like the idea of this God thing, when before he was on par with Peachy, a tough and smart and witty entrepreneur. No Guts, No Glory, I guess.This is the sort of story that reads interesting and raises questions about Colonialization and worship in general. On the screen, when delivered by a director who lets the backdrops of the mountains and hordes of middle-eastern mountain people, and the glorious acting of Connery (I might say at a career high here) and Caine (who is no slacker either, certainly when he realizes how crazy Draven has become), it becomes something to behold. The dialog is one thing that sticks out as particularly clever and intelligent; the script could easily fall into some kind of delirious or ridiculous swashbuckler story, or even something that praises what they're doing. But Huston and his co- writer's script give these characters smart things to say, things that people like these British officers with carte blanche, as well as their go-between guy who translates for them, would say in this unlikely cinematic situation. Like other Huston films ala 'Falcon' and 'Sierra Madre', it's very quotable.The themes are very potent, and not dumbed down or so sensational that they become incredulous. Huston and Kipling draw upon the history of man's ability to overcome obstacles, be it climbing a mountain or training a small army or becoming enamored with the responsibility of a God, what the outcome of adventure and ambition does to people. It's significant, for example, that Draven is told about how Alexander the Great picked his wife from this region when he ruled, and so he decides he must take a wife and bear a son for future rulers, even as it's spoken that women fear being chosen to become the wife of a God since they'll burn up in flames. Things like that, or how simple a small group of monks can stop an entire battle with everyone bowing in heed. It's remarkable how astute the commentary is in the film, while at the same time not detracting from the action or the power of the performances.The Man Who Would be King is elegant and harsh, with a beautiful and harrowing Maurice Jarre score (if not as iconic still as fantastic as Lawrence of Arabia for him), and memorable for its star power and how its story is really about something. It's also a grandly British story, of guys who sing traditional songs when they're bored or near death) and joke when they can and are so likable for how they just go for broke. That's one other thing these guys are never so distasteful as to be hated, and even their 'scheme' is sort of endearing because of everything they go through to get to Kafiristan.

And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway.

The film is an adaptation of Brown's autobiography of the same name. For those of you who have not seen this film, make it next on your to do list. The whole film is engrossing from start to finish and contains dynamic characters and some of the best performances in cinema history. The film plays out through Brown's life chronologically, whilst he is waiting to make a public appearance. I'm afraid that is all I will tell you about the plot, you will have to see it for yourself, I would hate to rob you of such a truly remarkable cinema experience.I will first focus on performances as they are so integral to the films prowess. As most of you will know, Daniel Day-Lewis won a Best Actor Oscar for this performance and never has one been more deserved. Many argued at the time that an actor with cerebral palsy should have been cast in the film, but these views were soon silenced after seeing how mind blowing Day-Lewis' performance was. He manages to portray so magnificently the feelings of frustration Brown felt towards platonic love and the ignorance of people that believed that his illness impacted upon his overall intelligence. There is really no more that I can say about Day-Lewis' performance, apart from see it for yourself. There are also brilliant performances from Huge O'Conor who plays young Christie in one of the best scenes in the film where he first uses his left foot to write and not to mention Brenda Fricker who also picked up an Oscar for he heartfelt portrayal of Brown's loving mother. All of the actors in this film walked the fine line of the portrayal of the disabled, and all of them simultaneously make you forget that the line even existed around 5 minutes into the film.Although the film is almost hijacked by the performances of Fricker and Day-Lewis, there is also a lot to be said for the brilliant direction of this film. There are so many beautifully shot scenes such as Christie's first rejection by a teenage girl, his speech therapy and his falling in love with the doctor who tutors him. There are so many other powerful aspects of the film, non more so than the portrayal of Brown's siblings, who's love for him is so important to the tone of the film.Overall the true triumph of this film is that it is not about feeling sympathy towards Brown, it is about empowering him and showing his creative genius to the world. This film will undoubtedly always be remembered for its performances and its portrayal of the life and trials of a true artistic genius.

This film is not to be confused with Theodore Rex, the 2001 biography of Theodore Roosevelt by Edmund Morris. The film was clearly meant to be a buddy cop comedy, but sadly the only joke here is the movie itself.Q What costs $33.5 million dollars and goes direct-to-video? A Theodore Rex. But all joking aside, this is not the worst film ever made. The special effects, at least those done in the computer, are below average for 1996, but the animatronics are passable at least. The plot drags its feet under a mountain of mildly entertaining filler. The worst scenes take place in a dinosaur dance club. Perhaps the only truly revolting scene in the film involves a ceratopsidae (a three horned type dinosaur) flirting with our cyborg cop, leaving us to contemplate an inter-species relationship between a dinosaur and Whoopi Goldberg. The horror! The rest of the film is a bland but generally unoffensive brand of unfunny humor consisting of two parts slapstick and one part flatulence, but T.

Rex, getit?) is the story of a dinosaur detective who teams up with a hard-ass cyborg cop (inexplicably played by Whoopi Goldberg) to catch a killer in what the movie hints is the world's fist ever 'dinocide.' This film is not to be confused with Theodore Rex, the 2001 biography of Theodore Roosevelt by Edmund Morris. The film was clearly meant to be a buddy cop comedy, but sadly the only joke here is the movie itself.Q What costs $33.5 million dollars and goes direct-to-video? A Theodore Rex. But all joking aside, this is not the worst film ever made. The special effects, at least those done in the computer, are below average for 1996, but the animatronics are passable at least. The plot drags its feet under a mountain of mildly entertaining filler. The worst scenes take place in a dinosaur dance club. Perhaps the only truly revolting scene in the film involves a ceratopsidae (a three horned type dinosaur) flirting with our cyborg cop, leaving us to contemplate an inter-species relationship between a dinosaur and Whoopi Goldberg. The horror! The rest of the film is a bland but generally unoffensive brand of unfunny humor consisting of two parts slapstick and one part flatulence, but T. Rex is too dull to hold the attention of little tots long enough to bring them to its peak of comedy genius. Do not rent this movie. T. Rex is mildly entertaining, but not worth spending any money on.

A terrific cast led by two towering performances from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones makes the most of an intelligent script and superb direction. The 60's television series provided a firm base for the story, but this feature length, densely plotted movie, takes proceedings to new heights of drama, and excellence.The central premise is as old as the hills. The wrong that must be righted. Ford playing Dr Richard Kimble is falsely accused of murdering his wife and the forces of good, the Police, become the agents of bad, in trying to recapture him after he escapes in a spectacular train and bus crash, as good an action sequence as you will ever see at the cinema.Tommy Lee Jones is imperious as Marshall Sam Gerrard charged with tracking him down. Wonderfully gnarled and taciturn, Gerrard starts out simply doing his job, but things change as he not only comes to respect his quarry, but also starts to have doubts about Kimble's guilt.The first half is all action, particularly the magnificent scene where a cornered Kimble dives down the face of a dam to escape his pursuers. The second half becomes a detective movie as Kimble returns to Chicago to find the real murderer- and clear his name. Full of twists and turns, there is an inevitable showdown at the end, and a text book ending as to how you wrap this sort of story up.Director Andrew Davis's previous work gave no hint of his ability to deliver such a masterpiece, although his previous effort Under Siege will have sharpened up his action skills. And subsequently, he never quite scaled these heights again.

But then the new girl arrives, who seems to have a natural power. Together, they will walk the path of the witch, but some will take the safe route and others will walk towards the darkness. What will be unleashed, and will they be able to control it?Having been in high school in the 90s, I was quite aware of the Wiccan craze that was going around, especially among the girls.

Apparently, Fairuza Balk was a devoted Wiccan and contributed to the authenticity -- I would love to know her thoughts on that now.Aside from Fairuza Balk, we can look back and see the early careers of Neve Campbell and Robin Tunney... even Christine Taylor, the future wife of Ben Stiller. I had no idea at the time they would blossom into big stars. That, and the soundtrack was rather popular, as well.Some have compared this film to Carrie, which I think is a great injustice. Yes, the film is a story of girls coming of age (despite being written and directed by men) and having magical abilities. But it's not much more similar than that. Carrie is an outcast and scared, while the girls here are powerful and puberty really is not a crucial part of the story at all.I think this film deserves a resurgence a fine story, good acting and impressive effects for the time. I would recommend it to anyone, and especially if you were a teenager in the 1990s. You may find the themes familiar it's like Clueless for those of us who weren't quite so glamorous.

I personally believe that you have a low self esteem (or a brain tumor) if you consider this guy funny, god forbid an average actor. And this turkey of a film doesn't make me change my point of view about this man. Not only doesn't make that, but also makes me believe that the stars conforming the supporting cast had taken LSD before reading the script. How can you make John Tuturro look silly and unfunny?, pair it with Sandler in a stinker movie. How can you make Steve Buscemi look disgusting and like a moron?. That's right, pair it with Sandler in a stinker movie. And the same goes with the rest. To sum up, if you like Adam Sandler doing the same type of character in the same Adam Sandler type of movie, I suggest you to view Mr Deeds. If you like to see a group of talented actor, doing it for the money and losing a bit of artistic credibility, I suggest you to view Mr. Deeds. But if you have good taste and like to have some earnest laughs, watch Mr. Deeds all the same, and try to find them. Heaven knows I couldn't ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"}]
