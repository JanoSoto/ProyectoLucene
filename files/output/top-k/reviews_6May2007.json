They were increasingly difficult years for Chaplin, as he and the U.S. government grew increasingly distant and strained in their relationship because of his outspoken liberal and left wing opinions and the government's slide into the McCarthy period. It would end shortly after the release of LIMELIGHT with Chaplin going to Europe on a vacation with his wife and family, and finding that the U.S. government pulled his passport so he could not return (technically, Chaplin had never applied for citizenship here, and was still an English citizen, so the government could do this). A bitter Chaplin moved to Switzerland, and resided there for the rest of his life (which was for another quarter century).While not flawless, VERDOUX was one of the great black comedies, and it's point about the evils of modern society were actually quite solid. It's preceding talkie (Chaplin made only five real talkies, and included a brief talking scene in MODERN TIMES) had been THE GREAT DICTATOR, which too had flaws, but skewered Hitler's Nazi regime, and Mussolini's posturing, delightfully. But LIMELIGHT was a lesser work. I have given it a 7 out of 10 for those parts that are meant for pure entertainment - the music hall turns of Calvaro, such as the flea circus act (an idea Chaplin had been thinking about since 1919's THE PROFESSOR), his final sequence with Buster Keaton (a joint triumph), and his musical score (especially the memorable Theme from LIMELIGHT). Those are all worth watching and hearing.What is not worth watching is Chaplin's windy philosophizing about life and love. Somehow the criticism of society or the Nazis had been done with greater delicacy and accuracy in the two earlier talkies. But here Chaplin's dealing with the romance between old Calvaro and young Terry (Claire Bloom) seems over-expressed to the point of total awkwardness. Basically, Calvaro saves Terry, a girl just on the beginning of life, and nurses her back to health and to the proper start of her career as a dancer. She, in turn, tries to help restore the now poverty stricken man to his position as England's greatest music hall clown. There are moments (due to the acting abilities of the two stars) when their affection and mutual admiration comes through very nicely. But then Charlie talks!Years earlier Paulette Goddard made a comment about her former husband and friend which many critics have since latched onto There is one problem with Charlie. He thinks he thinks! Like Charles Foster Kane Chaplin had hundreds of opinions on every subject under the sun (including those political ones that finally blew up in his face). But most of his opinions were hot air. He didn't realize this. So when he starts giving Terry a pep talk about why life is worth living (comparing us with jelly fish), one can only think that if one was living with this windy old fool one would like to take some artificial method to shorten one's existence and end the torture.He doesn't have to over-talk that way either - he can make one cringe when complementing Terry at her first big dance solo in a pantomime that he is involved in. The soulful way he tells her (ironically the line is quite brief) how beautifully she did it is so overdone as to make one wish Eric Campbell were still around to throttle him.There are other production flaws. One that always got to me showed Chaplin, the producer watching costs to the penny, having Norman Lloyd (as the stage director) explaining the pantomime to the dancers before they start rehearsing it. When he begins the camera properly shows the cast (it includes Chaplin's ill fated oldest son and namesake, Charles Jr., who later committed suicide) on the stage listening intently. Then Chaplin has the camera concentrate on Lloyd's face while he addresses the cast, his back to the large, empty audience section of the theater. Fine - except we can see Lloyd's shadow on the back wall of that large empty audience section. We suddenly realize it is a backdrop (and not a really good one) and must be the size of a medium size oil painting! Chaplin, of course, would not have considered hiring an actual theater for the filming of the scene as it would have been more expensive.Perhaps these comments seem too harsh. Enough of the film is entertaining to merit recommending it - at least as the last Chaplin film worth watching. Also as the last film with Nigel Bruce, as a theatrical producer. However, if my comments seem too harsh, I will say that the final tableau of Terry dancing to great acclaim on stage at the tribute to Calvaro, as he lies dying surrounded by the others, is quite a memorable conclusion - one of the best in any of Chaplin's films.

I just saw Monthy Python and the Holy Grail this night and I can't believe I've missed a masterpiece of a quality comedy. I mean, I haven't laughed that hard in ages, probably never that hard before this movie. It is so hilarious that you just can't stop laughing in certain parts of the movie and it is a definite celebration of comedy throughout, right from the beginning right to the end.I don't know where to start. When I've reviewed movies before, I've judged it by all the usual things; Directing, screenplay, role performances, cinematography and all that, but when it comes to this movie those categories can't be described with words, they just can't be described reasonably. I could always try, but I guess that just wouldn't make any sense. The movie's just so silly that simple rules of how movies are made don't apply. Stupid some may say, but I say it's just genius.Although I just mentioned above that this movie can't be reviewed like ordinary movies, I will try. Just for the fun of it. What comes to directing, well, it isn't something you pay attention to, as it just isn't even so important for the film itself. The things you see on the screen are the only things that matter. What comes to role performances, well, there actually aren't any actual performances. Every actor is excellent and do what they are supposed to do, taking it slightly too far than it's meant to. I know, it's a bit tricky, but that's the purpose of it. An intelligent purpose that is.The screenplay is in this case very hard to judge, because you don't actually know if there exists an actual screenplay. According to IMDb there is and no else than the Monty Python boys themselves have written it; Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Obviously they all are starring in the movie as well. There are two options when it comes to the screenplay Either it's the longest damn script after the script of The Return of the King ever written or then it's the shortest one. What I mean is that you just can't know if the scenes are improvised, because by judging what I saw, the whole movie could be improvised. There's just stuff in it which no other than the Monty Python boys could come up with, just brilliant. I'm not going to analyse the screenplay more specifically, because I don't want to give away any spoilers for those who haven't seen the movie yet. One thing is certain and it is that the movie's just mad in any imaginable way, it's so ridiculous it's beyond ridiculous and that is what makes it so damn good.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is among the best (if not The Best) comedies I've ever laid my eyes on, it's a movie you can not describe with words, it's a movie you have to see with your own eyes. Your lungs's air capacity will empty, scene after a scene. Surely mine did. I'm recommending the movie for everyone, for the fans, for those who just like Monty Python and especially for those who haven't seen any Monty Python's before.

It is so hilarious that you just can't stop laughing in certain parts of the movie and it is a definite celebration of comedy throughout, right from the beginning right to the end.I don't know where to start. When I've reviewed movies before, I've judged it by all the usual things; Directing, screenplay, role performances, cinematography and all that, but when it comes to this movie those categories can't be described with words, they just can't be described reasonably. I could always try, but I guess that just wouldn't make any sense. The movie's just so silly that simple rules of how movies are made don't apply. Stupid some may say, but I say it's just genius.Although I just mentioned above that this movie can't be reviewed like ordinary movies, I will try. Just for the fun of it. What comes to directing, well, it isn't something you pay attention to, as it just isn't even so important for the film itself. The things you see on the screen are the only things that matter. What comes to role performances, well, there actually aren't any actual performances. Every actor is excellent and do what they are supposed to do, taking it slightly too far than it's meant to. I know, it's a bit tricky, but that's the purpose of it. An intelligent purpose that is.The screenplay is in this case very hard to judge, because you don't actually know if there exists an actual screenplay. According to IMDb there is and no else than the Monty Python boys themselves have written it; Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Obviously they all are starring in the movie as well. There are two options when it comes to the screenplay Either it's the longest damn script after the script of The Return of the King ever written or then it's the shortest one. What I mean is that you just can't know if the scenes are improvised, because by judging what I saw, the whole movie could be improvised. There's just stuff in it which no other than the Monty Python boys could come up with, just brilliant. I'm not going to analyse the screenplay more specifically, because I don't want to give away any spoilers for those who haven't seen the movie yet. One thing is certain and it is that the movie's just mad in any imaginable way, it's so ridiculous it's beyond ridiculous and that is what makes it so damn good.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is among the best (if not The Best) comedies I've ever laid my eyes on, it's a movie you can not describe with words, it's a movie you have to see with your own eyes. Your lungs's air capacity will empty, scene after a scene. Surely mine did. I'm recommending the movie for everyone, for the fans, for those who just like Monty Python and especially for those who haven't seen any Monty Python's before. Believe me, I immediately felt this huge filling in my knowing-of-comedy -gap, a must see film indeed.

Last night I finally had the chance to watch it and I was very surprised how good it actually was even this day when movies are so different. If you are going to watch this movie you honestly have to relate to the time when it was made, because if you're going to watch it like any other movie, you may be disappointed.It was breath taking to see how detailed this movie actually was. Everything's just so precise, from the dialog to every single item that you see on the screen, even if it was only in the background. You can't even compare the acting to acting these days, it just isn't anything near it, as it's a totally different art form of its own, so significant and so great. Every single word spoken by every character is so powerful and compelling, every word is precise and carefully chosen. Humphrey Bogart is perfect for the role, a bad ass American, Rick Blaine, who owns a night club at Casablanca during the World War II, but yet he is surprisingly soft-hearted. Then there's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, whose beauty shines through the screen in her role of Ilsa Lund, the woman who was Rick's one time love when they met in Paris. The story between Rick and Ilsa is filled with passion like no other, making the whole movie one of the most passionate movies ever made.The screenplay's just excellent and it also compliments the whole directing of the movie. It progresses with scenes that are just so phenomenal, so legendary and so nostalgic. It includes one of the most legendary quotes in the history of motion pictures, for example; Play it once, Sam, We'll always have Paris and I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Even when I had never seen the movie, I just immediately recognised those sentences and smiled, as they are among the sentences everybody knows even if they've never seen Casablanca before. The whole plot is also surprisingly exciting, comparing to the plots nowadays it would definitely work in any movie, as it is just so thrilling from the beginning till the end and you just can't know how it ends before the last minute of the movie. The final solution's just genius and it's actually so good that I had to start clapping my hands together when the movie ended. Superb.One of the best things now when I've seen the film is that I can finally be proud in saying I've seen Casablanca. And I love it Even after 65 years, Casablanca simply shines, making it enjoyable in every imaginable way. It's thrilling, it's passionate, it's flowing and it's just excellent. Throw away your thoughts of modernity and enjoy some real nostalgia with amazing role performances, superb directing and an excellent screenplay. A masterpiece.

I skipped the fireworks and decided to rush out to see the new Bruce Willis movie entitled Armageddon and that day brought me one of my favorite movies to date even 10 years later. I caught it again recently expectantly while on vacation on TV and was impressed all over again. An ensemble cast that makes the film funny, edge of your seat action, huge special effects, amazing director and production and even a terrific story line amidst a rather predictable plot that had been done before and has been done since in one way or another. Many write how much they hate Armageddon but at well over 300 million dollars grossed and even some Oscar Nominations for effects and sound and such...somebody loved it and I was one of them. I have even read some who called Armageddon campy and I can't agree with that at all. Top notch special effects, and a huge budget ensured that even the wildest plot seemed feasible and real. You were strapped to your seat the minute they left the planet right onto that asteroid and then all the way back to Earth. It was the thrill ride of the decade.Bruce Willis led the cast of slightly unknowns at the time as world class oil driller Harry S. Stamper who lives his life on his oil rig along with his now grown daughter Grace. Willis plays this character to a T. Some would say it's his 'usual' character but in this case Harry Stamper is the usual Willis. He's macho, and oozing testosterone and the brighter of the group and he's a concerned father and a determined driller. He's a self made man and won't let anyone tell him how to do things. Willis is a powerhouse on screen. He was at his finest. Liv Tyler is Willis' daughter Grace and doesn't get a lot of screen time compared to some of the other cast members but she still does well showing the emotion and playing the romantic lead opposite Ben Affleck. Affleck plays young, head strong and very stubborn A.J. Frost who is in love with Stamper's daughter much to his dismay. Affleck and Willis butt heads on numerous issues but in the end are like father and son. They have great chemistry together and even the romance between Affleck and Tyler which is like a sub-sub-story works well and really adds to the plot. The supporting cast is just about brilliant and really jump started some careers...Billy Bob Thorton plays NASA administrator heading up this mission from the ground Dan Truman. Although the role is a little small he still manages to make the best of it and really give an emotional performance. Will Patton is terrific as estranged father and husband ready to be a hero 'Chick' Chapple, Steve Buscemi is good and important but a little over zealous as the woman hungry and a little deranged 'Rockhound.' Owen Wilson is pretty good as the cowboy Oscar Choi who gets some humorous one liners but I'm still not sure what his purpose in the mission was. Michael Clarke Duncan is terrific as the heavy lifter and operator 'Bear' Kurleenbear, Peter Stormare practically steals the show as stranded and reluctant cosmonaut Lev Andropov. And William Fichtner (who seems to pop up in various character roles) plays the lead NASA Astronaut on board Colonel William Sharp who butts heads with Willis on numerous occasions and holds his own against him.Michael Bay is no stranger to action films and definitely has his own wild style when it comes to directing and producing. He directed amazing action flicks like Bad Boys, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and The Island (which I liked!!) and is bringing to life the Transformers this summer. His gritty realism in the face of what otherwise would be the unbelievable makes him a master of this genre. He can make you believe anything and then take you on a wild ride as though you were sitting right there with them. Armageddon is the type of movie where when the ball gets rolling you could stand with your jaw dropped and not move until the credits role because the action is literally non stop and it's almost stressful to watch everything unfold one scene after the next. If somehow you haven't seen Armageddon you're missing out on one of the most fantastic disaster, action epics of the last decade.

The movie is not the effective and emotional involving concentration camp movie it promised to be, which is due to some poor choices of storytelling and its approach. But of course nevertheless this movie is way better than the just average movie regarding the subject and the movie still manages to be effective on most of its fronts, just not on the most important ones.The main problem with the movie is that it can be divided into two separate parts. In the first part of the movie 'life is wonderful' and everything is perfect and the story is told almost fairytale like, with a dreamy like love-story and lots of slapstick-comedy in it. It's just too perfect and happy all, which really doesn't make the movie believable. Yes, I of course realize that this was done on purpose to make the contrast of the second halve of the movie that is set in a concentration camp all the more bigger. It's almost like; no matter what we are going to show in the second halve, it's always going to look worse and more horrible compared to the 'happy' perfect-life first part of the movie. It felt like a really cheap way to steer the viewer's emotions. And let's face it, nothing really bad actually ever happens in the second halve For example; correct me if I'm wrong but we never get to see anyone get killed on screen. And all of the prisoners could walk around freely it seemed and the way the story was told made it seems as if they were in the camp for only two days or so. We never get to see any of the WW II cruelty which occurred in these sort of concentrations camp at the time of the war, with the exception of two or three sequences, which just isn't quite good and effective enough for such a sort of movie that tries to get the viewers emotional involved with the characters and events that occur in this movie. Also the fact that the mother was on the other side of the concentration camp gets highly underused and underdeveloped. They could had really made the movie more effective and emotional with this plot element.Also the comedy of the movie was far too slapstick like for a movie with such an heavy subject. It for me was the reason why I enjoyed watching the movie but yet just never got emotionally involved with it. Roberto Benigni is a clown, not an actor! But yet he won an Oscar for his role in this movie. Sorry, can't say I'm really a fan of him. Too much jumping around and shouting and not enough structured acted out humor, though he shows he's a competent director with this movie. Despite taking some not so effective approaches, the movie is still well structured and directed.It's rather cute that Bengini and his wife Nicoletta Braschi always appear together in movies but I'm sorry to say that Nicoletta Braschi just isn't the greatest actress around,, to put it mildly. It's also always dangerous to have a young kid play one of the other main characters of the movie. Giorgio Cantarini does an effective job with looking cute and Innocent at all but he also looked a bit too much to the things going on behind the camera's during sequences, as if he wasn't focused enough on the actual filming process. This was getting a bit disturbing after a while, especially in some of the sequences toward the end of the movie, which are the most heavy moments of the movie. I admire the approach the story picks when the movie gets set in a concentration camp, when the father is coming up with all kinds of things to make his young son believe they are in some sort of holiday camp, instead of a concentration camp. Truth gets mixed up with fiction in the movie, which provides the movie with some good moments. It's perhaps the best and most interesting idea of the movie, which certainly helps to make this movie an unique one. The movie is really good looking, which is of course mostly due to the Italian settings of the movie but the movie also does a good job at re-capturing the '40's period, in terms of costumes, sets and props. The movie is most definitely not a cheap-looking one, which perhaps is the case with most other European productions, especially the ones regarding the same subject and time period.The movie was one of the big surprises of 1997 and was also nominated for 7 Oscar's, also including the ones for best movie, best directing and best screenplay.

It's almost like; no matter what we are going to show in the second halve, it's always going to look worse and more horrible compared to the 'happy' perfect-life first part of the movie. It felt like a really cheap way to steer the viewer's emotions. And let's face it, nothing really bad actually ever happens in the second halve For example; correct me if I'm wrong but we never get to see anyone get killed on screen. And all of the prisoners could walk around freely it seemed and the way the story was told made it seems as if they were in the camp for only two days or so. We never get to see any of the WW II cruelty which occurred in these sort of concentrations camp at the time of the war, with the exception of two or three sequences, which just isn't quite good and effective enough for such a sort of movie that tries to get the viewers emotional involved with the characters and events that occur in this movie. Also the fact that the mother was on the other side of the concentration camp gets highly underused and underdeveloped. They could had really made the movie more effective and emotional with this plot element.Also the comedy of the movie was far too slapstick like for a movie with such an heavy subject. It for me was the reason why I enjoyed watching the movie but yet just never got emotionally involved with it. Roberto Benigni is a clown, not an actor! But yet he won an Oscar for his role in this movie. Sorry, can't say I'm really a fan of him. Too much jumping around and shouting and not enough structured acted out humor, though he shows he's a competent director with this movie. Despite taking some not so effective approaches, the movie is still well structured and directed.It's rather cute that Bengini and his wife Nicoletta Braschi always appear together in movies but I'm sorry to say that Nicoletta Braschi just isn't the greatest actress around,, to put it mildly. It's also always dangerous to have a young kid play one of the other main characters of the movie. Giorgio Cantarini does an effective job with looking cute and Innocent at all but he also looked a bit too much to the things going on behind the camera's during sequences, as if he wasn't focused enough on the actual filming process. This was getting a bit disturbing after a while, especially in some of the sequences toward the end of the movie, which are the most heavy moments of the movie. I admire the approach the story picks when the movie gets set in a concentration camp, when the father is coming up with all kinds of things to make his young son believe they are in some sort of holiday camp, instead of a concentration camp. Truth gets mixed up with fiction in the movie, which provides the movie with some good moments. It's perhaps the best and most interesting idea of the movie, which certainly helps to make this movie an unique one. The movie is really good looking, which is of course mostly due to the Italian settings of the movie but the movie also does a good job at re-capturing the '40's period, in terms of costumes, sets and props. The movie is most definitely not a cheap-looking one, which perhaps is the case with most other European productions, especially the ones regarding the same subject and time period.The movie was one of the big surprises of 1997 and was also nominated for 7 Oscar's, also including the ones for best movie, best directing and best screenplay. The movie eventually took home 3 statues for actor in a leading role, best foreign language movie and best music.I was overall slightly disappointed by the movie but my expectations for it were perhaps a bit too high.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"6 May 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" William Wyler...that name, for many years, has made me think of one of the most famous Roman epic directions of all time, BEN HUR (1959).

Therefore, I knew generally what the movie is about. Recently, ROMAN HOLIDAY was broadcast on Polish TV and I decided to see it. The first impression I got was there is something different about this movie than most of the classic films I have seen so far... And that impression I got is something I want to share with you.It is true that the classic pair of Audrey Hepburn as Princess Ann and Gregory Peck as Joe Bradley constitute a wonderful aspect of the movie. They will make your day when you see them in these various situations. Having ROMAN HOLIDAY without them is like having an apple tree without apples, they are just deeply attached to this timeless classic, like Liz Taylor and Richard Burton are attached to CLEOPATRA or THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. The whole story of ROMAN HOLIDAY is created in such a way that there is no focus on other performances. Indeed, in this film, there are two main cast, Hepburn and Peck and they are ... terrific.When considering the aspect of performances, it's important to mention lots of very funny and memorable moments where the famous pair do their best to entertain the viewer. Consider, for instance Joe Bradley's first meeting with Ann. Besides, it's just tremendous when she says I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my dress off, it's MOST unusual. Another wonderfully unforgettable moment is when they put their hands into the famous Mouth of Truth (Bocca Della Verita). The camera is so well crafted towards them and the great monument that the impression is like WOW! MAGICAL! The number of humorous moments also make for a great classic who can forget Ann's visit at the hairdresser's or her talk with Joe Bradley on Scalinata Di Spagna (Spanish Steps).Besides, it is true that ROMAN HOLIDAY is a film set in the real Rome of the 1950s. This aspect has become even more powerful as the years passed by. Of course it is not the only film that shows the Rome of that period since we have many, for instance, Italian movies that do the same; yet, the presentation of the Eternal City is really charming in Wyler's film. Since I know Rome and this city means much to me, I was overwhelmed by the movie and involved in seeing what the world known places, including Scalinata Di Spagna, Fontanna Di Trevi, Piazza Venezia, looked like more than 50 years ago. What is more, you are supplied with the views of real streets.But all these aspects are not the most significant ones. Hepburn and Peck are no longer great stars, Rome has changed seriously and a Roman holiday would probably be entirely different nowadays. Yet, the movie by William Wyler is still watched and admired...I think that it is so thanks to the wonderful uniqueness of its classic, the CONTENT. When we see the classic films, these are usually dramas, overall sad films, like GONE WITH THE WIND. I don't say that these dramas lack popularity nowadays, but there are so many of them that you only select and see the ones that suit your taste. Meanwhile, ROMAN HOLIDAY is a comedy, moreover, a romantic comedy, a beautiful fairy tale about gentle love. There is nothing sad, depressing about it! It is a charming story of the princess who badly wants to be a normal human being for at least one day and...her dream is fulfilled. The love absorbs the pair and makes the Eternal City the most unforgettable for both. The picture is in black and white despite there were colorful movies in the early 1950s. It isn't there for no purpose. Black and white picture makes perfect sense in ROMAN HOLIDAY since it adds charm and gentleness to the whole story.I'd love to have this movie in my film gallery since ROMAN HOLIDAY is really a precious film.

Evidently, Cyrano de Bergerac is a miraculous example of a unique slice of modern cinema which has its own set-charms put against its own glaring confidence. From the moment I started watching Cyrano de Bergerac I fell in love with the beautifully laden, grand romantic's vision, and gesture which was being laid bare before my eyes. With this glimpse of realisation I knew I was commencing the viewing of an extravagant modern masterpiece.Cyrano (Gérard Depardieu), a bulky, poetic musketeer with a humongous nose and a man who is both cynical and lively. Due to his nose he deems himself ugly and unfit for the woman he in love with, which is in fact his cousin. In an attempt to swoon his cousin, Cyrano uses his sophisticated charm and wit in the poetry he has written for her. Unfortunately because of his own embarrassment he asks the gallant Christian to pursue the woman with his poems, which leads to Christian falling in love with the lady and so enabling her to misidentify the author of the poems.Tragedy and comedy can be mixed perfectly, writers such as Shakespeare proved this, as have other geniuses and so does Jean-Paul Rappeneau's Cyrano de Bergerac. There is no denying that Cyrano de Bergerac is a depressing tale, yet I would not accuse it of being cynical and due to the delightful ambiance the film holds you feel apart of something truly heart-warming. Comedy is used as a way of dealing with tragedy and a method of being the jester to hide with personal anguish. Cyrano is a flamboyant genius, a man who knows his language, a man so eloquent he's impossible to ignore and a man of both the hysterical and profound.The brilliantly accurate casting of Gérard Depardieu as Cyrano is truly outstanding because he offers one of the finest male performances of the '90s. It is an unexpected performance from such a huge star. His performance bursts with a controlled charisma and a rare personal flourish which will exceed all expectations. The extravagant and lustrous feel the film has is echoed through its array of stunning set-pieces and costumes. All this helps to create a somewhat surreal, yet natural environment. Every technical aspect of the film is outstanding; from the choreography of the fight scenes, to the scathing conversations, to the fluid camera work and the gorgeously epic score. The film has many running themes, which include masochism, self-indulgence and self-destruction, all enabling a huge deal of character analysis.Cyrano de Bergerac is arguably the finest period-piece to come out of modern cinema, yet it is built exactly like a classic of another era.

But in a concept and a setting ripe with potential for making a standout movie on a tight budget, it was failure after failure after failure. On a few occasions, it simply snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory.So I'll list the problems in order of the severity in which they harm the film1. Pacing. It's God-awful. Fast when it should be slow, slow almost all the time - it just drags and drags and drags. A half-way competent editor could have been a lot of help here.2. Acting. Budget films don't have a lot of choice when it comes to choosing a cast, but there's no point in using people that just don't care about the role and couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. Pretty much every actor throughout the entire movie seemed to be thinking Hmmm... Hope we can finish this up quick and get some lunch. I'm starving. The SO is in town this weekend... Wonder what we'll do?And pay that more attention to what they were doing on screen. I felt like I didn't want to be there and it didn't look like most of them did either.3. Attention to detail There were jarring parts where you'd see a 1980's Ford 150 van, in a brilliant blue (probably normal blue, but brilliant in comparison to the super-dingy tonal palette around it).Or a modern windmill farm in a post-apocalyptic world; there were plenty of old-school electricity generating windmills from the 1930's they could base some designs on, but... No.4. Poor editing Non-synchronous sound? In a finished product?! This is not a hard thing to fix. It didn't seem like an 'artistic use of non-synchronous sound', to quash that idea before it can rise.5. Narrative structure Almost completely useless; a skimpy plot, random fight scenes, no build up, no pacing - pretty much the mayonnaise and American cheese sandwich of plots - bland and foul all at the same time, and it couldn't be filling if it tried.In conclusion, it seems like a student film with a slightly larger budget, but on all the things that count, it just becomes a waste in the end; a waste of the viewer's time, a waste of the money used in the project; and a waste of the director's time. This might be a turd that could be polished, or totally re-shot in the future, but as it stands... It's just a dog pile.

So you have a samurai with a six-stringed guitar on a quest to Lost Vegas to take the throne that the King has left behind on his deathbed. So does everyone else though - even Death himself!Now, that paragraph is perfectly accurate. What is described sounds like a pretty cool movie. But in a concept and a setting ripe with potential for making a standout movie on a tight budget, it was failure after failure after failure. On a few occasions, it simply snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory.So I'll list the problems in order of the severity in which they harm the film1. Pacing. It's God-awful.

Now that this storm has settled down, I hope that more people will be able to take this movie for what it is; pure simple entertainment.This is certainly a movie that entertains. It's clean and simple and makes no attempt in putting in any realism or much originality for that matter.It's obvious that Stephen Sommers, just like with his other movie Van Helsing, was attempting to revive the old adventure genre from the '30's\/'40's. And just as with Van Helsing was the case, it doesn't do this very successfully. Modern movie-making and '30's\/'40's adventurous storytelling just don't go together well anymore. The movie is perhaps more of a spoof than an homage at times. And although I certainly enjoy and admire Stephen Sommers attempts, I just don't think these sort of movies will ever make a large impact, or revive the genre from the old days. But I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more simple big blockbuster movies from Stephen Sommers in the future.The movie is loosely and I mean very loosely based on the 1932 The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff in the title role. The movie mostly chooses its own approach and simply uses the concept of the mummy for an overblown entertaining movie with a simple story.But entertaining this movie surely is. The movie is filled with fun characters, lots of over-the-top action and a perfectly adventurous feeling all over it, due to the movie its settings and traveling elements.The characters are perhaps the foremost reason why the movie works out so entertaining. All of the characters are extremely simple and stereotypical but that works really well for such a movie like this one, that obviously doesn't take itself too serious. On top of that the movie is also really well cast. It was the movie that introduced the world to Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, though his career never really got off the ground. Brendan Fraser shows how well he can handle the comical sequences but he also is convincing as the action hero of the movie, mainly because he has the right looks for it. Rachel Weisz plays a more light and naive kind of role and it actually is hard to believe that she is mostly playing now more demanding roles in movies such as Constant Gardener and The Fountain. John Hannah is perfect as the more comical sidekick of the movie and also Arnold Vosloo impresses as the villainous mummy. Also the supporting roles of the movie are very entertaining, such as the stereotypical cowboy-type Americans and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni, who also provides some comical notes. The characters are also made more entertaining by some fine and fun written dialog.But there isn't much else to the script really. The movie purely is an excuses to show off some new special effects and let the mummy cause all kind of mayhem across Egypt. Yes, its incredibly simple but perhaps also all the more entertaining because of that.The sequences with the movie definitely are the highlights of the movie, as he unleashes all the biblical plagues across Egypt. The special effects are convincingly looking for the mummy and his neat tricks, though it's definitely true that by todays standards the effects are all quite slightly below average.The settings of the movie are nice, though some are obviously fake, and they help to give the movie its adventurous feeling. The movie obviously had an high budget and it shows in its action sequences and special effects. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is also fine and truly uplifts the movie.

It worked in Fistful because there was a sort of logic to it whereas here in scenes like the shot through the pillow and the abandoning of Tuco it came off as being just too cruel to justify. Slapping of women and leaving people to hang are tough elements, but ones that had a feel that they belonged. As for the gunfights, they were good of course, but you get the feeling that they could have been better or more convincing.

But that is OK only for an underground movie, because the overwhelming majority of the viewing public will not accept it unless it has any sort of quality, which is clearly not the case here. How can the makers of the movie actually have expected Bowie letting them use his original music? On the other hand of course he invited misinterpretations by using the taboo of bisexuality to finally get his career going. Very soon it became evident that he could have success without any manufactured scandals. But too late for sueing films like this for historical inaccuracy. Well, yer can't have yer cake and sit on it, then throw it out of the window... Iggy Pop granted the use of his music, which is a shame. He of course is much less successful in terms of sales than Bowie and seeks to get his work known by any means. What a pity because he is one of the most intelligent people in the Rock business. To give your work to people who waste it on their private fantasies doesn't help you at all, I think. One question that bothered me throughout bearing this unfunny imitation of a Ken Russell movie was this Do these people understand glam rock? Do they know the difference between acting androgynous and being a flaming homosexual?... Christian Bale by the way is as stony and emotionless as always. The prototype actor for a dumbed down playstation generation.But the reason this movie is a complete failure is this It's neither a documentary nor some truly original fantasy on Glam Rock. It's something in between, something which doesn't work. Reason You cannot save yourself from coming up with a story by using 100s of actual facts from people's lives and then twist all the facts that don't suit your wishful thinking. I think that would be defamation but for reasons described above a well-deserved lawsuit didn't happen. And also because minorities are protected by the P.C. police. True Schlock the entire convoluted mess culminates in a boy-meets-boy fantasy on a rooftop. This is incoherent propaganda that doesn't quite know what it wants or how to get there. This is Rainer Werner Fassbinder at his amateurish worst. But he was probably too intelligent to produce nonsense like this.Lastly I find Biopics awful - they should only be made of people who have been dead for decades so there are less people who actually remember them.

It's something in between, something which doesn't work.

I think that would be defamation but for reasons described above a well-deserved lawsuit didn't happen. And also because minorities are protected by the P.C. police. True Schlock the entire convoluted mess culminates in a boy-meets-boy fantasy on a rooftop. This is incoherent propaganda that doesn't quite know what it wants or how to get there. This is Rainer Werner Fassbinder at his amateurish worst.

First saw this movie when I was about 12 and loved it so much I grabbed a VHS copy and wore it out. My best friends and I used to play Krull games after we watched it - some would be the slayers, others would pick their favourite heroic character and once we even roped a girl into our silly game and had ourselves a princess to rescue! Good times...anyway, enough with the nostalgia.Krull is cheesy, clichéd and the effects are dated. Now any pedantic it's cheesy, clichéd and the effects are dated people can stop reading! I wish I could see this movie as I did when I was a kid. It fired off hundreds of ideas in my head as I came up with xcountless backstories for the heroes, the slayers and the Beast...it fuelled the fires of my imagination almost as much as Star Wars (1977) did...and thats saying a lot coz I was the biggest Star Wars geek kid ever - had all the action figures and all! But now I grab a hot chocolate and rug up in front of the heater to lose myself all over again.Highlights quick summary if interested of what's good James Horner's music score, the fantastic location shots and set design, memorable supporting cast. The things the beast sends, with the BLACK eyes still creep me out even now...very cheap effect but genuinely frightening I feel...in fact the beast and slayers are some of the best ick...these guys make me uncomfortable.. bad guys ever! This film is not for everyone, but I'd suggest if u have kids say 12-15 age bracket I say stick this one on and prepare for something that's a lot better than most of the cheesy Disney stuff you're gonna find these days!Update 26\/10\/07 Listen to the commentaries if u are lucky enough to have the DVD with them, they are so good to listen to, if only to hear Lysette Anthony's real voice, and one of the sweetest laughs i've ever heard.

In GREAT DICTATOR, Charlie Chaplin was misidentified as Hitler, and he was given the opportunity to make a public speech to the world. Chaplin stepped up, cleared his throat, and delivered one of the unforgettable speeches in cinema about peace and freedom. In the case of THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ, Paul would rather bury the truth of Christ's existence, endorsing that faith in Jesus is more important than whether Jesus' resurrection really occurred. Both Chaplin and Scorsese had something which they felt compelled to communicate via their art, and although both deliveries felt contrived and unrealistic, this approach ensures that the point is understood by the audience.Now, I am not here to discuss the merit of this force-feed approach (frankly, I think it's rather crude...), nor am I here to assess the merit of Warren Beatty's statement (OK, I admit it oversimplifies the situation...). I am merely pointing out that Bullworth takes the same approach as Chaplin and Scorsese did in making a personal commentary, in this case the government (specifically, the democratic party) doesn't care about the people, and never will be able to, as long as corporate millionaires are influencing their decisions. In this respect, I believe that BULWORTH should not be critiqued on the basis of realism, but rather on its effectiveness in making the viewer contemplate about our current political environment. After all, at the core of every art, its purpose is to make people THINK, granted that from an artistic perspective, the artist value remains important (which BULWORTH has very little), but from a practical point of view, its maximum impact is what matters to the world.In short, BULWORTH is a political commentary delivered in-your-face with typical annoying Hollywood conventions. I cringed at the few laughably unlikely scenarios which defy any sense of realism; at the same time I was entertained; in the end I was rooting for Senator Bulworth, and the film had its share of impact on me.

The births were of two men who would leave their marks, for better or worse, upon the 20th Century. On April 16, 1889 Charles Spencer Chaplin was born to poor parents in London, England. On April 20, 1889 Adolf Hitler was born to a minor bureaucrat and his wife in Austria-Hungary. The first truly great cinema clown and star and the most evil dictator of all time born four days apart - it does show the impersonal way fate acts, willy-nilly, in tossing this old globe and it's peoples about.Chaplin and Hitler never met. They never had reason to meet. Hitler, although he liked movies, was not known to be enamored by comedians. In fact few of his intimates suggest he ever laughed that much. Chaplin had little use for the demon from Austria who seized Europe by the throat and nearly destroyed it, and who did destroy millions in his death camps. But by some ironies, such as their similar ages, their paths were bound to cross. The most supreme one was the mustache. Charlie had gotten there before Adolf (publicly, that is) with his toothbrush mustache. It made it look like a showdown for ownership of a trademark was destined between the two men. Only Oliver Hardy would sport a similar one to theirs in the same period, and Hardy's bulk made him hardly look like a Hitler clone. Chaplin had read MEIN KAMPF, and knew the homicidal insanities of his contemporary. He made no mistakes about them - this man was pure evil. It helped Chaplin that he had grown up in the East End of London, heavily populated with Jews, and that his half-brother Syd was Jewish (as was his wife Paulette Goddard). Chaplin was fully aware of what this beast and his minions could do and would do. And yet he did miss the beat on the camps (more below on that).Chaplin's first full talkie picks up with the conclusion of World War I. He is playing two roles, and the first is a Jewish Barber, who is a soldier in the Tomanian Army. The soldier saves the life of an officer, Captain Schultz (Reginald Gardiner, in a good performance), who was trying to deliver an important directive to the Tomanian commanders that could have won the war. But he fails to do it, so Tomania loses. The barber is knocked out and only emerges from his amnesia twenty years later to find Adenoid Hynkel the dictator of Tomania. Hynkel is also Chaplin. His first speech on screen is a wonderful spoof on those hideous eruptions of spite and malice from Der Fuhrer that newsreels showed in that period. When he clearly says in mock German that Democracy and Free Speech stink (he says schtunk) the propagandist stooge translator uses euphemisms like Democracy is fragrant! to hide the curt dismissal involved in these comments. When Hynkel goes into a tirade about the Jews, the translator will only say His excellency is commenting about the Jews!. Henry Daniell (as Garbitsch - a Goebbels type of adviser) is nonchalantly listening on the podium to all this. Later, when riding home with Hynkel, Garbitsch says, I thought you didn't like the Jews? to a surprised Hynkel.So it goes throughout the film, with point by point demolition of everything hideous about the Nazis. But with fun. The swastika is reduced to a pair of exes (a double cross). The cult of the leader is spoofed by Hynkel having a schedule which allows him one five or six second pose for a sculptor and a painter (he switches the direction of his head for both). An inventor of a new bullet proof jacket offers a pistol to Hynkel to shoot him with to test it. Hynkel does just that, only to kill the man - which he just shrugs off.It's a film full of delights, even with those horrendous shadows from the monster across the ocean in our minds. Only the handling of the concentration camps is less than desirable. Instead of real torture and horrible murder being shown, the camps are shown as places where the prisoners kick each other by forced marches in close order while goose stepping. Chaplin later said that had he known what horrors were in the camps he would not have made the film.Paulette Goddard is the love interest, a spirited Jew who is shown fighting off two storm trooper thugs in one scene. Daniell is perfectly aloof as always, feeding his bosses's ego in that memorable floating balloon globe scene. Billy Gilbert is a Goering clone, Field Marshall Bismarck Herring, whose bulk is used in some scenes against Hynkel. Gardiner is Hynkel's aide, who eventually turns on him. And best is Jack Oakie, who is perfect as Napoleoni, the rival dictator (and Mussolini clone), who keeps besting Hynkel in oneupmanship (I suspect that Chaplin did not like Mussolini, but in 1939 - 1940 the Fascist leader looked more tolerable to most people, prior to his fully joining the war as Hitler's ally).

Alien Resurrection probably looked good on paper Get a good European director with great credentials (the guy who did City Of Lost Children) who might bring a fresh sensibility to the franchise and take it in a new direction; get Sigourney Weaver to reprise her role as Ripley; get some excellent character actors to back her up (Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman and Micheal Wincott are always interesting to watch no matter what they are doing), and give the characters lots of snark and dry gallows humor to keep the viewer happy between action scenes. But somehow the whole came out less than the sum of its parts I've watched this movie on cable a few times in the last few years, trying figure what went wrong. My conclusion I think what screws things up is the pacing, the inability of the screenplay that to live up to the idea of a centuries long time lapse, and the portrayal of both the evil Corporation and the military as dim-witted, fumble fingered clods. Two whole centuries have supposedly passed since the last Alien, but apparently the only advances in technology since that movie have been in cloning. (Compare the differences in military technology and air travel between 1797 and 1997). That's a plain failure of imagination. And the Corporation scientists work for 200 years to be able to recreate Ripley and her alien egg, but once they have the aliens they are able to hold them for less than 24 hours before their security measure fail and the aliens infest the ship. That's a failure of respect for the shadowy figures who've been driving this plot's backstory for 20 years. And meanwhile the military has apparently degenerated from hard-core veteran Colonial Marines to a a bunch of wimps who can't handle a bunch of free lance traders on their home ground - and who cut and run the instant there is a problem on their space station. This is completely unlike Alien 1,2 and 3 where the Corporation goons are ruthless and powerful and oppressive in its power, and the military personnel are hard-nosed and ruthless xeno-killers who are simply outmatched. That's a failure of nerve, to have to portray the bad guys and soldiers as simps and wimps. IMO. these failures drain the movie of most of its potential gravitas. Instead of being horrified and angered by the sheer ruthlessness and sliminess of the suits who throw away the human lives for a buck, or dismayed and frightened by the way tough veterans of dozens of campaigns were summarily dispatched, I was angered and irritated by their stupidity and thoughtlessness. In the movie's favor the rag-tag crew of the Betty are fun to watch in action, and I think the screenwriter is at his best portraying their interaction with each other and Ripley, both before and after the crisis breaks out. Winona Ryder is (surprisingly) the least interesting actor here (not entirely her fault, given the nature of the character), but it was good to see her on-screen again, even in a place holder role like this one. The other problem is the visuals. The movie looked pretty good, but it just didn't have the punch and grandeur of the previous installments; it's as if the scale was simply too small. (Although Alien was pretty claustrophobic in spots, the Nostromo seemed to go on for miles). Even though I didn't care for Fincher's oppressive visuals on Alien 3, they were at least as striking and memorable as Scott and Cameron's visions in 1 and 2...but visually, AR is just another science fiction movie. At some point during the making of AR, I am sure that the director and the producer knew that they had lost the chance to make a great movie in the labyrinth of collaboration and production choices that every movie entails. So they went ahead and put out a flawed one and hoped that no one would notice. Well, everyone noticed, and I'm pretty sure that there won't be another Alien. It's probably just as well.
