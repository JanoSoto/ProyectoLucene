You've Got Mail has the charm and the humour evident in the performances and chemistry of the actors, however it just lacks the wit of Sleepless in Seattle. Both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan give excellent performances, and their chemistry is believable. The supporting performances from Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton and Parker Posey are also impressive, if careful not to overshadow the two leads. The music is lovely, and the backgrounds of New York are especially nice to look at. The direction is good, if lacking the extra bit of sparkle that was used in Seattle, and sometimes the script and story is a tad underdeveloped. But as a romantic comedy, I really liked it, it is very sweet and good natured and it makes me feel good. So I will give it a 7.5\/10.

While slightly inferior, the sequel BabePig in the City is very entertaining but noticeably darker, with some suitably heart-warming moments and really stunning visual design and cinematography(some of the best of its year actually for me). Yes, it's not perfect, but it is one of the better sequels to anything I've seen. The main merit would have to be the animals, the adorable Babe, the chimpanzees, the singing cats and my favourite the mice who stole every scene they were in. I also really liked Ferdinand, but if anything I wish he was in more of the film. The lip movements are excellent, and the animals are well voiced by the likes of EG.Daily, Miriam Margoyles, Hugo Heaving and James Cosmo. However, the human characters weren't quite as impressive- Mickey Roony is given very little to do and James Cromwell doesn't quite have the warmth he brought to the first film. The most impressive was Magda Szubanski, and some of the most priceless scenes of the film was with her. I liked the story, and the script in general, but what I liked most aside from the animals was the music, with Organ Symphony, Il Trovatore(there was a time when I didn't like the Anvil Chorus very much, but it's growing on me) and Non Je Ne Regrette Rien, where can you go wrong?

The Muppets are great as usual, Jim Henson especially as Kermit. It was such a shame that he died, he was such a talented man, though Steve Whitmire is a very good replacement in the later Muppet films. Great to see Sam the Eagle, Fozzie, Wrolf and Rizzo. Out of the human cast, Charles Grodin and Diana Rigg are very good, Grodin with his charm and Rigg with her frostiness, though if anything I wish the two stars had more screen time. Not to mention the amusing cameos from John Cleese and Peter Ustinov. The songs were very pleasant, perhaps not as memorable as ones in other Muppet films but First Time It Happens is one of my all time favourite Muppet songs, and there are some clever jokes about British eccentricity and what have you. My favourite Muppet and the the best aspect of the film, or for me anyway, was the always wonderful Miss Piggy, who delighted in every scene she was in.

I never watch the show when it is on, yet I own the first two seasons on DVD. I find the show funny, but never watch it consistently enough to get the jokes that my friends make when they refer to an episode. I've never seen the film until now too. I get the appeal it has, but I just never really got into it.The film, as is with any film adaptation from a TV show plays out like a longer episode from the series. This time there is a war against CANADA because of a film that contains foul language. Why a war? Well, the kids are swearing. That is it. The film is basically Matt Stone and Trey Parker's thoughts on the current state of censorship with the MPAA and the films they rate.For a cartoon, yes it has a wide variety of curse words, which are spoken by kids in grade school. There is violence, blood and guts grace the screen in a hospital (with cameo voice acting from George Clooney) and the final war scene between Canada and the States. There is also a bit of nudity, which is their version of heaven.I laughed more at the subtle humour then the in your face bits. I didn't find myself laughing at the language they use which is one of the main draws (damn those young teenage boys who like swear words). There is a smart film here, but when you listen to it, it sounds like it was written to two 15 year old boys who think every bad word is funny.Did I forget to mention it is a musical? The musical numbers are nice and sometimes funny. Hell, one earned an Oscar nomination. Sometimes the humour in the film is so random that it's funny, like a Skeet Ulrich poster above Satan's bed. I don't know who would think up of something like that, but it works.If you're a fan of the show, this film will appeal to you. If not, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

It fully depends on what you like, and don't forget it's an animated movie. I first watched this movie about 8 years ago (I'm still pretty young). Back then I couldn't review it, but after seeing it again, I think I can.It surprises me how well this is animated. Seriously, it was almost scary how detailed it was. Almost every move had a different detail, like when Omnimon was fighting Diaboromon. Maybe that's a bad example, but I couldn't think of others. Although I must admit the graphics self were a bit simplified, like the shading, the animation totally made up for it.As for the soundtracks, they were quite the same as the music from season 1 and 2, well, mostly season 2. There may be one or two tracks who were new, but I can't recall. At least the music was good and it all fit well together.Alright, now for the movie itself (yup, I'm not done), and I mean the script and stuff. Man, that's really hard. The main reason is that it's quite different from the original series. Not that the story has changed, maybe slightly, but it's a lot more dramatic then you expect from a regular Digimon episode. The fights had a lot more action in it, and were much more scarier. If I was a little kid, I could actually get nightmares from it. The sound effects also play a big role, because they sound a lot more destructive. But what really makes it awesome, as I call it, are the virus-kind Digimon, like Diaboromon.Man, those guys are scary. Those eyes, bodies, colors... Everything on them is freakin' weird. But that's what makes it so cool. It's the horror in the monsters what makes it so cool to watch. The hell with nightmares, as long as I can watch this movie!. Not that I would say that of course if I was like 7 or 8.There are some other points like the length that surprised me. The movie is 88 minutes long, which means (duh) it's 1 hour and 28 minutes long. That doesn't sound like much, but believe me, it is. It's mostly because there's always something going on. Humor or action, it doesn't matter. By the way, most animated movies are as long as that, but most of them have those stupid unnecessary scenes in them. I won't give any examples.Okay, some flaws are in this movie, I will sum the stuff up -The drawings are a bit simplified. -The endings a bit cut-off and strange -The story went a bit off, there were some things not mentioned in the series who were mentioned in the movie only, which makes the story a bit twisted, but still nice.And some good things -Kickass animation! -Nice storyline -Dramatic awesome fighting scenes. -Lots of humoristic parts.I think that's all I need to say about this movie. It's fun if you like anime, but even if you don't, give it a try. I'm not a real Digimon fan, but I just love anime.PS My personal downside is the fact that they're using a Windows rip- off, and even mention Bill Gates! As an Apple-fan, I don't really like that.

Imitations add these traits in abundance, which makes The Asphalt Jungle seem lacking, in hindsight. What you're left with is pretty much like the reverse of the reality drama done documentary style.Sterling Hayden (as Dix Handley), Louis Calhern (as Alonzo D.

A simple quiet scene between Mother and Son, with Aronofsky actually letting his cast do something that resembles a dramatic scene, but either side of it are just 100 minutes of untrained focus.

They get this trucker and play with them. They later check into the motel and the trucker comes back on the CB. They tell the trucker to meet 'her' in room 17, of course they have no intention of being there. They are in room 18. The next day they find out the guy staying in room 17 had his JAW ripped off and later dies. The crazy trucker then stalks them.That is the film in a nutshell, but the reason why I like it so much is because it sets itself apart from most Teen\/Horror\/Thriller films, because it has a competent director behind the lens. Yes, a Paul Walker film is good and guess what, HELL has not frozen over.This is an on the edge of your seat thrill ride that has some brains. Walker, plays his usual self (does this guy ever have any range?) Zahn plays his usual comedy buddy guy (does this guy have any range?) Leelee Sobieski plays the usual girl in distress role here (does she have any range?) Yet for me, I never got bored with them. Even though their characters and their acting are so routine, I surprisingly enjoyed them. Call it the writing, call it chemistry, call it whatever you want, they worked well together in this film. Zahn needs to stick to what he knows (comedic relief in supporting buddy role) NOT, COMEDY LEAD (National Security, Strange Wilderness)Dahl did a great job with this film. I enjoyed his other film Rounder as well, which leaves me to wonder why this guy isn't directing more films. J.J. Abrams is one of the writers, maybe that is a reason why this film feels different. It doesn't have that cookie cutter routine genre feel to it. J.J. Abrams is the type of guy who would bring something fresh a new to the table full of tired and old.Great use of colours in this film, the ominous red from the trunk and the eerie green at the motel. Accompanied with a good score and great thrills and chills. Of course, it's all about Ted Levine as the voice of Rusty Nails, the trucker. Just the right amount of eeriness that is disturbing. He sent chills down my spine. He was a great choice for this part. The choice to never see his face was great, but eventually lead to the DVD released sequel (yawn).Joy Ride gets a thumbs up from me.

Is Batman & Robin really so bad that it makes me want to disregard the rest of his films? He's not a bad director, hell I enjoy some of his work, yet I still cringe when I hear his name. Let's take a look at 8MM, something that is the polar opposite of B&R.It stars Nic Cage as a private investigator, hired to find out if the content on an 8MM tape found in a safe of a recently deceased millionaire is real. The tape is referred to as a snuff film, which is a pornographic film that ends with the murder of the female. So, already we have ourselves a pretty dark and disturbing film here. Yet, as I watched it I felt that is played it a little too safe.Upon research you will find out the writer and the director had a falling out over the film. The studio wanted it to be a bit lighter, and the director agreed. While the writer, who also wrote Se7en, wanted to keep the gritty disturbing feel he had originally wrote. The final product is a film that tries to be more hardcore then it actually is.Nic Cage really seemed to be playing by the numbers here. He is more monotone then usual I thought and didn't really seem invested in his character. Joaquin Phoenix on the other hand immerses himself into this world. Playing the sidekick who is smarter then he looks. The supporting cast also includes James Gandolfini, doing what he does best and Peter Stormare. Both stretch out beyond the page and embody their characters. With Gandolfini, we've seen him do this character before. But with every performance there is just one little thing that makes them all seem different every time.I was really underwhelmed with this flick. It was a bit longer then it needed to be, just over 2 hours. You go along for the investigative ride and are interested with the story, but at the end you just feel empty.

The ingredients were there to make a really good film, but the final product falls a bit flat. It's a rental, or if you are really a big fan of anyone involved .

It is one hundred times better and actually means something to the story, not just used for artistic flash. Not saying that that is a bad thing. I just think that the use of something as artistic as that that can drive a story is much more interesting that having it in there because it looks 'cool'.Even though it is billed as a comedy, I found it to be much more dramatic and more important that what people give it credit for.

If it were real people living real ordinary lives with zero flash? Unbreakable asks this questions to the viewers.The film is incredibly well shot and shows patience. I really enjoyed Shyamalan using alternate ways to show basic conversations. Like at the beginning when Willis is talking to the sports agent and we never leave the seats in front of them, or when we are with the second survivor before he dies the whole time Willis is talking to the doctor. These little things break the ordinary mold of a simple conversation and adds some interesting elements to keep our attention.Shyamalan, who also writes the films he directs, shows us that he's a talented guy. He knows what stories to craft and how to tell them, sometimes they are a hit, sometimes they are a miss. Then you have his big misses, but I give the guy credit for trying something different each time. From ghosts, to aliens and unknown forces. Kudos to the guy for trying to dive into different genres.Unbreakable is never thrilling, nor edge of your seat entertainment, it's never meant to be either. There are some intense moments though, specifically when his son thinks shooting him will prove he's a superhero. Well written, directed and acted on everyone's part.I liked the film, but felt it lacked to really grab me. It just seemed to be a well done film and nothing more, nothing to want me to explore this world or the people in it. It has a lot going for it too, the cast is great, the writing is superb and it has layers that the viewers peels away at, to get to that ultimate reveal.

Yes, it's a shame, but I have only seen snippets of his others films, like Rear Window and Psycho to name a few.Here is Rope a film about two men who murder someone and hide the body within the house. To make things interesting they hold a dinner party, the guests being friends and family of the victim, just to see if they can get away with murder. When I first heard this set-up, I was immediately interested and hearing praise for Hitchcock but never really seeing a full film from him I did not really know what to expect.I HATED IT!!!!! Just kidding, I really enjoyed Rope. What initially stuck out to me was the long takes Hitchcock used. The film plays out in real time and uses very little cuts, which both work well and kind of hurt the film. For those of you who grew up in the 90's and are use to the Michael Bay\/MTV style of cutting every 3 seconds, you may find yourself bored to death here. Also the entire film takes place in one room, some may be confined and not comfortable. I found myself more interested in the story and how it was being told. Dollying into the backs of the characters and back out again to 'cover' the edits was interesting, yet a tad overused.I really enjoyed Stewart's performance as the curious professor who questions the intentions of the party. Every little bit of tension in the film word well, the rope tying the books together, the maid putting the books where the body is hidden. All are suspenseful and work well for the film. All these scenes play well into Stewart's inquisitive notions throughout the film.I found myself liking Brandon more then Phillip. Brandon was more confident and sly, whereas Phillip, in his nervous and child-like ways got on my nerves. I kind of wanted them to get away with it at some points, but then Phillip would speak and I would want them to get caught again.I don't really hear much about this film when people talk about Hitchcock. It's more about his more 'popular' films, like Psycho, Rear Window and the Birds. I don't know why, but I think Rope is indeed an extremely well made film.

Can't Hardly Wait is suppose to be my generation party film, I think, but I feel more connected to Dazed and Confused then any other. Probably because Linklater is dedicated to his craft and isn't looking to cash in on a certain craze. I can honestly say this is his best film.It boasts an young cast of early talent, like Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, Adam Goldberg, Rory Cochrane, Milla Jovovich, and so on. I think it's great to see all of today's actors in a film like this, just having a good time.The film has a great soundtrack that embodies that time era, as it should. Dazed and Confused is a film that I can enjoy no matter what mood I'm in. So many teen high school films these days are moronic and try way too hard to be funny to immature kids.

Gibson's portrait is more of a twenty-first century graphic novel's character approach to justice than Marvin's 1967 nod to cool spy culture and a bad-ass anti-hero's approach to injustice.The author\/director clearly worked this story until it was a lean, mean fighting machine, ruthlessly taking out what didn't serve the story so that the overall effect is amazing pacing and audience satisfaction by turns of curiosity and empathy with this anti-hero.

This one definitely is, no matter what you think about his personal biases, love life, etc.And although this film is not outwardly credited (as far as I can tell) with having inspired Guy Richie, you can clearly see that this film and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels are part and parcel of a similar vision of late nineties' heroism, combined with very clever cinematography, excellent direction and muscular storytelling.

It wasn't the first, but it was one of the first and one to start so many imitators that never really got the formula down right. Carpenter is a master at his craft and he doesn't always score, but I applaud him for what he does and I can say that I enjoy most of his work. Halloween is one of his finest.So what is scarier then William Shatner? How about William Shatner spray painted white. Honestly, I find this mask scarier and more menacing then any hockey mask or fencing mask (ha, I hate Urban Legends 2). They ruined it in the sequels, then got it right again with Zombie's vision, but here it was the first and best. I was surprised that his mask came off in the film and we saw his face underneath. I grew up in the 90's, so I always saw the masked killer, then have the reveal at the end. Never did I see the victim tear the mask off during a scuffle, I was taken back....and I liked it. That scene makes it seem more real. Well done.I guess since I grew up with the horror films being more in your face and graphic with the killings, I wasn't too impressed with the deaths in this film. Everything felt kind of slow to me, like the actors were taking it easy with each other in those scenes. Small nitpicks I have.With other killers, they all have their reasons. Krueger is getting revenge on the kids of the parents who killed him, Jason is getting revenge on the kids who let him drown and killed his mother, the killers in scream are all about revenge. Then we have Michael Myers, who is described as PURE EVIL, from the one man who probably knows him best, Loomis. Not Loomis from Scream, that was a homage for you young kids out there.Donald Pleasence's most notable role? Some would say so and I would agree. Also Jamie Lee Curtis pops up here and she is quite good. I never really cared for much of her stuff, but I took notice here, even if it was one of her first gigs. Although, yes, her screaming at the end in the closet can get on the nerves.Halloween is the horror film to watch on Halloween. It's almost a rule, ritual, given. I can't say much for the sequels, but the first is always the best.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the cover? Simple, yet badass.
