Bujold's gifts as an actress are showcased along with Irons; her range is dynamic as both victim and victimizer and she manages to deliver a complex sexual personality with penetrating ease.  It's a complicated film for adults, exquisitely stylized by a major filmmaking talent.  Doctor, you've cured me!
