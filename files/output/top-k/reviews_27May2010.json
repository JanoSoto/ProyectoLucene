Literally, not a one provoked any sort of emotion at all, and that really ripped most of the sensation out of any and all action scenes in the film. It also has some very slow points that really could have used some touching up.As odd as it sounds,the other half of my issue with the film is that the soundtrack is so jarring and unfitting it threw me right out of the film and left me incapable of taking it seriously. SCREECHING violins during action scenes were unbearable, and it only got worse as the film progressed. Really, it's THAT painful.

These are the ingredients of Léon The Professional, and they combine to make quite the tasty dish.This is definitely an action movie, but it's the non-action parts that make it so memorable. Most of them are between Léon and Mathilda. When he first passes her on the stairs with her cigarette and bruises, or when he takes her up on the roof overlooking Central Park for her first real lesson. Scenes like these add a real emotional gravity to the movie, which 75% of action flicks either don't even bother with, or give a half-hearted attempt at, at best. A lot of people may focus on only the violent or seemingly exploitative aspects of the film, but that means that they're missing out on something much deeper.As for flaws, Gary Oldman takes over-acting to a whole new level in this movie. Occasionally, that kind of thing is okay (or even a plus), but not here. This isn't The Fifth Element. He was too wacky to feel sinister or dangerous. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie that is worth adding to anyone's collection.

A historical expose? Fail. Plot? Fail. Acting? Hahaha.....Lame does not adequately describe this Hollywood trash. Comparing this movie to other movies of the same genre (eg. Young Guns) just insults the other movies. All of rave reviews here come across as if they are written by 12 year old girls, and even then it's a bit shocking for me to see them gushing and fawning over this poor excuse for a movie. It's hard to imagine how anyone with even a single brain cell kicking would find this trash to be enjoyable. This film receives one star from me because I can't give half-stars on IMDb.
