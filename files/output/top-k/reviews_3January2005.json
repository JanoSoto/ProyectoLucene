She is so natural and at ease in front of a camera. The chemistry between her and the boyfriend is the best you will ever see and that's why I watched this movie. I felt like I was eavesdropping in on two young teenagers throughout the whole movie. The story is very simple and just chronicles the life of these two high-schoolers who fall in love by pure chance (the romance is instigated by Dunst and she does a great job). I think everyone will be able to relate to the characters and story in this movie. These are real-life characters and they are not overly stereotyped which was surprising, as well. The leading actor did a fantastic job, too. There is zero shock value thrown into this movie to try and put you on the edge of your seat which is something you don't find in Hollywood movies and which was really nice. Mostly every scene involves Kirsten and her boyfriend and they pull it off. There aren't many actors that can say that they can do that. This movie is entertaining throughout and will keep your attention. Already I like Kirsten more than I ever liked Julia Roberts, Gwyneth Paltrow, Daryl Hannah, Winona Ryder, Chistine Ricci, Catherine Zeta Jones, Kate Winslet, Sharon Stone, or any of these younger female celebrities. The direction in this movie is very good. If you want a real nice relaxing evening and you don't want to watch something with a lot of hype, drama, violence, stereotypes, people pitting each other against one another, etc. then I recommend this movie. I will definitely look for more of Kirsten in the future.

The discovery of a tall black monolith, the use of a weapon and the sending of a signal see us jump into the future where a mission is being sent to the moon. The mission is in response to the discovery of an unnatural monolith that had been deliberately buried under the surface. When the monolith emits a high pitch signal we jump 18 months forward to a mission on its way to Jupiter. Drs Bowman and Poole lead, with the rest of the crew in hibernation and the ship under the control of a HAL-9000 series computer. Things are strange enough with the mysterious nature of the mission but an apparent error in HAL creates more immediate worries.If you will humour me for a moment I will state my interpretation of the plot before looking at the film. To me the set up is about evolution of man, here being either guided or monitored by an alien race for reasons we can only wonder about. Obviously the monoliths mark times where we have advanced to a point where we can go to the next step, with Bowman's eventual journey just being the next step in man's evolution. Now what HAL's malfunction has to do with this is beyond me, in fact I'd say that it is actually unrelated but is just a separate part of the same story. However this is not a problem because both parts of the story are full of interesting ideas and strands that more than fill what is, lets be honest, a rather slow and unnecessarily long film. The pace may infuriate modern, younger viewers who have come to this as one of the greatest sci-fi's ever made expecting it to be an Aliens or a Star Wars &#150; it isn't, it is cold, remote, slow and built on ideas more than action.The film does have several sections that could have been significantly trimmed or lost altogether and it is hard to see why some of them were there other than to fill out the running time (the bit about the rumour of infection on the moon could have been lost as we are told this much briefer in the meeting in the next scene; and the apes could have been shorter) and this is always a problem to me while those scenes are on. However, as an overall film it isn't a problem because the time does move surprisingly quickly considering how little happens at times &#150; and it does this because it is relentlessly interesting. The evolution thread is never fully answered and, for that reason, is interesting throughout even if some viewers will baulk at the idea of being left to make their own conclusions and not having it all neatly explained for them. This makes up the beginning and end of the film, but the middle 80 minutes have little to do with it and instead are more about a view of the dangers inherent in a cold future where computers are given too much trust, credit and responsibility. Looking back, this view has only become more and more relevant and is now such a part of sci-fi that it is so easy to forget how influential this film has been. It is never fully explained why HAL goes (to quote the President in Strangelove) a little funny but it works the better for us not knowing &#150; it feeds our mistrust of him as a computer because it could have been deliberate, accidental, pre-programmed or just his application of pure, cold logic to an situation that, because it involves humans, can never be seen in those terms. I won't ramble on, but it provides so much food for thought that it more than makes up for the very cold, stretched plot and running time.Although it is easy to pick holes in it from our CGI-enhanced world, the film still looks great and, more than that is actually imaginative &#150; something that CGI sometimes fails to be. Again there are probably too many long scenes of craft moving silently through space but generally they are interesting. The first cut form bone to ship to the Blue Danube is iconic and will be known even to those who have never seen the film; meanwhile the silence of space is well used. The Stargate scene is well known as a trippy scene but even straight it works and (despite being overlong and slightly dated) is imaginative and interesting. The cold mood continues with the direction as Kubrick uses a lot of very static shots to tell his story &#150; without the style and interest brought out by the movement it is WHAT he looks at rather than how and he manages to frame all manner of interesting shots within the ideas in the script. Performances are very much secondary in this cold film but Dullea is suitably restrained even if part of me wanted him to be more human in the face of HAL. Douglas Rain only provides a voice but comes out as the single most memorable actor in the film as he plays HAL with cold, logical and unmeaning menace. Outside of these two nobody else really shines as they are never the focus, although it always amuses me to see Rossiter in there! Overall this is deservedly regarded as a classic and must see film. It is not a perfect film as it is overlong, is not edited as tightly as it could have been and does sometimes focus on visuals while leaving us to work out the substance ourselves, but these are minor complaints as the film is filled with imagination both visually and idea-wise. Its status and reputation mean it is a must see for cinema fans, it is just as well then, that it is a brilliant and intelligent must see to boot.

He steals the entire movie (and so far the trilogy) with the so-called confession scene, which, imo, is the best piece of acting I've seen in a long time, a very long time. Compare that with his romantic scenes together with Natalie Portman, where he stumbles over words (maybe intentionally) and just acts awful, and you'll begin to understand my confusion.Which brings us to the very lovely Ms Portman, who is undoubtedly a great actress. She proved herself ten times over in Leon (The Professional), but just seems lost here. The biggest contribution she makes here is showing off her well-trained abdomen.

The most interesting sections are early on when the real human part of the story is told. In this section we see grief, acceptance, fear and the disposability of these new people. We also see the desire to be human in David and, although it is a theme we have seen many times in other films, it is one that is still interesting here. So far so good, and I was ready to dismiss the opinions of those that dislike this film, however then the film started a slight slide that would turn into a car crash. The story then becomes less about exploring the emotions of the characters and more about a Wizard of Oz\/Pinocchio style journey that is about the new world that this story is taking place in. It is interesting enough and looks great but it never really gets beyond superficial stuff and it never seems set in any sort of reality (something the first section had managed to do). However it still just about works and had a great ending where David sits at the bottom of the Ocean with the quality that makes him closest to humans &#150; hope.The problem is, the film doesn't end there. It jumps thousands of years into the future, brings in a war between robots and men, the fall of man, futuristic robots and cloning all for the sole reason of producing a horribly sentimental happy ending where an open one would have been much better. I'm not going to moan about how Kubrick would have made it much better (he made bad films too you know) but this ending is pure Spielberg and it is about as bad as I've seen his schmaltz get. It is a real shame because, for all its flaws, it had actually been OK up till this final section, even if it could have been darker and more interesting. The cast are more than up to the task if only the material had been better. Osment is great here and it is a real shame that he doesn't have more time to work into his character. Likewise O'Connor is interesting but ultimately just forgotten by the script. Law is OK but only a plot device; meanwhile support is passable but poorly used in the form of Hurt and Robards. Visually the film looks great; plenty of imagination in many forms &#150; be it the hellish red light district or the simple pleasures of Teddy, it is only a shame that the film never gives the brain as much to do as it does the eyes.Overall this is an OK film &#150; neither as good nor as bad as many people say. It starts out with plenty of interesting ideas but then shelves them for a bit of a Wizard of Oz story, that gradually brings the ideas back in with it. Sadly the film is dragged down a considerable way by a final twenty minutes that are unnecessary, sentimental and almost unwatchable.

They said it's a really good movie! And I second demotion! First, when it was during the Iran-Iraq war, Iran was really a bad place that time, well, obviously because of war, and that's what exactly they are describing here in this movie. Second, Sally Field is one of the best actresses of all times and she portrayed the role very well. She gave justice to the role she portrayed! And that's one of the reason to have a good movie result if it has best actors and actresses playing the role.Third, I'm sure those who commented bad about this movie are 1. Iranians of course who wants to justify that Iran is not that bad place. Again let me reiterate this, it was worst when there was an Iran-Iraq war comparing to now! The country Iran, is now fine, not bad but you can't say it's a heaven either. I've been there last year to attend the wedding of our boss who is an Iranian to an Iranian wife. My boss is pure Iranian but grew up in America, and he speaks like a real American, and now his wife joined him in the US and they are living together there. And it was by the way my boss who told me to look for this movie as he wanted me to watch this for such a long time now. He said it's a very sad movie and he never commented such racism or things like that as he is an educated person! So you see? Again, this is not just a story of an American woman who wants to be a heroin as this is AGAIN Betty Mahmoody's story that happened in a real life!2. People who has Iranian friends or lovers or husbands will surely oppose to this movie! Don't be bitter and don't get mad! This is not your story, this is the story of an American woman who was betrayed by the man she loves who happens to be an Iranian! You just have to feel the story and analyze before giving this such comments! My husband by the way is an Iranian but grew up in the UAE. And I didn't count it that way, as I was feeling the story and the actors\/actresses portraying the role are very good. A lot of true stories like this happening all over the world who's marriage is made of cross country culture, that isn't successful due to some obvious reasons, and it's sad though.I think that the movie is a very good movie.

It has everything that a movie-goer would love to see in a movie. A great script full of plenty of gross-out moments, shocking moments, humor, great lines, and parts that make a watcher think. The film does not treat the audience like a moron like so many recent films have the tendency to do. It leaves you on the edge of your seat and you have to have an IQ that is larger than your shoe size to fully understand it.Tarantino also use time as a plot driving device in the most effective way I have ever seen put to film. I guess you could say that the film is in flashback form, but the characters and the plot that you see in those flashbacks make you forget that it has already happened! Along with the monster performances that Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman put on the table (not to mention the small, well acted part Quentin Tarantino did himself) makes this movie a 5 out of 4 star movie and an instant classic.

Unfortunately, in the case of Donnie Darko, I now find myself to be one of those morons. Sorry, but I just didn't see in this film any of the stupendous achievement that most other viewers have found. I found the film neither highly original, profound, nor particularly intelligent (beyond a plot construction that the viewer must wrap his brain around).My lack of appreciation makes me ponder not what I've missed in the movie, but myself Have I lost it? Why don't I find Donnie Darko to be the ingenious gem that most others agree it to be? One theory I'm too old for this movie. Of the people I've known personally who've said they enjoy Donnie Darko, I realize that they all have been teens to twenty-somethings with a creative bent and perhaps who also possess a soupçon of general life-angst and who are, perhaps, like Donnie Darko himself, more intelligent than the people around them; young people who feel isolated because of their superior ability to doubt or challenge what others around them accept blindly. If that description fits you, then see Donnie Darko. Regarding that particular plot construction there have been movies somewhat similar (David Lynch's Lost Highway comes to mind), but not one that pushes the buttons of today's youth. So that's my assessment Donnie Darko is a film that creative, intellectually-superior-to-their-peers, mentally\/socially fettered youth can rally around as one that speaks to them. However, if you're a FORMERLY youthful, creative social misfit like myself, you'll probably not care too much for this film. You've already gone through your phase of attraction to science fictional phenomena of wormholes, time travel and evil-looking imaginary friends to assist you out of your teen-angsty life. We older creatives have already embraced and abandoned such phenomena; but now here they are, presented anew, for a new generation. Every generation of us needs such a film. Enjoy it, my younger brethren.** Spoiler ahead ** Extras on the DVD include extended and deleted scenes. Some of the deleted material puts a divine spin on the story, which I agree with the director (in optional Commentary) inclusion of which would be too revealing, too explanatory (and, being an atheist, would turn me off). Better to let events be of mysterious origin. Oh, and for the record, I found the Bunny Boy of the movie Gummo far more intriguing and symbolic than Frank in Donnie Darko.

The casting is horrible. I like Cary Elwes but he's a dramatic talent and not a funny man. I can see him as a serious Robin Hood in a serious movie. Here, however, he is simply not funny and his dignity never seems to break, also not good for a stupid humor movie. Amy Yasbeck also seems like a dramatic talent but, for whatever reason, she keeps getting stuck in comedy movies and comedy TV series. You can almost read her mind going, This material is so stupid. What am I doing here? Chris Rock would have been funnier in the role of Achoo. Dave Chappelle is considered very funny by many people but he's just dull in this. The Blazing Saddle element was attempted here but Chappelle does not have the life in him that Clevon Little had. Richard Lewis as Prince John and Roger Rees as the sheriff are the only two bits of good casting in the flick. Lewis is boring here and not nearly as nervous as the part called for, strange because he is what one thinks of to play a nervous comedian. The movie's lone bright spot is Rees as the sheriff of Rottingham. He is very funny in the part and gives it the ridiculous portrayal that a movie of this type needs. The guy who played Blinkin is a funny guy but, instead of a loving parody of blind humor, the movie comes off as being cruel. The rap stuff also isn't good. If you want to produce rap, go all the way and make it real, not lily white rap. There is also a part in the original script where Achoo launches into a gigantic anti-white tirade.

The casting is horrible. I like Cary Elwes but he's a dramatic talent and not a funny man. I can see him as a serious Robin Hood in a serious movie. Here, however, he is simply not funny and his dignity never seems to break, also not good for a stupid humor movie. Amy Yasbeck also seems like a dramatic talent but, for whatever reason, she keeps getting stuck in comedy movies and comedy TV series. You can almost read her mind going, This material is so stupid. What am I doing here? Chris Rock would have been funnier in the role of Achoo. Dave Chappelle is considered very funny by many people but he's just dull in this. The Blazing Saddle element was attempted here but Chappelle does not have the life in him that Clevon Little had. Richard Lewis as Prince John and Roger Rees as the sheriff are the only two bits of good casting in the flick. Lewis is boring here and not nearly as nervous as the part called for, strange because he is what one thinks of to play a nervous comedian. The movie's lone bright spot is Rees as the sheriff of Rottingham. He is very funny in the part and gives it the ridiculous portrayal that a movie of this type needs. The guy who played Blinkin is a funny guy but, instead of a loving parody of blind humor, the movie comes off as being cruel. The rap stuff also isn't good. If you want to produce rap, go all the way and make it real, not lily white rap. There is also a part in the original script where Achoo launches into a gigantic anti-white tirade.

The discussion about the destruction of the Death Stars in Star Wars was funny in a stoner kind of way, and there were other entertaining moments. But unfortunately there was also a lot of repartee that just wasn't very funny and served only to move the plot along in a fairly dull way.I can't see where the semi-legendary status of Jay and Silent Bob comes from, either. They had a couple of modestly interesting scenes, and that's it.Black and white? Please.Towards the end of the movie it took itself far too seriously. In one way it was effective I had an immediate urge to turn it off and do something useful. Was that the objective? Still, for some entertaining and off the wall moments, I give it a 6.

And the voices.. oh my God..they probably took some lessons on that one, you know Swayze has a very deep voice and what about Wesley.. I don't know how they solved the problem but they DID!;) Just..see the movie and you'll know.All in all.. three drag queens stuck in a small town trying to go to a very important drag queen meeting.. I really enjoyed the whole I am a strong man in a very tight dress wanting to be a DRAG QUEEN thing going on in the picture.

I recently rented it along with several other movies that fit that category and gave it a whirl. The results were at first confused, but then once I got used to the humor I loved it. This is a stupid comedy, it's not witty or smart like the kind you find in Pulp Fiction or Fargo, but it's a damn good stupid movie at that. I laughed my hardest at parts that just didn't fit the story. Just a random quirk Oederek had and wanted to put in for kicks. Aside from taking two old kung fu movies and doing them over, the film does have other neat niches that haven't been filled before. Such as the dialogue, example; you meet a character and expect him to say something funny or out of context, but the character instead responds with a logical thought that stupid and is said in a manner to make anyone laugh. The ending was a little disappointing but what can I complain? I got my copy for free.

I say those ewoks had very little to do with the creative genius of this movie.It was a masterpiece. It all came together perfectly and seamlessly. It even started off terrificly with Luke Skywalker showing off his full fledged Jedi skills. There is action, humor, action, honor, and more action... and the special effects... whew, light years ahead of its time. We were treated with two epic battles the inter-galactic battle between the federation and the rebel forces, and the smaller but equally important battle between Luke and the Emperor, Luke and his father, and Luke and the Dark Side. Luke was in a perilous struggle internally with his feelings. You could see as he was slowly being poisoned with anger, concern, and perhaps a bit of fear. The Emperor had a very grand plan in mind for Luke and the rebel forces. That plan was all coming to fruition except for the will power and intelligence of Luke and Han Solo. As a child Return of the Jedi was my absolute favorite bar none. Well, Since childhood The Empire Strikes Back has toppled it. I'm a little older now and being more knowledgeable, The Empire Strikes Back is a bit more intellectually appealing. Even still, Return of the Jedi ranks extremely high with me and always will.
