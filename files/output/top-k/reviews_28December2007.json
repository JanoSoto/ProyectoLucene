He wasn't being nearly as jovial as one might think; he must have felt that LTL was a sure-fire hit and that its failure would mean his status as a star had markedly fallen - hence a sort-of ultimatum live-on-air to his fans to spend their hard-earned money on a dumb elephant comedy. (The comedy being dumb, not the elephant...) Or maybe he simply realized during the shooting (or when he saw the final cut) what a turkey this was, so he tried desperately to convince everyone how much optimism he had regarding LTL's quality.

Actors are prostitutes inter-bred with car salesmen.LTL is the sort of lousy project that comes from the Friends school of comedy; their motto If you ever run out of ideas - or if you never had any in the first place - then stick an animal into the plot and that will at least inject an element of cuteness. Cuteness = a sad substitute for lack of funny gags. The other motto Friends had was always include pointless, dull sentimentality, which this movie so predictably ends with, when Murray rather pathetically says what they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant.

The readers have no time. Just tell them simply what was good and what wasn't. And in one word after.. Did you love it or not?. Of course at the time I've seen that his very opinion was the real thing to not love ! But as the time goes bye I learned carefully that it's the law of journalism after all. So based on the above, here is my review  I loved  the fact that (Woody Allen) struggles to make his own movies by his own way, not to be a Hollywood bitch (sorry !). How his surviving movies are always grounded on one brilliant idea, so talented dialogue with catchy phrases, and some vision to some issues. I loved all the stars being in his movies doing whatever just to be in a (Woody Allen) film. His love and sincerity for the old American cinema or music. His cleverness when it comes to be sarcastic about the American culture, policy, and society. His wonderful studying for the character of the middle class intellectual man. And above all his wonderful ability to create continuously and his unwavering will of making movies whatever what.I hated  his invariability as an actor; whereas the man directs himself all along for years and years (That's bad if you ask me !) so his performance became quite tasteless as he aged.

For me today in its afterglow it is.I'm so fickle. I think if all else were equal, I'll always take embodied, real cinema that is coherently integrated. The way of telling the story is ideally complex and folded, using tricks to make the story matter. But if the storytelling is less spectacular, as long as the thing engages, that's what matters. If it changes me, its art and important, regardless of whether I can tell a good story about the storytelling.That's the way I prefer. But sometimes the storytelling is so spectacular, so engaging in itself, that it doesn't matter what the story is. These are rare, because after all, you need the touch to change your life. So a filmmaker as unsophisticated and unattractive as, say Elia Kazan, can modify my existence when partnered with Williams and Brando.And this story... what is conveyed here is mostly lies. Or rather it is a target story that is transparently bankrupt. Its based on an embodied reality of sorts. But its a twisted vision. The racism is palpable. The superiority of the European eye and mind are overwhelming. The simple notion of good and evil is less nuanced than in Star Wars or its predecendent westerns, and is intolerable. (This may be simply because history advises that both the Soviet and Cuban experiments were more brutal than what they replaced.)But what cinema! What life! Just inhabiting this world has adjusted my imagination and dreams. The focus is usually on the extraordinary flying camera, because its so obvious, striking. It is, and if it were just that, I would still get you out of bed and across town to see this. But the flying eye is integrated with an architectural expression that is far deeper. The actors and camera move through buildings, fire, smoke, cane, trees, exploding dirt. This is as amazing the first time, just in wondering how they did it. Knowing the technology used, it seems impossible, and that knowledge actually distracts. You have to see this several times to just get past the wonder at the talking dog.Then you can get into the visual poetry of thing. It isn't about people at all. They matter not at all except as fodder for ennobling posters. What matters is the structure of the forces that surround and channel them here and there like turbulent banks. This is a project centered on those forces, incarnated as spatial forces. Where in another project you wonder how a dog can be so dramatic, here you wonder how the director was able to control fire and smoke to be so perfectly compliant. Its not embodied in the story, which is daft, but in the real world that contains it.This is absolutely in the spirit of Tarkovsky, and is the only film I know that betters him visually. Its less human, but oh so spatial. You must, must see it.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.

However an attempt is made on Marks life on the plane which forces it to crash land, Mark manages to escape in the confusion.

The script by John Pogue is a bit too long & rather convoluted for my liking. The story is a bit of a mess as it deals with various things like conspiracies, selling Government secrets, people being set-up, cover ups & some predictable twists, the story never really flows as well as one would hope with little bits of information given every so often which never really come together that well. I never sat there & after a plot twist was surprised or never thought to myself that makes logical sense. The bitty storyline just isn't as clear, forward moving or purposeful as it should be, one good example of this is the revelation of what happened in the parking lot when Mark was supposed to have killed two agents as the entire scene is played out on various grainy black and white security cameras with a running commentary from Gerard & it's just a very confused scene as it's hard to make out who is who & what exactly is going on. The character's are alright but nothing special, there's your typical obnoxious high ranking Government officials, there's the good old fashion hero, the anti-hero & the annoying comedy relief.Director Baird does OK but for an action thriller I thought there was a major lack of action, OK there's an impressive plane crash, a couple of shoot-outs & a few fights & chase scenes but nothing I would call particularly memorable or original. I definitely expected more action & a better story. It's also a very long film, at well over two hours you could find your patience wearing very thin by the time the end credits start to roll. The violence is minimal as is the action.With a supposed budget of about $60,000,000 this was a well funded film & apart from the plane crash I can't really see where all that money went although apparently Tommy Lee Jones was paid $10,000,000 of it. The location filming in New York & Chicago was also probably pretty expensive. The acting is OK & Jones is good, Snipes is alright & Joe Pantoliano is just annoying.US Marshals isn't as good as The Fugitive in my opinion, to be honest I think it's a rather confused thriller that isn't thrilling & the lack of big scale action set-pieces is very disappointing. One good plane crash just isn't enough for over two hours worth of investment.

Roger Ebert gave the 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying that he did enjoy the film but that some scenes were lacking, such as the ending.Siskel missed the point. The chill from The Silence of the Lambs doesn't come from revolutionary originality, which it doesn't have. The chill of The Silence of the Lambs is in how it maximizes fear and suspense in a plot that one could simply describe as police on the hunt for a serial killer. It is here where The Silence of the Lambs set the bar; it takes a B-movie concept and raises it to the level of a taut A-level thriller.The plot has the FBI on the hunt for a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill (played by Ted Levine). Stuck, the lead investigator (played by Scott Glenn) wants to get the perspective of another serial killer, to try and see inside the psychotic mind. He recruits the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) to talk to the brilliant and cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins). Lecter agrees to help Starling, but only if she will grant him the sadistic pleasure of allowing him to see inside her mind.Even though the plot is about Buffalo Bill, with Lecter only having 16 minutes on screen in a 2-hour movie, Lecter and Starling are way more interesting and end up being the driving force for the film. In many films, an excellent performance by the villain can steal the show away from the hero. (Tim Burton's Batman, featuring a brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson as The Joker, is a prime example of this.) In The Silence of the Lambs, we have strong performances by both of the lead actors. Hopkins' Lecter is clearly everybody's favorite character, but Foster's performance as Starling is powerful enough to not get eclipsed by Hopkins.Not getting eclipsed is something of a theme for this film. Our heroine is not trying to be heroic. Starling is strong and courageous and could kick anyone's butt, and yet she comes across as vulnerable. She is a woman in a man's world and everywhere she goes, there is a sense of being dominated. She is 5'3 in a film where most other characters are over 6' tall. (The camera often skillfully has Starling occupying only the lower half of the frame; seeing so much space above her head makes her look shorter and more vulnerable.) Her black hair (which is different from Foster's natural light brown) makes her appear paler than she really is. Other characters are always hitting on her. She always whispers and is always giving a nervous smile. Even her slight Southern accent gives her a country girl appeal that helps the audience identify with her. Starling is an FBI agent-in-training and is clearly quite skilled at handling dangerous situations, but she still shares our vulnerabilities. As a result of this, her fears are our fears. This is the true skill of Jodie Foster's performance; she manages to play Starling as a woman of great strength and vulnerability at once.Credit should also go to the film-makers. One strong point is their choice to only be selectively gruesome. This is one key difference between The Silence of the Lambs and garden-variety serial killer movies. The latter often derive their scares by showing incredibly brutal images and portraying utterly disgusting scenarios. Fear is generated by the audience's own horrified reaction to what is being shown on screen. The Silence of the Lambs does not give in to that temptation though. It casually shows us several rather gruesome images to get us nervous, but then keeps some of the most disturbing stuff cleverly off-camera. Of course, this serves to only make them scarier; what could be so gruesome that not even this creepy film is willing to show it on camera? I do have criticisms. My main complaint is that Buffalo Bill is a lightweight who left me longing for the much more interesting and menacing Hannibal Lecter. Buffalo Bill is sick, twisted, and downright nauseating, but he also is a coward, who has to resort to trickery and gadgetry to make himself formidable. Lecter, on the other hand, has all the tools he needs right there in his brain. He is the smartest character in the film and he knows it and he loves it. He is so charismatic that he can enter the mind of anyone, no matter how hard they resist. This makes Lecter scary even when he is off-camera. Buffalo Bill is not really all that scary even when he's on camera; he's more just plain gross.The thrill of this movie is psychological. We don't feel thrilled because of cool action sequences or original plot ideas but rather because of the fear that we can relate to and the mind games that Lecter plays. Something of a void is left in scenes in the latter half of the film, where Lecter is absent. (Here, I agree with Ebert.) Nonetheless, Foster's performance makes up for that. Even in the final showdown with Buffalo Bill, the thrill is still there because we feel Starling's fear, even though the audience has not been particularly scared of Buffalo Bill up until now. (Here, I disagree with Ebert, who feels the showdown is lacking.) The Silence of the Lambs is thrilling and chilling. The main villain is a lightweight, but the secondary villain is among the most menacing and evil in cinema history. I think that after we walk away from this film, we somehow are left with the feeling that, at least for those 2 hours, Hannibal Lecter managed to get inside our own minds as well.

Whether an incident were to be filmed from a story and its screenplay form written directly for the screen or an adaptation of a Novel, a Short Story or a Stage Play, they are an important element of formulating our image of our World. Right or wrong, it is a fact of life and one that we must learn to live with.A good example of just what we are driving at is the occurrences of October 26, 1881 in Tombstone, Arizona. Known as The Gunfight at O.K. Corral, the incident is probably the best known single shoot-em-up incident in the History of the Old West. Countless references are made to it in our Western Movies, be they Major Motion Pictures or the B Picture Series of the Matinée & Bubble Gum Set.Equally as familiar to the movie going public and probably the best known example of Urban Gangster violence of the 'Lawless Prohibition\/Gangster Era, The St.Valentine's Day Massacre has been given Film treatment many times. It is featured in the Rod Steiger's Starring Title Role as AL CAPONE (Allied Artists, 1959).Director Roger Corman gave us THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE (Los Altos Productions \/ 20th Century-Fox, 1967); devoting the entire 100 minutes of screen time to the behind the scenes incidents leading up to it and to the Great Mass Murder.With Ben Gazzara in the title role, we had CAPONE (Santa Fe Productions\/ 20th Century-Fox, 1975), also which had the Massacre and its preparation and aftermath as central events in the story.With the dramatic come the comedies, spoofs, comedians, the social commentators and the satirists. There surely would be a comedy that would at least make mention of the Massacre in passing.And it happened. Producer\/co-Writer\/Director Billy Wilder gave us SOME LIKE IT HOT (Ashton Prod.\/Mirisch Corp.-United Artists, 1959). To a hilariously great script, Directot Wilder added plenty of Hollywood Star Power in Miss Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Tony Curtis and Mr. Jack Lemmon. In supporting position, we saw the likes of veteran, old pros like Joe E. Brown (as Millionaire Osgood Fielding III), George Raft (as 'Spats' Colombo), Pat O'Brien (as Detective Mulligan), Nehimiah Persoff (as Little Boneparte), Joan Shawlee (Sweet Sue), Billy Gray (Sig Pokikoff), George E. Stone (Toothpick Charley), Mike Mazurki (Spats' Henchman), Dave Barry (Beinstock), Harry Wilson (Spats Henchman), Beverly Wills (Delores), Barbara Drew (Nellie), Edward G. Robinson, Jr. (Johnny Paradise), Al Brenamen (Bell Hop), Pat Comiskey (Spats' Henchman), Tom Kennedy (Bouncer), Paul Frees (Funeral Director Mozerella & Josephine-Voices), Joe Gray (Mobster at Banquet), Harold 'Tommy' Hart (Official #2), Ted Hook (Official #1), John Indisano (Waiter), Jack McClure (Spats Henchman), Helen Perry (Rosella) and Marian Collier (Clarinet Player, Olga) and Joan Fields, Mary Foley, Penny McGuiggin, Laura Mitchell, Colleen O'Sullivan (Band Members All).OUR STORY&#133;&#133;&#133;In a nutshell, its 1929, Prohibition is in full swing in a defiant Chicago. Two struggling and apparently over-sexed Musicians, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) narrowly missed being arrested in a Police Raid on a Speak Easy run by big time Hoodlum, 'Spats' Columbo (George Raft). Obtaining a 'Gig' to play t the University of Illinois Dance in Champaign-Urbana, over 100 miles to the South of Chicago. Borrowing a Car from a Girlfriend of Joe's, they have the Bad Luck of being present at the Clark Street Garage when the mass killings take place.In order to escape being snuffed-out for witnessing the deed, the two masquerade as Women and join up with A Band made up of all Lady Musicians and (Woo, woo, woo, woo!)

I won't try and justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the 'art house cinema' I have liked or mentioning how I gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10\/10. All I ask is that someone explain to me the point, purpose and message of this film.Here is how I would summarize the film Opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co-incidence.

Lillies of the Field might have won a few more Oscars if it wasn't for Tom Jones in the race.Sidney Poitier plays Homer Smith, ex-GI whose truck breaks down at a convent in the Arizona desert. It's populated with a small group of German speaking nuns to whose order was left this property. The group is headed by Lilia Skala who's not going to let the fact she doesn't speak English deter her from building up the place. Starting with a chapel.It seems like the Almighty has answered her prayers when she finds out Poitier has a construction background. The sister is convinced God is on her side and even without the Deity, she's pretty formidable all by herself. The rest of the story is their effort to make it happen.I guess the closest example to this film I can come up with is Marty, another story without any real stars in it, shot on a shoestring budget that got to be Best Picture and win for Ernest Borgnine an Oscar for Best Actor and stardom. Lillies of the Field was up for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Lilla Skala and a few other categories. But it came home with one winner, Best Actor for Sidney Poitier the first black person to win in that category.I don't think it would detract one bit from Poitier's achievement to say that the Civil Rights Revolution at its crest in 1964 might have just put Poitier over the top. His competition that year was Rex Harrison for Cleopatra, Paul Newman for Hud, Richard Harris for This Sporting Life and Albert Finney for Tom Jones. Tom Jones won a host of Oscars that year including Best Picture, but in 1964 in the wake of the Kennedy assassination and the news of the atrocities done to civil rights workers and the mounting pressure to pass the Civil Rights Act, Hollywood was casting its own voice of support in naming Sidney Poitier as Best Actor. As you can see Sidney Poitier faced some stiff competition in the category, I certainly wouldn't want to say he was better than Albert Finney or Paul Newman who got rave reviews for their performances.Sidney Poitier was something special in Lillies of the Field. As his character Homer Smith says he's a camp meeting Baptist from the south. And the highlight of the film is him teaching the nuns to sing that Baptist camp meeting song, Amen. That was about brother and sisterhood and peoples of all kinds working together and respecting each other in their differences.And for that reason, because that message is so vital today, the Academy voters gave Sidney Poitier a well deserved Oscar for delivering that message in an under-financed, but very beautiful film.
