[{"date":"21 February 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Elizabeth is a fantastic film. Historically accurate, no, but a fantastic piece of filmmaking nonetheless.  Cate Blanchett is amazing as Elizabeth Tudor, as is Geoffrey Rush as Walsingham. Several scenes sent chills down my spine, especially when Elizabeth is told that she is Queen, and when Mary of Guise sends a message back to Elizabeth from a Scottish battlefield.  One of the few films I've seen that deserves their awards nominations. If it's playing in your area, do yourself a favor and see it.
