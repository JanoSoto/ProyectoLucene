The movie was criticized of being too dark, too serious and not having Sean Connery. So the producers thought that the best thing to do would be to make the next Bond movie more in tone with Goldfinger.The movie does start rather seriously, with James Bond mercilessly hunting down and, seemingly, killing his archenemy Blofeld. After the great intro though, the movie just kind of pretends On Her Majesty's Secret Service never happened and goes to a completely different direction. Bond is assigned to investigate diamond smuggling from Africa to Europe and ultimately to USA. Bond pretends to be a smuggler and teams up with Tiffany Case to smuggle diamonds from Amsterdam to Las Vegas. There he finds Blofeld to not only be alive but also using the diamonds for his new sinister plan.Diamonds Are Forever really wants to be another Goldfinger. It has the director of Goldfinger, Guy Hamilton, back and Shirley Bassey is again singing the main theme. Again Bond is investigating smuggling only to learn villain is planning something worse, and again the main Bond girl is a bad girl with a good heart. However, this is a far cry from Goldfinger. The plot is all over the place, characters flat and\/or uninteresting and the humor at times feels really forced.Having received some bad advices from his agent, George Lazenby refused to reprise the role of 007. The producers decided they had to get Sean Connery back. Connery, in an attempt to scare the producers off his back, agreed for a salary that at the time was astronomical. Producers however paid him the asked sum and Connery returned. While he does still perform the action scenes, especially the elevator struggle, with dignity it's obvious Connery doesn't take the film as seriously as the previous Bond movies. Other times he is treating it like a joke, being even more wisecracking than before, or he stays in background waiting for the lunch break.Jill St. John is nice to look at, but her character Tiffany is incredibly hard to like. She never comes across as anything other than gold-digger who only watches after herself. Charles Gray is a good choice for Blofeld, but the character has been reduced to a poor Saturday morning cartoon villain, a far cry from the evil mastermind of previous Bond films.This is also the last time Blofeld acts as Bond's main antagonist. Due to copyright problems the filmmakers couldn't use Blofeld and SPECTRE in films anymore. Considering how they had been villains in nearly every Bond film so far, I consider Diamonds Are Forever to be an end for an era in Bond series.Now, I do have to admit, if you don't expect too much and you don't watch it right after On Her Majesty's Secret Service, then this can be pretty entertaining film. It does have its moments, like one heck of a car chase scene and two very memorable gay assassins, so there is entertainment value here. Plus John Barry still delivers great score. But all in all, Diamonds Are Forever is one of the sillier Bond movies made. And that's saying a lot considering Roger Moore wasn't here yet.

Bad Taste is essentially Peter Jackson learning the ropes and experimenting with practically zero cash. The result is a gory and sometimes funny mess. He polished this formula up for 'Dead Alive', and 'Dead Alive' definitely shows a progression both in Jackson's talent, and his pocketbook(although DA had a small budget too).You can see Jackson's influences. Direction similar to early Romero, and Gore that reminds me of some of the late 70's\/early 80's gore-fests. The gore here is in heavy doses, and it is probably the strongest characteristic of this film - along with what he achieved overall given the restrictions with the budget and cast. He learned from the best... Other influences were surely make-up masterminds like Tom Savini and Rick Baker.You have to be in the right mindset to enjoy this movie. I've seen it three times. The first time was years ago and I didn't enjoy the film at all. Years later, after realizing that you don't have to take everything so serious, and that horror films can be as funny as they are scary - I gave it another whirl. I laughed on a few occasions and my interest was sparked but not glued. The third time I concentrated more on Jackson's technique and the little nuances that make this film more of a lesson in film-making than an enjoyable 90 minutes.My conclusion. Bad Taste is a film to be appreciated by horror\/comedy fans, and fans of making film - because it's essentially someone just like you making their first backyard movie. The only difference is the effort and the near flawless shots of gore and tension that can only be achieved at the hands of someone who is A.Talented, B.Meticulous, and C.An Obvious Film-Buff. He was paying attention to how Romero achieved tension with his close-ups and sound,... and the editing here, for what it is, is amazing. The plot is a dose of Comedy, horror, and sci-fi.

The story is as compelling and ultimately uplifting as one will ever find in cinema -- from the very get-go we see Andy Dufresne in a courtroom, being sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two people. So instinctively, we believe this must be true -- after all the judge did rule him guilty, right? But over time Andy grows on us, until we learn of his actual innocence, and by the end of the movie one can't help but root him on in his pursuit of freedom. Tim Robbins is the perfect assignment to play Andy, as Robbins' lesser-known status as an actor (as opposed to Tom Hanks, who was considered for this role) eases his task of being the quiet, tranquil Andy who prefers to keep to his own business. Andy's easygoing yet pensive nature makes him the ideal protagonist, as he is an independent thinker yet he can peacefully interact with all others.His friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman) is the backbone of The Shawshank Redemption. Red, a contraband smuggler, may be different from Andy in almost all respects, but over the years Andy earns Red's respect through his acts of courage and selflessness. This movie teaches that title does not have to dictate behavior -- a man who is in prison can be as kind and generous as anyone outside of prison walls -- it all depends on how far you're willing to look into that man's heart. I also love the fact that the friendship of the two men heightens very gradually -- that seems far more realistic than the instant-friends that one often sees in all mediums of story telling. This one takes time to develop, creating a profundity in the relationship and contributing to one of the movie's themes (time). This theme teaches us how much things can change over time, and also lends to the purported notion that Andy and Red have been in prison for a very long time.Red's narration is one of the standout features of The Shawshank Redemption. It is both poignant and insightful, allowing us unlimited access to his mind, which makes our empathy for him so real. While in most other films we learn about characters only through dialogue, in this one Red divulges practically everything to us. His abandonment of hope and eventual love for Andy makes him a tragic figure that should pull at the heartstrings of all viewers. When we first see him attempt to receive parole in 1947, he seems to be no more than an unfeeling criminal. But by 1967 when he's trying to leave Shawshank Prison after 40 years of incarceration, we hang on every word of his memorable rehabilitated speech. And when he meets Andy on the beach in the final scene, and the two peacefully embrace with a hug as the camera fades away, it is hard to hold back tears of joy.A significant aspect of this film is its theme of institutionalization. We are made to scrutinize exactly what prison does to people. How does a man adapt to freedom again, once he has been released? All Brooks Hatlen could land was a job as a grocery bagger and a room in a halfway house. This inauspicious lifestyle, plus the insecurities of being away from familiar faces while among all the technological\/social changes since the start of his 50-year sentence, overwhelmed Brooks, as we all saw in a speechlessly dramatic suicide scene. Red lived in much the same fear before he decided to take off and cross the border to visit Andy. So we're forced to ask ourselves does even a finite prison sentence essentially end the free will of its recipient? Is it better to leave the inmate in prison in certain cases? This cuts deeply into the philosophy of society's legal system.But the overarching theme of The Shawshank Redemption is hope. Hope is a wonderful, vital virtue that should never be absent in any human heart. Andy echoes this through his audacious acts (be it offering financial advice to Hadley or playing classical music over the prison intercom (which is one of the finest scenes you will ever see in cinema)). He vocalizes his faith in hope to his inmates when he claims that his two weeks in solitary confinement were the easiest he'd ever done, all thanks to the music he kept in his head. He tells Red get busy living, or get busy dying and uses the death of Brooks as his evidence, much to Red's initial chagrin. Yes, Andy is built into an icon for hope in this movie, and that is what makes it so universally successful in its appeal. Hope can and should be adopted by every human being who graces the earth. This notion is expressed through Andy's entire struggle, as well as in Thomas Newman's incredible musical score for the film (which is so good it has been used in multiple movie trailers before to evoke emotional response). This precious lesson, told through a film in which literally everything is perfectly mastered, is what makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films ever made.

His abandonment of hope and eventual love for Andy makes him a tragic figure that should pull at the heartstrings of all viewers. When we first see him attempt to receive parole in 1947, he seems to be no more than an unfeeling criminal. But by 1967 when he's trying to leave Shawshank Prison after 40 years of incarceration, we hang on every word of his memorable rehabilitated speech. And when he meets Andy on the beach in the final scene, and the two peacefully embrace with a hug as the camera fades away, it is hard to hold back tears of joy.A significant aspect of this film is its theme of institutionalization. We are made to scrutinize exactly what prison does to people. How does a man adapt to freedom again, once he has been released? All Brooks Hatlen could land was a job as a grocery bagger and a room in a halfway house. This inauspicious lifestyle, plus the insecurities of being away from familiar faces while among all the technological\/social changes since the start of his 50-year sentence, overwhelmed Brooks, as we all saw in a speechlessly dramatic suicide scene. Red lived in much the same fear before he decided to take off and cross the border to visit Andy. So we're forced to ask ourselves does even a finite prison sentence essentially end the free will of its recipient? Is it better to leave the inmate in prison in certain cases? This cuts deeply into the philosophy of society's legal system.But the overarching theme of The Shawshank Redemption is hope. Hope is a wonderful, vital virtue that should never be absent in any human heart. Andy echoes this through his audacious acts (be it offering financial advice to Hadley or playing classical music over the prison intercom (which is one of the finest scenes you will ever see in cinema)). He vocalizes his faith in hope to his inmates when he claims that his two weeks in solitary confinement were the easiest he'd ever done, all thanks to the music he kept in his head. He tells Red get busy living, or get busy dying and uses the death of Brooks as his evidence, much to Red's initial chagrin. Yes, Andy is built into an icon for hope in this movie, and that is what makes it so universally successful in its appeal. Hope can and should be adopted by every human being who graces the earth. This notion is expressed through Andy's entire struggle, as well as in Thomas Newman's incredible musical score for the film (which is so good it has been used in multiple movie trailers before to evoke emotional response). This precious lesson, told through a film in which literally everything is perfectly mastered, is what makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films ever made.

I first heard of it when about 10 or 11, and already then it had a mysterious aura surrounding it, the words zone and stalker just stuck with me. Then I watched it in my mid-teens, a time when I idolized Tarkovsky but of course missed much of the philosophical musings. Still, as a youngster already trying to comprehend this life, I found many ideas&#x97;and many expressions of the characters&#x97;thought-provoking. So, in fact, this film left its mark on forming my personality.That was back in the 80's. Today, I still consider Stalker one of the highest achievements of cinema, and to me it belongs, with Andrei Rublev and The Mirror, to the Tarkovsky top three. A firm 10. Tarkovsky's hypnotic filmmaking literally draws you in, and it has always been a mystery to me how people can find this film boring. For me, it feels like barely an hour or so. I think, the reason is that the characters' spiritual journey finds a perfect expression cinematographically. Tarkovsky's art is pure cinema, he is interested in this kind of artistic expression, by which I mean that everything in this film (dialogues, camera work, music, acting, and so forth) works together to create a piece of art of cinema. It's never just talking heads reciting some profound truths, or just music trying to evoke some kind of deep feelings in the viewer, or anything like that. It's cinema. Of course, to relate to these particular characters you will need to relate to their journey into themselves. Because it is deeply emotional one too, not only spiritual. And yes, for many the pace will be too slow, sadly.Tarkovsky was never interested in an experimental cinema. He insisted that the artist must witness to the truth, as he sees it, artistically or otherwise. It seems to me that in this film this approach in a sense has taken the art to its limits. Because they are only a step away from the revelation, from a possibility of learning something deeply important. However, we can never learn the full truth about ourselves, and the art, in fact, can only ask questions, not give answers. If it starts giving answers, it steps over into the realm of religion, or philosophy. I love the moment toward the end of the film (you can consider the rest of the sentence a slight SPOILER) when one of the characters, losing his balance, almost steps into the desired room&#x97;and he almost panics. Even with the outer layers of their inner selves, those to show others and themselves, stripped down, there is still so much more to discover.This film also features some outstanding acting. Kaidanovskiy in the title role is one example, and of course, a Tarkovsky regular Solonitsyn, another. What a great actor he was. Although Tarkovsky's films can usually be appreciated quite well without knowing Russian, I doubt it is fully true in the case of Solonitsyn's lines. But I have never watched a Tarkovsky movie subtitled, only in Russian, so it's just my assumption.To sum it up A quintessential Tarkovsky, a definite must-see for every movie lover. More importantly, a film which can make you learn more about yourself, or at least want to learn. If you are willing to.

This was evidenced to me when I was 'Rhoda' for a Halloween party a couple of years ago...pigtails, frilly gingham dress, blood soaked mary janes, Fern School penmanship medal and all. No one knew who I was, even when I told them. Hopefully I convinced at least a few of them to see this horror masterpiece! Nothing's creepier than an 8 year old blonde, blue eyed, sickeningly sweet serial killer. Rhoda Penmark is like the 'little girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead'. When she's good, she's very very good and when she's bad, she's horrid. In the beginning you are more annoyed by her sweetness than endeared by it and that's good because it helps you transition to seeing her as the bad guy later on. The same is true of Leroy, played by the talented Henry Jones. Right at the start, you don't like him much. He seems like a pervy degenerate who gets his kicks picking on a 3rd grader. So when Rhoda sets him on fire and plays the piano while he's screaming and burning to death in the backyard, well, let's just say I wasn't as upset as I might have been otherwise....and that in itself is disturbing! Patty McCormick as Rhoda gives an amazing performance, especially considering she was only ten or eleven when she made this film. The quick transitions from sweet to psychotic are as good as any veteran actor. She's just spooky! Nancy Kelly as Rhoda's mother, Christine, is amazing. She's almost regally lovely, calm, and is just as cool and calculating as her daughter, only not in the same way. Instead, Christine's energy is spent subtly manipulating information out of her father and others and trying to protect her little girl from what she feels is at least partially her fault because of her genetics. All the while, she's having to deal all of Rhoda's 'problems' alone, being a military spouse who's husband has been called to Washington right before the you-know-what hits the fan. Her act of desperation toward the end of the film is totally understandable and ultimately forgivable. Talk about a lot on your plate! Monica Breedlove, the landlady played by Evelyn Vardon is a treasure. The ultimate busy body who, though she has the best of intentions, is always sticking her nose in where it doesn't belong! In the end, she winds up being the luckiest person in the film! My favourite character is, without a doubt, Mrs. Daigle. Eileen Heckart is one of the gems of this era. Great character actress. And this film is no exception. The pitifully sad, yet amusingly drunken mother of Rhoda's first victim (the first one that takes place in the course of the film anyway), little Claude Daigle. Her performance is one of the best I've ever witnessed. She has you almost falling on the floor laughing at her spot on 'drunk' (I've always thought that Carol Burnett must have stolen her 'drunk' as well as some of her 'Eunice' from Hortense Daigle). But then she'll deliver a line in which you can just feel the grief at the loss of her only child and you well up with tears. Outstanding. Period. This is a fantastic film that everyone should see.

It's been named as one of the most influential propaganda films of all time. I don't exactly agree with this, but I do think that Einstein did a wonderful job at showing us the injustice and brutality of actual events. One of the scenes that stood out to me was when the crew was fed rotten, maggot infested meat. I was extremely disgusted by this scene, but thought Einstein did an excellent job at showing us what their life was like aboard the ship, even though it might have been dramatized. There were a number of vivid and grotesque images that stayed in my mind even after I watched it. The Odessa Steps was one of the most violent scenes that I have seen. Einstein did a fabulous job at creating shots that were rapid and sharp. It enhanced the feeling of panic as the civilians run down the stairs. The close-ups used by Einstein of the panicked civilians really captured our class' attention as we gasped and cringed.

Still, for anyone who appreciates the genesis of the studio's iconic definition of contemporary horror, The Wolf Man is mandatory viewing, and despite its faults the end result is a highly enjoyable and thoroughly solid entry.The brilliant acting of the ensemble cast can be held directly responsible for much of the film's effectiveness. Lon Chaney, Jr. leads the way with a very strong turn as the blighted Larry Talbot, and perfectly essays the Jekyll and Hyde theme at the core of the story. Chaney is a likable and charming protagonist, and when the horrors of his curse begin to manifest, he channels the character's sequence of emotions into a nuanced and tragic screen presence.Claude Rains grounds the film with his sensible yet intense performance as Larry's father, and the scenes between he and Chaney are gripping exchanges that any student of acting would be wise to take a look at. Bela Lugosi's appearance as the (rather un-creatively-named) gypsy Bela is a genuine treat, and the venerable horror icon makes a strong impression despite his relatively scant screen time, further showcasing what a brilliant character actor he was. Evelyn Ankers furthers the tradition of attractive leading ladies which was practically a trademark of the Universal Monster canon, and her nimble performance is excellently understated.Parts of the werewolf mythos outlined here are intriguing bits of lore which have been largely abandoned in other contemporary lycanthropy fables. The association of pentagrams with the monster here may not make much sense to modern audiences, especially since Talbot is ultimately a sympathetic figure, not an evil villain; yet the notion that someone afflicted with lycanthropy sees the ancient symbol manifested in the palm of their next victim's hand is a nice touch, and this device is played to great dramatic effect here.Jack Pierce's werewolf make-up and the transformation sequences are surely primitive by today's standards, but the former has endured remarkably well, and the close-ups of Chaney in full monster mode are still thrilling. However, the dissolves used to portray Chaney's shift from man to beast don't look very sophisticated or spectacular, even for the time. These scenes certainly have a quaint simplicity about them, but when you consider the still-impressive camera tricks employed in The Invisible Man a decade before, one has to wonder why a more clever method wasn't devised to capture these crucial scenes.While most of the sets have the customary lushness that made Universal's monster movies look much more expensive than they were, the often-used simulations of the woodlands the Wolf Man stalks are largely pretty underwhelming. There are very few moments where it isn't clear we're seeing action unfolding on a sound-stage, so recalling how often Universal productions adeptly presented a complete immersion into the setting (picture the amazingly-rendered interior of Dracula's castle), this one aspect of the production falls a bit short.There's also a confusing gaffe that is never addressed in the film. When Larry first transforms into the Wolf Man he's wearing a white tank top and slacks, yet when he prowls as the titular beast we see him adorned with a long sleeve button-up shirt and matching trousers. I'm very capable of suspending my disbelief, but I've always wondered why a recently transformed feral monster would be inclined to change its clothes before going on the prowl.Though The Wolf Man has a few weaknesses, the plot unfolds at an excellent pace, and the heightening of the werewolf's monstrous deeds is as grisly and horrific as the era would allow. The terse conclusion ends the movie on a strong note, and though Chaney would reprise his role in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, this original outing holds up as a fine stand-alone story, while still leaving ample room to delve deeper into the mythology in subsequent films.Yes, The Wolf Man has its flaws, but it is nevertheless a classy and well-crafted gem that should not be missed by anyone who appreciates the golden age of horror.

But the story is Schanberg's because he's the person who has something to learn -- and learns it.Waterston's handling of the Schanberg role is more than adequate.

Schanberg, busy typing, interrupts himself long enough to tell Dith Pran that people will be killed -- a lot of people -- and tells him to decide on the spot whether he wants to stay or leave. Arrangements have been made for Pran's family to get out but Pran himself is torn between his family and his loyalty to his profession as a journalist, as well as his personal loyalty to Schanberg. He twists his hands and works his features for a second before deciding to remain behind. As a result, he is dropped into hell.That basically is the first half of the film.

The final scene is sentimental but very moving.Among its virtues we can say that the photography is unimpeachable, although what it sometimes shows us is revolting. The musical score by Mike Oldfield is appropriate and innovative. Especially effective is the percussive dissonance that accompanies the arrival of the last U. S.

What I was most surprised by with this film is Spike Lee's work on screen. I've known of him as a director but I felt like he really did a great job as Mookie and Samuel L. Jackson adds a little bit of humor to an otherwise very serious movie as the local DJ. This movie isn't good due to good acting though, it's more due in part to the question that the film poses and at the end you'll find Spike asking you who you thought did the right thing?

It sometimes is too shouty for me, or a little just obvious in its step by stepping through disaster, but Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel are truly amazing, both outrageous and subtle, a stunning combination.It might be hard to view the movie in the light of 1968. It has some of the 1960s mad-cap element, mixed with Jewish Broadway humor, with a dash of New Hollywood liberalism thrown in. Influences of late Billy Wilder and early Woody Allen can't be dismissed, but in a way this is Mel Brooks himself coming to his own. His background in Catskills resort stand-up is clear, but he interweaves a cogent plot in a way that we'll see many times later, almost with a Marx Brothers logic (or illogic?). No, call it logic. This movie depends on actually making absurd sense in the end.Mostel of course had a whole incredible career of his own, including in Woody Allen's The Front in 1976. And Wilder has a kind of legendary fame for his leading role in Willy Wonka in 1971 (though his career had a small kick from the seminal Bonnie and Clyde in 1967). In some ways the over the top (of course) idiosyncrasies of two side kicks help make the film the farce it is. Dick Shawn as a kind of drugged out Elvis imitator named L.S.D. (playing Hitler of course) is perfect, and so is Kenneth Mars as the German\/Nazi\/writer who had the whole idea of Springtime for Hitler in the first place. If you aren't laughing through some of these scenes you have a gene missing for this kind of New York hilarity.The movie has taken on a different meaning now that the actually Broadway version (not a flop) was a fixture there for six (six!) years. The irony is plain, but the talent even more so. The movie is a funny take on the times (unlike the play, which is set in the 1950s) and so has a weird kind of authenticity to it. Not that you care one bit. It's just belly laughs all the way.

It was cool to see how all of the different people throughout the story remembered him. Welles' use of lighting in Citizen Kane is unmatched by any movie I have seen. The lighting along with the use of creative and dramatic angles puts this movie in a category of it's own.
