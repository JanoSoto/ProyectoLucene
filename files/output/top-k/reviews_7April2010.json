Dreamlike and beautifully surreal from the beginning, the film starts off simply enough, we see the residents of a small town enjoying themselves, in fact the town is what anyone and everyone would envision as a perfect town community. This is David Lynch's masterpiece.Young college student Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan, who was also in Lynch's Dune and would later star on Lynch's TV show Twin Peaks) returns to his seemingly perfect town when his father suffers a heart attack (in a very chilling scene). One day he discovers a severed human ear that is decomposing in a field, and this is when we as the viewers discover that this seemingly perfect little town is hiding some deadly secrets. Eventually, Jeffrey teams up with a young Laura Dern (who it seems is modeled after a 1950's high school sweet heart) and both begin playing detective, and it soon leads them to a tortured nightclub singer named Dorothy(played by Isabella Rossellini), who has some secrets of her own. This leads Jeffrey to begin to have a dangerous obsession with Dorothy, and that is not taken too well by Frank (Dennis Hopper, who is extremely great in this completely psycho role), a man who is terrorizing Dorothy for his own sexual perversions, and is holding her child hostage to attain them. Later on we get to see Frank and his crazed crew (Brad Dourif among them), and we meet his oh so suave buddy Ben (Dean Stockwell), who has only one screen appearance, but it is a chilling one nonetheless.The only complaint I can think of is how the film ended, it seems to me that Lynch had an alternate ending but decided to go with the one featured here. Lynch pulls out all the stops here, tugging at every emotion he can. You'll laugh, cringe, feel sorry for the characters, and be horrified, sometimes all at once. Blue Velvet is a haunting, dizzying, mind bending trip that will haunt you for days after viewing it, this is Lynch's best film, and it stands today as an American classic.

We see idealized images of a small town, a well manicured garden, only to dip below the surface to discover swarming insects. This is a metaphor for what the rest of the film explores - what lies beneath and what is seemingly hidden within the inhabitants of this small town, within the town itself. Jeffrey Beaumont, after discovering a human ear, proceeds with his own investigation, along with the help of the wholesome, high-school sweetheart Sandy Williams, whose father is the towns detective. They are introduced to Lumberton's hidden underworld, home to prostitution, illegal drug trade and sexual violence. Not to mention one of the most infamous cinema villains every created - Frank Booth. The film transcends from a tale about what lies beneath, to a tale about good vs. evil, good being Jeffrey, evil being Frank.Blue Velvet is a very well done film. It doesn't have the typical David Lynch narrative, where being coherent and making sense is almost non-existent, Blue Velvet actually tells a very straightforward story. It operates like a Hitchock thriller, but there are those bizarre Lynchian elements with surrealism on par with that of the masterful Dali. The lush red lipstick of Dorothy Vallens and the midnight blue on her gown also looks amazing on DVD. The only detractors I have for the film as a whole is its sometimes weak acting from Laura Dern and the occasional over-the-top acting of Dennis Hopper. Also, some of the sexual and violent overtones of the film become a little too heavy at some points, in particular a ridiculously perverted rape scene.

Everything is characterized by happiness, innocence and the American way. Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan) is on the way home from a hospital visit, where he saw his father who has recently suffered a stroke. While walking, he crosses a grass field, where he comes across a milky, rotting human ear crawling with bugs. It's a foreign object for this small town Americana idyll. Jeffrey, clearly horrified, takes the ear to his town sheriff. This is probably the type of American town where everybody knows everybody, you can go to your neighbor to borrow milk, have a good old conversation across the fence and everybody's business is everybody's business. Nothing here, is out of the ordinary, until we see the ear. And that's what makes Blue Velvet so remarkable. This ear is, unbeknown to Jeffrey, his entry into another world that co-exists in his humble hometown. A blonde, girl-next-door type, known as Sandy (Laura Dern), becomes his accomplice and partner. They become two young detectives gradually drawing themselves deeper into the sadistic madness that secretly inhabits their town, home to Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini in a wig), a tortured and fragile lounge singer whose sanity is probably hanging by a thread. This is quite clearly arousing to Jeffrey, sneaking into this lounge singer's apartment, in hope of finding a clue.Blue Velvet is a film about seeing what has always been hidden, Jeffrey even mentions this in the film I'm seeing something that has always been hidden, he says to Sandy. What he is seeing is the perversity that characterizes his town, and in a way, the perversion that characterizes childhood. Jeffrey observes more than he bargained for in Dorothy's apartment. When she returns unexpectedly, rips the closet door open and orders him to come out and strip, the boundless terror in his eyes exposes him as a peeping tom caught in the act, although he is obviously aroused by the act despite being held at knife-point. He experiences pleasure and power. David Lynch toys with these phenomena and makes the viewer an accomplice to the bizarre happenings. The scene in which Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth (an icon) rapes Dorothy is just as shocking, sickening and disturbing as the shower murder in Hitchock's Psycho, a film I would compare to Blue Velvet, because both films are as important for the cinematic era they were made in (1980s for this, 1960s for Psycho).All of it is too shocking for Jeffrey to comprehend, and it all seems so very out-of-the-ordinary for the every-town like his. But it wasn't, Jeffrey was an observer and participant and Frank became the representation of Jeffrey's repressed desires. The bad side of Jeffrey is Frank Booth. Frank's conscious acts are Jeffrey's unconscious desires. Toward the end of the film, when good finally overcomes evil, the camera shows a close up of an ear, but this time it's Jeffrey's and it's intact with the body it comes from. The fissures in this perfect little town are apparently sealed, and Jeffrey's journeys into the perverse, dark side of his soul are over. But is this permanent or just a temporary respite...? The genius in this film is that there could always be something lurking, something hidden behind the perfectly trimmed, green grass displayed by the swarming beetles in th grass in Blue Velvet's incredible opening scene.Blue Velvet is an amazing film. It is an exhilarating experience and although you have been sitting in your chair for the 120 minute running time, you feel as if you've been running for about 3 hours, the experience is so exhausting. While the film is dark, horrifying and sadistic, it is also beautiful and dreamlike. It is a surreal journey into the loss of innocence and the dark, unknown depths of the human soul. There is a Jeffrey in all of us - a desire to journey into the unknown and the human nature of sexual desire that is stripped bare in Blue Velvet. Highly recommended.

She is a brides main for his sister and destroys the reception, steals a limo and crashes it into a house and then to save jail time she goes to rehab. In rehab she takes it as a joke, but when being around other people and facing her addiction head on she is able to leave knowing what she must do to get what she really wants out of life.I admit movies about drug addiction can sometimes be uplifting and important, but this movie really never focused well on the problem, just the solution.. Its difficult to make people truly see how horrible it is to be an addict when you portray their addiction in a funny way. Although drunk and pilled up, the opening scene of her crashing the reception was more comedic than tragic. The party was a yawnfest and they brought life to it. Drug addiction is serious and it takes more than just the lightweight procedures used here to beat that addiction... I didn't buy it and didn't like it...Writer Susannah Grant can write good she did an amazing job writing Erin Brockovich, but that was based on true events, maybe original and true depictions of life isn't her forte.Acting wise Sandra Bullock has never impressed me, I can't recall ever seeing her actually act. She plays the same boring person in every film she's ever done. Viggo Mortisen was a nobody when this came out, he had been in a ton of movies and no one had paid him any attention, here he once again was lame and boring.. It was his last film before peter Jackson would make him a household name, and several years before David Cronenberg would actually teach him how to act.Steve Buscemi did'nt have much of a huge part here but Steve is always great, he is one of the most real actors out there. Many of the actors did fine, but I think Alan Tudyk was hands down the best actor and the true star of this film. He was actually making me laugh, and making me feel something. There is one part where he does a confession using the fork in the road as a metaphor and he completely improvised the entire scene and he was just wonderful. Lots of the supporting cast did a great job.The ending of the movie Bullock comes home and back to her old life, she soon realizes if she wants to stay clean she needs support, and she walks away from her boyfriend and broke the tie. To me that was the best scene of the film and I applauded that and people in real life who can shake their demons, it's not easy...That scene helped boost my rating up to a 3 star out of a possible 10.

The film is chiefly of importance for the sizzling performance of the young Marilyn Munroe in a supporting role as the mistress of Louis Calhern, whom she kisses in the film, despite his prickly moustache, with a good deal of ardour, despite his being zillions of years older than her and certainly being one of the least kissable screen actors of his day. Munroe's affectation of jaw-dropping naiveté and simple-mindedness is shockingly convincing, as all her dumb blonde characteristics always were in films. She really stands out in this film despite still being an unknown actress. The script of this film is brilliant, and the dialogue is crisp and effective at all times. Everyone in the film except for the Police Commissioner (a lone, honest figure in a sea of sewage), and a pathetic girl who is in love with Sterling Hayden without his noticing, is amoral, corrupt, vicious, avaricious, violent, unfeeling, dishonest, double-crossing or triple-crossing, selfish, egotistical, greedy, and despicable in every way. One wonders why anyone wants to make films about such people, but then it is done every day to great popular acclaim, which says a lot about humanity. The film is, therefore, truly about a jungle. All the beasts of prey are on the loose and eating each other. Huston was always a talented director, and he makes this film compelling and fascinating to watch, a bit like a visit to the Reptile House in the zoo. Huston was a sadistic personality who liked to watch people suffer, and here he has an entire cast to torment, so he must have been very happy. (At least no one cuts off her nipples with scissors, as Julie Harris did in REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE (1967), which is a relief, and also no horses are tortured as in THE MISFITS (1961), and the masochistic Montgomery Clift was not in the cast for Huston to hospitalize and then visit afterwards with flowers as he liked to do, or a masochistic James Agee to drive to a premature heart attack.) Sam Jaffe does an excellent job of playing a brilliant criminal who has just been released after seven years 'behind the walls' in prison, and immediately plans an ingenious heist. He dresses impeccably and affects the airs of a gentleman. His performance is truly remarkable, especially the scene where he loses all track of time because he becomes entranced with a young girl doing the jitterbug to a juke box, with tragic results. The film is littered with rich irony, much of it very subtle indeed. In a way, it is an intellectual work, though unquestionably a study in evil which ends up apologizing for much of it. As Louis Calhern says in a sober reflective moment 'Crime is really just a left-handed form of human endeavour.' I fear this moral relativism is at the basis of this entire film, and seems to have been accepted by writers, producer, and director. In other words, this film is rotten at its heart.

It tells of China lifting itself off her knees, and of the Americans who were caught in the giant's bloody rousing. It tells of crewmen Frenchy Richard Attenborough & Jake Holman Steve McQueen from the U.S.S. San Pablo, two men whose lives are to be severely altered here on the banks of the Yangtze River. It tells of the San Pablo's Captain Collins Richard Crenna as he tries to negotiate tricky political waters. And also of the missionaries Larry Gates & Candice Bergen who in turn are resentful and bewildered by the US involvement in China. All molded together brilliantly by Robert Wise in this stirring drama that's flecked with romance and explosive action.Tho the film has undertaken a number of edits since its original release ranging from 170 minutes to 195, in any form the piece proves to be a lesson in character involvement. Adapted by Robert Anderson from the novel written by Richard McKenna, the film unfolds precision like, its intensity bubbling away until we reach the highly emotive conclusion. The film has often been placed as a parallel to the Vietnam conflict, something that is in truth hard to ignore. The Sand Pebbles shows the Americans meddling in affairs they don't understand. They act arrogantly towards the Chinese, they dismiss them and call them derogatory names. To them, the Chinese are an inferior race. But Frenchy & Jake are cut from different cloth, with the latter showing a cynicism and mistrust of authority that was felt by many young Americans towards their government for getting them involved in the civil war of Vietnam. Wise may be guilty of being heavy handed with his anti-war message, the aside at Imperialism boldly timed in 1966. But it does work and impacts hard, because the writing and the acting is so good. As is the many other technical aspects that are needed to tell such a vast story.It was nominated for 8 Academy Awards, but incredibly it won none. It was McQueen's only nomination in his career, that in itself is arguably unfair Papillon anybody?. But here he really should have won, I mean seriously does anyone really remember Best Actor Winner Paul Scofield's turn now? Those close to McQueen have said that Jake Holman was closest in character to the man himself. It's a riveting, emotionally nuanced performance that shows his unnerving ability to say more with his eyes and body language than with words. As anti-hero performances go, McQueen's is right out of the top draw. Attenborough Golden Globe Winner for Best Supporting Actor, Crenna and the impressive Mako all captivate and draw the viewers in, while Bergen has a winsome quality that plays nicely off of McQueen's rugged weariness. The cinematography from Joseph MacDonald is gorgeous, shot in Deluxe Color and Panavision in Taiwan and Hong Kong, MacDonald brilliantly took advantage of the sweeping Oriental scenery. This in turn is backed up by a sublime score from Jerry Goldsmith, at times beautiful & tender with a pinch of Oriental flavouring, at others powerful and sharp and landing in the chest like a force of nature.It was a far from trouble free shoot. McQueen initially clashed with Wise over how certain scenes should be shot, but the director won out and eventually got McQueen's support. Something that wasn't to be sniffed at, and something that wasn't afforded to Anderson who was jettisoned after falling foul of Blue Eyes. Bergen and McQueen also didn't get on, but with she being 19 years of age and he 36, that's somewhat understandable. But when she proclaimed that there was no talent on set! one hopes that was merely the misguided naivety of youth? Wise always said it was the most difficult picture he ever made. Expensive props, thousands of extras, low and high tides, Taiwan still at war with China! Three months of delays and $3 million over budget, Wise said that the cast and crew were heroes one and all. To be dropped into a completely foreign country, and suffer the delays and problems they did, it's a miracle the finished product is so dam good.The final word should go to Francis Ford Coppola. Who whilst suffering similar problems filming Apocalypse Now, requested a copy of The Sand Pebbles from Robert Wise. He used it to show his cast and crew what a terrific end result can come out of adversity. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 April 2010","score":"10 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" China 1926...Ravaged from within by corrupt warlords...oppressed from without by the great world powers who had beaten China to her knees a century before...China...a country of factions trying to unite to become a nation...through revolution.....The Sand Pebbles is a multi stranded panoramic story.

It tells of China lifting itself off her knees, and of the Americans who were caught in the giant's bloody rousing. It tells of crewmen Frenchy Richard Attenborough & Jake Holman Steve McQueen from the U.S.S. San Pablo, two men whose lives are to be severely altered here on the banks of the Yangtze River. It tells of the San Pablo's Captain Collins Richard Crenna as he tries to negotiate tricky political waters. And also of the missionaries Larry Gates & Candice Bergen who in turn are resentful and bewildered by the US involvement in China. All molded together brilliantly by Robert Wise in this stirring drama that's flecked with romance and explosive action.Tho the film has undertaken a number of edits since its original release ranging from 170 minutes to 195, in any form the piece proves to be a lesson in character involvement. Adapted by Robert Anderson from the novel written by Richard McKenna, the film unfolds precision like, its intensity bubbling away until we reach the highly emotive conclusion. The film has often been placed as a parallel to the Vietnam conflict, something that is in truth hard to ignore. The Sand Pebbles shows the Americans meddling in affairs they don't understand. They act arrogantly towards the Chinese, they dismiss them and call them derogatory names. To them, the Chinese are an inferior race. But Frenchy & Jake are cut from different cloth, with the latter showing a cynicism and mistrust of authority that was felt by many young Americans towards their government for getting them involved in the civil war of Vietnam.

This one was not really intended to be made as Eastwood seemed to to have left the iconic cop in the 70s. But, he effectively re-vitalized the great character in this fine sequel. Generally, I think that most sequels are not very good and formulaically either copy too heavily from the original (see any of the DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON sequels!) or go in the wrong direction trying to be so different from the original that in their presentation they strip away all that made the original film so great (see ALIENS and T2!). Doesn't matter to me that most of those sequels I mentioned made tons of money, they don't appeal to me as films and are failures to me where it truly counts.Somehow, some way, SUDDEN IMPACT manages to avoid the death knell of most film sequels manages to find the right balance between containing elements of the original while still seeming like an original movie in and of itself. What's amazing about SUDDEN IMPACT is that you need not have seen any of the 3 previous Dirty Harry movies to understand Harry Callahan! After a 7-year absence from playing the iconic role (in 1976's THE ENFORCER before this), Eastwood stepped back into the fray as if he'd never left. That's quite an achievement.Harry's task this time is to find a mysterious woman Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke in a bold, dark, convincing performance) killing off a group of her college friends that gang-raped her and her sister 10 years before; Locke was an Eastwood regular back in his 70s and 80s movie-making days (and of course his live-in lover at the time). The instigator of the rape was, ironically, a female Ray Parkins (Audrie J. Neenan giving an uncompromising performance playing a very despicable character). Ray is the nominal leader of the gang, while the main guy was Mick (Paul Drake in a 100% sleazy role). The first killing occurred in Harry's backyard San Francisco as one of the gang had moved there after college, but the rest are still in the burg San Paulo, where Jennifer goes back to and Harry gets shipped off to to investigate. The San Paulo police chief Jannings (played by Pat Hingle, another Eastwood regular in these days), knows of the incident as his son was one of the rapists who has since gone into a guilt-ridden catatonic state. All of them try to keep Harry at bay.In this sequel, Eastwood's Harry shares the spotlight with Locke's Jennifer, who, like Harry, believes in justice, except she takes it to the extreme of vigilantism and revenge. It has the obligatory moment where they meet (before Harry knows who she is!) and are mutually attracted, but b\/c of Jennifer's past, it's a rather cold and empty union, just 2 lonely people who think alike (mostly!) that sense a strange connection to each other.But you still get your dosage of iconic Harry moments and scenes, especially early when Harry methodically goes after criminal after criminal in that special Dirty Harry way, including the legendary make my day scene. The first 30 minutes or so serve as a complete reminder than Eastwood IS Dirty Harry and there will never be another! Film-wise, SUDDEN IMPACT obviously has that 80s pastiche, but when you've got a filmmaker as confident and assured as Eastwood that knows how to give the viewer what they want, you probably better watch it over and over again... or else Harry Callahan will Make your day!

In the Mouth of Madness goes in a different direction and it's just one of its many charms.The first thing that comes to mind with this film is the score by both Carpenter and Jim Lang. Carpenter's scores are usually pretty memorable anyway and this one is no exception. As soon as you hear it, it immediately reminds you of the early to mid-nineties. Even though the soundtrack is obviously dated, it fits the film incredibly well and it's difficult not to admire how great it really is.Sam Neill is another huge factor to this film being so well done. He's at his best here. Plain and simple. His struggle with his possible insanity regarding everything that's happened to him with the Sutter Cane case is where he truly shines. John Trent scrambles to find a logical explanation with everything he's seeing due to his job, but he eventually runs out of reasoning and panic begins to set in.

Starring Peter Cushing (John Banning), Christopher Lee (Kharis\/The Mummy), Raymond Huntley (Joseph Whemple) and Yvonne Furneaux (Isobel Banning\/Princess Ananka), the film is written by Jimmy Sangster and was filmed at Bray & Shepperton Studios in England. Tho listed as being filmed in Technicolor, it was actually shot in Eastman Color using the Technicolor process. I mention the latter because Eastman Color has a different hue to it, something that makes this movie all the more affecting as a horror piece.The plot sees three archaeologists (Stephen & John Banning & Joseph Whemple) desecrate the tomb of Egyptian Princess Ananka. This awakens Kharis, Ananka's blasphemous lover who was buried alive for his unlawful deeds. Taken from the tomb to London by Egyptian priest Mehemet Bey (George Pastell), the three archaeologists find they are being hunted down by the vengeful Kharis. The only salvation may come in the form of Isobel Banning who bears a striking resemblance to Princess Ananka.This Mummy is adroitly directed by Fisher, his choreography for the action scenes is stunning. Lee's incarnation as the mouldy bandaged one is swifter than most, thus Fisher has him stalking around Victorian England one minute, then the next he's crashing thru doors or windows with brute strength. With murder his (its) only goal. It's a top performance from Lee as he really throws himself into the role, with his dead eyes ominously peering out from gauze swathed sockets sending those little shivers running down the spine. Technically the film belies the budget restrictions that was a staple of Hammer productions. The sets are very impressive with the Egyptian tomb set original and authentic looking, and the swamp based set-up nicely constructed. The latter of which provides two genuine horror classic moments. As first we see the Mummy for the first time as he rises from a foul bubbling bog, and then for the dramatic swampy finale. It's also atmospherically filmed by Fisher, with Jack Asher's photography utilising the Eastman Color to give off a weird elegiac beauty.This is not about gore, Fisher and the makers wanted to thrive on atmospherics and implication. Something they achieve with great rewards. The Mummy would prove to be very successful in Britain and abroad, thus ensuring Hammer would dig up more Mummy's for further screen outings. None of which came close to capturing the look and feel of this first makeover.

The first movie had horrible acting, horrible writing, and horrible directing.The lead role then, (1988) was played by a professional wrestling star, Rowdy Rod Piper, and the smaller parts were nothing worth mentioning either, with exception of Keith David who played Armitage.The script was poorly written, for it does not show why Meg Foster's character, Holly did not have the unusual and scary kind of night-of-the-living dead face as her other cronies, and looked completely human. Yet she pushes Rod's character, Nada off a balcony with such strength, but Nada can't identify her like he can the other enemies with the sunglasses. The script also does not reveal why some of the deaders can push a button on their sci-fi wristwatch and disappear quickly, while others don't even try, and instead are shot and killed by Nada and the good guys. Then there is the matter of the sunglasses themselves, which don't appear to be any particular kind or brand or with any special characteristics to reveal the walking dead, as if any old pair of sunglasses will do just fine. Yet the deaders are amazed, and exclaim We have one that can see. Yeah - no special sunglasses, just an ordinary sundry item that you can get anywhere, and the deaders didn't think about that beforehand. Really how gullible do you think the watching audience is?

The script differs from the novel in various ways including changing the ending in which Rambo is killed in the book but lives in the film but never having read the book I cannot compare the two, First Blood is great to just sit down & watch since it has a great pace that keeps going all the way through, it's never too fast in that you can't reflect on what's going on but it never slows down to the point where I was bored. Although definitely an action film the film has things to say, the aftermath of the Vietnam war & the abandonment of those who fought in it along with the effects of the war on those who fought in it & there's a broad swipe at racism as well. The villain of the film isn't as black and white as you may think, is it the Sheriff who just wants to do his job & protect his town or is the villain Rambo who causes untold damage & ultimately breaks the law? The character's are good, Rambo barely says anything & never really interacts with anyone either as it's the other character's (played by better actor's) tell the story & flesh Rambo's character out more than he does. I enjoyed this, it's not full of flashy effects & the body count is surprisingly low with one one on screen death but overall I thought it worked great as both an action film & one with a (albeit slight) message.The action is really good here, this is solid 80's action with nice steady camera shots rather than modern shaky quick fire edited hard to understand set-pieces that give me a headache. There are exploding cars, exploding shops, motorbike chases, fights & shoot-outs plus a car jump in which a stunt man broke his back but carried on & the shot is actually in the film. First Blood was the first Sylvester Stallone film that wasn't Rocky not to bomb at the box-office & arguably launched his career. The film looks great & the forest wilderness is a terrific backdrop for Rambo to turn the tables on the cops, Rambo uses the terrain to his advantage & as an action adventure film setting it works well.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 the production ran months over & delayed the filming of Rocky III (1982), the action scenes are great with cool explosions & no modern quick editing at all. Although set in the US this was filmed in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is good from a solid cast & since Stallone doesn't hardly say anything is acting skills or lack of don't get the way too much.First Blood is a terrific early 80's action adventure film, there's a bit of a cop out ending in which no one really wins or loses but that just left the door open for some sequels which duly followed with Rambo First Blood Part II (1985), Rambo III (1988) & Rambo (2008) while the IMDb lists Rambo V The Savage Hunt (2011) as currently in production.

I respectfully disagree. First off, for a film that's widely considered a brilliant piece of entertainment, I don't find it very much entertaining. It's too talky, if that makes any sense. The scenes with Travolta and Jackson are good, particularly when Jackson is doing his yelling schtick, but some of the conversations just don't interest me. I don't care about what burgers are called in France, or whether or not they put Mayo on it. It's just filler, and dull filler at that.Which brings me to the Travolta scene with Uma Thurman, which is even more dull. We basically watch them on a date, chatting it up again with more useless filler ($5 milkshakes, foot massages, etc), and then we see them dance. Call me crazy, but I don't particularly find that entertaining. Now when Thurman over-doses, and what follows after, that's entertaining. But what happened on the date simply bored me.I'm also no fan of the Bruce Willis Segment, as his character is not interesting to me. For one, Willis pretty much plays himself, and two we have to watch him and his girlfriend talk about nonsense, like women with potbellies. I honestly don't understand why this is considered brilliant dialogue. The scene where Steve Buscemi talks about tipping in the superior Reservoir Dogs is far better written, and more interesting, than any of the dialogue in Pulp Fiction, IMO. Also, I don't buy Bruce Willis going back to save the gangster who was going to kill him.The movie does pick up when Travolta accident shoots the kid. I'll admit that part is funny, and very well written, even if Tarantino nearly ruins the whole scene with his voice and acting. The ending in the restaurant is cool, as Jackson steals the show yet again. Overall though, I'm just not a fan of this movie. I have nothing against Tarantino, as I find Reservoir Dogs and the Kill Bill films to be solid and enjoyable films, but this film is, for the most part, dull. My 5\/10 rating for it still stands.
