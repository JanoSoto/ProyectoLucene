Ashby and crew handles the technical aspects quite well, not much bad to say about that area. But the films mood and atmosphere appeared to be two things at the same time. It's both lighthearted and sad, and it does not work to it's advantage. It made me feel uncertain about how to feel, which could have been an excellent tool for a more serious film, but not for this one.My main problem with it is the set-up. Why would a presumably rich man be asked to live with them? Why would the doctor advice it? And how he acts and behaves makes it just annoying that nobody can figure out that he is mentally retarded. The film takes itself a bit too serious for me to overlook this. I suppose this is a social commentary. But whether or not it says that the innocent has the right ideas\/morals or if it says that people in general are stupid I'm not completely sure of.For me it was like every laugh brought on a little bit of annoyance and even a bit of sadness. The Sellers character is really a tragic figure, yet the situations he takes part in is too light hearted to make it truly stick.As stated the film does offer multiple good laughs but it never seem to ind it path. Being There balances between calm, nearly dramalike subtleties and Zucker\/Brooks craziness. I have to say the subtleties did not work for me. The story was not strong enough to carry it, so these parts felt rather dead. This might seem like an awful lot of negativity but I did like the film to some degree. Sellers does most definitely give a very usable performance and Melvyn Douglas was great. My overall rating is 6.5\/10.

There are issues (and tricks, cinematically) with ghosts and memories, but these play small against the bigger strain of the lead woman dealing with this sudden trauma in her life. Even though the main event in the movie happens at the start, I don't dare mention it because its surprise is important (I didn't know it was coming, and liked the way it was handled very much). Director Francois Ozon never seems to quite nail down the pace and editing of his films, at least for American sensibilities. Even the sensationally complex Swimming Pool doesn't quite use its material to propel us in every scene. But let's turn that on its head and say that Ozon uses emptiness and gaps in the action to give his movies breathing room, or maybe, in some old fashioned sense, the make them serious. When nothing is happening you can only start to think and dwell on the events, along with the characters. In Under the Sand there is nothing else to do and yet it's exactly what Rampling in her role has to do think and dwell. It's slow at times, yes, but only if you don't let yourself relax and get absorbed.And, like the character, confuse what is real from what is chimera, and what she needs with what she once had, and even one man from another.

Of course Tom Hanks' performance is flawless, as is almost everything else he does (the key word is 'almost'). Most of the other characters are well-acted, etc. Once again, there's not much else I can say about this movie from that angle either that hasn't already been said.I think what compels me the most about this film, is that, due to the spread of political correctness, this film, as it is, would not be able to be made today. It's a time capsule of the late 80's, right in the middle of the Reagan-Bush, Sr. years, the high point of Just Say No, during the conservative backlash against the forward progress made in the 60's and 70's. Don't get me wrong, I'm as liberal as the next guy, but I still can't stand political correctness. It's a step in the wrong direction, in my opinion. But it goes to show you that the late 80's-early 90's, compared to now, you could get away with a lot in films.First of all, all of Josh's exploits, as an adult, are going on while his poor mother thinks that he's been kidnapped and is tied up or being raped in a basement somewhere, or something to that extent, and that alone would stop this movie from getting green-lit. Also, the scene where Josh sleeps with Susan, would not be able to be included in the film, because most censorship groups would protest this film saying things like 'They're showing a scene with a 30-year-old woman having pre-marital relations with a 13-year-old boy?' The educated would know that type of thing has already been shown in European cinema and American classrooms.Even though there is a lot of trash on television these days, there is now, thanks to some politicians (Democrat or Republican, doesn't matter) who have really messed things up with the PC movement, a real fear about what people can and can't say, and this film is a testament to those times when people didn't care as much, and wouldn't unless it were pointed out to them by rambling pundits with nothing better to do. Oh wait? Aren't I doing just that? Now there's something to think about...Oh, and one final note... In the scene where Josh is trying to impress a girl by trying to get on to the ferris wheel, he gets chewed out by some jerk ride operator for being too short, and told to 'get on the kiddie ride'. Josh's parents must've been a couple of real wusses. If I went to a carnival, and some a--hole carney was picking on my kid for whatever reason, I'd f--king punch his lights out. If Josh's parents had defended him, or at least shown him how to defend himself or have confidence in himself in such situations, and given that carney what he deserved, maybe the whole debacle of him wishing to be big and inadvertently turning into an adult wouldn't have happened. But then again, we wouldn't have had this movie. But in the real world, I wouldn't let that happen, and I bet that most parents would do the same for their children.

God is dead and the soul is left to wander the depraved streets of NYC looking for a way to survive. But men still have their dreams, even if those dreams are no greater than to be successful Miami pimps or hustlers, and come in from the cold. In a world where there is no morality and no one can be trusted, imperfect human beings still find each other and struggle to survive. Somewhere along this dark, lonely, unglamorous path, a thing called love happens. Not the amorous love of heterosexuals or homosexuals but the love of one human being for another. The Texas hustler displays something sorely lacking in many people's lives loyalty, and compassion, even though he is capable of violence and great force in order to keep his friend alive. The old expression (probably coined by the old themselves) is very apt Life is the thing that happens when you are on your way to something entirely different, or Life is what happens while you are thinking about doing something else entirely. Will Dustin Hoffman's character, Ratso die on his way to Miami in the same way that every man dies on his way to the corner drug store, the bath room, his next big project, or to some other place entirely? Or will he find a reprieve? We know the answer to these kinds of things innately whether we think about them or not, and that is why the culminating and moving scenes of this film still take your breath away. In a soul-less universe the world still goes its merry way, whether we are sick or well, rich or poor... but somehow we still have soul. There is a shot during the film that hints at Ratso's future or perhaps his past. A shot of a Times Square symbol of the sun with dazzling lights is followed by the X in the window of the tenement apartment. The sun has been or will be X'ed out, the man has not made it to his place in the sun and we wonder if he will make it to the sun in Miami; he has already been crossed out, rejected, X'ed out of the sunny life by poverty,physical handicap, disfranchisement. Historically and cosmically, the sun has been used as the symbol of one's vitality and life. The X tells us that this man has lost his vitality and will lose his life. But will he? Is it a way of preparing us for a blow in the same way that a dream or premonition prepares us for a dramatic turn of events, or has the blow already been made? Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight did a magnificent job. I first saw this film at the age of 13, over forty years ago, and all I had remembered about it was the ending and the theme of loneliness, and that it had made me cry. (But how on earth did I get into that film if it was rated X? That is now a mystery to me.) Now, after 40 years, I have just watched this film again and been even more moved the second time round, knowing much more about life, about illness and death, poverty of both the soul and the wallet, and about roads taken to dreams that never manifest. Love is more important than the dreams. That's what our young hearts finally find out before we die. Or at least that's what we hope, for dreams are as fleeting as the northern midnight wind.

It would appear this, their first film, has served as the prototype for the great films to come. In Blood Simple we have the wide open country (No Country for Old Men), portentous headlights emerging from the night (Fargo) we have ominous ceiling fans (Barton Fink) and terrible deaths (Miller's Crossing) and of course, we have a simple crime that goes terribly wrong (Raising Arizona, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, No Country, Burn After Reading).I should now confess that the Coen Brothers always rub me the right way. Their quirkiness and defiance of expectations send tingles down my spine that put me in a good mood, no matter how peculiar the material. Just like with Kubrick, Woody Allen, Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, and Fellini I can always find something to like in their films.Blood Simple starts off like so many other movies and then diverts and meanders into a plot that's hard to see coming but easy enough to follow. Marty (Dan Hedaya), a jealous bar owner, hires Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh), a private detective of questionable moral integrity, to spy on his wife Abby (Frances McDormand). Abby is having an affair with one of Marty's employees, Ray (John Getz). When Visser informs Marty of Abby's infidelity, Marty hires him to kill the lovers. He offers Visser ten thousand dollars and it is an offer Visser can't turn down. That is the set up and to elaborate any more on the plot would be a disservice to the film - except to say that Visser has a plan of his own.In some ways, this film reminded me of Sam Raimi's A Simple Plan (1998) (coincidentally the Coen's got their start working for Raimi). Both films are about how a series of independently motivated actions can add to a complete and encompassing massacre. I suppose for that matter, Fargo and No Country are that way too.But as with all Coen brothers what makes this movie so good is the particulars of the camera-work and the oddities of the characters. The camera glides all over, sometimes smoothly, sometimes rough, sometimes along the floor or a street, and other times at eye level. It takes on strange yet affecting angles, like underneath a sink looking up or above a ceiling fan looking down.M. Emmet Walsh as Visser comes off as a striking villain. He sometimes seems a simpleton, which makes us like him, and sometimes a vicious killer, which makes us fear him. One of his greatest amusements in life seems to be a toy woman, dangling from his rear view mirror, who's breasts light up when turned on. Can such an easily amused man be a ruthless killer? You bet.Blood Simple, for a first film is impressive. It is beyond apprentice work. While the Coens would go on to make better, even stranger movies, Blood Simple has a memorable quality all its own.RatingOn a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974).RationalizationWell, sometimes people just make bad decisions. I didn't mention much about the main character Ray in the review, but suffice it to say, he makes a very bad decision in Blood Simple &#x96; one that will change the rest of his life and the course of this movie. The scenes in which he makes this decision are the best scenes in the film, wrought with suspense, horror, and evocative pity. We understand why Ray does it, but still&#x85;It makes you think that God just likes to mess with some people.

But with those islands, I still like to lump 'em with Hawaii. In my mind, Joe Versus the Volcano has been lumped with Turner and Hooch (1989) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993);pretty much the Tom Hanks movies that bridge his mainly comedic work of the '80s to his more serious roles of the '90s.And so, what do I think about a unique film like Joe Versus the Volcano. Well, I'll start by saying it is a pretty unique film, a rare example of early '90s American expressionism. It looks like no other Tom Hanks film I have ever seen, including Forest Gump (1994) and Cast Away (2000) and its plot is also singularly odd in the Tom Hanks filmography, including Splash (1984) and The Man with One Red Shoe (1985). Joe (Tom Hanks) is an Advertising Librarian for a medical supplies company in New York. His office is a hellish place that makes the bathroom setting in Saw (2004) look like a spa at club med. It is an office filled with flickering florescent lights and a man who endlessly repeats the same phrases again and again. One day Joe feels sickly and decides to go to the doctor who promptly informs him he has a brain cloud. As to what a brain cloud is exactly, we never find out, but we are informed it will kill Joe within six months. The next morning a spastic businessman, Samuel Graynamore (played hilariously by Lloyd Bridges) comes knocking at Joe's door. He has a proposition for Joe. There's a little known volcanic island in the pacific that has a special element Graynamore needs to make superconductors. The tribe on the island will allow Graynamore to take as much of the element as he pleases if he can find them a willing participant to jump into the island's volcano to appease the volcano gods. Graynamore believes Joe is his man and Joe, seeing he has nothing to lose, agrees to do it. The majority of the film follows Joe as he travels to the island. He buys a new wardrobe of clothes, hires limousines and travels luxuriously by air and by sea, all on Graynamore's dime. Along the way Joe meets Graynamore's daughters Angelica and Patricia (both played by Meg Ryan) and learns the value of truly living. I appreciated some parts of this movie very much. For instance, a scene in which Joe beholds a giant moon at sea and begins to pray is very powerful. But on the whole, Joe Versus the Volcano is uneven. If writer-director John Patrick Shanley had presented a more consistent vision I would have liked this film a better. The surrealistic edge to Joe is great, but too often it flips over into scenes that look realistic and lack stylization. It makes for a choppy film going experience.I also wasn't impressed by the romance between Joe and Patricia. It seems to me the sister Angelica was frivolous to the plot and Patricia, who becomes Joe's love interest, could have easily subsumed her role. When Patricia confesses her love to Joe it seems rushed and undeveloped. I didn't buy it. Joes Versus the Volcano is ultimately an oddity and if you're a Tom Hanks fan its worth checking out. But when I consider what this film is versus what it could have been, I wish what it could have been had won. RatingOn a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a Superman Returns (2006)RationalizationWhat it is versus what it could have been says it all. I really wanted Superman Returns to be awesome, but let's face it, Superman Returns is a disappointment. If you give Lois Lane a husband and a kid, you really can't root for Superman to get the girl in the end without also making him into a super-dick. And no hand to hand face-off with Lex Luthor? That's just a shame. There's one scene where Luthor's goons kick the crap out of Superman and that sets up tension that should have been released by Superman's vengeance. But no. No vengeance. Apparently it didn't get personal for Superman even though it was clearly personal. Some people would say superman is not a vengeful creature, but he is. Remember in the Max Fleischer cartoons how Superman could just pick up a villain and throw him in jail without due process? In my mind, that is real vengeance and real power. But no.

Joe (Tom Hanks) is an Advertising Librarian for a medical supplies company in New York. His office is a hellish place that makes the bathroom setting in Saw (2004) look like a spa at club med. It is an office filled with flickering florescent lights and a man who endlessly repeats the same phrases again and again. One day Joe feels sickly and decides to go to the doctor who promptly informs him he has a brain cloud. As to what a brain cloud is exactly, we never find out, but we are informed it will kill Joe within six months. The next morning a spastic businessman, Samuel Graynamore (played hilariously by Lloyd Bridges) comes knocking at Joe's door. He has a proposition for Joe. There's a little known volcanic island in the pacific that has a special element Graynamore needs to make superconductors. The tribe on the island will allow Graynamore to take as much of the element as he pleases if he can find them a willing participant to jump into the island's volcano to appease the volcano gods. Graynamore believes Joe is his man and Joe, seeing he has nothing to lose, agrees to do it. The majority of the film follows Joe as he travels to the island. He buys a new wardrobe of clothes, hires limousines and travels luxuriously by air and by sea, all on Graynamore's dime. Along the way Joe meets Graynamore's daughters Angelica and Patricia (both played by Meg Ryan) and learns the value of truly living. I appreciated some parts of this movie very much. For instance, a scene in which Joe beholds a giant moon at sea and begins to pray is very powerful. But on the whole, Joe Versus the Volcano is uneven. If writer-director John Patrick Shanley had presented a more consistent vision I would have liked this film a better. The surrealistic edge to Joe is great, but too often it flips over into scenes that look realistic and lack stylization. It makes for a choppy film going experience.I also wasn't impressed by the romance between Joe and Patricia. It seems to me the sister Angelica was frivolous to the plot and Patricia, who becomes Joe's love interest, could have easily subsumed her role. When Patricia confesses her love to Joe it seems rushed and undeveloped. I didn't buy it. Joes Versus the Volcano is ultimately an oddity and if you're a Tom Hanks fan its worth checking out. But when I consider what this film is versus what it could have been, I wish what it could have been had won. RatingOn a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a Superman Returns (2006)RationalizationWhat it is versus what it could have been says it all. I really wanted Superman Returns to be awesome, but let's face it, Superman Returns is a disappointment. If you give Lois Lane a husband and a kid, you really can't root for Superman to get the girl in the end without also making him into a super-dick. And no hand to hand face-off with Lex Luthor? That's just a shame. There's one scene where Luthor's goons kick the crap out of Superman and that sets up tension that should have been released by Superman's vengeance. But no. No vengeance. Apparently it didn't get personal for Superman even though it was clearly personal. Some people would say superman is not a vengeful creature, but he is. Remember in the Max Fleischer cartoons how Superman could just pick up a villain and throw him in jail without due process? In my mind, that is real vengeance and real power. But no. In Superman Returns he just chose to be boring.
