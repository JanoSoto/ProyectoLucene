Bad directing, yes. Bad acting, most definitely. Bad sets, bad continuity, bad special effects; they're all in there. And REALLY bad use of actors the likes of Bela Lugosi (remember when he was actually scary in his Dracula heyday?) and Tor Johnson (yes, he was a good actor; anyone here recall his comedic turns in movies like The Lemon Drop Kid and his many appearances on The Red Skelton Show?).So all of this is true, then; but there's still so many who watch Plan 9 over and over again, drinking in every small detail and relishing such choice dialog as A flying saucer? You mean the kind from up there?, You see? You see? You're stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid! or the classic Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebody's responsible!. So what is it about a movie like Plan 9 that has people turn to it time and again, gets it colorized, brings vivid commentary from the likes of no less than Mike Nelson (from TV's MST3K) and even lauded for its 'merits' in the classic tome The Golden Turkey Awards?Quite simple it is one of those films whose badness is tempered by the sheer likability of what is put on screen. In other words, some scenes are so completely endearing and evocative of the work of Ed D. Wood that when you watch this film and see...* Pie tin spaceships wobble happily across a cloth backdrop sky * Police officers stumble over bending cardboard tombstones * A detective scratch at the back of his head with his own gun barrel * Scenes change from day to night and back again all within a few seconds time * A double for Bela who looks nothing like him holding a cape over his face and stand a good foot or two higher than Bela did * several different locations that use the same furniture and props as previous scenes had...it just gives you a warm, comfortable feeling in that after watching so many movies that sweat over every detail of the film, here is a director who is only interested in telling a spooky story as a fever dream; never mind that it makes no sense, never mind that much of the dialog is incomprehensible, never mind that the bookend scenes with Criswell hold no context, and certainly never mind that the most expressive actor in the whole thing is one who never acted in another film before or since (John Bunny Breckenridge).When you watch Plan 9 From Outer Space, you can at least see what Wood was *trying* to do, and that's enough. It certainly was enough to make a little film from 1959 fondly remembered even today, which is more than can be said for many other, bigger films from the same time period (quick name the biggest money-making film from 1959! ... See there?)So forget everything you've heard. Plan 9 From Outer Space is bad, yes, but not bad in the same way that films nowadays are bad (like Gigli or Baby Geniuses). This is a film that is bad in an endlessly re-watchable way, a way that will guarantee you watch it with a huge smile on your face and a song in your heart. It really is sort of comforting; like wrapping up in a huge furry blanket in front of a roaring fireplace on a cold winter day...with spaceships and Mona McKinnon, sure, but you get the idea.So I heartily endorse watching Plan 9 as soon as you can. As often as you can. With as many friends as you can. And, above all...enjoy.Eight stars out of ten...and this is all based on sworn testimony!

My personal favourite story was 'The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill' as I thought it was the most original & had the best ending as well. I'd put 'Something to Tide You Over' as my least favourite because it drags in places & seemed like a routine revenge thriller with a standard 'bad guy getting his just deserts' ending which you can see coming well before it arrives. The character's are all larger than life stereotypes but you need that when there's such little time to develop them & the trick is to make you care for them within that short space of time, Romero & King do a good job of it & they all serve their purpose well enough & they are quite well fleshed out.

This is as close to a comic book as you can get I suppose, there's some decent gore here, there are bullets through heads, bitten necks, slashed faces, decapitated heads, thousands of cockroaches literally explode from someones chest & there's plenty of blood splatter & other make-up effects.With a modest sounding $800,000 budget Romero has made five mini films & each one is pretty impressive, it's well made with good special effects from Tom Savini & nice production values.

Here's a few things that really bothered me  1)Death scenes. Whatever happened to taking a bullet, keeling over and dying ? Maybe it was part of the whole young-bucks-trying-to-outdo-each-other, but why the hopelessly overacted song-and-dance routines by Bronson, Vaughn, Wallace and Coburn ? What were these guys (and the director, I might add) thinking ? Being shot, doing a few twirls and squeezing in a spot of conversation with your adversary, preaching to a couple of kids, throwing the odd knife (at a dodgy looking brick, no less) or (my personal favorite) doing a veritable love scene which practically includes frenching a stone wall !? That's not just stretching credibility, that's outright laughable...2) Stunts. Badly performed and thus very obviously fake scenes once again stretch the credibility of the movie. The worst one is where a farmer strikes at one of the bandits seated on his horse with a scythe.3) Horst Buchholz. Clearly the least convincing actor of the bunch and also the least charismatic. Yet for some reason, he is pretty much the center of this film... Compared to Seven Samurai his character is a blend of two of the most important samurai (the young one and the farmer-turned samurai). Why ? Am I wrong in saying the focus on Chico causes other (much more interesting) characters played by charisma-oozing guys like Coburn, Bronson and McQueen to remain quite one-dimensional ? In my opinion the attention devoted to the development of the other 5 (besides Chico and Chris) was just too small.But these visual flaws pale in comparison to the plot holes, the illogical twists and turns in the Content of the film  1) Chico infiltrating in the bandido gang. At that point the bandits are NAMING their fallen comrades, which implies they know damn well who is part of their gang and who isn't. Yet Chico (who was shooting at them hours before) can mosey on into their camp in his bandido hat disguise without anyone going The hell is this guy ? 2) The farmers betray the gunfighters. The reason why is a bit dodgy to begin with, but what about their reaction to it ? Why would they even bother returning to help the villagers who clearly show they no longer want their help ? What is their MOTIVATION at that point ? Also, why not follow up on punishing the traitor(s) (I believe this Sotero character was the main culprit) who are in fact responsible for the deaths of 4 of their comrades ? 3) Calvera returning the guns, complete with ammo. In the very beginning Calvera explains it's not easy being a bandit chieftain. It seems this type of business venture includes important overhead costs, not in the least the feeding and arming of your bandido employees. So why GIVE AWAY free guns and ammo (to people who tried to kill you) ? Letting them go in order to avoid payback, sure.

That's not just stretching credibility, that's outright laughable...2) Stunts. Badly performed and thus very obviously fake scenes once again stretch the credibility of the movie. The worst one is where a farmer strikes at one of the bandits seated on his horse with a scythe.3) Horst Buchholz. Clearly the least convincing actor of the bunch and also the least charismatic. Yet for some reason, he is pretty much the center of this film... Compared to Seven Samurai his character is a blend of two of the most important samurai (the young one and the farmer-turned samurai). Why ? Am I wrong in saying the focus on Chico causes other (much more interesting) characters played by charisma-oozing guys like Coburn, Bronson and McQueen to remain quite one-dimensional ? In my opinion the attention devoted to the development of the other 5 (besides Chico and Chris) was just too small.But these visual flaws pale in comparison to the plot holes, the illogical twists and turns in the Content of the film  1) Chico infiltrating in the bandido gang. At that point the bandits are NAMING their fallen comrades, which implies they know damn well who is part of their gang and who isn't. Yet Chico (who was shooting at them hours before) can mosey on into their camp in his bandido hat disguise without anyone going The hell is this guy ? 2) The farmers betray the gunfighters. The reason why is a bit dodgy to begin with, but what about their reaction to it ? Why would they even bother returning to help the villagers who clearly show they no longer want their help ? What is their MOTIVATION at that point ? Also, why not follow up on punishing the traitor(s) (I believe this Sotero character was the main culprit) who are in fact responsible for the deaths of 4 of their comrades ? 3) Calvera returning the guns, complete with ammo.

There's no doubting how silly and cheesy it just happens to be, but gladly this item is not overly put off by it. There's a real kid-like mentality to it, but it breathes an sincereness that sweeps you along for the journey. Coming out the same time as Conan the Barbarian , it was hard no to compare the two. While Conan is obviously the better made grandeur production, it kind of had a pretentious feel to it and pacing was incredibly sluggish. Beastmaster might be systematic in the story, but to me it was far more entertaining. I might not win any votes for what I have just typed, but I'll stick to it.Coscarelli who co-wrote the story with Paul Pepperman takes the central idea of our hero communicating with animals from Andre Norton's novel of the same name. The campy plot is routine (there's no real twists or surprises) with a constant mixture of sub-plots and ideas involving different adventures (which were mostly about rescuing someone\/ or thing), which all lead onto the main story of Dar getting revenge. Some might be worthless and too straightforward with relax pacing, but I never found a boring moment within them. The direction by Coscarelli has a muscular touch to it and imagination to spare in some creative stabs and visuals. He knows how to create a rich atmosphere and his at his top when his going for that dark edge. The way he staged some of the one-on-one combat scenes though, came across as too clean and choreographed (especially the final climax). The larger battle scenes were gritty, kinetic and relentlessly staged though. Also don't expect much in the way of blood from this mainstream aimed piece.Since the budget was reasonably modest, it did give the film a slick technical advantage, but it definitely tried to outdo itself with the budget it had. The camera-work by John Alcott is beautifully sprawling and nippy. Same treatment for Lee Holdridge's grandly bravura sounding musical score that only heightens the atmosphere, locations and actions. Sound effects were effectively cutting and location sets were cleverly shaped. Only draw-card in this would be that editing at times came across as very ragged. Reading that the film was far shorter in the first cut, the producers then got the editors to extend certain scenes and Coscarelli and Pepperman had no say in it. That's disappointing, because it would have been better off with the first cut and maybe gained more respect. The acting is nothing sensational, but acceptably good. Marc Singer wasn't too bad and felt right at home in the part of Dar. Tanya Roberts looks drop dead gorgeous, but isn't called on to do too much. Chewing it up as the villain is Rip Torn as he fabulously turns it up with plenty of flavour and John Amos is acceptably solid as Seth.

To be fair about it, if disturbing stories don't bother you, or if you are not titillated by sexual-deviant scenes and just appreciate a film for its acting or its photography or its suspenseful, entertaining story fine, because this film offers all of the above. It also will leave you emotionally worn out and you certainly will empathize with Voight's character at the end.To me, however, this film may have all the above, plus a fine director in John Boorman (see The Emerald Forest), but I found it just too depressing and sordid.

I was only five in 1990, when Turtle-mania was sweeping the nation and now I'm 21, as Turtle-mania Part II threatens to grab a hold of a new generation of young fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Of course the TMNT got their start in the black & white pages of Mirage Comics, as first printed by artists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. What began as a one-shot parody of popular independent comic titles at the time (namely Frank Miller's Ronin and his revisionist re-workings of Marvel Comics' Daredevil), quickly turned into an overnight sensation, launching the greatest and most successful comic craze and merchandising campaign of the last 50 years. Several animated series and three live-action movies have only added to the madness started by Turtle-mania.The first film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, was released in 1990. Its sequel Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret of the Ooze was released in 1991. The second sequel came out in 1993. The Secret of the Ooze picks up right after the events of the first film. The Foot Clan (a group of martial arts-trained teenagers) has been virtually wiped out by our four mutant reptilian heroes - Leonardo (my favorite), Donatello, Raphael, and Michaelangelo - and a much-deserved rest is at hand. However, the Shredder returns, angrier and decidedly more fearsome than in the first film, with only one thing on his mind vengeance. So he reassembles the Foot Clan in the hopes of getting his revenge off the ground.But TGRI, the corporation responsible for the experimental mutagen that created the heroic foursome, has been hard at work recovering and disposing of the remaining canisters of ooze. Jordan Perry (David Warner) has been leading the mission of retrieval and disposal, with Channel 6 reporter April O'Neil (Paige Turco, a little less convincing than the first film's Judith Hoag) on the story. Shredder manages to steal the last remaining canister of ooze and uses it to create two mutants of his own Tokka and Rahzar (filling in for Bebop and Rocksteady, from the 1987 animated series), who have both been swimming in the same toxic cesspool as ye old Toxic Avenger. Guided by their Yoda-like sensei Splinter, the Turtles must find a way to battle their new mutant adversaries.Considering that The Secret of the Ooze is a sequel, it is a surprisingly entertaining sequel. Although not as a good as its predecessor (it is less dark and less violent and more slapstick than the first film), it is obvious that accommodations were made by the filmmakers to cater to a younger audience. Director Michael Pressman takes his cues from Turtle-mania hype, much rather than Eastman and Laird's source material, but The Secret of the Ooze is still a fun ride through and through.The acting and plotting is all sub-standard, but hey, it's a family movie based on a hyper-violent underground comic book. Along for the ride is high-kicking martial artist and stuntman Ernie Reyes, Jr. as the Turtles' new human friend Keno. Without a doubt, he probably gives the most enthusiastic performance here, even if his talents are somewhat underused; it's a shame he hasn't faired better over the years even though he has become something of a cult figure. The special effects by Jim Henson's Creature Shop (the film is dedicated to his memory) are astounding, even if somewhat dated. The action climaxes with a battle royal in a dance club where (who else?) rapper Vanilla Ice is performing Ninja Rap as our four heroes duke it out with Tokka, Rahzar, and a bunch of Foot Clan members (this segment alone is what will surely date the picture).For this Turtle fan, I plan on seeing the new movie next week with friends, just so you know.

This is an all-too-common complaint in which the protagonist comes across as bland, tedious and somewhat annoying, whereas his sinister opponents -- typically characterised as European and\/or effete against his all-American working-class worth, facially striking and\/or highly intelligent against his dogged brawn, verbally dexterous and\/or ironic against his inarticulate honesty -- are, frankly, the ones who instinctively attract my sympathies. The result of which is that I spend most of the film subconsciously rejoicing when things go wrong for the hero, while knowing that I am bound to be frustrated in the end as the entire plot is inevitably rigged in his favour! At the end of Saboteur, as in North by Northwest, it wasn't the name of the male lead I was looking up; as so often, it was more a question of 'Who was that actor with the wonderful face who played the villain?' From this inverted point of view the film does, of course, have quite a lot to offer. The beautiful blonde not only fails to believe the hero's story; she behaves intelligently for once, allowing him to think that she is on his side while driving him off to the police station and then tricking and physically overpowering him. She feigns frailty in order not to get left behind in the desert, then informs him once on the bus that she has every intention of handing him in after all. Admittedly she then goes on, predictably but not very explicably, to fall in love with him -- but as she is at pains to point out, it's a free country which means one can't have everything.The hero's attempts at amateur sleuthing, a flamboyant getaway, and undercover infiltration are also gratifyingly frustrated; in fact, this is one of the least heroic characters in the genre. Attempting while on the run to track down the true criminal, only to get arrested yourself, is perhaps par for the course in the wronged-man scenario -- but it makes a change to see the hero vault onto a horse, leap a fence and gallop off, only to be roped by the bad guys and dragged ignominiously to earth within minutes! And I found it very satisfying when Charles Tobin, surely the most charismatic of criminals, not only unmasked Barry's masquerade but revealed that he already had the girl in custody. The final revealing straw came when I caught a glimpse of the battleship lying sidelong across the ways like a great beached whale, and experienced a distinct unexpected lifting of the heart apparently the hero's oh-so-predictable eleventh-hour rush to foil the plot had failed after all...In total and in consequence, when the film is considered as a piece of propaganda -- which is its fairly unsubtle intent -- I can only say that where I was concerned it appears to have backfired badly. But then, of course, it wasn't aimed at me. It was aimed at the 'Average Joe' in 1940s America, and if it is formulaic and ultimately frustrating, it was as the result of a calculated effort to appeal.Oddly enough I did like the blind-man sequence, with its echoes of a similar scenario for Frankenstein's monster; it could have struck me as cheap and corny, but it didn't. Perhaps it is because in this case, the 'good' character is shown as refined of speech and quick-thinking -- note that the hero is still ultimately wrong-footed by the revelation that his host, for all his blindness, was not fooled for a minute! The cinema sequence at the end came across as very contrived, however Hitchcock clearly simply fancied the idea of having real gunfire in the auditorium mistaken for on-screen shots, although it's not at all clear why the audience reaction is to roll with laughter.It's only fair to admit that I'm looking at this film across a vast cultural gulf, and that somehow or other I managed to conceive a dislike for the main protagonist from the start, which inevitably coloured my entire reaction to the picture. Unlike other viewers, I don't think it was actually Robert Cummings' fault that I found the character less than charismatic; I do get the impression that this production was basically a case of Hitchcock sticking pet concepts together by-the-numbers to produce an uneven and sometimes illogical result.I don't hate the film, and in fact I'd give it a mild recommendation.
