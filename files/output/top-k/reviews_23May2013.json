In a now empty city, there is one man who has survived uninfected and must go on surviving while holding onto to both his sanity and his life. That is the premise of The Omega Man, the 1971 adaptation of Richard Matheson's seminal science fiction novel I Am Legend. But what has made the film stand the test of time to the point that it has become something of a cult classic over the last forty plus years? Due to its premise, the film rest heavily on the strength of the performance of lead actor Charlton Heston. Heston makes a believable last man on Earth as Neville, a former scientist and military man who came up with an experimental vaccine against a bio-weapon turned plague, struggles to keep his sanity between sheer loneliness and the threat of his fellow survivors who wish his destruction. The script gives Heston plenty to work from action hero moments to comedic moments (such as a scene in a used car dealership early on) and even some fleeting touching moments as well. Indeed, his performance also helps to make some of the films cheesier lines and moments seem believable. Heston as Neville more or less carries half of the film (and more especially the opening fifteen to twenty minutes) by himself and he never fails to keep the viewer engaged and interested in what is happening.But thanks to the supporting cast, the film proves its tagline of the last man alive...is not alone! Leading it as it were is Anthony Zerbe as Matthias, a former TV anchorman turned leader of the group of mutated, nocturnal albino like plague survivors called The Family who seek to destroy Neville. Zerbe's performance is oddly compelling, almost theatrical at times, as he plays the role of a crazed cult leader to the hilt. Playing the proverbial omega woman is Rosalind Cash as Lisa, though her performance is very much hampered by the fact that the script makes her into a Black Power caricature and as result has become incredibly dated. Much the same can be said of the performances of Eric Laneuville as Richie and Lincoln Kilpatrick as Zachary. The results then are mixed but, despite the dating of some performances, they help to keep the film moving and interesting.The film also features some strong production values for its time as well. In particular, there are some highly effective shots of an emptied out Los Angeles done decades before CGI made it much easier to accomplish. Those shots are put to special use during the film's first half and, along with stock footage and a few scenes in a flashback depicting the plague, help to firmly place the viewer into the film's world (which being the 1970s might well date the film in some eyes but certainly not mine). While the makeup used for The Family might not be up to 21st century standards, it is surprisingly effective especially in a reveal about midway through. Then there's the score from British composer Ron Grainer which mixes a whole bunch of styles together both for better and worse but, given that Grainer was the composer behind such TV themes such as Doctor Who and The Prisoner, it's a score that is memorable if at times for the wrong reasons.Yet the thing that perhaps stands out most about the film, along with Heston's performance, is its script. Writers John William Corrington and Joyce H. Corrington loosely adapted Richard Matheson's seminal science fiction novel I Am Legend and updated it somewhat for the early 1970s. For those who know the source material, there are many differences (such as the fact that Matheson's novel was a vampire story done in a science fiction context which, by Joyce H. Corrington's own admission on a DVD special feature, was something they dumped very quickly) but also some things brought from the novel into the film as well. The film then takes the bare bones of Matheson's novel, adding some action sequences, and very much does its own thing.The results of that are compelling. There are some fascinating subtexts going on in the film such as Neville's struggle to preserve a last vestige of civilization against the barbaric, nocturnal albino Family who see the world as it was, and therefore Neville, as evil (as Matthias describes Neville at one point One creature, caught. Caught in a place he cannot stir from in the dark, alone, outnumbered hundreds to one, nothing to live for but his memories, nothing to live with but his gadgets, his cars, his guns, gimmicks... and yet the whole family can't bring him down&#x85;) There's also an interesting quasi-Biblical subtext going on as well that becomes almost blatantly obvious at times during the back half of the film and especially in its final scene (this was an element that the much later adaptation of Matheson's novel starring Will Smith used quite heavily). That all being said parts of the script, like the film as a whole, have also dated horribly especially its African-American characters and some of its dialogue, something that as noted above hampers a few of the performances. For those faults though it is the script, both in its events and thematic, that makes the film compelling and entertaining.In the final analysis, The Omega Man then is an interesting film that has earned a cult status. Like many films after four decades it has become dated and cheesy in places. Yet the performance of Charlton Heston and its script, with its very loose adaptation of a classic sci-fi novel combined with some compelling subtexts, has also given it the ability to stand the test of time. The result, mixed though those are at times, is ninety-eight entertaining and at times thought provoking, minutes.

Jolly soundtrack by Frank De val , Robert Aldrich's usual , including the lively leitmotif , usual in the Herbie's series. This is a delightful film , the original entry was ¨The love bug¨ by Robert Stevenson with Dean Jones , David Tomlinson and Buddy Hackett , followed by ¨ Herbie rides again (1974)¨ also by Robert Stevenson and starred by Ken Berry , Stefanie Powers and Helen Hayes ; it's followed by ¨Herbie goes to Montecarlo¨ with Dean Jones , Don Knotts and Julie Sommers ; followed by ¨Herbie goes bananas¨ (1980 , or Herbie Torero) by Vincent McEveety starred by Charles Martin Smith and Cloris Leachman , among others and a 1997-for-television-movie with Bruce Campbell and John Hanna and a TV series , the most part filmed by Stevenson and Vincent McEveety and usually starred by Dean Jones .

He's an usual craftsman from Disney productions and a filmmaker of several TV episodes such as ¨Diagnosis Murder , Colombo , Pensacola , Airwolf , Dallas , Cimarron , Star Trek , Gunsmoke¨ and many others . This ¨Herbie goes bananas¨ is an amusing and engaging film with effective combination of primitive special effects , live action , adventure , fantasy and humor .

Love Bug's outing in which Herbie one again doing antics , it is full of pranks and car stunts that are great fun to see . ¨Herbie goes bananas¨ (1980 , or Herbie Torero) by Vincent McEveety starred by Charles Martin Smith and Cloris Leachman , among others results to be an agreeable though inferior Disney's love bug Wolkswagen plenty of action , slapdash , laughs and entertainment .Pete Stancheck (Stephen Burns) inherits from his Uncle Jim Douglas a race car being stored in Puerto Vallarta. With his friend Davy Johns (Charles Martin Smith) accompanying him to Pete is dismayed to learn that the car is an older model Volkswagen Beetle. But when Pete and his friend watch what the car can do and learn that it somewhat has a mind of its own, they decide to enter it into the Brazil Grand Prize formula one race. The adorable little VW helps its owners break up a counterfeiting ring in Mexico. The road to Rio has never been bumpier , as en route to Rio De Janeiro, Herbie gets the two friends have one problem after another as it attempts to help its new friend, a streetwise orphan named Paco (Garay) . Meanwhile , at a boat Pete fall in love for Melissa (Elyssa Davalos) and all of them are pursued by a trio of villains (John Vernon , Alex Rocco , Richard Jaeckel) .¨Herbie goes bananas¨ is a delightful Disney comedy that displays great loads of amusement , fantastic cars antics , slapstick , fun , giggles , chases are great fun to watch and being pretty entertaining . It's an enjoyable movie for kids and for those who enjoy cars racing round and round and bounds and leaps carried out by Herbie . In the sequence where Herbie walks the plank, a real Volkswagen Beetle was cast out into the sea , however it was never recovered. Herbie The Love Bug was a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle deluxe ragtop sedan painted in Volkswagen L87 pearl white. Under normal circumstances, the interior would be a matching white. However, Herbie's interior was painted a special non-reflective grey color so the camera and studio lights would not reflect . The actors seem to enjoy immensely , as Charles Martin Smith and Harvey Korman as a silly captain play of sympathetic manner and the mean-spirited villains performed by John Vernon , Alex Rocco and Richard Jaeckel are top notch .

The characters they create are definitely memorable and the situations in which they find themselves are compelling. Scripted by Vincent Patrick from his own novel, it's simply fine storytelling that keeps its grip for two solid hours.Rourke plays Charlie, a regular Joe whose loyalty to his screw-up cousin Paulie (Roberts) gets him into all sorts of trouble. Paulies' schemes get Charlie fired from his job, and when Paulie draws Charlie into a plan to steal some money, he doesn't tell him from whom they're stealing. And that man is Bed Bug Eddie (Burt Young), a mafia boss who is understandably going to be more than a little angry.There are all sorts of interesting characters in this involving, heavily layered story, and the film has a hell of a phenomenal cast as well, full of incredibly good character actors. Among the many familiar faces are Kenneth McMillan (endearing as the third participant in the robbery), Tony Musante, M. Emmet Walsh, Jack Kehoe, Philip Bosco, Val Avery, Joe Grifasi, Tony DiBenedetto, John Finn, Ed O'Ross, Frank Vincent, Anna Levine, and William Duell. They're all entertaining to watch, but Geraldine Page is especially riveting as the mother of a corrupt detective. Her scenes are the best in the film.Roberts - who totally rocks a perm hairdo - really goes all out sometimes in his performance; one can't accuse this guy of phoning it in. Rourke, overall more restrained, is quite likable; Daryl Hannah isn't bad as Rourkes' frustrated girlfriend.Director Stuart Rosenberg (Cool Hand Luke) has a great feel for the neighbourhood in his handling of the material. And Patrick injects some amusing comedy bits - such as Paulies' revenge against a portly parking patrol officer - into the story that provide some counterpoint to the drama. The denouement really is too abrupt, but on the whole this is a really enjoyable tale worth catching for fans of the performers and genre.Eight out of 10.

His ability to set himself up with great casts, resounding music, intellectual stories and top-notch special effects seems to come natural. So it actually is a surprise for me to say that his third theatrically released film did not entice me at all. I found a couple of good things to give credit for but everything else is tiresome and confusing because of how bad the writing is.Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) is the story of a man who happens to get a glimpse of a UFO and then decides to make it his goal to be able to see them again in person. Cast, as this ordinary man is Richard Dreyfuss who has worked with Spielberg two years before in another blockbuster called Jaws (1975). Here, Dreyfuss starts his character out like any other normal person but soon becomes absolutely bizarre in a sense that I'm not sure if anyone will understand what's happening to his character. And Spielberg wrote the screenplay! What's going on here? And what's with the François Truffaut's character? He can speak English but he also needs an interpreter? Ugh... I also got confused as the film was getting close to its end because it seem liked there was a secret love interest but it never was explained. How did Spielberg miss all these loopholes? Another aspect of the film that frustrated me was the dialog. It's not that the dialog was too simplified or overly complex - its placing was off. By placing I mean when people are trying to talk, there's always something else that is competing with it. Someone is trying to explain something but it's too hard to hear because there's a storm louder than hell. Or when Dreyfuss' character is talking on the phone, but can't be heard exactly what he's saying because a TV is on in the same room and you don't know which thing to focus on. Come on guys.There were even parts of the movie that was never explained. When an individual first sees the UFOs they end up getting this red burn on their body. It was never explained what it meant, what the possible side effects are or how it was gotten rid of. What is going on with this story telling?! Even more shocking was how bad and absent composing legend, John Williams' music was throughout the film. In some places of the movie, it was closer to sounding like a horror film with sporadic volume increases and scraping violins.The only credits I will give are the background scenery and special effects. I really like the scenic backgrounds, especially since it is in widescreen, the shots look great. And for 1977, yes, the special effects are great too. The lighting arrangements of the UFOs were mesmerizing. However, that's all I enjoyed. I am still truly shocked to how bored and confused I became with this Spielberg film.The shots look great but that's it. John Williams' music is random as well as uninspired and the screenplay was written very poorly.
