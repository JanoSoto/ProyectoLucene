A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment. I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry. You will be hearing about this movie. When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic. These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books. If you haven't read either, get to it.

Watching it again after many years, I recently had that sense myself. And I was around when this movie came out&#x97;although I didn't see it for years. I think it's dated because it reflects a time and a sub-culture that were quite small, that very few people became a part of or knew. And, it may seem so strange from the ways of culture today that few would find it of much interest. Ergo, slow and boring. It's billed as a comedy, but it isn't very funny. It's also a romance, but hardly. This is a story about one young woman who lived in a dream world, who fantasized about her life, and who hoped to land a very wealthy husband. It would be perfect even if it were someone she might love. Sure, there may always have been young people (women and men) who have dreamed about the glamorous life and lifestyle that wealth can bring, and who fantasized about finding the right rich person. But few of us were captured by the allure of our daydreams. In this film, Audrey Hepburn is captivated by it. Otherwise, there is hardly any plot at all. This movie came out while I was in training for the Army, so I didn't see it for many years. I can imagine that many in the audience saw it as a fairy-tale, sweet story about a girl looking for the dream life. But my first impression watching it years later on TV, was that it was about someone who had lost all sense of reason, and had fallen under a spell of riches and hedonism. Anyway, the movie is very dated in that way. Not that many aren't drawn to wealth, prestige, glamor or the power of riches today. They may be more sly and conniving, but certainly not in the category of gold-diggers, or perpetual daydreamers. Perhaps few people then saw the movie in that way, and I can understand that. Audrey Hepburn was a genuine dove of the cinema. Who couldn't like her, for her youth, innocent beauty and wonderful skills as an actress? Indeed, if it weren't for her persona in this film, its hit song and musical score, and a little bit of the showiness of the lavish wealth in corners of New York, I think this film might have flopped. The rest of the cast are mostly flat or wooden, or of no consequence to the story. George Peppard is flatter than a pancake in the romance department. I'm not sure it's all his fault &#x96; the script is so slow and dull.This movie got a big play and promotion in its day, and it did well at the box office. Probably because people were expecting a glamorous romance. What surprises me today though, is the high rating this film apparently has received by so many viewers. It's a 7.8 average from nearly 108,000 viewers in early 2015. Maybe there are more dreamers today than I thought, or people just like seeing the glitz and goofiness of the artsy set of the mid-20th century. But the film didn't fool those who count. In a year that had just modest competition for quality films, it won two Oscars and had three more nominations, including Hepburn as best actress. The awards were to Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer for the song of the year, Moon River, and to Mancini for the movie score.But for Hepburn and Moon River &#x96; and that is a lot, I can't see how film would be worth more than five stars today.

All of those elements make Midnight Run one of the best films of the 1980s and a fun,unforgettable movie.Midnight Run tells the story of Jack Walsh(Robert De Niro),a former Chicago Cop turned bounty hunter who after years of being a bounty hunter and chasing criminals wants to retire and open a coffee restaurant. But before he retires he has to track down and catch accountant and bail jumper Jonathan The Duke Mardukas(Charles Grodin)who stole 15 million dollars from the mob and is wanted by the FBI and Jack is asked to bring him from New York to Los Angeles in five days on a Midnight Run for 100,000$. But Jack and Jonathan's trip isn't going to be easy with the FBI,the Mob and a rival bounty hunter on their trail which leads to laughs and fun.Midnight Run is a brilliant and hilarious Action-Comedy that is an instant classic the first time you watch it,a movie that gives viewers 126 minutes of perfection where everything from the wonderful performances,direction,script and score just works from beginning to end. Midnight Run also succeeds in mixing together different genres and elements such as Comedy,Action,road movie and buddy picture playing with the formula of each of the genres and giving the film an unpredictable edge making Midnight Run one of the most entertaining movies that you will ever watch and is a movie that is up there with Lethal Weapon(1987),48 Hrs(1982)and Beverly Hills Cop(1984)as an amazing Action-Comedy and Buddy movie and ranks as one of the best in the two genres. The Comedy and laughs in Midnight Run are hysterical and funny with every comedic scene coming at a quick and rapid fire pace that just keeps on going and never stops until the end the Humor feels natural with many scenes that are classic and well-done. The Comedy is also smart and fresh because there is a balance of going straight and over the top and the movie never loses a beat. The Comedy and laughs also works thanks to the ingenious screenplay by writer George Gallo which is truly flawless,amazing and in my opinion one of the best scripts in a Comedy. The dialog by Gallo is masterful,funny and just makes the characters come alive whether it's the hilarious back and forth banter between Jack and Jonathan or the dialog from the supporting characters throughout spitting out memorable one-liners and exchanges that are very quotable and iconic. The Action scenes in Midnight Run are great because there is gunfights,car chases and explosions that are simple but effective but is done with enough excitement to keep viewers thrilled. Midnight Run smartly balances Comedy and Action with wonderful ease. The main characters Jack Walsh and Jonathan Mardukas are one of the most entertaining and memorable duos in movie history and what makes the two so fun is that instead of one being the usual(in typical Buddy Comedy Movies)straight guy and one being the funny guy both characters are straight and serious which make the scenes and dialog between Jack and Jonathan gold and funny. Like any duo Jack and Jonathan in the beginning don't like each other but as the two continue along with their journey the two begin to like and understand each other despite Jack wanting to kill half the time. Jack and Jonathan are also three dimensional characters because there are some scenes with some dramatic weight and depth which makes Midnight Run rise above the typical Action-Comedy and makes viewers like the characters more. Jack Walsh and Jonathan Mardukas are characters you will love from the start and are characters you won't forget. The ending of Midnight Run is outstanding and truly brings the movie full circle for Jack and Jonathan and gives the movie it's greatness while putting a smile on viewers faces. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is outstanding. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Jack Walsh,with De Niro being tough and funny at the same time. Charles Grodin is brilliant and hilarious as Jonathan Mardukas with Grodin bringing tons of laughs. De Niro and Grodin are dynamite together. Yaphat Kotto is terrific as Alonzo Mosley,an FBI Agent. John Ashton is wonderful as Marvin,a rival bounty hunter. Dennis Farina is outstanding as Jimmy Serano,a Las Vegas Gangster. Joe Pantoliano is delightful as Eddie Moscone,a bail bondsman. Richard Foronjy(Tony),Robert Miranda(Joey),Jack Kehoe(Jerry),Phillip Baker Hall(Sidney),Wendy Phillips(Gail),Danielle DuClos(Denise)and Thom McCleister(Red Wood)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Brest is wonderful,with Brest always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a solid pace. Great direction,Brest.The score by Danny Elfman is amazing and memorable,with Elfman doing a score that is very bluesy with adventure and excitement that adds to the film. Terrific score,Elfman.In final word,if you love Robert De Niro,Comedies,Action-Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Midnight Run,an excellent and hilarious Action-Comedy classic that you can watch again and again.

But before he retires he has to track down and catch accountant and bail jumper Jonathan The Duke Mardukas(Charles Grodin)who stole 15 million dollars from the mob and is wanted by the FBI and Jack is asked to bring him from New York to Los Angeles in five days on a Midnight Run for 100,000$. But Jack and Jonathan's trip isn't going to be easy with the FBI,the Mob and a rival bounty hunter on their trail which leads to laughs and fun.Midnight Run is a brilliant and hilarious Action-Comedy that is an instant classic the first time you watch it,a movie that gives viewers 126 minutes of perfection where everything from the wonderful performances,direction,script and score just works from beginning to end. Midnight Run also succeeds in mixing together different genres and elements such as Comedy,Action,road movie and buddy picture playing with the formula of each of the genres and giving the film an unpredictable edge making Midnight Run one of the most entertaining movies that you will ever watch and is a movie that is up there with Lethal Weapon(1987),48 Hrs(1982)and Beverly Hills Cop(1984)as an amazing Action-Comedy and Buddy movie and ranks as one of the best in the two genres. The Comedy and laughs in Midnight Run are hysterical and funny with every comedic scene coming at a quick and rapid fire pace that just keeps on going and never stops until the end the Humor feels natural with many scenes that are classic and well-done. The Comedy is also smart and fresh because there is a balance of going straight and over the top and the movie never loses a beat. The Comedy and laughs also works thanks to the ingenious screenplay by writer George Gallo which is truly flawless,amazing and in my opinion one of the best scripts in a Comedy. The dialog by Gallo is masterful,funny and just makes the characters come alive whether it's the hilarious back and forth banter between Jack and Jonathan or the dialog from the supporting characters throughout spitting out memorable one-liners and exchanges that are very quotable and iconic. The Action scenes in Midnight Run are great because there is gunfights,car chases and explosions that are simple but effective but is done with enough excitement to keep viewers thrilled. Midnight Run smartly balances Comedy and Action with wonderful ease. The main characters Jack Walsh and Jonathan Mardukas are one of the most entertaining and memorable duos in movie history and what makes the two so fun is that instead of one being the usual(in typical Buddy Comedy Movies)straight guy and one being the funny guy both characters are straight and serious which make the scenes and dialog between Jack and Jonathan gold and funny. Like any duo Jack and Jonathan in the beginning don't like each other but as the two continue along with their journey the two begin to like and understand each other despite Jack wanting to kill half the time. Jack and Jonathan are also three dimensional characters because there are some scenes with some dramatic weight and depth which makes Midnight Run rise above the typical Action-Comedy and makes viewers like the characters more. Jack Walsh and Jonathan Mardukas are characters you will love from the start and are characters you won't forget. The ending of Midnight Run is outstanding and truly brings the movie full circle for Jack and Jonathan and gives the movie it's greatness while putting a smile on viewers faces. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is outstanding. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Jack Walsh,with De Niro being tough and funny at the same time. Charles Grodin is brilliant and hilarious as Jonathan Mardukas with Grodin bringing tons of laughs. De Niro and Grodin are dynamite together. Yaphat Kotto is terrific as Alonzo Mosley,an FBI Agent. John Ashton is wonderful as Marvin,a rival bounty hunter. Dennis Farina is outstanding as Jimmy Serano,a Las Vegas Gangster. Joe Pantoliano is delightful as Eddie Moscone,a bail bondsman. Richard Foronjy(Tony),Robert Miranda(Joey),Jack Kehoe(Jerry),Phillip Baker Hall(Sidney),Wendy Phillips(Gail),Danielle DuClos(Denise)and Thom McCleister(Red Wood)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Brest is wonderful,with Brest always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a solid pace. Great direction,Brest.The score by Danny Elfman is amazing and memorable,with Elfman doing a score that is very bluesy with adventure and excitement that adds to the film. Terrific score,Elfman.In final word,if you love Robert De Niro,Comedies,Action-Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Midnight Run,an excellent and hilarious Action-Comedy classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

But unlike the past, this one wouldn't be a dream come true. This one would be a nightmare. Valentine's Day is a day of love, or is it? Not to a cupid masked killer. Roses are red, violets are blue, they'll need dental records to identify you. Valentine (2001) ensembles a cast that is very easy on the eyes. Katherine Heigl (Shelley Fisher), David Boreanaz (Adam Carr), Denise Richards (Paige Prescott), Marley Shelton (Kate Davies), Jessica Capshaw (Dorothy Wheeler), and Jessica Cauffiel as Lily Voight. Valentine is not your average horror movie, in fact it was originally to be a dark thriller until Warner Brothers wanted it to be a slasher. Valentine is shot beautifully and almost in a lush way, stylish and expertly structured. Directed by Jamie Blanks who also directed Urban Legend (1998.) While many critics thought Valentine was just another post Scream slasher, I disagree. Valentine is more like a horror movie from previous decades than early 2000s, which is probably why it got bad reviews. It's far from a Scream ripoff as some critics said. It has heavy character development unlike many horror movies. I have watched it many times and it remains a favorite. The acting is very good- sadly many people don't appreciate it for what it is. It almost has a comedic sense about it and the situations throughout. It leaves you on your seat. This is what makes Valentine unique. It has a lot of hate that makes no sense. I wish they'd mass produced the cupid mask, as you wouldn't expect a sweet cupid doing all of these evil deeds. It would've made a killer Halloween costume.. Valentine is definitely worth a watch.

Just thinking about The Maltese Falcon causes their eyes to glaze over, their mouths to water for the thirst of wealth.As Roger Ebert points out in his glowing review of 1941's The Maltese Falcon, the film isn't just a classic audiences have come to fawn over over the years. Consider film noir didn't exist before The Maltese Falcon was released. That Humphrey Bogart was still a character actor hiding in the shadows of James Cagney and George Raft. That Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet were not yet the supporting player dream team doomed to live on the exaggerated pencils of caricaturists then and now. That John Huston had never directed a film before.I saw The Maltese Falcon for the first time five years ago, sitting in the pitch-black room of my grandfather's study with his dinosaur laptop on a Saturday night. Then, I was just becoming acquainted with black-and-white films, only familiar with the likes of The Big Sleep and The Major and the Minor. All too young then, I found The Maltese Falcon to be too talky, to not have enough action. In my original review (my second, to be exact), I cited it as an overrated classic. How times have changed.It's talky, but not too talky; it's a classic, but not an overrated one. It's a cynical character study, the characters greedy, self-indulgent liars on the prowl for unfathomable riches. Instead of liking them, we're fascinated by their methodical actions. We don't connect with them on a human level; we feel the need to unravel their stacked façades, pulling apart the rambling lies and accidental truths spat out in an attempt to double-cross an obstacle. In his (arguably) career-defining role, Humphrey Bogart portrays Sam Spade, a smug private eye hired by the beguiling Miss Wonderly (Mary Astor). Wonderly claims that she is being hounded by a man named Floyd Thursby, needing immediate protection. Sam, nor his partner, Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan), believe her shaky story, but money talks, and she happens to have a lot of it. Later that night, while shadowing Thursby, Archer is shot to death in an alleyway. Thursby, as it turns out, was murdered that night too.Like all great film noir films, things are much more complicated than they first appear. Miss Wonderly's real name is actually Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and O'Shaughnessy isn't just a sexy dame gliding into detective agencies with falsely dramatic stories. She is actually a sinner desperately trying to get her hands on an international treasure otherwise known as The Maltese Falcon. Encrusted with gleaming gems, it is worth thousands. Also frantic for the treasure is Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), a mysterious European who walks around with a cane and flowery handkerchiefs, Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), a cackling, walrus- sized socialite, and his sidekick, the mousy Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.).As the MacGuffin of the jeweled falcon hangs over the heads over the characters, all we can manage is a sense of bewilderment; they are so caught up in their lies, their temptations, that gone is their moral compass, their common sense. The masquerades they put on for Spade, who acts as both a potential fellow shareholder and an outsider, cross the line, in their own psyches, that is, between the real and the fake.Though The Maltese Falcon was adapted twice before, once in 1931 and again in 1936 as Satan Was A Lady, the 1941 version bears the most distinct personality. In a world of detective agencies, trench coats, cigarette holders, and femme fatales, it is a carnival of film noir tropes before film noir tropes were even a thing. The dialogue is fiendishly clever, all characters putting on an act for the other at all possible times; Huston's direction is equally intelligent, complementing the auras of the characters with subtle camera tricks while keeping a sense of humor hanging above the dark motives of the plot.Just as unmistakable in memorability are the actors. Bogart's sniveling but tough persona is put to good use &#x97; in other films, he's a sort of grizzled good guy; in The Maltese Falcon, he's an anti-hero perhaps as greedy as the men he's trying to dig dirt on. Astor is the ultimate femme fatale, always seductive, always untrustworthy; Lee Patrick, as Spade's faithful secretary, leaves an impression with her adept tactics. Greenstreet and Lorre completely subvert the pitfalls most character actors face, immediately so large in their presences that Bogart and Astor frequently feel like supporting actors.Still more witty, unforgettable, and clever to me is The Big Sleep &#x97; The Maltese Falcon comes at a close second. While it isn't as labyrinthine as the former, it is much more sordid and embracing of its corrupt patina. There isn't anything like it &#x97; few crime films are as convincingly acidic.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"20 May 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Writer\/Director Robert Benton tells a sensitive story about the details that he had remembered (good and bad) as a child in the small town of Waxahachie, Texas (just south of Dallas) in the 1930s.As Sheriff Royce Spalding (Ray Baker) sits down to his evening meal with wife Edna (Sally Field), son Frank, and daughter Possum, he is interrupted by his deputy who tells him that he is needed to help corral Wiley, a drunk Negro. The intoxicated Wiley (De'voreaux White) has been wildly shooting his handgun down at the railroad yard. Unfortunately Wiley shoots Spalding in the abdomen, killing the sheriff. Without waiting for the justice system to take over, some local citizens dispose of Wiley. Edna becomes a young widow who knows little about maintaining her inherited 40-acre barely arable farm. Sensing that she is rather genteel and not used to back-breaking work, her unsympathetic banker Denby (Lane Smith) advises her to sell her land and board her two children somewhere. Then Moze, a Negro drifter, knocks on her door for a handout. But he hangs around doing necessary chores for food and shelter. Now Moze has learned much about cotton farming, and he becomes widow Edna's adviser on how to farm and also make enough money to save her land. Then banker Denby visits with his blind brother-in-law (as a consequence of The Great War), Mr. Will (John Malkovitch); Denby and his wife do not want to be involved with his care anymore. But the banker does propose that Edna take in Mr. Will as a modest paying boarder to help with expenses. She accepts. Over a short time the three adults and two children become like a family that will work hard to make the farm work and to maintain the property. Their bond is quite touching, and we root for them to succeed. There are some eye-opening scenes, like Edna personally preparing her deceased husband's body for showing in her living room and subsequent burial. Apparently that undertaking was typical in the days when funeral parlors were not always accessible. Then there is the bit where cash-strapped Edna cuts out cardboard soles for her son's worn shoes. And the film points out the tremendous work involved in planting, cultivating, and picking cotton. As picking cotton alone leaves bloody fingers, sore legs, and back pain, skilled labor is important. There are also some dramatic moments, like the tornado striking. But secondary stories, like the infidelity of Wayne Lomax (Ed Harris) and teacher Viola Kelsey (Amy Madigan), often detract from the main story-line and add little. We really care more about Edna's situation with her extended family and farm.The leads are sympathetic characters who grow with the movie. Because of wonderful acting, there were several Oscar nominations. Sally Field, very convincing as the determined widow, even won her second Oscar for Best Actress. The pacing and photography are first-rate. Director Benton skillfully grabs the atmosphere of the 1930s (like another movie of the genre, Bound for Glory, 1976).

The intoxicated Wiley (De'voreaux White) has been wildly shooting his handgun down at the railroad yard. Unfortunately Wiley shoots Spalding in the abdomen, killing the sheriff. Without waiting for the justice system to take over, some local citizens dispose of Wiley. Edna becomes a young widow who knows little about maintaining her inherited 40-acre barely arable farm. Sensing that she is rather genteel and not used to back-breaking work, her unsympathetic banker Denby (Lane Smith) advises her to sell her land and board her two children somewhere. Then Moze, a Negro drifter, knocks on her door for a handout. But he hangs around doing necessary chores for food and shelter. Now Moze has learned much about cotton farming, and he becomes widow Edna's adviser on how to farm and also make enough money to save her land. Then banker Denby visits with his blind brother-in-law (as a consequence of The Great War), Mr. Will (John Malkovitch); Denby and his wife do not want to be involved with his care anymore. But the banker does propose that Edna take in Mr. Will as a modest paying boarder to help with expenses. She accepts. Over a short time the three adults and two children become like a family that will work hard to make the farm work and to maintain the property. Their bond is quite touching, and we root for them to succeed. There are some eye-opening scenes, like Edna personally preparing her deceased husband's body for showing in her living room and subsequent burial. Apparently that undertaking was typical in the days when funeral parlors were not always accessible. Then there is the bit where cash-strapped Edna cuts out cardboard soles for her son's worn shoes. And the film points out the tremendous work involved in planting, cultivating, and picking cotton. As picking cotton alone leaves bloody fingers, sore legs, and back pain, skilled labor is important. There are also some dramatic moments, like the tornado striking. But secondary stories, like the infidelity of Wayne Lomax (Ed Harris) and teacher Viola Kelsey (Amy Madigan), often detract from the main story-line and add little. We really care more about Edna's situation with her extended family and farm.The leads are sympathetic characters who grow with the movie. Because of wonderful acting, there were several Oscar nominations. Sally Field, very convincing as the determined widow, even won her second Oscar for Best Actress. The pacing and photography are first-rate. Director Benton skillfully grabs the atmosphere of the 1930s (like another movie of the genre, Bound for Glory, 1976).

The director and the writer is Luc Besson. It is currently on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a cleaner, or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal. The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be. Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants. The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie. I gave it 10 stars. Dale Haufrect ","genre":null},{"date":"20 May 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Leon The Professional is a great movie from 1994.

They either love it or hate it. I thought that it was pretty good. It is a film with a separate plot, but grounded in the machinations of Hollywood. It seems to me that most of the cynicism expressed here has only gotten worse in the decades since. A film seems to need to be a sequel, a remake, or based on a comic book to get made these days. Anyway this movie's main character is played fairly well by the unlikeable, and vaguely creepy Tim Robbins. Nice job by Greta Scacchi, and also by Cynthia Stevenson, who I recall as playing a goody-goody character in a sitcom around that time, so her part was a nice departure.

They either love it or hate it. I thought that it was pretty good. It is a film with a separate plot, but grounded in the machinations of Hollywood. It seems to me that most of the cynicism expressed here has only gotten worse in the decades since. A film seems to need to be a sequel, a remake, or based on a comic book to get made these days. Anyway this movie's main character is played fairly well by the unlikeable, and vaguely creepy Tim Robbins. Nice job by Greta Scacchi, and also by Cynthia Stevenson, who I recall as playing a goody-goody character in a sitcom around that time, so her part was a nice departure.

Americans can tell the story of the Native Americans (or Indians), Australians have the aborigines, and as we see here the New Zealanders have the Maori people. This is a story that can be told in either an archetypal way or more specifically. (This film does a bit of both.) But we also have internal conflict. This is not just us versus them, but also us versus us. And then you have an even worse situation. When the minority is against the minority, who do you turn to? By turning to the majority, you run the risk of only bringing shame on your own people.

Which says a lot about it - the studio was looking for an Eddie Murphy vehicle to get him into the theaters, stat, and they threw this mess together as a result. One might question the fantastic castle the prince lived in during his years in Africa, as Africa is not known for castles. Rather, he more likely lived in a mud hut, but one larger than the other mud huts in his village. The vanity that an African prince somehow lived in the same sort of luxury enjoyed by royalty in western Europe is an insult to the intelligence of the audience, who surely must notice the lack of programs about The Great Castles of Africa on the AWE channel. Next, there is the Bruce Lee-esque fighting the prince engages in during the altercation at the restaurant. Again, Africa has no known martial arts tradition. Certainly, there is plenty of violence in Africa, but the brutality of child soldiers swinging machetes and inter-tribal limb-lopping is far from what Eddie portrayed in the fight scene.I think there's a lot of wishful thinking in this movie. Much of it centers around wishing the studio could throw a bunch of audience-pandering into a script, stick a star's name on the poster, and make a fortune. In at least the profitability sense, they succeeded, but this is not a good movie. Sad that it's one of the best Eddie managed to make.

So Sara ends up falling for Nelson(Reeves)and they live together all through the month of November. But Sara of course is hiding a terrible secret....and like in almost every Nicholas Sparks movies(seriously this film should have been created by him)as get this Sara is dying of cancer and that is why she breaks up with men as Keanu's charcther spots her taking pills and he had no idea that she was dying of cancer. So will Nelson help Sara with her illness.Bottom line like I have said I haven't seen this movie in years and I just thought I write a short review on it. I always like Keanu Reeves since Speed so it was nice to see him star in a tearjerker like this. Whenever its on TV again I will check it out if its on a early time.
