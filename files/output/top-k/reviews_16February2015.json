John Wayne, as the title might suggest, stands with one foot in an earlier time, and another in the first year of the twentieth century. The film has magnificent imagery. The characters are completely believable, with only John Carradine bowing to inevitable type casting. Ron Howard is compelling as the representation for the hope of the future, understanding that Wayne is really a living legend, and it's time for legends to become that.This was a fitting conclusion for Wayne. The character of J.B. Books could not really have been portrayed by anyone else. Wayne gave the role what it needed, a conclusion to a career. Geroge C.

The greatest of Abbott and Costello clash with the greatest of Universal's monsters and the end result is without question one of the greatest movies ever made. It works brilliantly as a comedy. It works brilliantly as a horror movie. You mix the two together and you've just got something totally special and unlike anything else out there. Mixing two genres is always extremely hard to do successfully but this film pulls it off remarkably well.I think the reason the movie works so well is that both sides play to their strong points. Abbott and Costello are at the top of their game together and they have their typical wonderful chemistry but it's bumped up to another level due to the terrific screenplay that gives them some of the best lines of their careers. The constant back and forth between the duo is just priceless and some of the times are just so hilarious that you'll have tears rolling down your face. As for the monsters, they're played extremely straight here and it's really easy to see why so many parents were upset that they were taking their kids to an Abbott and Costello movie only to have their kids terrified of the monsters. They're really played in a scary manor here and especially some of the violence, which is a lot stronger than in the typical monster movies.It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got everyone delivering some of the best work of their career. I've already mentioned how terrific Abbott and Costello are but they're also excellent with the rest of the cast. This is especially true for Costello who gets to mix it up with Chaney, Lugosi and Strange. Lugosi is extremely good here and, dare I say it, much more entertaining than even his role from the 1931 film. Chaney has no problem playing the sympathy card with Talbot and Strange makes for a very striking monster. Lenore Aubert, Jane Randolph and Frank Ferguson are also very good in their supporting parts.ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN takes two classics, the comedians and the monsters, blends them together and somehow it works.

So this movie was a pleasant surprise. This is a true story (with names and places changed) depicting the life of Sam Ace Rothstein and his friend Nicky. Sam is a great gambler, and works his way through the years, eventually landing a job running a casino in Las Vegas. He watches for cheaters and uses his friend Nicky (a man in the Mafia) to get rid of problems using violence. The Mafia protects Sam in return for scamming money from the casino. When Nicky starts to get careless with his tactics (even getting kicked out of Vegas' casinos and put on the infamous blacklist) and Sam's wife gets hooked on drugs and is cheating, things start falling apart. The FBI comes after the Mafia hard, and the Mafia in return starts to come down on everyone. As the story goes on things fall apart more and more. Sam and Nicky stop being so close, and violence gets worse and worse. This was a well put together movie. Excellent acting, great directing, and an amazing story come together perfectly.Soundtrack 8- Most of the time the music works for the movie, but there were a few moments where the music didn't fit in the film.Script 10- The writer knew how to write mobsters well. The writing was smart, and believable. I really liked this element.Originality 10- Yes, this is a gangster film. But when you watch this, you never know what to expect. This isn't your average gangster flick. There were all kinds of new elements, and it was well done.Cinematography 7- Martin Scorsese has a very specific style to his cinematography.

It isn't the best thriller of all time, though there are thrills. If you need lots of thrills, perhaps this isn't your movie. There are other things at work though, things other than thrills. There's anger. This movie will anger you. Infuriate you. It did me. The suffering of Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine at the hands of Michael Keaton is infuriating, in as much as they cannot do anything about it. Keaton plays a bad man Carter Hayes. He rents a room in a gorgeous Victorian house in San Francisco's - you guessed it - Pacific Heights neighborhood. Drake Goodman and Patty Palmer - Modine and Griffith, respectively - are living in sin, and renting out the room to Hayes. But Hayes never pays the rent and never leaves. It gets worse from there. It's kind of a cautionary tale for Renters. Most reviewers have called out Griffith and Modine's characters as being yuppies - I just see them as a normal middle-class couple. Not much yuppie-ish about them. Maybe I don't really know what a yuppie is. Doesn't seem generous to call them yuppies, though. And here, they are victims. I like Michael Keaton, though he's not on screen all that much, really. There's some convoluted back story to his character, though it's hard to understand why he's really as bad as he is. No matter. Michael Keaton is the best part of this movie. Matthew Modine is okay. He's kind of a chump. You kind of get the feeling like he partially deserves what is happening to him. Partially. And then there's Melanie Griffith. She's okay in it, too. She's the heart of the movie, really. The movie doesn't really suggest anything about who the characters really are or why they make the choices that they do. The movie is really all about the situation that they are in - and as I said, the situation is a bad one. It may be that the movie is trying to say something about the rights of property owners in this country, or the lack-thereof. But it doesn't explore that enough. Overall, it's a good little movie, and I recommend watching it, especially if you like Keaton. I like Keaton. I'm glad I watched.

","genre":"Thriller"},{"date":"16 February 2015","score":"","review":" This was the second film pairing of Fred and Ginger, and their first as the starring couple. Already, Fred had enough clout to demand that the dance scenes, in particular, be devised and filmed according to his specifications, which were quite different from those of the competing popular dance-oriented musicals of Warner, choreographed by the innovative Busby Berkeley. Fred insisted that all dance routines be filmed in one shot, if possible, and show the dancer's entire body throughout. No zooming in on one body part, such as the face or legs, as often done at times in the Berkeley films. No overhead shots of interesting geometric patterns of masses of dancers or single couples a staple of the Berkeley films. Songs and dances were to be integrated into the screen play, helping move it along, rather than being stage productions that had little or nothing to do with the screenplay, as in the typical Berkeley film. Fred always had at least one solo dance(two in this film), usually did most of the solo singing, usually with a back and forth duet or two with Ginger, and usually included at least one purely romantic partnered dance, along with one or more novelty, comedic or pure energy partnered dances. He very rarely did duet vaudeville-styled dances with other males, exceptions occurring in the later Broadway Rhythm of 1940 and Ziegfeld Follies, for example. Throughout his RKO period, he always worked closely with choreographer\/dance director Hermes Pan, who had been the assistant choreographer in the previous Flying down to Rio, which included Fred. Pan would leave RKO soon after Fred, to serve as dance director for many of Fox's musicals during the '40s, then to MGM during the '50s, again as dance director\/choreographer, including the occasional Astaire musical. Typically, Fred and Pan worked up the dance routines, Pan taking the role of Ginger, then brought Ginger in to learn her part. Unlike Fred, who did virtually no other films without Ginger during this period, Ginger was usually busy taking part in various non-musical films. For example, 5 films were released including her in '34 vs. just this one including Fred. Besides the presence of Ginger and Pan, Fred had several advantages in this film to ease his responsibility as the featured male. He, as well as Erik Tonetti and Eric Blore, reprised their roles from the Broadway play this screenplay is based upon. Although only Porter's classic Night and Day was retained from among the original songs from the play, the humorous complicated plot of the play was mostly retained.Besides Night and Day, 4 new songs were composed by others, of which only The Continental is memorable as a song so memorable that it won the Oscar as The Best Original Song, and was played to death during the extremely long dance production it was the center piece of. It wasn't until the much more varied ballet production in the '51 An American in Paris that a slightly longer dance production was staged. Here, it includes several segments featuring Fred and Ginger as the exclusive or main dancers, interspersed with segments with many dancers, sometimes acting as if they were in a Berkeley film. As in the long Carioca dance production, in the previous Flying down to Rio, the lyrics were periodically sung by 3 soloists, beginning with Ginger. In addition, Fred comes up with a very imaginative way of fooling Tonetti into thinking that he and Ginger were still upstairs, when they go down to join the other dancers.Early in the film, Fred does two solo dances, to Don't Let it Bother You and Needle in a Haystack. The second of these has him dancing around his room, including on the furniture, though not on the ceiling, as in the later Royal Wedding. The point of the lyrics is that he desperately wants to find Ginger, whom he briefly interacted with, by chance, with no clue where to find her.Let's K-nock K-nees is a fun romantic novelty song and dance, begun by a very fresh-faced 18 y.o. Betty Grable, while trying very hard to 'put on the make' with the puzzled middle-aged E.E. Horton, who eventually joins in(I'm surprised this passed the censors). Later, it's taken over by a squad of male and female dancers, with Betty and Horton again dominating near the end. Unfortunately, Betty would make little further progress toward becoming a leading lady until 6 years later, when she moved to Fox, and lucked out as a last minute replacement for the ailing Alice Faye.Fred is still trying to woo the non-receptive Ginger, as they happen to be alone on a danceable floor at a beach. Fred begins to sing the lovely Night and Day. Ginger tries to leave, but Fred keeps pulling her back, 'forcing' her to dance with him. During the dance, it appears she tries to leave several times, but Fred pulls her back. But at the end, she looks enthralled with Fred briefly, but then becomes angry again, as she mistakenly believes he is the man she expecting to show up, relating to her desire to divorce her estranged husband. This is one of the best of the Fred and Ginger romantic dances, through their film series, with Ginger's periodic reluctance actually adding to its interest.The supporting actors E.E.Horton, Erik Rhodes and Eric Blore, as well as Ginger's scripted aunt, Alice Brady, are all great in contributing humor to the screenplay. Ginger's acting, which largely consists of trying to resist Fred's advances, is also superb. I really miss Alice's humor and Grable's independent number in the subsequent Fred & Ginger films.

I hate all of the contents of it. However, it does closely stick to the book and everything is portrayed unbelievably well. The movie is also filmed incredibly by Stanley Kubrick and Malcolm McDowell plays (in my opinion) his best, and scariest role. McDowell ran away with it. I should specify, I don't like this movie, however; I respect it so much. The story of why the book was made is so shocking and sad (go look it up if you don't know it) that the movie makes sense and I see why all the sex\/rape and violence is actually necessary. Also, the way the movie is made is so well done and revolutionary for the time that it deserves respect, and as a movie lover, this was a very well directed and well executed movie. ItI saw the movie for the first time last year after reading the book. I saw it, I hated, yet I couldn't get it to leave my mind. I would constantly think about it and let it terrorize me. Until a few months ago when it hit me. This movie is so deep. I first thought it was a psychological thriller intended to show how someone who is so bad can change and make you feel sorry for them. But no. It's about forgiving those who have done the unforgivable.

Anderson's first foray into the adaptation world after some reasonable films like 'Soldier' and 'Event Horizon', his CV didn't look too shabby but previous attempts at this sort of genre proved dismal.Amazingly enough this first offering in what is now an overly ridiculous 'Matrix' 'Blade' 'Underworld' monster mash mess is actually quite good and sticks to the original formula. It all kicks off inside the well known mansion but in an imaginative spin delves deep underground to the secret Umbrella facility. Here we get a very admirable 'Aliens' type thriller as a team of commandos battle to survive against a sadistic mega computer that runs the facility and of course lots of undead creatures\/monsters. So the whole film is contained within the underground labs instead of roaming the mansion which at first seemed wrong. Maybe they could of done with some mansion action but it actually works well. Later adaptation 'Doom' does seem somewhat similar in premise though, slight case of concept rip methinks.Naturally the effects are mostly CGI for the creatures and they do now look rather crappy, very obvious. Of course you can't pan a film for that but the CGI hasn't dated well, where as sets and overall look for the film isn't too bad, zombies look a bit childish though. It is nice to see most of the video game nasties in the film though, Anderson certainly did well not to stray far from the source yet add to it as well. Zombie dogs which aren't fully CGI but real dogs with makeup is a nice touch, a hint of the crows and Lickers which are good n scary...accept for the fact they are all fully CGI. The Red Queen computer character is a good addition to the fray and quite eerie at times also 'you're all going to die down here'.This film is a welcome presentation of the franchise and shows what can be done if done properly. Its still mind boggling to me that the film is actually a reasonably scary horror flick! there are quite a few good jumpy moments and certainly no hesitation with blood. A creation of slow building dread and suspense is well handled throughout, alongside some nifty visual moments and a good if slightly clich√©d bunch of commandos all adds up to a darn fun ride.Yes you can see many steals from other similar films (the usual tough bunch of soldiers taken down one by one) and the characters are all generic copies stemmed from a certain Cameron film but the fact its not a kiddie flick and watered down is fantastic and astonishing. There is no silly slow motion nonsense, no over the top set pieces, actually Jovovich plays it for real and isn't a Selene clone from 'Underworld'...yet.
