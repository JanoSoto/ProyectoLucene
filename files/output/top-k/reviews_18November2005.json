[{"date":"18 November 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" PATCH ADAMS, in my opinion, is a very hilarious and touching movie. When Patch (Robin Williams) used his humor to help patients who were suffering or on the verge of death, I laughed really hard. I really hated Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton). This was because of the way he treated Patch. Also, I thought that Carin (Monica Potter) was a very beautiful woman, even though she wasn't very nice to Patch at first. All in all, this was a very good movie. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Robin Williams, and you haven't seen this very hilarious and touching movie, I highly recommend it! You're in for a real treat and lots of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
