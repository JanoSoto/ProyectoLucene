It's definitely in my list of the top 5 funniest movies of all time.  I was surprised to see that Entertainment Weekly and Roger Ebert both gave it bad reviews (well, actually, not bad reviews, just not reviews that could be interpreted as good.)  I guess it's an acquired sense of humor, and the plot leaves some to be desired.  There isn't really much plot, and the movie is pretty slow paced (it's obvious that this was once a play), so if you don't like dark humor, don't rent this.  It's basically filled with lots of one-liners and such, most delivered by Parker Posey, in what is probably her greatest performance to date.  While Parker usually plays the same character you love to hate (or just plain hate), she always plays it well.  Has she ever played a good-natured character?  Anyway, if you like dark comedy, and you can enjoy a movie no matter how sick the plot is, I would think that you would love this.

I also liked the actors very much. The only one I didn't enjoy so much was George Brent, but then I never like his acting in any picture. The rest of the cast is perfect.Sometimes the story gets a little boring - most of the times it happens when Ethel Barrymore is talking - but that is, in a way, good, because it gives you that sense of desperation and anxiety.

Even his playing with the Matrix comes across nicely and - surprise - fittingly. The bad guys are like a hibred of the Johnsons from the original Die Hard, the boys from MIB and a bit of Max Headroom - hilarious!The camerawork, CGIs and SFX are excellently done and choreographed and the plot with its different - at times almost confusing - levels is very well brought across with just the right mix of fast-paced action and time left to explain and reflect upon the new and disturbing developments.Is reality real?

However, it is Jason Isaacs that, in the spirit of Alan Rickman and Tim Roth, steals the show with his deliciously evil portrayal of Col. Tavington.  What separates this epic apart from the other summer movies is Rodat's wonderful ability to evoke several different emotions.  Rodat wonderfully establishes many bonds and then breaks them abruptly with the death and destruction of war.  Truly there is more suffering in this movie than I have seen in almost any, and it makes the payoff at the end (you were aware that we actually win the war right?) that much better.  Emmerich also is able to capture the essence of combat tactics of the day.

Truly there is more suffering in this movie than I have seen in almost any, and it makes the payoff at the end (you were aware that we actually win the war right?) that much better.  Emmerich also is able to capture the essence of combat tactics of the day.  Be it the minute-man behind the bushes style, or the open field style Emmerich milks every dramatic possibility from these old style battle tactics.  All this combines to make a wonderful movie that should not be forgotten come Oscar time (especially Isaacs).

Well, it is mainly pointed towards them, but it's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience. This time around, the Muppet gang try to get on Broadway, with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced, leading them to splitting up. But Kermit won't stop, and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia! It's a send-up, in part, of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical, only here there's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments (Lou Zealand's boomerang fish; Gonzo's water-stunt display, the whisper campaign, among many others), but also with a lot of heart too. The Muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream. While not as totally original in scope as the Muppet Movie, it's got many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations all over Manhattan, and even some intonations of inter-species dating (and marriage)! Cameos include Liza Minneli (a frog?), Elliot Gould (as the cop), Brooke Shields (propositioned by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing-along, or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best Muppet movies.

I went to the theatre to see it and was so completely blown away that I returned the next night to see it again.There is really not a single bad thing about this movie.  The cast, which includes familiar names like Julianne Moore and William H. Macy and lesser knowns like Melora Walters and Jeremy Blackman, is just spectacular.  With the sheer size of the cast, a lesser director would be unable to effectively tell the story (in fact, this happened; see _Beautiful People_) yet Paul Thomas Anderson has a uncanny sense of timing that juggles the various plot elements perfectly, so that the entire film flows into one story, rather than nine.Speaking of the story, the script itself is top-notch.  Besides being engaging (three hours fly by like 90 minutes), there is an important message to the film with complex social, religious, and philosophical implications.  Even better, the movie isn't preachy!  You actually have to discover its theme for yourself and decide what each of the characters got out of the film.  While some may not appreciate this, I find it highly commendable in an era of hit-you-over-the-head, blatantly obvious, socially conscious films that bombard the audience with already apparent (and self-important) messages about an easy topic like sexism, war, etc.A common objection to this film is that it is long.  Well, if you sat through _Titanic_ or _The Green Mile_, this film should not seem long at all.  Unlike those films, _Magnolia_ actually uses all three hours and eight minutes of its screen time.There's not much more to be said.  The only down side is that it will be nearly impossible for Mr. Anderson to follow this one up.

I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys `a good movie'. It is almost 20 years old and I still watch it when I can. I've owned it on videotape and now, on DVD as well. It moves me as much today as the day it hit the theatres here in the states. An awesome movie, good vs. bad, honor and truth... Beautiful sound track too!

A fairly compelling story about the unusual experiences of one young man raised in an orphanage. Movies that provoke any degree of thought or introspection, these days, are rare.  This one does just that, substantially.
