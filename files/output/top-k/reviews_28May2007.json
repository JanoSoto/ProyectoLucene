Daringly saving the life of a spider he comes into possession of magic boiled crocodile tongues, after which an enormous peach starts to grow in the garden. Venturing inside he meets not only the spider but a number of new friends including a ladybug and a centipede who help him with his plan to try and get to New York.This film is truly delightful for the whole family. It's sweet, funny, and has a great musical score. I liked the stop-motion animation, which was fantastic in this film. It really had a lot of imagination to it, too.There are even some great action scenes, although some might scare little children. The characters are lovable in the film. This isn't a masterpiece, but it sure is just a film to watch with the family if you have nothing else better to do.

When we go to see a Tim Burton film we know we are in for a dark, Gothic style trip into the black comedy mindset of Burton. Batman, however, is a very different Burton film. Unlike its sequel, Batman Returns, this first film seems more like a film noir that could have been directed by almost anyone than a twisted Burton vision.Not that its not very good. Batman is a very entertaining romp that takes the character of Bruce Wayne out of his Adam West camp-fest and returns him to the darker beginnings of the graphic novel. Not that there aren't hints of camp in it - just take a look at Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker. Unlike the more over the top performance of Jim Carrey as the Riddler in Batman Forever, Jack's is more controlled than you would first think. His Joker is a psychopathic murderer, as he should be. We get a brilliant origins story for the villain of all villains, though the addition of the crime of murdering Buce Wayne's parents does grate at times.As for the title character, Michael Keaton gives a very serious performance of a man teetering on the edge of his sanity. Remember Batman is not a superhero - he is a grown-man who dresses up as a bat. Therefore Keaton has to give a very real performance, and unfortunately, though I enjoyed it, this is given more gravitas by the very un-real performance of Nicholson's Joker.Kim Basinger, as the love interest for both foes, starts out as seen as a pair of shapely legs and gradually gets worse from there. She is constantly screaming during the middle of the film and really doesn't get a chance to do anything other than be the token female. This is, perhaps, one of the problems with the script of the film which, as previously mentioned, does hold a few problems, particularly towards the end; although the set pieces at the end are magnificent, and we do at last get a hint of the dark, Gothic Burton genre that we are more used to.However this all does not mean that any die-hard Burton fans should poo-poo Batman for, I believe, two important reasons the first is that we must remember that Batman was still relatively widely known as the 60's camp fest. For Burton to reveal his true vision of the Dark Knight would, I feel, have been too much in the first film, and it works much better in the second when he was given more control. the second reason not to totally ignore this film is the wonderful score by Danny Elfman, one of the musts when making a Tim Burton movie. Heroic with a sinister twist in its marches, the only thing that really pulls it down is the addition of the rather rubbish songs by Prince. The end titles song, in particular, is awful beyond compare, and I warn you all now to steer clear of the music video for this song you will go blind.On the whole Batman, at times a very flawed film, does what it set out to do it rescued the character from the jaws of camp hell.

Each page was a scene in a story of some kind, but the plot was bizarre and inscrutable -- something to do with gold dust and diesel engines and parallel universes. I recall showing it to my Mom and we both wondered whether the coloring book guys had been chewing peyote that day.And then I saw this execrable film, and it all became clear. The coloring book was based on the plot of this movie -- and the screenplay for Thomas and the Magic Railroad indisputably was written under the influence of mind-altering substances.And it isn't JUST that the plot makes no sense. There's also the acting, which is horrible even by the standards of children's movies. Peter Fonda (!) wanders through the film in a kind of drooling stupor. He's supposed to be depressed, but to me he seems more like the victim of a brain injury, or perhaps a massive overdose of Thorazine.In fact, it may well be that the director secretly dosed Fonda, and the rest of the cast, with some kind of high-powered anti-psychotic medication during filming. Any normal person would, after all, need massive pharmacological intervention to keep from crying tears of laughter at the horrible, stilted lines the characters are required to speak.Did I mention that the plot makes no sense at all? Meanwhile, here's one idle observation for the good engines of Sodor If an evil diesel engine with a crane on top (!) is out to ruin your magic parallel universe (!!) and destroy you, just STAY A FEW TRACKS AWAY. The crane only reaches so far, and it's not like he can drive off the track to get you. Or maybe your friend the conductor could, I don't know, maybe THROW A FREAKIN' SWITCH once in a while. Seriously, I can see how the Killdozer, or an evil car like Stephen King's Christine, could make some real trouble, but how tough can it be to avoid an evil TRAIN?Speaking of the conductor, let me just say this about Alec Baldwin's work in this film It made me wish that the Canadians really had bombed the Baldwin brothers. (If you don't get that reference, run, don't walk, to the video store and rent South Park The Movie.) In sum, I would place this film among the top three Worst Movies That, Luckily, Most People Have Never Seen. The other winners(1) Showgirls (2) The Norseman They should put all three of these movies on a DVD and force the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to watch them. The heck with the Geneva Convention.

Each page was a scene in a story of some kind, but the plot was bizarre and inscrutable -- something to do with gold dust and diesel engines and parallel universes.

I have seen this movie for several years in the video store, but it never really piqued my interest. I just recently signed up for one of those rent-by-mail DVD things (you probably know the company, but they ain't payin' me, so they can do their own plugs), and this was one of their Instant Watch movies, so I decided to give it a try. (They also were suggesting it pretty heavily based on my previous movie ratings.)While there is some silliness in this movie, none of it comes across as completely unbelievable, nor simply thrown onto the pile of already ludicrous gags. (Okay, a lot of it is highly unlikely, but many of us with family who only seem to function when they're screwing something up can relate...)The plot is not completely original (guy tries to get into college, many hare-brained schemes blow up in face, zany characters abound, life lessons sprinkled here and there), but it is pulled off brilliantly. I can thoroughly enjoy dopey, even bad movies, but this one actually EARNED the laughs it brought forth! (It is very hard these days to find a movie with real laughs in it. I found myself laughing out loud to several sections of this film. Even other movies I've enjoyed have had a very difficult time doing this.)The writer for this movie, Mike White (cameo as the English teacher) really knows funny! He also wrote School of Rock (cameo there as Ned Schneebly), and has definitely proved himself in my book.The cast of Orange County is stellar. Colin Hanks delivers a truly sublime performance, acting the sensitive, intelligent straight man to an all-star cast of misfits, managing to carry the viewer eagerly through his tale of dreams and obstacles without veering toward the After School Special feeling. Catherine O'Hara and John Lithgow are a delight to the screen, and Jack Black brings the laughs by the shovelful. (There are tons of other fantastic comedy cameos in this film; read the cast list, and you'll see a who's who of comedy greats in the last 20 years.)This movie strikes an almost perfect balance between zany laughs and feel-good moments. It manages to entertain without focusing on laughs-at-any-cost, and manages to be feel good without tending towards the maudlin or sappy.If you liked American Beauty, School of Rock, National Lampoon's Vacation, you should run not walk to the nearest video store and treat yourself to some laughs!

I love the campy one liners and the over the top action, but it was a great movie. It was well paced and they are no real complaints about the movie. Rickman was amazing and it is one of the best bad guys performances and the one scene when we snaps at John's wife is priceless. It is kind of fun to see how a lot of action movies pull from a lot of stuff from this movie (even though I sure this movie got a lot of it's substance from other movies). One of the highlights of the movie is the music and when the bad guys actually manage to open the vault one really feels a swelling of emotion as the music grows. The one problem I have is that the LAPD is not that dumb and the FBI agents are not that dumb and the fact that Al knew better than both of them was kind of silly, but I did like the dynamic of the two FBI agents and the way they fit into the movie as a bunch of idiots, but it was almost a little too much. The humor they tried to inject with the black guy who was cracking the vault was a little dry, but not to the point where I hated him. The limo driver's smile got annoying too, but I liked his character for the most part. Bruce Willis did a perfect job with the character and played him perfect. I like action films like this where there is unnecessary swearing and violence, but it works and I hate how Hollywood is making a lot of action films with a pg-13 rating when i think it would be so much more enjoyable with just letting them swear and be really violent. I know one does not need the violence, but I think it does so much more for the movie experience by letting the characters express themselves with their violence. The last gripe I have is that the ending with Karl jumping up out of nowhere was totally unnecessary and it really annoyed me. The cop did not need a complete arc and John's and his hug was all the ending needed. This will probably always be one of the my favorite action films.

If you can't get the main character to stay, drop it.Halfway through the movie we started wondering Will this never end? and Are we there yet? - and finally we could flip this yawner out of the DVD player - never to be played again.

No. Reason with the guy maybe? No. He throws him to the ground, boots him in the stomach, beats up his two friends and throws him through a window. He even follows it up with a glib I believe there's a vacant seat. Of course, in real life, the bus would have ground to a halt while the driver accessed the damage and refused to drive on, quoting union regulations, and the pregnant woman would have screamed at him for excessive behaviour. Instead, the scene cuts away as we get to more testosterone-packed japery. But it's also the hypocritical morality that annoys. I hate knives winces Stallone after being threatened by one. So knives and stealing bus seats are bad. Throwing a man through a glass window is perfectly acceptable? You might think I'm reading too much into what is just a brief scene, yet it's scenes like this that regularly punctuated vacuous action movies and went unchecked. For Stallone's Ray Quick, it's not an eye for an eye, it's your entire head, arms and body for a papercut.A later scene has James Woods gain the respect of some underling cops by threatening to blow them up with Semtex.

It's a tale of much contrivance but little consequence, on which every one-note motivation is played out before the camera, allowing for no suspense or intrigue. But let's cut to the chase There's only one reason why people really watch this film, and that's to see Sharon Stone naked in the shower. Seeing pneumatic parodies of the human form with star egos hopelessly out of control isn't pleasant. And in what film doesn't Stone take her clothes off anyway? In the middle of all the male egos Stone is very much odd woman out. While her role is supposedly that of empowered female, she needs a man to help her do her work and is there as a physical victim to show their power. Any other function is merely that of receptacle to sexual desires, Stone doing that sexy voice of hers which is as sexy as a sack of kippers. Even searching her for weapons in a church can be a masturbation analogy.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"28 May 2007","score":"","review":" I eagerly waited in anticipation for the 2001 martial arts action flick Exit Wounds six years ago because I thought it would signal the return of Steven Seagal, that stoic Aikido master who starred in Above the Law (1988), Hard to Kill (1990), and Under Siege (1992). While it is good to see him back in form (even if he has put on a little bit of weight) after a sharp decline in his popularity, the rest of Exit Wounds suffers from a lot of cop movie clichés and a plot that really just moves through the motions of the typical cop movie.Other than that, Seagal's acting and fighting style haven't changed. He still snaps and breaks limbs with his black-belt Aikido mastery, kills lots of bad guys and saves the day, all without so much as even raising his voice. In Detroit, Michigan, Seagal is hard-boiled street cop Orin Boyd, who is busted down to patrolman after saving the vice president from a gang of would-be assassins on a bridge. It turns into a fiasco for the Secret Service when Boyd tosses the V.P. over the bridge and into the river, and as a result Boyd is sent to the 15th Precinct, the worst in Detroit.It is here that Boyd knocks heads with many of the other officers and becomes waist-deep in police corruption, and stumbles upon their connection to a shady street hustler, Latrell Walker (DMX). The bad cops want Boyd out of the way, so he's busted down even further to crossing guard (this scene alone will get a lot of laughs just to see Seagal doing a few comedic hi-jinks that really seem out of character). (There is also another comic scene where Boyd is sent to an anger management class and busts up a desk when trying to get up out of it after being asked to introduce himself.) But he does find some allies in fellow cops George Clark (Isaiah Washington), Strutt (Michael Jai White), and tough-as-nails Commander Mulcahy (Jill Hennessy).Exit Wounds, adapted from the novel by John Westermann, comes to us from blood-letting Lethal Weapon and Matrix producer Joel Silver, and director Andrzej Bartkowiak (who was at the helm of Jet Li's 2000 American starring debut Romeo Must Die). While Exit Wounds does not do much to change the formulaic cops & robbers theme, it gets by plenty on the strength of Seagal. But this isn't classic Seagal, unfortunately. Exit Wounds was released on the heels of the popularity of The Matrix (1999) and as such, was one of the many action flicks to try to use wire-fu (a technique borrowed from Chinese wuxia films where actors are attached to wires that are eliminated in post-production using CGI to make them seem like they can defy gravity).While it might make sense to see Seagal get with the times, it doesn't fit his Aikido skills. It's very troubling to see a martial artist as skilled as him have to rely on such technology. It's just not like him to go that far. I want to see Seagal snap limbs the old-fashioned way since that's what I'm used to seeing him do and want to see him continue doing. DMX wasn't really all that convincing either as the thug-with-a-heart-of-gold, who eventually comes to be Boyd's closest ally on the street (he was really much better as a supporting figure in Romeo Must Die). And Tom Arnold and Anthony Anderson also appear as comic relief sidekicks television personality Henry Wayne and T.K., respectively, and the two do have one hilarious dialogue during the credits.Exit Wounds isn't a total failure just because Steven Seagal is here and is given something to do. But his popularity for a new generation of fans was short-lived following the failure of Half Past Dead the year after, in which Seagal again relied on fancy technology to get with the times. It's just that we want to see the old Seagal; rolling with the new isn't always a good thing, you know.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2007","score":"","review":" I eagerly waited in anticipation for the 2001 martial arts action flick Exit Wounds six years ago because I thought it would signal the return of Steven Seagal, that stoic Aikido master who starred in Above the Law (1988), Hard to Kill (1990), and Under Siege (1992).
