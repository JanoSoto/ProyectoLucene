Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are one of those screen couples that seem to just Mesh. I get the same feeling about Travolta and Kirstie Alley in the Look Who's Talking movies. Some people compared this to When Harry Met Sally, but these movies are no where near the same, and as I said, Hanks and Ryan make the better couple.The movie is a remake of Shop Around the Corner and updated for the times, 1998 I may add. The allure of internet movies I think has past. But for 1998, it's a nice little story of two people who hate each other in real life but really love each other as their anonymous selves via email and chat. This topic may be sordid now, with all of the stories of internet affairs, but not in this movie. There are some holes in this movie, but as in most movies, they don't really hurt. There are times you'll feel they should be able to realize who each other are. And for most people who don't over analyze as I do, you won't notice.You can tell how the plot line is going to develop but for a first time viewer it's really a nice, fun movie. This is a good 2nd or 3rd date type movie if you're really interested in the person. This is the kind of movie where you want to sit close on the couch and see if snuggling develops. So go ahead and rent it, if you like it maybe buy it.Thanks, Gary ","genre":null},{"date":"30 December 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I am a guy and as others have said, guys like this movie.

I usually have feelings about a movies but have problem to express it in intelligent language! Like some I wish Terry stuck to his job as a professional rather than sink into emotional involvement that did not help the the plot for me. As David Caruso's performance, I was so glad he managed what it did without tilting his head as he does in his CSI role. At home we refer to him as 45 degrees, quite unkind, especially when we do enjoy the show! Meg Ryan was OK to me but yes she's nobody else but Meg Ryan. If she's going to be used in other movies she should simply be called Meg Ryan in each of them, as this is what we get anyway and I'm not complaining! Yes it is nice when you see a movie and manage to forget who's the actor because you are overwhelmed with the character. The location is gorgeously filmed, I keep seeing this helicopter against the background of a deep Ecuadorian waterfall. Some found the rescue very realistic I'm not so sure about this but I have not much experience in such action. Some also found it a little long, well try to see it on an ever hungrier commercial television station, It started at 2030 and finished at 2320!

Yes, the cast was talented in a non-professional way and that is perhaps what made the film work. But the real story of how the film was made is this Off set was very much like on set. We lived in an abandoned pineapple warehouse and all called each other by our movie names. There was a split in the cast - sort of one gang against another - although in the real life one Jack and Ralph were on the same side (the leader of the other gang being one of the other choir boys). The gangs would make war on each other with Jack and Ralph's bunch headquartered out in the cane fields while the other bunch had a metal scaffold fort near the warehouse. In the beginning the cast was more of less evenly split but in the end I found I was on the losing side since we were down to only two people! So, filming was not all that difficult for the kids and much of it was simply letting us go at it. For instance the hut building scene was turned into a contest of who could build the best hut with a watermelon being the prize. That the cameras were going was only a secondary concern for the kids.

I never cry at movies, but the first (and only) time I ever did was at the end of this movie. For years, this movie haunted me; it permeated nearly every aspect of my existence. My bedroom walls were covered with posters from the film, I saved up the money to hunt down and purchase all of the comic books, and grew my hair long for the sole purpose of going out for Halloween as Eric Draven my senior year in high school. I wrote countless papers for various classes during my undergraduate study related to the film. Sometimes I feel like I know this movie better than the people who made it.It's funny how the things that are going on your life shape the way you experience the movies and music of your past. When life is good, it's easy to be over-analytical, to be hyper-critical, maybe even poke fun. I've been in this stage, watching this film and having almost no reaction to it whatsoever. However, there are times when life feels so dark and overwhelming and suddenly I'm that emotionally-vulnerable, confused 15-year-old kid again, carrying around the haunting images and music of the film in my head and trying to sort out the feelings evoked by it.And that's the beauty of this film. From the intensely angry expressions on Eric's face as he metes out his brand of justice to the tender moment he shares with Shelley before returning to the grave, this film encapsulates so many emotions; fear, rage, sadness, loneliness, hope, love, and redemption. The viewer can't help but have a bittersweet, visceral reaction to the film as we weep alongside Eric and revel in his revenge at the same time. An action-packed thriller it is, but this film really serves to remind us of how precious this life is; that every little moment we can share with those we love is to be treasured and cherished. And that when we love, we must love as long and as much as we can. Because, as Lee points out in his comments on the DVD extras, this seemingly inexhaustible well of life really is quite shallow, for we never really know when our time will come. This is the tragedy of both the film and of Brandon Lee's pointless death, but it can ultimately instill a sense of hope and purpose in those who heed the message.

If some one really wanted to see a movie about cannibals, they would probably enjoy it, but not necessarily. I can guarantee, though, that some one who finds cannibalism actually revolting and not worth mentioning would HATE this movie.Ravenous presents a tale revolving around an Indian myth in which eating the blood of another man can bring forth supernatural strength. Cannibalism is likened to a drug; despite it's potential healing powers, it is actually addictive!It's not just about cannibalism, but cannibalism is most of the fun. Ravenous has a cast of lower-A and upper-B-list actors, including Guy Pearce, Jeffrey Jones, Robert Carlyle, and David Arquette- and all are at the top of their games (however high that may be). It's a finely scripted and finely directed piece of work. The music especially stands out, composed by film veteran Michael Nyman and rock\/pop veteran Damon Albarn; the score is unconventional and original, and perfect for this film. For some people, it may be the most memorable thing about it.To some people, it might just seem silly and sloppy. The film is split into two parts, which is uncommon and can bother a viewer without them really knowing what's bothering them. Ravenous certainly does have an unusual plot, and the fact that it features people eating one another because of an Indian myth probably doesn't help its stature. But to me, it's a splendid film.

I liked him so much that I read a lot about him, probably I would check out his other movies too.All this tells u is We have got answers for every damn question in others life, but what is more important is to get answers for those questions, when Its My Life!

Even without the humour it would be a cracker of excitement. And with less serious attention to detail it would still be a joyful romp. In short; it's got just about everything.I find Melina Mercouri's preamble in the museum very well played and enjoyable. Her addiction to emeralds, and that preposterously feminine hip-swinging walk had me in stitches the first time I saw it. I suspect quite a few cross-dressers have used her as inspiration. Other commentators have dismissed her looks. Actually, she was 44 when this film was released so it would be silly to expect a baby-doll. She has had no cosmetic surgery either, unlike the desperate divas of today. For me (a mature man, like Schell) her sparky personality more than makes up for any decline in appearance. And her silky, burring voice? That could cause erections in a mortuary. In any case, she's not a model, she's an actress; so isn't that how she should be judged? Nobody slags-off Morley or Ustinov for being flabby, unprepossessing slobs, so why pick on her?I also find the chemistry between herself and Maximillian Schell entirely believable. They really do look like a flirting couple and I wonder if something wasn't actually going on when the camera stopped rolling. Schell himself has always struck me as an underrated actor. All too often he has featured as a star of B-movies, when this piece clearly shows that he can be a front-man, extremely versatile and plausible - far better in his time than the over-hyped Tom Cruise is today. His leadership and determination is touched with genuine humanity.Peter Ustinov, on the other hand, has always seemed lacking. Although an extremely funny entertainer, he appears only ever to play the craven bumbler, whether in this, 'Logan's Run' or even 'Spartacus'. Personally I would have given any Oscar to Schell.All the other actors earn their pay-cheques with conviction. Akim Tamiroff has a drunken, obnoxious cook to the letter, and trumps the more famous Ustinov in each of their exchanges.There is some excellent location camera work, particularly the opening montage of old Turkey and that scampering about across the palace roof complex with the Bosphorous shipping in the background. And haven't we seen some of those heist details ripped-off by 'Mission Impossible' and later 'Father Ted'? Flattery indeed.The music score is well chosen, too. It hits just the right cord of fun, excitement and cultural placement.If there's a weakness in any detail it is the sudden appearance of the bird. Where did that come from? It would hardly have approached the window with the gymnast sitting on the sill. I think one of those little rock-climbing lizards that are to be found all over the Mediterranean would have been more believable, it could easily have sneaked in without being seen. But that would have stymied the 'little bird told me so' line. And it's a nit-pick anyway.The thing's over 40 years old now, so like Ms Mercouri it's bound to be showing its age. Yet despite all of the modern developments in Dolby, special effects and so on, I would still prefer to dally an hour or two with this little gem than Tom Cruise's pretentious, over-blown, and needlessly violent outing. I cared for these characters, and that's what story is about.

However, instead of the Sierra mountains, this one takes our 3 pet friends to the urban life, more precisely to the worst streets of San Francisco. Basically it focus more on desert roads, empty streets and dirty alleys. We don't see that much of San Francisco, neither of its most beautiful things. This is a radical contrast with the first movie's environment, which shows us all the beauty of pure nature in the Sierra mountains.In this film, our buddies Shadow, Chance and Sassy often face city's dangers, such as weird people, two dog catchers who lock street dogs in their van to take them to one of those creepy laboratories and two rival dogs a vicious boxer-like dog and a goofy bulldog-like dog, despite the help of numerous street dogs (Riley and his gang).The two rival dogs are particularly annoying, especially the boxer-like dog.

I sickens me when I think of the actresses we have today and their off-screen antics, but that's another story. Ms. Hepburn gives a wonderful, believable performance as a chauffeur's daughter who goes to Paris and comes back a sophisticated young woman. I enjoyed many of her roles but I think this is my favorite because it is such a lovable and loving role. The storyline is not unique but wears well with age and makes you long for the romantic comedies of 1950s Hollywood.So why did I not give this almost perfect movie a 10? I just never could bond with Humphrey Bogart or his character in this movie. Maybe it was because Mr. Bogart was nearing the end of his life, but there seemed to be a lack of energy and a real sense he was in love with Sabrina or she with him. I heard Cary Grant was supposed to play this role, but I honestly don't know whether it would have made a difference to me - maybe it was just the age thing. James Mason does a better job with a May-December romance in Georgy Girl in my humble opinion. But then again, did it really have to be a May-December thing? The storyline really never played on the age difference in the first place. Why not have cast a couple male actors with a slight age difference a little older than Sabrina? They really didn't have to be a lot older than the heroine and it would have been more effective and more believable in my opinion.

Largely modeled after the book On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor who provides the heroic figure for JFK and has become famous as the only one who ever brought the Kennedy assassination to trial, it promotes the idea that the JFK case - maybe along with the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and even Martin Luther King - is really solved, if you watch\/read the two in sequence. The book got a major interest boost from the film.According to various evaluations I found on the net, a majority of Americans actually take most of JFK's assertions as facts, while of course expecting small artistic liberties.

On the other hand, would the alleged dark government forces really use such a bunch of losers for the hit of the century?

Delve deeper and the picture of Jim Garrison - and his times - changes entirely.One of the movie's most subtle, but most basic distortions is the claim that everybody believed in the Oswald myth from the start, at the latest after the Warren Report. In reality, conspiracy myths sprang to life almost instantly, and a large majority of the public was not satisfied with the official explanations, just like today. Garrison wasn't the only one investigating and speculating, not even the most vocal. Public pressure eventually forced a commission to re-investigate the facts.Numerous books have been written on the Garrison trial False Witness by Patricia Lambert and American Grotesque by James Kirkwood, among others. Garrison has made a comeback that would have made Richard Nixon proud, writes a commentator. They all conclude that Garrison whitewashed his investigation and misrepresented important details of the trial (errors that were faithfully repeated - and artfully inflated - by Oliver Stone). Garrison tried for years and failed, not because of a small missing piece of evidence for a guilty verdict, but because in reality, the jurors thought he had no case - absolutely nothing to credibly back up even the smallest of his claims, which had grown ever more sensational over time. The press, who would have loved anything spectacular, had abandoned him before the trial was over. Serious reporters and conspiracy buffs alike didn't take him seriously anymore. It took JFK to resurrect him.There remains the issue of - the real - Clay Shaw, who looks guilty as hell on screen. The movie states before the end credits roll that CIA director Richard Helms later admitted that Shaw had worked for the CIA. That's not true. All Shaw was ever convicted of was being homosexual, which was confirmed by some of his acquaintances, and that he owned some sadomasochistic equipment. Count the number of homosexual suspects in the movie, and the claim that Garrison believed in a gay plot looks less incredible. Whatever Garrison may have thought, Shaw's forced coming out cost him dearly in social status. Shaw (and Ferry) are dead now.

There are entire websites devoted to debunking conspiracy myths, but their common mistake is usually to make the reader angry or flatly refuse to acknowledge the validity of questions. On the other hand, would the alleged dark government forces really use such a bunch of losers for the hit of the century? Since Jim Garrison's book is the source of most of JFK's claims, its credibility rests on Garrison's shoulders. The movie's hero is accused of pressurizing and even drugging witnesses, persecuting people for their homosexuality, wasting taxpayer's money etc. All of these claims seem ridiculous and are either attributed to a hostile press, a tired wife, a public won over by the Warren Report or government pressure... Garrison really had to fight all the demons of hell at once to get the truth out! Except that it wasn't really that way. Google up The Assassination Goes Hollywood! for a step-by-step debunking of JFK that doesn't make you mad at first glance. Delve deeper and the picture of Jim Garrison - and his times - changes entirely.One of the movie's most subtle, but most basic distortions is the claim that everybody believed in the Oswald myth from the start, at the latest after the Warren Report. In reality, conspiracy myths sprang to life almost instantly, and a large majority of the public was not satisfied with the official explanations, just like today. Garrison wasn't the only one investigating and speculating, not even the most vocal. Public pressure eventually forced a commission to re-investigate the facts.Numerous books have been written on the Garrison trial False Witness by Patricia Lambert and American Grotesque by James Kirkwood, among others. Garrison has made a comeback that would have made Richard Nixon proud, writes a commentator. They all conclude that Garrison whitewashed his investigation and misrepresented important details of the trial (errors that were faithfully repeated - and artfully inflated - by Oliver Stone). Garrison tried for years and failed, not because of a small missing piece of evidence for a guilty verdict, but because in reality, the jurors thought he had no case - absolutely nothing to credibly back up even the smallest of his claims, which had grown ever more sensational over time. The press, who would have loved anything spectacular, had abandoned him before the trial was over. Serious reporters and conspiracy buffs alike didn't take him seriously anymore. It took JFK to resurrect him.There remains the issue of - the real - Clay Shaw, who looks guilty as hell on screen. The movie states before the end credits roll that CIA director Richard Helms later admitted that Shaw had worked for the CIA. That's not true. All Shaw was ever convicted of was being homosexual, which was confirmed by some of his acquaintances, and that he owned some sadomasochistic equipment. Count the number of homosexual suspects in the movie, and the claim that Garrison believed in a gay plot looks less incredible. Whatever Garrison may have thought, Shaw's forced coming out cost him dearly in social status. Shaw (and Ferry) are dead now. Is it true that in the United States, the laws of defamation apply only to the living? Memory is fleeting, film is forever.On the whole, all of JFK's central claims turn out to be pure myths, yet there is hope that some day one version of what really took place will be generally accepted, and it will be the right one. The merit of any controversial film is that it encourages discussion - and maybe research on the part of the viewer. There is nothing wrong with purely enjoying a good movie, as long as it's taken with a grain of salt.

His music always did to me what is said in this movie (made me feel like the composer) and it's not enough if I say I am a Beethoven fan, better to say I admire, adore and pray him...His works are (in parallel with J.S Bach but in another way) make me feel mad and there are quiet few music that do so to me.With the above description and with the effort I've made to study his life and works, I believe this movie is a disaster.With the huge amount of raw material and stories in his life - which Roman Rolland has written that thick book - it's the strangest thing to use his worst, hard-to-believe and neglectable-to-magnify part of his life.It surely is a crime if we see Beethoven in this way.The movie may be a good one if it was not based on him and it was a fictional story for that I may give 6 stars but because of the crime they've made I had to omit the later 3 stars!Please compare with Milos Forman's Amadeus, is it comparable? actually that one was neither completely satisfying but much better than this. Why?-Gary Oldman is a great actor but not suitable for this role, even as hard as he tries...-All about the 9th symphony was this? it is considered as 'The greatest symphonic composition for all the time' by almost %100 of the experts. It's the best choice for the EU anthem. It's mystical. It's beyond the imagination and it's written when he was completely deaf! It's - as he has quoted - his greatest piece of work.
