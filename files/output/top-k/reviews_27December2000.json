A masterful take on the original Mercury program. Seen it a dozen times...keeps getting better. Funny as hell in some parts, flag-wavin' patriotic at others and entertaining from start to finish. Like the Wolfe book, which it follows pretty closely, it provides you with a truckload of information about the astronauts and the program that NASA didn't want revealed in the midst of the Cold War. So you're getting an education the easy way. It seems that just about the entire cast had their first major breakthrough on Right Stuff. Remarkable acting by all concerned parties. Donald Moffat (I hate to single any ONE actor out in this movie for special attention) does a turn as LBJ that belongs in the Satire Hall Of Fame. The editing is perfect. This movie is around 3 hours long and it just flies by. Great use of archival footage from NASA. It's an epic film that never feels like an epic film. Great moviemaking.( And I'm waiting for someone to make a film out of Wolfe's A Man In Full. If James Garner is reading this...there's an Oscar with your name on it, Jim. Get the part!!!) And by all means, let the kids watch Right Stuff with you. This is what they mean by a movie the whole family can love. Just start it early enough to get 'em to bed on time.

There were many things that were said about the film that made me apprehensive about going to see it. People told me the film was boring and that there was not much dialogue. True, there is not much dialogue, but if you think about it, why would there be. He is stuck on an island by himself. The things that make this film interesting is the sheer fact that you feel as if you were there with you. I don't believe that the title refers to him as a Castaway on an island, but in fact Cast Away from the world and his friends and family. Tom Hanks is remarkable in this role. If he does not win an Academy Award for this role then there will be many upset people out there. Something that made this movie feel all the more intense is the fact that there is no music. All you hear are the waves, the wind, and the coconuts falling. It makes you feel like you are truly out on the edge of the world alone with nothing except some rocks and an old soccer ball named, Wilson. Cast Away is a an exceptional movie experience like none other. Joel Seigel said it best, Tom Hanks and Director Robert Zemekis have none the impossible...You will walk out of the theater in absolute awe.
