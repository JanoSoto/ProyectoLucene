Over the following 25 years though I have noticed that my favorite Hitchcock movie has continued to change. It was Psycho for many years, but sometime in the mid- 1990s, it became Vertigo (coincidentally a time when a new restored print of that came out). Apart from the beautiful new print (which I also saw on the big screen), I was probably somewhat also swayed by the Sight & Sound critics poll where Vertigo had just displaced Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all times. But, for the past ten years or so, North by Northwest has become my favorite Hitchcock movie of all times. It is the one I find myself watching over and over again (just caught it on the big screen, for a change). It is also the one I find myself recommending to others, when they ask what Hitchcock movie should they start with. I guess the reason for this is that it is the most perfect Hitchcock movie. It has all the elements the Macguffin, the wrongly-accused leading man, and the blonde woman who may or may not be who she claims to be. More than that, it has in one single movie everything that you will find in separate Hitchcock movies a great screenplay (by Ernest Lehman), fantastic score (Bernard Herrman, obviously), great title sequence (Saul Bass), crackling dialogue and humor, and great chemistry between the leads (similar to 39 Steps). The interplay between Cary Grant (at his best - and more than Jimmy Stewart, the perfect Hitchcock lead) and Eve Marie Saint when they first meet on the train is an exercise in great writing and acting - it could be from any great romantic movie. But most of all it has some of the great set-pieces assembled in the movies - the crop-dusting and Mount Rushmore sequences are already classics. Yes, it doesn't have the psychological complexity of Vertigo, the shock and horror of Psycho, but it is what it is the most ENTERTAINING movie that Hitchcock ever made, and the one I can watch over and over again.

So, after a few false starts, I finally have seen VERTIGO, and what I feel to be the perfect example of a Hitchcock film. The story follows John Scottie Ferguson, a retired San Francisco detective who is called by a friend to follow his wife. Along the way, he falls in love and has some curious experiences revolving around mistaken identity and his fear of heights. Dare I say that James Stewart hasn't been better (at least in a Hitchcock film) than here. Kim Novak also acquits herself rather nicely in the typical Hitchcock blonde role, although I still think Grace Kelly is a slightly better actress. All of Hitchcock's tricks are put to full use here, and things start off brilliantly with my favorite title sequence so far. Saul Bass and Bernard Herrmann were two of Hitch's greatest collaborators, and they certainly did some of their best work here. From a story perspective, the narrative takes a number of twists and turns which a discerning viewer will probably figure out beforehand, but its the execution of said twists that really make them work. They aren't telegraphed, but rather are hinted at or suggested. And if there's anything that makes a Hitchcock film extremely watchable, is how he is able to manipulate audience expectations through the power of suggestion. From a technical perspective, there was quite a bit of impressive camera-work and photographic effects that add to a sense of disorientation and suspense. In particular, there are a few zoom in\/track out shots that visually illustrate James Stewart's character's acrophobia. There was also a really trippy dream sequence that served as a nice reprise of the opening title sequence. Even the production design, sets, costumes, etc. added to the visual splendor. Even when the narrative slows down (to ease the tension), there's always something beautiful to look at, be it a person or one of the many on-location shots of downtown San Francisco. And finally, Bernard Herrmann's score was pretty much perfect, helping to build tension at the right moments and backing off when necessary. A couple key moments in the film happen sans score, and the mark of a good composer is knowing which moments to back off and let the drama speak for itself. Put together, all of the various production elements form a package which, to me, is the epitome of what Hitchcock brought to cinema. You have interesting (and attractive) characters, a suspense-filled story, brilliant camera-work and a rapturous score. Even the ending this time felt better than in his other films. Although it would probably benefit someone new to Hitchcock to start with something earlier in his filmography (to get a sense of progression), VERTIGO is probably the pinnacle of his style and certainly essential when it comes to film classics.

The flooding of the old town, which has divers swimming through a submerged cemetery (that scene alone made me feel uneasy), the dreams that Annette Bening has, which are actually visions of the future, even the haunting rhyme that the killer writes on the walls (My father was a dollar \/ I wrote it on a fence \/ my father was a dollar \/ not worth a hundred cents) all add up to an interestingly creepy atmosphere. Jordan is also an expert in atmosphere, giving an eerie feeling of dread throughout the film, although this is slightly hamstrung somewhat by the frenzied editing. There are several weak points in the film as well &#x96; the story needed a few clarifications on how long Bening has had the visions for; the exact nature of the mind-link with the killer; as well as some needless scenes of destruction that seem to be inserted purely to justify the film's 'thriller' tag. The climax is also pretty weak but is redeemed somewhat by a darkly ironic ending where Bening, now a ghost, haunts Downey Jr's waking moments for karmic payback.The acting is top-notch, although Annette Bening has some trouble getting into the disturbed headspace without doing some glass-munching (the act of doing extreme emotions in an over-the-top manner). As for glass-munching, Robert Downey Jr is perfect as the killer, doing an excellent job of playing a disturbed killer who was traumatised by being left chained up by his mother in the flooding town.

They (again, like me) may be huge movie fans, even huge fans of Kubrick's earlier movies, but for some reason this particular Kubrick movie hasn't drawn them yet.They may feel sometimes (like me again) that they OUGHT to see it, but for some reason they just haven't.

This review is for you and you alone.I've read a LOT about this movie, about the circumstances under which it was made, the challenges Kubrick and others faced in making it, its unique position in the history of making and distributing movies. I've read dozens of reviews of the movie, by professional critics whom I respect enormously (and some I don't) and by amateurs like us here at Amazon, IMDb, Netflix, etc. I've seen many clips from the movie, official trailers as well as pirated clips posted online, including some that are hailed as the very best scenes in it by most fans of the movie.The thing is, not once in all that time have I ever read or seen anything that made me want to see the movie.

There just is not anything about it that appeals to me.

Top-notch performances by all cast members, exceptional cinematography by Roger Deakins, and masterful direction by Frank Darabont (who also penned the screenplay based on Stephen King's short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption) combine to make the film something special indeed.Co-stars Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins simply transform themselves into two unconventional prisoners. Their inspired acting helps us understand the virtue of patience and hope, regardless of how long and how much suffering one might face. Freeman plays Red Redding, a man who has adapted to prison life by becoming the institution's go to guy for various items from the outside world. Robbins is Andy Dufresne, a successful banker sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and lover. These very different men become friends who think decency and kindness are important, even in the brutal prison environment.That brutality may be very hard for viewers to watch, but those disturbing scenes are necessary to give the film its gritty realism. Sadistic Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) runs Shawshank Prison like it's his own personal kingdom, and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) carries out the warden's orders -- very enthusiastically.Things change for the better when Captain Hadley receives help with some paperwork from Andy. It's not long until Andy is assisting all the guards with their tax returns. Soon Warden Norton takes interest in Andy and uses him for his own paperwork. The result? The warden grants little favors that improve the lives of the prisoners. Unfortunately, a new prisoner (Gil Bellows) arrives with a revelation about Andy's case -- one that creates chaos for everyone concerned. The only thing Andy can do involves a daring escape. But how? And what will happen to Red if Andy leaves? Although The Shawshank Redemption boasts a number of memorable scenes, my favorite shows Andy broadcasting an opera selection to the entire prison population. All the men are stunned as they listen in awe to the beautiful music. However, as you've probably heard, no good deed goes unpunished. Especially at Shawshank. Released in 1994, this acclaimed motion picture earned seven well- deserved Academy Award nominations including a Best Actor nod for Morgan Freeman.

It is unfair to say that these movies aren't great since so much effort was put into them in order to make them superior in production value. The sets are massive, they require the careful direction of many extras in some scenes, and they usually have great leading performances.While this film does follow the life and accomplishments of Cleopatra, much of the time we are either focused on Caesar - the entire first half of the film - and Mark Antony, as Cleopatra was able to manipulate these men for her benefit, Antony more so than Caesar. For the film as a whole, I'd have to say that at most a third of the time is devoted to Cleopatra, so I am not convinced that this movie should be considered a character study for Cleopatra or that Elizabeth Taylor should be considered the sole lead. Though we don't see her as much as the title of the film insinuates, I suppose she is the driving force of the film, so it is a barely suitable title.It is a little annoying that throughout the first half of the film, Caesar refers to himself in the third person, so it took me about half an hour to figure out that he was Caesar.While I do enjoy epics, I don't think that this is one of the better ones out there, but it is still great for what it accomplishes. As I had stated in the first paragraph, it is impressive to see these films made in the era they come from since the production is massive and seems as though it couldn't possibly be done back in the 60's or even before then. That is what this film feels like - the action sequences are amazing and well-choreographed and very well-put- together in general. Even in unexciting scenes we have a huge amount of things to see within the frame, especially in exterior scenes where Cleopatra is welcomed in Italy and it is more like a community-sized celebration than a simple welcome. It also takes good writing and execution to keep the audience's attention for just over four hours, and I while I had to watch the two halves on separate days it had my attention until the end.This epic felt like it didn't need to be quite as long as other epics, but it was. In my opinion there could have been more improvement if Cleopatra was given more attention to obviously show she is what the film is all about, so the story lines of Caesar and Antony could have been cut down to give more room for Elizabeth Taylor's leading performance. I shall revisit this film eventually as I plan to revisit all epics I have seen - they are simply amazing films.

We see the icon play J.B. Books, a terminally ill gunfighter (or shootist) who is looking for an appropriate, relatively painless death. With Wayne succumbing to a terminal illness several years after the release of this title, 'The Shootist' becomes an almost unsettling, but very dignified, swan song. The iconic actor is joined by fellow actor James Stewart, and fans of 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' (one of my favourite Westerns) will be glad to see the reunion of these legendary performers. A second icon to join John Wayne for his final film is the actress Lauren Bacall; she has a stronger presence in the film than Stewart, who only appears in a couple of scenes, and she delivers a very good performance. John Wayne has generally been regarded as a second-rate performer when compared to the likes of Stewart, Tracy, Bogart and other actors from his era, but 'The Shootist' boasts a career-defining performance, on par with (if not surpassing) the actor's parts in 'The Searchers' and 'The Quiet Man'. Complemented by a strong Ron Howard performance, Wayne's final film benefits immensely from truly stellar acting. I would also draw attention to some of the technical aspects of the film. The cinematography, to begin with, struck me as very modern for a Western. I wonder if this was intentional, as 'The Shootist' frequently addresses the twilight\/death of the Old West. You won't find the sort of shots famously associated with John Ford in Don Siegel's Western, and this helps in establishing the film as, basically, something different. I also noticed how the score seemed, if not anachronistic, quite eccentric. Elmer Bernstein really brings something magical to 'The Shootist' with his uplifting, unmistakably epic sound. Overall, I rank John Wayne's final film amongst my favourite Westerns, and it is a truly fitting send-off to one of cinema's most iconic stars.
