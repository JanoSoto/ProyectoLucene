First off, many people love to bash this movie because they loath George Lucas. They say that it does not compare to A New Hope or Empire. Well, maybe it doesn't. But perhaps part of the reason for this is simply that many of us were young impressionable children in 1977 or 1980 and so we were more likely to be overwhelmed by a picture (any picture) than we are today.Having said that, I will say that this movie certainly has its flaws. Unlike a lot of people, I did not find the visual effects to be as impressive as some viewers. A great deal of the effects reminded of a high tech video game. The performance of Hayden Christensen was not exceptional but okay. Natalie Portman did a fine job. The story still seems a little empty to me, in terms of information that Lucas has yet to cover (i.e. the Solo family, the conversion of Anakin to Vader, Anakin's children, Grand Moff Tarkin and so on). Worth seeing and certainly an improvement over Phantom Menace but by no means a masterpiece.

True, that the ending was slightly warped (I didn't read the novel - I found out the real ending from a relative)Maybe it was because of the fact that I didn't have any expectations from the show, and therefore my judgment was impartial. Unlike Harry Potter, I had read the books several times before, and was a little disappointed at the way things turned out in the movie.What another user said is true, I guess. The objective of judging a movie is to see how well it managed to captivate the audience, not how well the plot stuck to the original story.I would recommend this movie to all those who haven't read the book, as it is quite a good source of entertainment, and the actors played their parts extremely well. James Caviezel is extremely elegant - both as a naive, illiterate peasant, and as a rich sophisticated count. Guy Pearce on the other hand plays his role so well that he's almost hateable.On the whole, it was good, but I would have preferred it if they didn't rush the ending as they did. I'm sure the plot was more intricate and interesting than the way they did it in the movie.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 June 2002","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I saw this movie the other day, and I must say that it wasn't as bad as the critics depicted the whole thing to be.Fair enough, maybe I liked it because I didn't read the novel before watching the movie, so I had no idea what was going to happen, what should happen, and what didn't happen.I went into the theater without any expectations, and I must admit that the show was intriguing, and it managed to keep me glued to my seat in trepidation.
