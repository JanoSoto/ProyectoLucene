Althought the movie is set in the early 1900's, her struggle with making a life for herself while surrounded by treacherous friends with their own agendas feels completely relevant. Working from a terrific script, Anderson draws nuance, meaning and emotion from her lines and the circumstances in which she finds herself, as she puts it, doing the wrong thing at the right time. The journey she took me through in this movie was invigorating, thought provoking, engrossing and ultimately heartbreaking. The supporting cast, including Day Akroyd, Anthony LaPaglia and Terry Kinney, hold their own and fill out the movie beautifully. But Laura Linney deserves special mention as Lily's cunning, manipulative rival posing as a friend. Although very much a period piece, the film goes beyond some of the best pictures of Merchant-Ivory in bringing to life Wharton's novel, presenting a darker movie about the consequences of choices and the cost of guilelessness in a ruthless world. It also pulls Scully out of her basement and into the spotlight where her talents deserve to have her.

Then again, perhaps its unfair to label it a vampire flick.Lily Taylor stars as a women studying for a degree in philosophy. Not only does she study it, but it's her life. It intrigues her, makes the wheels in her head turn. Then one late night, she's bitten by a female vampire (Annabella Sciorra). Only she doesn't see it that way. Believing it was just an attack of a sick twisted woman, she tries to go on with her life. Then she starts getting really sick and her doctor can't find anything wrong with her (and so the story goes). Finally she figures it out - she's a vampire, accepts it - and doing like vampires do - goes about her new found way of life. Anything more than that I can't tell you. Simply because the movie gets bogged down in heavy exposition and lost me.Having only seen one or two other films from Abel Ferrara (the director), I assume 'The Addiction' is meant to be less story and more character study. On that note, it was a fine decision to present this movie in black & white. It adds much needed atmosphere to the proceedings and also takes away from the violence. I would suggest they filmed it in this way for that exact reason. This isn't a horror movie. It's a study in character ... philosophy ... with a large splash of blood.

The character examined contained all of the personalities revealed and they were perceived by the onlooker through the onlooker's own prejudices.  The stories were told also by the character stressing their perception of the event and role in it.  What was the true story?  It was a combination of all the stories or none of them.

I was but a nine year old boy when I saw the first RoboCop, which has taught me valuable lessons about the difference between what people say and what they mean, along with the consequences of violence. Granted, I enjoy RoboCop even more as a young adult because I understand more what Neumeier and Verhoeven were saying about Christian America, but the point is not that RoboCop was aimed specifically at adults, but rather that it was aimed at people with a brain in their head.By comparison, RoboCop 3 has obviously been aimed at special education classes.

The real problem with this film is that the dialogue and special effects are utterly dreadful.

In RoboCop 2, he battles with a drug lord who is used to create a new and improved cyborg.

He was a match for RoboCop because one could feel an equal amount of fury coming from him whenever he was on-screen. In RoboCop 2, the main opponent for most of the film was a drug lord called Cain. This was a slight falter because Cain had all the personality of a squashed gnat, but the error was reversed when he was turned into RoboCop 2, a cyborg that took the Iron Man syndrome (listen to the Black Sabbath song of that name while watching parts of the original and you'll get what I mean by that) to new heights. Otomo had about ten minutes of screen time at most, and would have been ripped limb from limb by the RoboCop of the first film.RoboCop was one of the films that made my early life worth living, and I credit it with making me want to write scripts for films and television among other things.

LADY IN WHITE is one of those rare gems.A murder mystery, a ghost story and a coming-of-age dramedy all wrapped up in one, it is the realization of the vision of one very gifted director, Frank La Loggia, whom I believe has paid a heavy price for staying true to his instincts, when it comes to what kind of films he wants to make. Hollywood has left us all poorer for not supporting his quest to make more movies like this, and shame on them for that. The story begins with the recollection of author Frankie Scarlatti, whose specialty runs into Stephen King-like novels and stories, as he remembers his childhood in the town of Willowpoint Falls, in upstate New York, and the events there that would shape the rest of his life and his career.Young Frankie, (Lukas Hass from WITNESS) becomes the victim of a prank played on him by two of his school chums. They lock him in the school cloak room on Halloween Night, and there he discovers the pieces to a chilling puzzle that has long baffled and bewildered the town's citizens for years, and has especially been a source of terror for the children.   Ten local children have all fallen victim in the past ten years to a mysterious serial killer who has never been caught. The most recent victim, Melissa Ann Montgomery, is the ghost that Frankie encounters in the cloak room. But more than that; he becomes a reluctant witness to her murder after the fact, and nearly victim number eleven.Frankie survives the ordeal, and in the events that follow, he learns about prejudice, paranoia, how not to fear the darkness or the dead, and that the greatest terror of all comes from the living, especially when evil strikes closer to home than you ever dared believe.The most amazing thing about this film is how, on such a limited budget, La Loggia evokes such a strong sense of time and place. What's more, the care and skill he used to coax such remarkable performances out of the cast reflect what a labor of love this was for him, and I believe that if he never makes another film, LADY IN WHITE will stand the test of time as one of the best films of its kind.Aside from the great work done by Haas, then about midway through his child-acting days, Alex Rocco, Len Cariou and Katherine Helmond give some of the best performances of their careers. The efforts of the entire cast, as orchestrated by La Loggia, ensure that this is one character-driven movie that does not suffer for lack of car-chases, explosions or elaborate CGI set pieces.Though it may be a little too intense for members of the younger set, (under 13), for a story that will delight, chill, amaze and move you, you won't get better than this, whether you sit down to watch it alone, or preferably, with the entire family.

After 19 years of public life 'Blade Runner' is considered a 'cult movie' transcending the genre becoming a classic. The plot may seem a little bit simple at first sight however 'Blade Runner' raises some of the most fundamental questions flirting with existentialism as well as humanism. If the movie was inspire by Philip K. Dick's novel 'Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep', the realization of the scenario differed completely. The story takes place in a dark and urban near future where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford best role) is a blade runner, a cop and has been asked to retire\/kill 4 replicants who escaped from an obscure space colony, have hijacked a space ship to return home back on earth (where they have been declared illegal) seeking for their 'maker'(the charismatic Joe Turkel). The mission turns out much more difficult than expected. The 4, soon 5 replicants are not 'computers' they are 'physical' (Human made by Human through genetic manipulation I assume). They have great intelligence and superior physical abilities and resistance. They are looking for answers and are determine to get them what ever it takes. Their questioning will become ours What makes us human? Are we human from birth in other words by essence? Or do we become human with what we do, through what we achieve? Who is a human being? Rick Deckard who tracks down Zhora (the beautiful Joanna Cassidy) or the tragic Zhora who after a stressful hunt seems suddenly so close to us when being shot down, frozen in an everlasting slow motion made of shattering glasses. Roy Batty who discovers his own humanity when facing his last trial, the only trial he will never win death ; or Eldon Tyrel who plays God but has forgotten to play Human? Maybe 'memories' is the clue we are looking for? But what kind of memory and whose memory? Sure my memory (personal or common) is part of what makes me act as a human being but doesn't it alienates me like a trauma alienates a patient? So love has to be the ultimate clue. But in that case what kind of love? The love that shows Deckard to Rachael (the enigmatic Sean Young) made of sarcasm and bitterness or the love shared by the powerful Roy Batty (the awesome Rutger Hauer) and the wild Pris (best role ever for Daryl Hannah)?

Just as Jim Belushi and his brother John have a lot in common, so do Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs. And just like John Belushi was the better of the brothers, Silence of the Lambs still stands as the better film. Still, Hannibal has quite a lot to offer.The best joy of this film was its intriguing, original plot. While most sequels have to stretch to continue their stories, the events in Hannibal seem the logical output of Lambs. This can be attributed to Thomas Harris' well written-book, and the contributions of dramatic bigwig David Mamet. I believe this a rare occasion where not reading the book is beneficial to the movie-viewing experience, as I hear there are some discrepancies between the two (I have not read the book, though I'm planning on it). Regardless, the excitement comes from the suspense, not knowing what is coming next.And in this story, it's hard to tell what will happen next. One of the first characters we meet is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a horribly disfigured, and horribly rich, former victim of Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins). Verger is bent on seeking revenge on the escaped Lecter. To do this, he uses former Hannibal guard Barney (Frankie Faison), and our heroine, FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). Starling has just been involved in a FBI fiasco, and exploiting this, Verger lures Starling back into the Hannibal hunt. Of course, she faces opposition from within her department, in the form of Justice Department member Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). However, once she tracks Lecter to Florence, Italy, she faces competition from foreign law official Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini). All the meanwhile, the sophisticated and (ahem) tasteful Lecter is up to his old tricks, sparked to re-enter crime as his arch nemesis rejoins the battle.So with all these old friends back together, who's missing?

One of the first characters we meet is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a horribly disfigured, and horribly rich, former victim of Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins). Verger is bent on seeking revenge on the escaped Lecter. To do this, he uses former Hannibal guard Barney (Frankie Faison), and our heroine, FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). Starling has just been involved in a FBI fiasco, and exploiting this, Verger lures Starling back into the Hannibal hunt. Of course, she faces opposition from within her department, in the form of Justice Department member Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). However, once she tracks Lecter to Florence, Italy, she faces competition from foreign law official Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini).

Doctor Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) promises to oversee the errant Coulmier and see to it that De Sade's Writing does not see the light of day.The new job is a godsend to the Doctor who can now afford an enormous house with all the trimmings and a youthful virgin wife who has been exiled to a convent for lack of a Family Dowry, and can be purchased for cash.  There are several concurrent stories with the main one about De Sade and the doings inside the Asylum.There is the War between the doctor and Coulmier; the war between Coulmier now joined with Royer-Collard to suppress De Sade.  There is the story of Madeliene (Kate Winslet), a chamber woman, who has been smuggling De Sade's writings to the outside world and is believed to be the Marquis' lover.  The Quills play included many scenes from Sade's plays.  But Director Kauffman produces only one in the film, a play-within-a-play to match the one produced by Hamlet for his Stepfather.  Apparently De Sade has gotten word that Royer-Collard is being duped by his virgin bride.  The play is an insult to the Doctor and it raises the ante in the War to suppress Sade's free speech.Royer-Collard, with a host of toadying jailers, is constantly scurrying to discover what new outrage the Marquis has perpetrated.  Sade is forced to adapt to the removal of his quill and ink.  He must improvise.  Madeliene is drawn into the conflict.  Coulmier is being challenged by Royer-Collard on the one hand, and De Sade on the other.  The Marquis is untroubled by the rising commotion and violence inside the Asylum, but Coulmier lets his libido get the better of him and begins to betray his vows, with Madeline, who he has always secretly loved. Meanwhile Royer-Collard's virgin bride has replaced the contents of her Child's Garden of Verses with De Sade's Justine (Justine was actually published years before Sade entered this Asylum, but the screenplay suggests this book is the one smuggled from the asylum that set Napoleon off after he came to power in 1810).  Fortified by Sade's writing, the Bride summons the courage to seduce her husband's architect.  Chaos reigns as this examination of free speech under fire moves toward climax.Rush is powerful in one of the best performances of his life on film as the unyielding De Sade.  Phoenix is more energized than we have seen him recently; he gives a good performance.  Kate Winslet is voluptuously acceptable as Madeline.  Michael Caine is OK as Dr. Royer-Collard (I keep worrying that he will refer to the inmates as you wonderful sons of New England.)

Pokemon! Digimon! Or Dungeons and Dragons, which kids nowadays won't even have heard of. This is a must see for all Richard Donner fans, Spielberg fans and Chris Columbus fans. You could say it's a childlike replica of Temple of Doom, but much funnier and with a faster pace. Great to watch time and time again - reminiscent of the time when kids actually did things like this and didn't just play on their PlayStation!
