Jim Carrey is not good as Kaufman, but Andy would have said..Ï don't care. The movie has so many flaws i really don't know where to start. Mr. Kaufman was an avante guard comedian, which is like saying...it is kind of art house and you get it or you don't. His flaky style of substituting himself with another character was funny...if you saw it once. But Andy used this over and over. He was in the sit-com Taxi, and if there was one thing Kaufman did have it was confidence in his own material. (he didn't see his weaknesses). The best thing one can say about Kaufman---is that he was highly original. The movie is one long tedious bore, and Carrey does nothing to lift the sinking film. If this was Kaufmans highlights, i am glad they never showed the low parts of his life. It appears he was vastly over-rated.
