[{"date":"21 February 2008","score":"","review":" Says lawyer Jack Palmer to Emma Duval, explaining the fate of her long gone father, a man she was told years ago had died while doing missionary work in Africa after he'd left his family. He died alright, about four years later, somewhere down in Alabama in a button factory accident. Seems the hole poker machine broke loose and fell on him. They say he had 273 holes in him before they could get it off. After all that Emma and her friend Willis Richland have experienced in Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune, it seems perfectly natural when Emma cries out in exasperation, Willis, what is wrong with all these people? The important point is that they all are part of a movie of great ease and geniality. Cookie's Fortune may be a little sentimental, perhaps, but it is so sweet-natured and natural, and so skillfully presented, that I think the film ranks among Altman's most accomplished works...even if what powers it is an old lady blowing her brains out. Jewel Mae Orcutt -- Cookie (Patricia Neal) - is aging and increasingly infirm, and she longs for her deceased husband, Buck. When she decides to use one of Buck's pistols to join him, she sets off the avarice of her niece, Camille Dixon (Glenn Close), who pulls along her slow- witted sister, Cora Duval (Julianne Moore). Camille is determined that no hint of a suicide will scandalize the family name, so she makes things look like a burglary gone bad. And, unintentionally, makes it look as if Willis Richland (Charles S. Dutton), a close friend of Cookie's who had worked around the house for her, must have done the deed. Well, there's no way Emma Duval (Liv Tyler) an unconventional young woman who is seriously estranged from her mother, Cora, and her aunt, is going to buy that. In fact, no one, even the local cops, believes that Willis would have burglarized and shot Cookie. For the next hour and a half we're going to take part in Altman's gentle examination of the people in this little cotton-growing town of Holly Springs, Mississippi. We're going to learn how to clean catfish, listen to the blues and, a little off camera, how to make love standing up. We'll encounter Camille's obsession with propriety and look aghast at her firm direction (and rewriting) of Wilde's Salome as a church play for Easter. We're going to see how skilled Lyle Lovett is at gutting a catfish and peeping into Liv Tyler's window at night. We're going to learn a lot about family relationships, even the more informally blessed kind. Most of all, perhaps, we're to learn just how much friendship and family can mean, especially when it's served up with such skill and off-beat humor by Altman and screenwriter Ann Rapp. And as good as all the actors in this ensemble cast are, Charles S. Dutton stands out. He gives a fine performance brimming with likability and honesty, and without a trace of Hollywood nobility. Willis Richland is a guy who has responsibilities, and that's just fine with him.

Now Frank is ready, he jets off to Hong Kong where he intends to compete in the Kumite, a traditional full contact no holds barred illegal fighting tournament organised by local crime lords (not sure why though). There he meets up up burly American Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) & together they enter the tournament, it's a brutal tournament where people get seriously hurt, it's a tournament for champions & winners, it's a tournament that Frank thinks he can win. If he doesn't win the thing he will almost certainly die in the arena trying...Directed by Newt Arnold & produced by the infamous Yoram Globus & Menahem Golan under their Cannon company Bloodsport isn't anywhere near as bad as I was expecting, it ain't no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it ticks enough boxes to be enjoyable if ultimately forgettable. Based on true events Bloodpsort was JCVD's fifth film & his first starring role, to be honest this ain't too bad at all. The script by Christopher Cosby, Mel Friedman & Sheldon Lettich moves along at a reasonable pace & it gives the makers a fair number of chances to stage various martial arts fights which is all most viewers will be interested in I would have thought. The character's are alright if a little basic, they are fairly likable & the dialogue isn't too bad either. It tells an OK story with the minimum of fuss with some heroes & some villains & it passes 90 odd minutes harmlessly enough if all your looking for is a bit of martial arts. However it's not perfect with several underdeveloped sub plots, for instance why do the US army want Frank Dux back so badly? They send these two guy's after him who try to take him back but the script never gives any reason for it! I mean Frank is just a soldier, he's not even top level brass or anything, just a lowly soldier according to this so why is he so vital to the army & in what capacity did the army spend lots of time & money on him as suggested?Director Arnold does alright, Bloodsport isn't going to win any awards for grace or style but it looks neat and tidy enough. It has a late 80's feel to it with JCVD sporting a daft looking haircut & a few silly skin tight outfits that look like they belong in an aerobics class. The fights are surprisingly well choreographed & effective, they are clear & concise & you can easily keep track of who is who & whats going on which is nice in view of the modern blink & you will miss it editing & quick cuts style of cutting action films. Apparently even after it was finished Bloodsport was almost never released & JCVD himself stepped in to reedit it so that it could be, I would have hate to have seen the original rough cut. Most 80's action films have at least one unintentionally funny moment, here in Bloodsport there's a scene early on as Tanaka is training JCVD & makes him serve him & his wife tea blindfolded!With a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 Bloodsport is competent, it's reasonably well made with decent if unspectacular production values. Shot on location in Hong Kong which gives it a nice authentic look. Apparently paid $70,000 for his role JCVD does alright here but the boy never was, isn't & never will be a good actor. Amazingly respected Hollywood actor Forest Whitaker has a small role while Hollywood typecast Chinese martial arts film bad guy Bolo Yeung plays the bad guy.Bloodsport isn't a masterpiece, it isn't art & it won't change your life but it is a decent film with some good martial arts fights which is really all anyone came to see. Does what it says on the tin, no more no less. Successful enough to spawn three sequels Bloodsport 2 (1996), Bloodsport III (1997) & Bloodsport The Dark Kumite (1999) none of which feature JCVD.

It had so much potential but somehow the movie became utter rubbish around the 1\/2 way mark. There is way too much cheesy dialog and moments in this movie. I guess I am one of those that expects some degree of realism when I see movies, especially movies such as these that like to themselves seriously (big name stars, story based on arguably the most imp time period in America, etc). I think only a fraction of the movie is based on actual historical facts. There is way too much 'in your face' bravado and 'patriotism'. I agree with some reviewers that the way the slaves were portrayed was a joke. Given that this is set in the late 1700's and in the South, there seemed to be a lot of 'acceptance' of them. Mel Gibson couldn't decide if he should play this movie seriously or tongue-in-cheek and that indecision comes through quite openly. This says a lot about the director too. I saw another one of Roland Emmerich's movie - Stargate, which I thought was utter trash too. Joely Richardson is intolerable as the 'aunt'\/'stepmom-to-be' (go figure!). She showed absolutely 0 emotion throughout the movie. She shares equal honors on that front with Chris Cooper, who somehow keeps disappearing and re-surfacing throughout the movie. Heath Ledger and Tom Wilkinson were quite good in the movie, while Isaacs was below average and very one-dimensional. The one main thing that made me feel disgusted about this movie was the lack of emotion in the main characters when their near and dear ones are murdered by Col.Tavington (Isaac's character) at various times in the movie. The costumes and cinematography were the other redeeming features in this movie.
