[{"date":"17 October 2015","score":"","review":" The film incorporates some of German Expressionism which was really obvious in the film. The beginning of the movie itself shows this through the use of lighting and shadows. A recurring theme is the framing of the face with a dark surround, and light shining only on the eyes. This creates a very intense and eerie sort of mood, which consolidate the theme of Expressionism. The acting is pretty good and both Anny Ondra and John Longden did well. Ondra greatly showed the expressions of a person recently exposed to trauma, and the close-ups of her occupied and fearful expressions emphasize her guilt. Longden first starts off as a pre- occupied character who doesn't pay much attention to Alice, but after the murder he becomes more concerned and does his best to keep her from confessing. I find it interesting that the film goes about different ways to silence Alice. She is never given a chance to tell her story, and hardly gets any input. The story was average for me, but I guess for that time period it could have been engaging. I felt that it lacked motivation on the part of the blackmailer (Donald Calthrop) and that his character just popped up so suddenly. The cinematography however was pretty creative. As mentioned before, there was some Expressionistic styles used in the film, and camera placements helped with that. Also, the beginning scene had a really great shot from a mirror that showed a criminal's point of view.I watched the version of this film with sound recorded, and it was pretty ingenious how sound was synchronized. The voice of Alice is from another actress, and Ondra was miming the words in the film. Though the sound at the beginning of the film is inconsistent and very much like a silent film, it got better throughout the film. Noticeably there was use of ambient noise as well as back shots of characters to eliminate sound synchronization problems. The use of sound to enhance Alice's subjective perception was also a great addition. A obvious example of this is when the neighbour starts gossiping and all Alice hears is knife blah blah blah knife! blah blah knife! That was pretty comedic (and annoying after awhile) but could be related to how Alice was hearing things.

One of the best and most creative horror films of all time. It's often lumped in with movies in the slasher subgenre, and it does use many of those tropes, but it's much more interesting and imaginative than 99% of the slashers out there. Freddy Krueger, wonderfully played by Robert Englund, became a pop culture phenomenon like nothing that had been seen with horror movies since maybe the Universal movie monsters of old. The guy was on lunchboxes, for crying out loud.The cast is pretty good, with Englund a standout for obvious reasons. Heather Langenkamp is one of horror's best final girls. She has a relatability and normal quality about her that is rare for Hollywood. Compare her to any of today's young horror movie actresses, who are almost always glamorous bimbos who are aspiring pop music stars or at least look like they are. Admittedly she's not the strongest actress but she does well with the role of Nancy. John Saxon is good as Nancy's father. Johnny Depp makes his film debut as Nancy's boyfriend and does a fine job. The only stinker in the cast really is Jsu Garcia (billed here as Nick Corri). Every scene with him is a little cringeworthy as he seems to be trying to be the James Dean of horror. The movie's full of memorable scenes and striking images, such as Freddy's face coming through the wall above Nancy's bed or his glove reaching up between her legs in the bathtub. Wes Craven's direction is excellent in what is arguably the highlight of his long career. The script is smart and inventive. Charles Bernstein's iconic score deserves more praise than it gets. It's an atmospheric and influential horror film that gets better with each viewing. The sequels, TV show, and remake that followed only served to highlight how great this first Nightmare on Elm Street film is. If you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself a favor and watch it. For the love of all that's sacred, please watch it before you even think about watching the 2010 remake.

Seriously, this one thing never made sense, since it seems that the two couples are going for a romantic retreat in the woods and she comes without a partner? Then again Cheryl is the only one to get lucky is this movie....When these friends go to this cabin things seem off. At first it is just little stuff like Cheryl being forced to draw creepy books or trapdoors randomly slamming open. When they explore the basement of the cabin they find The Book of the Dead and a skull bone dagger thing that according to Scotty looks like something Ash might have got it on with. They listen to a tape recording where the previous owner of the cabin reads some text from The Book of the Dead. One of these incantations releases the demons and they possesses Cheryl in one of the most awkward way possible. From then on the story is about the group surviving the onslaught of demons that are called Deadites. So the story is simple but the Deadites have this cool mythology setup and once these things are established, the second half of the story is non-stop horror. If you can really bring the scares in a horror film, you can get away with a slim story.

To kill a Deadite is upsetting for the characters because you have to kill a friend and because there deaths are really gruesome. Deadites really know how to milk a death because they won't just die; they will spurt out blood or leak out some really nasty yellow stuff. This film may not have the same kind of blood and violence modern horror film has, but it knows how to use it all creatively.The music score in the film is kind of a disappointment as it really just sounds like standard horror movie music. The sound that the evil force makes is the only really interesting sound in the movie.

Directed by Mamoru Oshii and written by Kazunori Itō, it is based in a dystopian future where a major section of the population has been cybernised. We meet Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg who works for the government in Section 9 and is called upon to do their 'dirty' work along with the other cyborgs. The major plot of the film revolves around the pursuit of a powerful hacker named 'The Puppet Master' by Motoko and the other cyborg cops on the order of the government. The extent to which every human being is cybernised varies. But Motoko is almost completely artificial. But like other cyborgs, she has been provided a 'ghost' inside her which effectively is equivalent to the soul of a human being. Thematically, the film explores all the insecurities and dilemmas that Motoko faces regarding her identity. In spite of the presence of the 'ghost' inside her, at a deeper level she knows that she can never be humane. She thinks she will always remain a government product which is supposed to carry out their orders without having an identity of her own.'Ghost in the Shell' is a film that strongly belongs to the cyberpunk genre. The influence of other artistic works belonging to this particular genre like Blade Runner and Neuromancer can be easily noticed in this film. Like other Cyberpunk stories, this film's storyline also thematically revolves around identity. Motoko's psychological struggle to find a singular unique identity for herself gets conveyed through blatant verbal conversations and also through beautiful metaphoric visuals. There is a beautiful scene where Motoko dives into the sea and goes deep inside. But when she swims back up to the surface she watches a reflection on the surface of the water and gradually merges with the reflection. She later said that although diving isn't something which is advised for cyborgs, but she still does it because that makes her feel vulnerable and scared like a human when she is in the water. But when she comes up she looks at the reflection and feels like she becomes a new individual. So the diving is a way for her to feel like a human. She has an identity inside the water. Outside the water she is again a government property. There is another masterful sequence where Motoko takes a ferry ride through the grim, dark cityscape. The sequence is rich with beautiful moments where Motoko just quietly observes the city and its people. She watches the mannequins in the stores. Reflections are used very often by Mamoru Oshii. These reflections again drive home the point of questioning your own identity. Monoto looks at her reflection and thinks about what she sees. Is she looking at a living being or is she looking at a machine? Like 'Blade Runner', 'Ghost in the Shell' also explores the idea of life and what it means to be alive. 'The Puppet Master' after he arrives also questions the right of his creators to undermine him by calling him a programme containing a set of information. He argues that the DNA in the human body consists of nothing but information too, which makes them not too different from cyborgs or other forms of artificial intelligence.The themes in the plot can be interpreted in various ways. In a literal sense, the film shows a cyborg trying to find herself in a dark and menacing world. She questions herself. She wants to become something more than just a tool for the government. I see it as a metaphor for female struggle in our world. A woman always gets labelled and is expected to carry out specific duties and obligations and very few women all around the world truly have the opportunity to live the life that they want to live and pursue their own dreams. Men suffer due to similar pressures too, but maybe not as much as women do. The film ends optimistically. The character of 'The Puppet Master' is used as a god-like figure that gives Monoto the strength to become more powerful. She starts her life again both figuratively as well as literally with a new body which is of a young girl. This might well be an optimistic note to end on by using a new cyborg body that symbolises a female representing the next generation who is powerful and confident about herself.The script is good when it comes to the themes it conveys. When it comes to the plot in a literal sense, it is maybe a bit predictable and you can certainly see the influence of William Gibson's 'Neuromancer'. It is directed very well and the film looks gorgeous. Every still is ornamented by spectacular and awe-inspiring artwork with intricate details. 'Ghost in the Shell' is a very intelligent piece of work. It is thought provoking and I believe requires multiple viewings and introspective discussions. It not only is a great anime film, but also a great film period and deserves its place in the category of other masterful Sci-fi films like '2001 A Space Odyssey', 'Blade Runner', 'Gravity' etc. that evokes emotions and intriguing questions about the society as well as the individual.

Directed by Mamoru Oshii and written by Kazunori Itō, it is based in a dystopian future where a major section of the population has been cybernised. We meet Motoko Kusanagi, a female cyborg who works for the government in Section 9 and is called upon to do their 'dirty' work along with the other cyborgs. The major plot of the film revolves around the pursuit of a powerful hacker named 'The Puppet Master' by Motoko and the other cyborg cops on the order of the government. The extent to which every human being is cybernised varies. But Motoko is almost completely artificial. But like other cyborgs, she has been provided a 'ghost' inside her which effectively is equivalent to the soul of a human being. Thematically, the film explores all the insecurities and dilemmas that Motoko faces regarding her identity. In spite of the presence of the 'ghost' inside her, at a deeper level she knows that she can never be humane. She thinks she will always remain a government product which is supposed to carry out their orders without having an identity of her own.'Ghost in the Shell' is a film that strongly belongs to the cyberpunk genre. The influence of other artistic works belonging to this particular genre like Blade Runner and Neuromancer can be easily noticed in this film. Like other Cyberpunk stories, this film's storyline also thematically revolves around identity. Motoko's psychological struggle to find a singular unique identity for herself gets conveyed through blatant verbal conversations and also through beautiful metaphoric visuals. There is a beautiful scene where Motoko dives into the sea and goes deep inside. But when she swims back up to the surface she watches a reflection on the surface of the water and gradually merges with the reflection. She later said that although diving isn't something which is advised for cyborgs, but she still does it because that makes her feel vulnerable and scared like a human when she is in the water.

For whatever reason, 80s movies stand out more to me over time (not just action movies, but movies in general). As accusatory as people are about the 80s being dated, I have a hard time not laughing at some of the absurd, odd apparel and grooming choices of society in the 90s. Thankfully, a good film can overcome these obstacles and not appear dated. This one, SPEED (1994) fits the bill!Starring Keanu Reeves, who in my opinion delivers his greatest film performance, Speed is an adrenaline rush of a movie. The movie starts with an intense, suspenseful sequence of a group of people trapped in an elevator rigged with a bomb set to detonated by it's creator psychopath Howard Payne (played solidly by Dennis Hopper). Enter our film's hero Officer Jack Traven (played by Reeves), a member of the LAPD S.W.A.T. team, along with his partner Harry (winningly played by Jeff Daniel). Harry is the typical snarky sidekick of the film's action hero, but Daniels' reliably goofy personality makes it work. This film actually makes me understand why he was good in Dumb and Dumber! LOL Reeves and Daniels buddy chemistry is believable.After Jack and Harry save the day, Payne is presumed dead in an explosion. A few months pass, and two city buses are rigged to explode. Turns out Payne is very much alive and out to play cat-and- mouse with Jack. Payne detonates the first bus, then tells Jack where the second one is. Jack finds the bus, but the catch is that once it goes over 50mph, it has to stay above that speed or the bomb will detonate, thus the plot of Speed!In a surprising development, one of the bus passengers Annie (wonderfully played by then relative unknown, but now famous Sandra Bullock), who was on her way to work, must take over the wheel and keep the bus above 50mph. Along for the ride are a group of reliable supporting players Joe Morton as the S.W.A.T team leader and Alan Ruck, Beth Grant, and Carlos Carrasco as part of the group of frustrated and frenetic bus passengers.Interestingly, the film starts off with hostages trapped in an LA high-rise office building, a la Die Hard, of which Speed has been called a ripoff in some circles. But Speed still works as it's own entity mainly due to Jack Traven feeling like an original character due to Reeves' strong acting and convincing performance as a cop and action hero, the Jack-Annie dynamic, and even the overall vibe of Speed is more fast-paced than Die Hard. Die Hard is still the seminal action film, but Speed is a great addition to the genre. In particular the stunts are very well-staged, convincingly delivered, and don't feel implausible for the most part. Now, the film definitely has a few minuses. Other than the action, of which there is a lot, much of the non-action scenes are the standard of most action films. While Hopper is very good as the villain of the piece, he's not nearly as memorable as other action movie bad guys, like the ones from the original Lethal Weapon and Die Hard movies. I've also read people say that Bullock steals the film, and I think that's incredibly overstated. Her role isn't as large in this as I initially remembered. While her chemistry with Keanu is palpable, this film is Reeves' movie all the way. While he may be the weaker actor overall of the main cast, in this film, REEVES steals the show! Although Jan De Bont would go onto to direct the extremely cheesy Twister and the awful sequel to this film Speed 2, both dubious projects to say the least, he can always hang his hat on Speed as being one of the most intense, engrossing action movie experiences of the 90s, if not of all time.

One thing Hero does better is sell its believability and accuracy.Dustin Hoffman's role of lowlife Bernard LaPlante reminds me of many people I grew up with-- all the way down to his core. He is a mean, dumb, hated loser who just wants money and spending time with his kid. One rainy night, his car breaks down and he witnesses a plane crash yards away from him. He pops the door open and reluctantly saves everybody just before the plane explodes (the plane had 54 passengers). It is funny the way he does it because since he doesn't want to save anybody. He did the right thing, but was it really in his nature? He loses one of his hundred dollar shoes in the event and gives the other to a bum (Andy Garcia) the next day. Bernie wants to keep a low-profile and not attract much attention because of all his felonies and criminal ties.Geena Davis plays a reporter who is always in search of a good story and happens to be on the plane. Nobody gets a good looks at Hoffman, so a search for a lowlife with the other shoe begins. Bernie is in jail due to stolen goods and Garcia claims to be the hero as he is a lowlife who has the shoe. The movie is nice and fun up until this point, but Garcia stepping up to the plate is where it really starts to sizzle. Garcia is awarded one million dollars and becomes a nationwide sensation, renowned hero and inspiration to millions. Garcia is humble and uses the money for good, but Hoffman--who is the actually hero of the crash--would have kept it all for himself. So the viewer must decide who is more worthy. The publicity the Davis starts is exactly how the media works and people are manipulated. That is how it is similar to Wag the Dog. The first component that makes this movie great is Dustin Hoffman. He is one of the best actors in film history and his role as a complete loser is both funny and heartrending. That is hard to do. He is also the protagonist and changes the least out of the three leads. In every movie there is chemistry, and Hoffman slightly changes but still stays to to your average thug from the ghetto. It is rare that a character stays the same throughout a movie but is still great. I did touch base on how the media is affective, but the big picture and moral is what makes a hero. Bernie LaPlante is a hero because he saved people from a plane crash. Andy Garcia is a hero because he is a selfless inspiration.

He did the right thing, but was it really in his nature? He loses one of his hundred dollar shoes in the event and gives the other to a bum (Andy Garcia) the next day. Bernie wants to keep a low-profile and not attract much attention because of all his felonies and criminal ties.Geena Davis plays a reporter who is always in search of a good story and happens to be on the plane. Nobody gets a good looks at Hoffman, so a search for a lowlife with the other shoe begins. Bernie is in jail due to stolen goods and Garcia claims to be the hero as he is a lowlife who has the shoe. The movie is nice and fun up until this point, but Garcia stepping up to the plate is where it really starts to sizzle. Garcia is awarded one million dollars and becomes a nationwide sensation, renowned hero and inspiration to millions. Garcia is humble and uses the money for good, but Hoffman--who is the actually hero of the crash--would have kept it all for himself. So the viewer must decide who is more worthy. The publicity the Davis starts is exactly how the media works and people are manipulated. That is how it is similar to Wag the Dog. The first component that makes this movie great is Dustin Hoffman. He is one of the best actors in film history and his role as a complete loser is both funny and heartrending. That is hard to do. He is also the protagonist and changes the least out of the three leads. In every movie there is chemistry, and Hoffman slightly changes but still stays to to your average thug from the ghetto. It is rare that a character stays the same throughout a movie but is still great. I did touch base on how the media is affective, but the big picture and moral is what makes a hero. Bernie LaPlante is a hero because he saved people from a plane crash. Andy Garcia is a hero because he is a selfless inspiration. This feel-good dramedy is one of the most underrated movies of the decade. I highly recommend it.

As a matter of fact, I'm the same age as the movie! I mean the first Terminator movie is a classic also and gave both Arnold and director James Cameron their big break. But Terminator 2 is what cemented it all and took the franchise to a whole new level. I mean pretty much everything about it is excellent the acting, the writing, the action scenes, the music, the visual effects and the characters. It even had a couple of twists and surprises for us as well. One of the things I love most about movie is the relationship between John Connor and the Terminator which how John bonds with the machine and teaches it how to be more human and understand the importance of human life and emotion. In fact, the Terminator becomes a father figure (similar to how Ripley becomes a mother figure to Newt in Aliens). As for the acting, everyone knows Arnold Schwarzenegger can't act, but still you got to love him as the Terminator because that was the role he was born to play. Also Linda Hamilton was incredible reprising her role as a heroine specializing in guns and weapons. And this movie was a nice introduction to Edward Furlong since this was his first movie and he managed to pull off as a rebellious kid yet always tries to do the right thing. And Robert Patrick made an even better villain who is menacing, intimidating and powerful. In fact, he was almost unstoppable if it wasn't for that steel mill. So in conclusion, Terminator 2 is one of my favourite movies of all time, as it is for many other people as well. I just wished they hadn't made the two other sequels. I mean Terminator 3 was disappointing but Terminator 4 was okay but I haven't seen Terminator 5 yet. I mean it got bad reviews but a lot of fans seemed to have enjoyed it. Even James Cameron said he liked it so maybe I'll give it a try when it comes out on DVD. But I seriously doubt it could as epic as Terminator 2.

Dickerson shoots Bedford-Stuyvesant with such intensity and colour that it literally becomes a cultural melting pot. It's the hottest day of summer, but we know this even without the in-world references and the narration of radio jockey Mister Señor Love Daddy. His palette is awash with 'hot' colours that perfectly capture the heat of the setting; reds, oranges, yellows that boil under the surface and seep through the screen until racial tensions that have been harboured for years explode into focus. There is a montage that bursts with this anger; later used again in Lee's 25th Hour. When Radio Raheem strides into Sal's blasting Fight the Power, he demands a slice of pizza and is shot with a wide lens, which distorts his face and makes it loom large in the frame, towering over the POV recipient. This is relevant to Sal, but also to Pino, who is quite sure of his racist views. This is a canvas full of characters that pop out at you. Their skin shines with sweat and the words that comes out of their mouths resemble authenticity; why else would we be so frustrated with an act of simply buying radio batteries, or how irresponsible Mookie becomes in both his job and his love life? These are flawed characters, and Lee spends much of his time devoted to criticising them, not outright, but by showing who they are and prompting us to understand. Sal is proud that he has raised this street on his pizza, and berates Pino for being outwardly racist, then in a fit of anger smashes a black man's property who has come barging into his pizzeria demanding 'justice'. In another burst of anger, Radio Raheem chokes out the man who has destroyed his one treasured possession, and we understand his rage, but not necessarily how he goes about dishing it out. Anger and the heat drives these people to do these things. Some interpretations have said that Mookie redirects the mob rage to property instead of Sal - the right thing. No, he is angry, angry that love has lost out to hate, that a brother has been killed, and of course that emotion boils over in him too, and he must take action.Later he returns to ask for what he is due - his salary - and we see now that he his hostility is not aimed at Sal at all, or his pizzeria. People have endlessly pondered on what is the right thing to do in this film. There are no easy answers. A community has lost a brother in an act of brutality, perhaps not purposely in the haze of rioting and violence. The riot is not the right thing in the sense that they destroy Sal's beloved pizzeria, and they even nearly veer towards the Korean grocery in their anger. In a different sense, it is an act that cries out loudly from the oppressed. Sal's pizzeria will rise again - he has his insurance, and his mutual relationship with his customers. But Radio Raheem is dead, and will remain dead, and there must be a response. That response is directed towards the window, and oh it's heartbreaking to see his life's work go up in flames, but where is the heartbreak for Raheem's radio, a piece of property in itself? Or more importantly, his life? It would have been very easy for Lee to tilt the scales. But he doesn't; when the white copes arrive in the wake of a prank that leaves a man and his car soaked, they brush it off. Da Mayor is a small voice of reason that perhaps does the only righteous things in saving a little boy and trying in vain to reason with the riot. No one but Raheem and Smiley even agree with Buggin Out's boycott; they've been raised on this pizza after all, and though they prop up Sal with their business, it is a two way street, with it being the only place along with the Korean grocer where food is available. But they riot with him anyway. Why is that? It is a significantly more important question than, why did they riot at all? And then there is love between the lines. Watch how Mookie quietly seduces Tina with a block of ice, as he skips out on his work. See how Sal treats Jade with respect and care, even as both his son and her brother observe with disapproval (maybe even disgust in Pino). They see eye to eye on this particular issue, but unfortunately on opposite sides. Da Mayor seeks romance with Mother Sister, who is wary of his drunkenness, but also wise in recognising his kindness and goodness. But then in climax, she too is shouting for the pizzeria to be burnt down. Tricky. Lee ends with two conflicting perspectives from MLK and Malcolm X, but which seem to fit together. Oh, this form of protest is violent and impractical and immoral, but what are the residents of Bedford-Stuyvesant supposed to do in the wake of a brother's death? And then you can condemn them too, and go on forever arguing. But at least we are arguing about it. We need to be.Film Crit Hulk offers some enlightenment. He ponders that people still ask why Mookie smashed Sal's window, but not why the police killed Radio Raheem. It is something to consider. People say, why couldn't have Raheem just turned off his music, but those same do not say, why could Sal not have referred to it as 'jungle music'? The latter seems to be reasonable (Even I wrestled with it upon my first watch), but again, we filter the events. He eloquently sums up this film better than I could in one sentence It's impossible to do the right thing when no one seems to care when the wrong things are done to you.

Dickerson shoots Bedford-Stuyvesant with such intensity and colour that it literally becomes a cultural melting pot. It's the hottest day of summer, but we know this even without the in-world references and the narration of radio jockey Mister Señor Love Daddy. His palette is awash with 'hot' colours that perfectly capture the heat of the setting; reds, oranges, yellows that boil under the surface and seep through the screen until racial tensions that have been harboured for years explode into focus. There is a montage that bursts with this anger; later used again in Lee's 25th Hour. When Radio Raheem strides into Sal's blasting Fight the Power, he demands a slice of pizza and is shot with a wide lens, which distorts his face and makes it loom large in the frame, towering over the POV recipient. This is relevant to Sal, but also to Pino, who is quite sure of his racist views. This is a canvas full of characters that pop out at you. Their skin shines with sweat and the words that comes out of their mouths resemble authenticity; why else would we be so frustrated with an act of simply buying radio batteries, or how irresponsible Mookie becomes in both his job and his love life? These are flawed characters, and Lee spends much of his time devoted to criticising them, not outright, but by showing who they are and prompting us to understand. Sal is proud that he has raised this street on his pizza, and berates Pino for being outwardly racist, then in a fit of anger smashes a black man's property who has come barging into his pizzeria demanding 'justice'. In another burst of anger, Radio Raheem chokes out the man who has destroyed his one treasured possession, and we understand his rage, but not necessarily how he goes about dishing it out. Anger and the heat drives these people to do these things. Some interpretations have said that Mookie redirects the mob rage to property instead of Sal - the right thing. No, he is angry, angry that love has lost out to hate, that a brother has been killed, and of course that emotion boils over in him too, and he must take action.Later he returns to ask for what he is due - his salary - and we see now that he his hostility is not aimed at Sal at all, or his pizzeria. People have endlessly pondered on what is the right thing to do in this film. There are no easy answers. A community has lost a brother in an act of brutality, perhaps not purposely in the haze of rioting and violence. The riot is not the right thing in the sense that they destroy Sal's beloved pizzeria, and they even nearly veer towards the Korean grocery in their anger. In a different sense, it is an act that cries out loudly from the oppressed. Sal's pizzeria will rise again - he has his insurance, and his mutual relationship with his customers. But Radio Raheem is dead, and will remain dead, and there must be a response. That response is directed towards the window, and oh it's heartbreaking to see his life's work go up in flames, but where is the heartbreak for Raheem's radio, a piece of property in itself? Or more importantly, his life? It would have been very easy for Lee to tilt the scales. But he doesn't; when the white copes arrive in the wake of a prank that leaves a man and his car soaked, they brush it off. Da Mayor is a small voice of reason that perhaps does the only righteous things in saving a little boy and trying in vain to reason with the riot.

The film revolves around a young enthusiastic 19 year old soldier named Alyosha who receives a medal for his heroic act in the front when he single handedly destroys two German tanks. Instead of this he appeals to be granted leave for a few days to visit his mother. Throughout his journey home he comes to fully realize the turmoil and affect of war on humans. One of the many themes this film portrays is heroism. At the beginning we immediately realize that Alyosha isn't particularly this traditional amazing hero as we see him fleeing from the German tanks, but his instincts to survive has him become an accidental hero. This isn't writing off his title of a hero in any way. The presentation of a heroic act between the scene of him staying back to deliver the message that a group of tanks were heading their way, to the scene of him saving countless people from the train wreckage that happens later in the film is comparatively different in the portrayal of a hero. The treatment in soldiers from the beginning of the filming towards the end is significantly different as at the beginning many citizens were willing to help Alyosha get home, but near the end it was difficult to have someone take him merely 5 miles to see his mother. He was treated as a good for nothing or obstacle especially in the scene where he had saved several people from the train wreck. Chukhrai usage of angles is rather unique, for example the deep focus shot that is slowly turned upside down when Alyosha is running away from the German tanks gives a sense of disorientation and loss that the battlefield is composed up. Chukhrai especially like to elongate characters and objects perhaps to highlight the importance these elements have on the film. Although the film does respect authority figures and idealizes soviet workers it does devote a lot of its attention on the humanistic picture that is powerful as it is devastating. For example the scene were Alyosha meets a veteran who lost his leg and is hesitant to return to his wife.

Don, on the contrary, starts his career in showbiz as a vaudeville artist and stuntman with his fellow Cosmo Brown (O'Connor), so his bent of singing and dancing well-tested. One day, running away from crazed fans, Daon hops on the car of a young girl Kathy Selden (Reynolds), who quite pertly disses the superficiality of his acting and stardom, it strikes a chord to Don, who begins to question his own capability.However, it turns out Kathy is a struggling starlet, with a doll-like cuteness and a voice can sing. Don falls for her instantly, but does she love him back? Of course she does, it is a musical comedy, no one can resist a superstar's charm. After THE JAZZ SINGER becomes a sensational hit, all the studios begin to tread its footsteps, so Don-and-Lina's next picture will be their first talkie, named THE DUELLING CAVALIER, talking is a cinch for Don, but the soft underbelly is Lina's cockamamie voice, a disastrous test screening forebodes this talkie would be the Waterloo for Don-and-Lina trademark.

Don, on the contrary, starts his career in showbiz as a vaudeville artist and stuntman with his fellow Cosmo Brown (O'Connor), so his bent of singing and dancing well-tested. One day, running away from crazed fans, Daon hops on the car of a young girl Kathy Selden (Reynolds), who quite pertly disses the superficiality of his acting and stardom, it strikes a chord to Don, who begins to question his own capability.However, it turns out Kathy is a struggling starlet, with a doll-like cuteness and a voice can sing. Don falls for her instantly, but does she love him back? Of course she does, it is a musical comedy, no one can resist a superstar's charm. After THE JAZZ SINGER becomes a sensational hit, all the studios begin to tread its footsteps, so Don-and-Lina's next picture will be their first talkie, named THE DUELLING CAVALIER, talking is a cinch for Don, but the soft underbelly is Lina's cockamamie voice, a disastrous test screening forebodes this talkie would be the Waterloo for Don-and-Lina trademark.

The problems with it was the animation the characters colors looked more darker and the Genie looked less Blue and his face looked kinda weird also he was kinda weak in the final battle. Jafar is great as always and i must say i liked this ending better than the Original movies ending more Genie Jafar is always great probably my favorite look of him.
