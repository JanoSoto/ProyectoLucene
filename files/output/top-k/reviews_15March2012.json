[{"date":"15 March 2012","score":"","review":" Lola Rennt is probably the best German film to date! I've seen it a couple of times now and each time it is as fascinating as it was when I first saw it on the big screen.The most stunning thing about this movie is the fast pace that is maintained through all aspects of the film the sound, the music, the camera perspectives, the editing, etc. Plus Franka Potente does an excellent job to underline this effect.But to be honest Lola Rennt is no film for the casual moviegoer who just wants to see another mainstream movie as we so often see it in Hollywood movies. It is in nearly every aspect different from the average movie and has a lot of stylistic (animated sequences, split-screen, etc) and narrative twists that you won't see in most films today.Score 10 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 March 2012","score":"","review":" Lola Rennt is probably the best German film to date!
