First and foremost Episode One, was meant to be a set up film. Not only for the next two movies, but for the whole saga. George Lucas wanted to tell the back story. The rise of the Empire and the Sith, and the fall of the Old Republic. The main point was to know Who was Darth Vader. First off to know Who Vader was we have to start at the beginning. When he was a boy, as set up in this Movie, we get a basic sense who the boy who would grow up to become Vader, really is. Now First Aestheticlly, the movie is phenomenal. The settings and visuals really are Gorgeous. The Special Effects, for a 1999 film, still hold up Today in 2010. They were Groundbreaking and Nothing like this was ever done before. I mean let's be real. Without Lucasfilm's ILM there would be No real Special Effects. Next, The story- Obviouslly the First installment was based towards a younger generation. Jar- Jar, at first I couldn't stand him. I thought he was horrible. Now I look back at the movies again and, yes there are some things that were too slapstick. However Overall he really wasen't That bad a character. He was clumsy and awkward. However in a strange way, He more or less worked. Now the story which was set 10 years before Episode II, the main plot didn't focus on the story as a whole. Yes people will always complain, but every installment of the Star Wars movies, had it's importance. In episode I,it was to show Anakin's Start, how he was a nice kid. His start as a padawan. Now some people say this Midiclorian stuff was wrong. I kind of agree, something that made the force special, was not knowing really what it was or the true mysteries behind it. Kind of like the impossibility of Understanding what God really is. Did the midi's ruin anything for me? No, it was really a small part of the movie. Kind of like in A New Hope, When people were wearing shirts Han shot first O.K. let's be real, does it really matter in the story as a whole, NO! Get a life people, Kiss a Girl. Anyway back to Episode I, the main point was the force is strong in the Skywalker blood line. So to assume that Anakin Destroyed the Droid control ship was random. As Qui-Gon says Nothing that happens is accidental The force is behind it all. Next, In order to tell a movie that would please everyone, well that is impossible. Was this the best Movie? NO, it was still a very good beginning to the Star Wars saga. As they say all sagas have a beginning.

Marc Levin embarks on a film where a young black man Ray Joshua, played by Saul Williams, gets caught dealing after the man he was dealing with is shot. Ray later gets sentenced to jail for four years where his natural gift of slam poetry is embraced. In one encounter he finds himself developing feelings for Lauren Bell, a woman visits prison for poetry sessions, also shares a passion for slam poetry. Together, they find out how similar they really are, while Ray makes a decision of staying in the place that got him in the mess he's in now, or he takes a different way, the way that could free him from all his daily misery.The story is bland, far from what I hoped it to be. To me the most exciting scenes in the film were towards the end when a bunch of characters from the movie recited slam poems. Unfortunately, the film is just trying to show us how people who live in the ghetto, stay in the ghetto for the most part. They don't have aspirations of leaving because being sufficient to them means selling drugs to make a living. Ray, like many others have many forces that define who he is. For one, the poverty from where he is raised and currently lives is a force that is carried out throughout the film. Another force would be the because you are black and poor, there's no place for you outside of the ghetto. The negativity that discriminating people have for African-Americans triggers Ray. Even though I believe that this film was a repetition of what struggling black people in the ghettos go through on an everyday basis, I feel like the integration of poetry into his life gave a little piece of hope that many could have just thrown it away.All in all I didn't think the quality of the film was all that great. It seemed like I was watching a live documentary being shot from a regular video recorder. I personally don't like movies that finish open-ended, but for others it gives them a way to imagine how the film would have ended having had them as the director. In part the message of the film is trying to tell us is that no matter how poor conditions you were brought up in, there is a way to break out and find that good-positive path that deep down inside everyone wished they had. Sadly, the message is never really concluded because we don't know what Ray ends up deciding on. If you like the typical lost and confused boy who doesn't know where and who to turn to in the beginning, ends up ruining his life in the middle, and ends up somewhat saving his life again&#x97;then you'll like Slam.

That is probably the only bad thing about this film, the timing. The American President was a political\/romantic comedy film, that was directed by Rob Reiner and written by Aaron Sorkin (both famous from A Few Good Men). The film had a lot to say about politics but because we were in a stable political time, it was ignored. That is a real shame because this is one of the best political movies ever made.The film is about President of the United States, Andrew Shepherd (portrayed by Michael Douglas) in his third year in office. After achieving a 63% job approval rating he decides to tighten ship and focus on passing a crime bill through congress. Well that doesn't sit well with the Global Defence Council who are continuously asking the president for a large fossil fuel reduction (20%) on the new environment bill. This in turn causes the presidents first meeting with GDC lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade (Portrayed by Annette Bening). A fire ball, Sydney's first meeting with the president is followed shortly by her inadvertently insulting him. After a few awkward meetings they become a couple. The problem is that this relationship is the perfect opening for Republican Senator (and presidential opponent) Bob Rumson (portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss) to start a character debate with the president. This causes his job approval rating to start dropping and the loss of votes on the crime bill.The acting and writing have to be the two most important things in this film. Douglas plays the president that we all want; confident and wont back down to spineless opponents. He and Bening are the root of this film but Michael J Fox and Richard Dreyfuss are the cherries on top of the Sunday. Fox plays an unspecified role (sorry but it's never specified) in the presidents cabinet. He is the member who always wants to stay on the right path, wants to be risky to do the right thing. He is my favourite actor in the film and I'm sure that anyone who sees this will agree. Dreyfuss plays Rumson and I'm completely positive that this is the role that got Oliver Stone to select him for the role of Dick Cheney in his film W.There is a quote that sums up what this film is about.Lewis Rothschild You have a deeper love of this country than any man I've ever known.

People want leadership, Mr. President, and in the absence of genuine leadership, they'll listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone. They want leadership. They're so thirsty for it they'll crawl through the desert toward a mirage, and when they discover there's no water, they'll drink the sand. President Andrew Shepherd Lewis, we've had presidents who were beloved, who couldn't find a coherent sentence with two hands and a flashlight. People don't drink the sand because they're thirsty. They drink the sand because they don't know the difference.God just watching that scene sends shivers down my spine. It is mind boggling. If this movie had been made just a few years later this world would be such a better place. I believe that if it had been released in say late 1999 or mid 2000 then Gore might have won the election.

This film is almost perfect so i'm giving it 9.4 stars out of 10. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"23 May 2010","score":"","review":" Where can we draw the line between poetry and rap? Both extraordinary ways to express oneself, but in between the two is a combination of both which is spoken word. In the inspirational movie SLAM written by Marc Lavin and Richard Stratton spoken word is a way for release of one's emotions. This movie follows Ray Joshua throughout some period of his life where he was caught in the wrong situation. One evening while selling drugs to his friend just to get some money a drive by occurred and shot his friend in the head. In shock Ray flees the scene and the cops catch him then arrest him for possession of drugs. While in jail Ray is in jail his prison mates are not so fond of him and bully him but one day Ray silences the violence with his spoken word piece called Amethyst Rocks. Had he mentioned earlier to someone that he would use spoken word to silence other people's negative actions that person would have thought he was crazy to think that could work. Letting out his emotions left the other men surprised with his actions. While this event happened a poetry teacher named Lauren observed from a distance and admired Ray's bravery. After a flirtatious moment Lauren asks Ray to attend her poetry classes. These classes inspire Ray to do more so once he gets out of prison he changes his act and who he hangs with as well.In this film the authors are trying to critique the prisons effect on society. They do this by showing how unfair the justice system is towards Ray. Ray gets into trouble with the law because of one force that defines who he is, this force is dealing drugs and it is his way to make a living; it's just a way for Ray to get by in life. This force defines him negatively because it gets him into the wrong situation thus lading him straight into jail. A positive force that has affected Ray is spoken word. He uses this as a way to vent as well as express himself. With the negative and positive influence Ray chooses to define himself in a positive way and is successful with it. He gets out of prison and makes a point to his friend that an eye for an eye will just make the whole world go blind. He also starts to hang out with a different crowd of people including Lauren. When spending more time with her he learns a lot about her past too.One theme that occurs in the film is no matter how tough things go there is always an escape from the negativity. For example, Ray gets put into jail because possession of drugs and everything turned out so unfair for him. If he went to court and tried to prove himself innocent then was pleaded guilty then he would have to be in jail longer. Although he did commit a crime he was not responsible for the shooting. Once Ray is in jail he encounters many dilemmas with the other prison mates but in the end he finds an escape through spoken word. The negativity of others rash actions made him seek for a positive escape. Consequently Ray was let out of prison only if he could stop the war between his friends and the real perpetrators of the crime. His friends all want revenge but Ray preaches otherwise and his friends begin to accept it and decide not to fight back. Also Lauren lashes out on Ray because she thinks he doesn't know what she's been through or who she is. While this is occurring we find out that Lauren used to be a drug addict and a prostitute. This harmful lifestyle did not stop her from becoming a healthy person and staying away from the bad habits. In the end Ray attends a poetry slam and in his spoken word he says, I would stand there and whisper memories of my children's future I would let their future dwell in my past so that I might live a brighter now (Sha-Clack-Clack). These words mean a lot, and to me I believe they say he will remember his past and the past of his ancestors to allow himself and his future children a better and brighter life. If Ray and Lauren kept letting the negative forces define them then they would have never made it to a more positive lifestyle.Throughout the film many inspiring events occur but my favorite part was when Ray stopped his friends from going to get revenge on who shot his other friend. I could relate to my favorite part because I try to be kind of a mediator and I like to try and get the message of peace out to the world. I can also connect to Ray and his escape through writing, whenever I am upset I take it out on a piece of paper and let out all my problems which relieves me. This whole film I believe has a great message and to viewers it shows that you can never let negative forces define you because there is always a positive escape. This film was very inspirational and I would most definitely recommend it so other people could be just as moved as I was.

The Captain & crew quickly realise this fact & also realise the significance of the date as the 15th December was the eve of the Pearl Harbour attack by the Japanese during World War II, Captain Yelland must decide whether to intervene & defeat the Japanese & risk changing all of recorded history or whether to stand by & do nothing...Directed by Don Taylor this is an interesting sci-fi fantasy drama that is hard to categorise & while the potential was here for something special I personally think The Final Countdown falls somewhat short. Credited with four screenwriters time travel had rarely been tackled in an intelligent or thought provoking way before in cinema, the majority of films to feature the concept of time travel merely used either the past or future to set some sort of adventure in & I suspect it was the makers intention to add a little thought to the idea. At 100 odd minutes The Final Countdown starts off briskly enough & the Nimitz & crew are stuck in 1941 fairly quickly & then the debate begins & the real point of the film is made, basically what if we could change history? Should we & what would the consequences be? The whole time paradox issue is brought up & things are discussed & debated & both sides of the argument are represented by old fashioned Commander Owens who believes things are what they are & cocky young office boy Lasky who sees immense possibilities in righting past mistakes, both men have their stand point & opinions & luckily the film never becomes too bogged down with hypothetical chit chat although that's not to say there isn't any because there is. The film moves along at a reasonable pace, while not exactly fast it maintains one interest through a strong story & some decent if restrained action. Now, the major talking point is the climax, the cop-out climax where no-one is forced to make any kind of decision which after investing an hour & forty minutes in it feels a little bit of a let down. The character's are quite well balanced with opinions & views, surprisingly not every naval officer wants to go to war & the dialogue is pretty good too.The one aspect that really adds to The Final Countdown was that it was actually shot on the USS Nimitz which gives it amazing authenticity, the real crew were used in shots & the makers were allowed to film training exercises & the like. This really looks authentic because basically it is. Apparently footage from the Pearl Harbour war film Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) was edited into The Final Countdown presumably to cut costs or to represent scenes they were unable to film. The special effects are pretty poor, the storm effects in particular look very dated. The aircraft flying scenes however look good & were probably mostly real except for a few model shots.Filmed in the Atlantic Ocean on the real USS Nimitz, Virginia & Florida the film looks good with the actual Nimitz location invaluable, I doubt set makers could have done anywhere near as convincing a job. The cult song The Final Countdown by Eruope is not featured anywhere, bummer. There's a good cast on show including Kirk Douglas, James Farentino, Katharine Ross, Charles Durning & Martin Sheen who in this really looks almost exactly like the way his son Charlie would during his mid to late 80's films.The Final Countdown is a sci-fi fantasy drama that tried to experiment with the time travel concept & was one of the first to explore the consequences & decisions surrounding it but a seriously none event of a climax & a slightly slow pace may leave some frustrated, an interesting & watchable curiosity but not a must see.

This film is about this young man named Harold, who gets enjoyment out of pretending to commit suicide and going to funerals, that is until he meets this very strange 79 year old lady, Maude, at a funeral. They end up becoming great friends and enjoy being together, that is until Maude's 80th birthday when she takes some pills because she believes that you shouldn't live past 80.In Harold and Maude Harold does many bizarre things, things people don't really do for fun, but they are very interesting to the audience, for example going to funerals for fun. He enjoys going to random peoples funerals and sitting there and watching the whole thing. He also in the beginning of the film several times fakes his own death, but not in a peaceful way, he does it with such anger for example with the scene of him in the bath tub with blood all over the bathroom. He does it in a way that makes it truly look like is dead. Most of the things he does in this film are very entertaining though. Like his and Maudes relationship. He is about 18 or 19 and Maude is 79 and 80 by the end of the film. Their friendship begins with them at a funeral and throughout the rest of the film they are great friends and even become more than that by the end. The strangeness of their friendship is what helps make the movie so funny and entertaining. Maudes this old woman who loves to borrow things from total strangers, like other peoples cars. Throughout the film you see her steal many different cars and one time it's even Harold's hearse in the scene between 2135 and 2434.I think that the importance of this film is to entertain you. It was made so that you could have a laugh at Harold and Maudes strange but cute friendship. I think that it was also made to show that no matter what, you always have a friend, even if you are a strange person like Harold.

In the movie a young man named Ray Joshua gets caught up in this stereotypical generation, while gang violence and drug dealing causes Ray to become another statistic in his society. This inspirational tale lets the viewer see how people in different surroundings can be faulted so easily based on their race, neighborhood, and level of threat to society. Ray makes the best of it when he stumbles upon a passion for slam poetry which changes his whole perspective on life.When Ray participates in a drug deal gone bad and is arrested for possession of a controlled substance and suspicion of homicide, he starts to realize the odds of him fighting this and winning his freedom back is slim to none. While in jail he is defined as a typical African American drug dealer but he begins to fight back when he finds a way to resolve a fight between to gangs by blessing them with his free written poetic rap which talks about the forces that try define him. Ray fights back and attempts to change the way he lives his life by trying to end the revenge between the people that shot his friend in a drug deal gone bad. Not even the violence can define Ray as he uses his imagination to express all his feelings through poetry. He begins to go down the right path when he gets out of jail and does everything in his power to live above society's definition of him and try to better his surroundings. He does this when he stands up to his enemies and explains that revenge is pointless and they should just squash their beef.Extra Credit One theme I saw replay itself in the movie is how the public views people like Ray and how these people fall right into societies trap because it's the only way they know. Nobody expects for these Washington D.C. punks to ever grow out of the ghetto and make something better of themselves. Ray really proves his society wrong when he shows everyone that he can be a good person and he expresses this through his poetry which opens up a whole new group of people who teach him the typical or expected way isn't always the way to go. Society views Ray and his community as public enemies number one because everyone assumes they will all just become drug dealers or killers and end up in jail. This is a horrible stereotype that is seen everywhere in the world and can define the people in the ghetto. It takes a strong man to live above this definition and try to make something better of himself.My favorite part in this movie is when Ray attempts to stop or delay a fight about to break out in the jail yard. I loved this part because anyone can write a poem and make it rhyme, but it takes a strong motivated individual to use his poetry as a way to make people think about the decisions they make and ultimately put a stop to a deadly situation. I can relate to when Ray was meeting with his public defender and he was given the ultimatum of either going to trial and fear losing or pleading guilty for less time even if he was guilty. When I was in eighth grade I worked at a concession stand at a football field where I was accused of stealing money. I denied stealing the money and I was told either I admit to stealing the money and giving it back or they were going to call the cops. I told them to call the cops because I knew I was innocent. About a week later I got a call from the woman who runs the concession stand and she explained that another worker and her own son had admitted to stealing the money. I felt helpless when I was given an ultimatum because I realized that when people don't believe you, you could be paying the consequences for another person's wrong doing. I could tell that Ray felt helpless and trapped in between two negative outcomes. This film sends the viewers a message that if you don't try to better yourself from the people around you, then you will fall into societies definition of a typical ghetto troublemaker.

His imagination and his earnest desire to conjure up fanatic, and sometimes insanely chaotic, images has always been strong. None of his work is lacking in energy, but perhaps his most interesting films, in my opinion, are his first four. Bad Taste is perhaps his most curiously unusual. It's obvious that he pulled this picture off with little to no money, and he's obviously talented when it comes to visuals. This relatively plot-less film is pretty much just about aliens who have taken over the earth and are eating human beings as part of an extraterrestrial fast-food relocation program. The film is pretty much just about how the few survivors do battle with the aliens and what kinds of crazy things happen in their fight. There are more colorful characters than I can even remember, but there's also a lot of bloodshed. This gory, over-the-top, tasteless film throws in everything but the kitchen sink in it's abundant display of mayhem, flesh eating, and exploding body parts. It's utterly surprising to me that this film was not released by Troma, because it'd make a perfect double feature with The Toxic Avenger. Bad Taste is insanely disgusting, but also very campy. What normally passes for undisciplined action films of the 80s has instead been given a rather retro downgrade by this film. It is reminiscent of an Ed Wood film, but obviously more self-aware. The only thing that Bad Taste lacks is a heart, but I doubt that fans of the film will really care.Bad Taste is the kind of film that I wish to god that I could have seen when I was younger. This is a juvenile film that has no fears or limits to it's depraved content. People who have an interest in film-making will be overjoyed by this film's brilliant use of it's budget limitations. This is one of the best films a wannabe filmmaker could watch. It's creative, cheap, effective, and very satisfying. The problem with it, however, is that as a film in general it's really not all that good. I wouldn't even say that it's as good as The Toxic Avenger, though it's certainly loads better than most Troma films out there especially considering such utter tripe as Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy and Zombie Island Massacre. The main thing that Bad Taste delivers on, above all else, is the gore. If you're looking for a revoltingly gory film, this is one of the slickest you'll find. A lot of it's humor comes from the gore as well, and it's all in as much bad taste as the title of the film implies. This film succeeds in being what it's trying to be, and Peter Jackson must be applauded for that. The film works better when you view it as a master filmmaker's student film, however, because Bad Taste does not offer much else besides gross out humor, visual effects, and good make-up. The film just is not all that memorable. None of the characters were interesting or funny and none of them had traits that made them stick out. The film looks like utter crap, shot obviously on the most passable restraints. The film does not make good enough use of it's New Zealand location shooting, though the scenery does look absolutely beautiful. The aliens all look so fake and rubber that it's almost completely embarrassing. This is a really bad film.On the other hand, however, I can't help but feel that all of this is what makes this so appealing. In that regard, the best way to watch this film would be with a group of friends. It would likely be a lot more entertaining and would be a lot funnier in that environment. With a film like this, or The Rocky Horror Picture Show, or Clerks, or Pink Flamingos, judging it as a film is not fair. It's more about quantity than quality, and viewing it as you would any other film will simply diminish it's power. Putting all this aside, I think that there are far better films out there that are more worth watching than other people.

His imagination and his earnest desire to conjure up fanatic, and sometimes insanely chaotic, images has always been strong. None of his work is lacking in energy, but perhaps his most interesting films, in my opinion, are his first four. Bad Taste is perhaps his most curiously unusual. It's obvious that he pulled this picture off with little to no money, and he's obviously talented when it comes to visuals. This relatively plot-less film is pretty much just about aliens who have taken over the earth and are eating human beings as part of an extraterrestrial fast-food relocation program. The film is pretty much just about how the few survivors do battle with the aliens and what kinds of crazy things happen in their fight. There are more colorful characters than I can even remember, but there's also a lot of bloodshed. This gory, over-the-top, tasteless film throws in everything but the kitchen sink in it's abundant display of mayhem, flesh eating, and exploding body parts. It's utterly surprising to me that this film was not released by Troma, because it'd make a perfect double feature with The Toxic Avenger. Bad Taste is insanely disgusting, but also very campy. What normally passes for undisciplined action films of the 80s has instead been given a rather retro downgrade by this film. It is reminiscent of an Ed Wood film, but obviously more self-aware. The only thing that Bad Taste lacks is a heart, but I doubt that fans of the film will really care.Bad Taste is the kind of film that I wish to god that I could have seen when I was younger. This is a juvenile film that has no fears or limits to it's depraved content. People who have an interest in film-making will be overjoyed by this film's brilliant use of it's budget limitations. This is one of the best films a wannabe filmmaker could watch. It's creative, cheap, effective, and very satisfying. The problem with it, however, is that as a film in general it's really not all that good. I wouldn't even say that it's as good as The Toxic Avenger, though it's certainly loads better than most Troma films out there especially considering such utter tripe as Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy and Zombie Island Massacre. The main thing that Bad Taste delivers on, above all else, is the gore. If you're looking for a revoltingly gory film, this is one of the slickest you'll find. A lot of it's humor comes from the gore as well, and it's all in as much bad taste as the title of the film implies. This film succeeds in being what it's trying to be, and Peter Jackson must be applauded for that. The film works better when you view it as a master filmmaker's student film, however, because Bad Taste does not offer much else besides gross out humor, visual effects, and good make-up. The film just is not all that memorable. None of the characters were interesting or funny and none of them had traits that made them stick out. The film looks like utter crap, shot obviously on the most passable restraints. The film does not make good enough use of it's New Zealand location shooting, though the scenery does look absolutely beautiful. The aliens all look so fake and rubber that it's almost completely embarrassing. This is a really bad film.On the other hand, however, I can't help but feel that all of this is what makes this so appealing. In that regard, the best way to watch this film would be with a group of friends. It would likely be a lot more entertaining and would be a lot funnier in that environment. With a film like this, or The Rocky Horror Picture Show, or Clerks, or Pink Flamingos, judging it as a film is not fair. It's more about quantity than quality, and viewing it as you would any other film will simply diminish it's power. Putting all this aside, I think that there are far better films out there that are more worth watching than other people.

This film goes against the canon of behaviour for the cinema in countless ways, but Davies is one of those masters who knows how the break the rules and achieve results. It is only to be expected that a film so radical in its contempt for conventional film-making as this should arouse a great deal of exasperation and fury amongst viewers who do not know what they are seeing, or cannot understand. The film has an austerity and formality about its construction which reminds me of a Japanese Noh play, and another Oriental touch is the enlarged moon at which the characters are so often staring, and towards which the boy is constantly reaching his hand, as if straining towards some perfection which he knows is forever beyond his reach. But what is so remarkable is that Davies has captured an elusive essence of the American Deep South of the 1940s, as if he were a perfume-manufacturer who had found the recipe for an exotic scent, using materials wholly unfamiliar to him, for after all, Davies is an alien in that world. However, as he shot a lot of the film in Crawfordville, Georgia, which has a population of 572, everybody who visits it could be said to be an alien. He seems to me to have drawn inspiration from the photographs of the Alabamba sharecroppers taken in the late 1930s by Walker Evans for James Agee's book LET US NOW PRAISE FAMOUS MEN, which was published in 1941, the same year which is so important early in this film, in which we hear Roosevelt's broadcast announcing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, which leads to the boy's father going to war and coming back in a box. I am proud to say that I saved the manuscript of Agee's book. I used to stay in Mia Agee's house when I was young, and as she suffered from chronic depression, she was allowing Jim's manuscripts to rot in wet cardboard boxes in the cellar. Once she left me alone in the house for a few days and I took 'direct action' at the request of her daughter. I went down and got the manuscripts and dried them out by laying them all over every surface and floor of the house in relays for days. FAMOUS MEN had fortunately been written in hard pencil, so that there was no ink to run or smudge. It is now safely in the University of Texas, and Mia lived for some time on the money she got for it, once it had been dried! Agee died in 1955, but Walker Evans lived to a ripe old age, though he was such an urbane sophisticate you would never know he had once spent months in a house like the one in this film, and I was unable to get him to talk about it much. This film does not have normal continuity in the cinematic sense, but instead progresses in a series of tableaux. However, the emotional and narrative continuity remains intact and is perfectly comprehensible. The film in that sense resembles poetry rather than prose, and indeed it could be said to obey the strict rules of H. D.'s and Pound's Imagism, whereby every word which does not stand for a concrete image must be cut. (Pound cut Eliot's THE WASTELAND by half in this way prior to publication, which is why it became such a world classic.) THE NEON BIBLE is thus an imagist poem, not a prose piece which rambles along in the normal fashion. I have no idea why it is called THE NEON BIBLE because that must have been explained in the novel which provided the story, and which Davies does not explain. Of course, there is a great deal of preaching and religious intolerance in the film, but why it is neon escapes me, unless perchance neon, being such a rare gas, the degree of religious hypocrisy portrayed is meant to be of an equally rare kind, or perhaps the reference is to neon's unnatural glow, like that which emanates from the putrescence of a fermenting small Southern town, being what is really intended. The central performance as Aunt Mae is by Gena Rowlands, yet another example of her inspired and brilliant work, which has been the continuing hallmark of her career. The other female lead is played by Diana Scarwid, who comes from Savannah, Georgia, and is the only performer in the film who has the correct accent. If I were to criticize this film, I would have to call attention to the fact that the director and cast all have tin ears, and cannot detect that they lack the Georgia accents, apart from Scarwid. Scarwid is marvellous as a woman who goes mad under the strains of poverty, battering by her violent husband, then grief at his death (the Patty Heart Syndrome, where you love your captor, and mourn the passing of your tormentor). Jacob Tierney, a Canadian boy, is superb and sensitive as the son who narrates the tale, and whose story it really is. The cinematography by the Scot Michael Coulter is sensationally evocative and technically brilliant. All that steam and pine branches brushing at the windowpanes (hats off to the sound engineer too for that scene!) and mist and gloom really works, as do the flat-on Walker Evans-style shots where surfaces of buildings and features of rooms are treated as naked planes seen in the perpendicular, and which cannot hide as they are helpless to avoid revealing their all to the unremitting eye. The story is sad, both of loss, and of never having had anything to lose, of the unravelling of hopes and dreams, and of the blows which fate inflicts upon the helpless, full to the brim with sombre pathos.

The Vietnam War was exploding and the body count was broadcast every night into the dubious comforts of our households. Generations were clashing, seeing each other as the enemy. Battle lines were being drawn over the color of a person's skin, or the length of their hair. Heavy stuff huh? And your probably saying, BT! What does this have to do with the movie? well, you'll see as you read on. During these times, B movies rain supreme. Turning out of Hollywood faster than Japan can turn out Pokemon cards. One of those B movies in small, black and white venture from John Russo, and George Romero, would go on to become one of the most influential, and important horror films of all time. It would become legendary, as a film that not only started an entire sub-genre, but also accurately and without apology, mirrored all the strife that those times had to offer. That film was Night of the Living Dead.The movies plot is simple enough, a young woman named Barbara played by Judith O'Dea, and her brother, Johnnie played by Bill Moseley, visit their fathers grave at a cemetery in the rural backwoods Pennsylvania. The first hint of socio political commentary this film has to offer takes place in the first few minutes. As Barbara's brother mocks her beautiful prayer, scoffing at the notion of Church of God. For 1968 this was pretty risqué stuff. Within minutes they are attacked by a zombie, which kills her brother. Soon several zombies, eager to consume her warm tasty flesh, pursue Barbara. She takes shelter in an old farmhouse and soon finds our heroine has company. The films hero Ben, played by Duane Jones, arrives on the scene also seeking refuge in the farmhouse. Ben was unlike anything ever seen in Hollywood at that point. He was African American, and standard convention advised against having an African American as your main hero. To compound things he wasn't a suburban African American. Nope, this brother was from the streets and he let the viewers know it.In their first twenty minutes with each other, Barbara is more scared of Ben then she is of the ghoulish army in camp outside the house. Again, Romero perfectly reflected the racial turmoil of the time. Soon five other refugees from the nightmare, including Harry Cooper, played by Karl Hardman, join them who typifies the average white, middle age, and xenophobic businessman of the era. His daughter Karen, played by Kyra Schon, and his wife Helen, played by Marilyn Eastman, who's beginning for the first time in her life to question her husband's judgments and motives. Again the movie speaks of deeper issues, touching on woman's liberation and the classic of all these problems, old money values.Later in the movie we deal with the issue of patricide. When the Cooper's daughter, Karen, who previously had been bitten by a zombie before they got to the farmhouse, dies. And then comes back as one of the walking dead, and kills, and eats, her mother and father. After barricading themselves in the house, cabin fever soon begins to pick up the groove, inflicting more damage than even the zombies can do, culminating in a desperate struggle against not only the cannibalistic hordes outside, but against each other as well.Perhaps the most memorable moment in Night of the Living Dead is the ending. Romero provides a conclusion, so shocking and so unexpected, that the critics of the era were unsure what to make of it. Audience reaction at the time was one of strong disbelief. Another interesting aspect of Romero's zombie methods is that no explanation of the dead rising and eating the living is ever given. In this film it is speculated that a recent space probe returned from Venus may have caused the change due to background radiation. It's important to remember that at the time, America was in the grip of a nuclear war fever, and the danger of radiation was on every bodies mind.Budgetary restraints and a lack of experience may have added some rough edges to Night but they don't really diminish the film; they actually add to its surreal atmosphere. For instance, the camera work is stationary, never changing position. Each shot is from the same, locked vantage point. Most of the shots are very tightly framed and from low and skewed angles. Sometimes you can see the ceiling. Sometimes the camera is unsteady and shaky. It all helps create the claustrophobia and unsteadiness that's so integral to the film's power and message. The walls are closing in; the wall of zombies outside, and the wall of mistrust and fear inside.The other rough edge I'll mention, if you can even call it that, is the acting. It ranges from quite good to I'm glad she didn't have more lines. Again, this only makes the proceedings of the film more odd and maybe a little more unsettling. If you can suspend your disbelief for the dead rising chances are some stilted acting won't bother you.Night of the Living Dead truly deserves the praise and acclaim that has been showered upon it in the last few decades. There have been many sequels and remakes of the movie, and most of them are good. However, the 1990 remake, which was done in color, I considered to be an abomination. Sorry Tom Savini. If ever a horror movie were a masterpiece, this one is it. An important milestone in cinematic history, and proof of what independent filmmakers can do. Night of the Living Dead is the seminal zombie movie.

Now I have to say that anyone says anything like that, is pointless himself !It's a refreshing fantasy, while being a wicked, sort of dark, parody also. The thing about it is that it has 2 ironies. They both had been summarized well in the tagline Everybody wants to be on television. Just not this kind of television.. Hence it's about living the TV, and an evilly twisted version of it too. It kills me already when I know, in 2010, that a movie with this story was made 18 years ago, while I wrote a TV show based on more or less the same idea couple of years ago !! It's not how someone else me thought about it?, No, it's How they made it, while my TV show isn't made till NOW ?!!!!!!Away from my personal sorrows, I think that the movie's vision can't be more obvious  Today's TV is devilish, by watching &#x96; rather surrendering to &#x96; it we sell our souls to hell, setting in front of it for more than it deserves means turning into a viewer more than doer, losing reality, dreams, and most of all  love.Its fun is close to impeccable. I loved the wicked finale where the cinema studier becomes the new devil, as if the ones who knows the rules of art will be better Satans ! I believe that writers (Jim Jennewein) and (Tom S. Parker) didn't do anything this entertaining again. While their career includes movies like (Major League II, Ri¢hie Ri¢h), still (Stay Tuned), the first one they wrote, is their most original and wild work yet. Director (Peter Hyams) can make a keen steamy action just about every time, in spite of how the scripts he deals with are sometimes weaker.Speaking of which, this movie has a similar problem. A serious one too. While the action and comedy are on, the drama isn't. From the wonderful, so smart, parody of the game show, then the wrestling match, to the end of the movie where the lead has no solution to save his love, and his marriage, but to turn off the TV, no actual drama, concerning the development of the 2 lead's relationship, was done. It's a series of non-stop chases through bizarre channels (with the bizarre commercials as well), yet with no substance to follow. I thought that with more care and seriousness about such a basic storyline the drama would have been more attractive and effective, and the interplay between the movie and the viewer more emotional and powerful. So the movie's satire wasn't bad, it's the dealing with it that tarnished it a bit, maybe causing the accusation of pointless for some.Minor problems  for sure the video clip at the end. It's bad on so many levels. I mean it was long. It was noisy. It was cold. And it was while the movie's most critical phase for god's sake, so how about putting it to slacken the tight pace ! Actually, seeing (John Ritter) in that yellow girlie outfit was awful enough ! I didn't like the matter of parodied TV shows, only by punned titles, at the closing credits; that was lame and blank. And for a final problem  while (John Ritter), (Pam Dawber), (Jeffrey Jones) did their absolute best, I thought they all missed the glamour of stardom. The charisma of them wasn't as dazzling as the movie itself. Well, maybe I'm wrong, and it's measured by the amount of fun this cast gave, because accordingly; they scored high.Some lines were great  I prefer a man who touches me, not the controller, All I wanted was to be the big shot for once.

The movie SLAM by Mark Levin is another typical story of a young man who gets into trouble and by doing so finds who he is. The issue isn't hard to identify making the audience put less thought into what is going on. A shooting while making an exchange of drugs puts Ray Joshua (played by Saul Williams) in jail where everyone wants a piece of him. Violence and drugs make him decide on different roles in his surrounds but he tries to stick to his own beliefs. When threatened in the prison yard instead of fighting he retaliates with words to also try to open up everyone's eyes to the real enemy that is holding them down instead of each other.In this film society is showing the idea that when a problem arises people can be torn apart and start to fight each other instead of going after what the real cause of the problem is. The law is trying to make Ray accept his punishment for possession of pot and even for a crime he did not commit, shooting his close friend. He is forced to choose sides in prison on the current situation just like everyone else has. One side believes that Ray set his close friend up while the other knows he did not. By expressing his talents in the prison yard with a poetic rap he tries to define himself with his own views on the situation at hand and makes no attempt on joining anyone. His rap got him out of trouble that day as well as convincing the leader of one of the side to bail him out to reunite with his close friend who happened to have only become blind. He did this so he would make the others understand that the fighting need to stop to end the cycle. The retaliation from the shooting stopped when his close friend understood that he didn't want anyone else to get hurt or to even lose him.My least favorite part of the film even though it may have been inspirational to some would have been anytime there was rapping going on. I honestly could not follow or understand what they would be saying when they did. With all of the drugs, violence, and jail time going on I could not relate to this story in any way that I could think of. I don't even think there was an exact time in my life that I could say that I found myself. The film sends out the message that you need to accept the consequences for your actions and move on. I would only recommend this film to people who can relate to it. As for the people like me who can't or don't think they can relate to it will not find it interesting. The film would have been better if Ray would have been more of a bad guy in the beginning to show even more how he has changed.

I would only recommend this film to people who can relate to it. As for the people like me who can't or don't think they can relate to it will not find it interesting. The film would have been better if Ray would have been more of a bad guy in the beginning to show even more how he has changed. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"23 May 2010","score":"","review":" Many give in to the pressures of their surroundings but some are just stronger. The movie SLAM by Mark Levin is another typical story of a young man who gets into trouble and by doing so finds who he is. The issue isn't hard to identify making the audience put less thought into what is going on. A shooting while making an exchange of drugs puts Ray Joshua (played by Saul Williams) in jail where everyone wants a piece of him. Violence and drugs make him decide on different roles in his surrounds but he tries to stick to his own beliefs. When threatened in the prison yard instead of fighting he retaliates with words to also try to open up everyone's eyes to the real enemy that is holding them down instead of each other.In this film society is showing the idea that when a problem arises people can be torn apart and start to fight each other instead of going after what the real cause of the problem is. The law is trying to make Ray accept his punishment for possession of pot and even for a crime he did not commit, shooting his close friend. He is forced to choose sides in prison on the current situation just like everyone else has. One side believes that Ray set his close friend up while the other knows he did not. By expressing his talents in the prison yard with a poetic rap he tries to define himself with his own views on the situation at hand and makes no attempt on joining anyone. His rap got him out of trouble that day as well as convincing the leader of one of the side to bail him out to reunite with his close friend who happened to have only become blind. He did this so he would make the others understand that the fighting need to stop to end the cycle. The retaliation from the shooting stopped when his close friend understood that he didn't want anyone else to get hurt or to even lose him.My least favorite part of the film even though it may have been inspirational to some would have been anytime there was rapping going on. I honestly could not follow or understand what they would be saying when they did. With all of the drugs, violence, and jail time going on I could not relate to this story in any way that I could think of. I don't even think there was an exact time in my life that I could say that I found myself. The film sends out the message that you need to accept the consequences for your actions and move on.

True to the Die Hard formula, Bruce Willis' crass old-school New York cop John McClane takes on a situation way over his head in roughly under a day's time. The charm of With a Vengeance is that it takes place in McClane's city, where McClane is in his element, but not. We see the crass old-school NYPD itself, resolving issues and doing detective work with profane exclamations, matter-of-course Styrofoam coffee cups and worn-out suits they've probably been sleeping in. It follows the old custom that hero cops are either suspended or should be, but that is not the opposition to McClane's as-the-crow-flies brand of individual police work. It is something much more complex, and personal.I'm aware that Jonathan Hensleigh's script in the form of Die Hard 3 has been reworked from a potential Lethal Weapon 4, from there having been reworked from an original script called Simon Says. Regardless of whatever inevitable contrivance that was necessary to assert franchise characters into his original plot, the result is one of the very best-written Hollywood action-adventures of the '90s. Yes, there are some holes. One might go as far as to say the plot under real scrutiny is Swiss cheese Our classy villain Simon could not have employed his necessary camouflage justification for his complex plan as long as required without arousing doubt among the police, which he would've had McClane been snuffed during his first chore in Harlem, which could've happened without any difficulty. That is the one major thing at variance with Simon's otherwise fail-safe plan, but then no one who is aware or becomes aware of the Federal Reserve incident either recalls, or finds it gracious or worthwhile enough to bring up that billions in stolen gold is laying in the Aqueduct following an explosion.Nevertheless, in spite of it all, Hensleigh's screenplay transcends any boilerplate situations or characterizations with unique, and thus less predictable and more exciting, turns on their heads. The most prominent of these is Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's unwitting and unwilling shopkeeper partner Zeus, an ingenious departure from the buddy-cop blueprint. Upon his encounter with McClane in Harlem, he has no reason to like him, or believe what he finds he's gotten himself into, and yet he has little choice when&#x85;Simon says. Zeus has a racial chip on his shoulder, and for him to confront the reluctant and terrified McClane in the sadistic scenario Simon has forced him into, is to make a gesture of pure social conscience and shows various levels of humanity, automatically making him an exceptionally sympathetic character. And when he and McClane begin to bond, in their own cynical, acidic New Yorker ways, over the course of this phenomenally chaotic day of explosions, gunfights, helicopter catastrophes and unrelenting German soldiers, we feel we have seen real characters go from profoundly resenting to profoundly respecting one another.The movie follows in the Reaganite blockbuster tradition of streamlined stunts and nonstop million-dollar set pieces of mass destruction, and they do rock, but scenes of dialogue and deduction are not mere bridges between those extravagant tableaux. Two irrevocably hostile and deeply imperfect people thrown together in a city of 8 million people like McClane and Zeus, an Irish Brooklynite cop and a black Harlem electronics store owner, bound not to get along much, are given thirty seconds to crack ancient nursery rhyme riddles and yet they just can't stop fighting and cursing each other. Mathematical problems and other brain busters segue back and forth between the problem at hand and the personal problems they have with each other. But they end up using their heads in ways the other didn't expect. They end up inextricably necessary to each other to foil Simon's plot, which all holes considered turns out to be rather brilliant.Yes, Die Hard with a Vengeance is a real pleasure of its kind. McTiernan's back in the director's chair, and Jeremy Irons returns the series in the direction of classy, well-mannered villains, bad guys whose intentions are highly intelligent and mostly plausible, and who are scary because they are so nice to you when they talk. Even though they are threatening various lives and have comparatively mean thugs pointing guns at you, you still want to have a cup of coffee with them. It's difficult to say Rickman as Gruber in Die Hard 1 was anything but peerless, but Irons is a formidable comparison, I must admit. Iron's Simon is not a recycling of Rickman's Gruber. His mannered behavior is also not quite as infectious. But Irons, a powerful actor all his own, is his own fascinating, multi-dimensional beast, a soldier whose purpose and scheme are engraved like clockwork in his mind, from Plan A to Plan B all the way down the line. But what is his purpose? We think we know until there's yet another revelation, but what of the first revelation? It's true to some extent, but where do his ideals truly lie?
