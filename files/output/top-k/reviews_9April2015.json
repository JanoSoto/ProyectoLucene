","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"9 April 2015","score":"","review":" Director Robert Zemeckis, whose directorial resume rivals directors like Spielberg, Scorsese, and Sidney Lumet, made a strong impression with Death Becomes Her, a delicious 1992 black comedy that combines refreshingly human and flawed characters with an over the top story and some eye-popping visual effects.This is the story of Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep), an extremely vain actress and Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) a writer, who have been professional and personal rivals since childhood and have been fighting over the same man for years, a nerdy plastic surgeon named Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis). It is revealed that, in a search for eternal youth, both women have taken a magic potion that has some unforeseen side effects, driving the good Dr. Menville crazy and yet somehow bringing the women closer together.This film has a lot going for it and at the top of the list is a dazzling, Oscar-worthy performance by Streep as Madeline Ashton...Streep hits all the right notes here, offering a character with equal parts of vanity and bitchiness. Streep has rarely been this entertaining on screen and I think the fact that this film is a comedy had a lot to do with her being overlooked at Oscar time. I think this performance is better than half a dozen of the performances for which she did receive nominations. Hawn beautifully underplays in a less showy role but compliments Streep perfectly. Isabella Rossellini is appropriately ethereal as the keeper of the magic potion and mention should also be made of a brief but funny appearance by director Sidney Pollack as a doctor examining Streep. It's fun seeing Streep and Pollack on screen together seven years after he directed her in Out of Africa. My main problem with the film is Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Ernest Menville. Nerdy is OK, if there is a sexiness going on like Ryan O'Neal in What's Up, Doc?, but there's nothing sexy about this character. Why these two women are so obsessed with this guy doesn't make sense nor does his attraction to Madeline and Helen. He doesn't appear to really have feelings for either woman but it takes way too long for him to separate himself from these women.This film did win an Oscar for Outstanding Visual Effects and this is one that the Academy got right...the visuals here are just dazzling and more importantly, imaginative, not the kind of things you normally associate with standout visual effects. Watch the subtle changes in Madeline's body when she takes the potion or the hole in Helen's stomach when she gets shot or the final destruction of the ladies' bodies in the extremely effective finale. Throw in a smart screenplay by Martin Donovan and David Koepp, a superb musical score by Alan Silvestri, and the master directorial hand of Robert Zemeckis and you have a winner.
