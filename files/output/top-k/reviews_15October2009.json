[{"date":"15 October 2009","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" OK, time to cut to the chase. In prelude to my coming trip to 'The Land beyond the Hills'(Romania for you less poetically inclined)I have been reviewing genre films set there while carefully skirting those that feature it's most (in)famous (fictional)resident. The list of films set in Romania without Dracula was surprisingly extensive(and there are still several I haven't seen)and also surprisingly good. But now it's time to review film's featuring his excellency the Count, and where better to start off than with the version that is the most firmly implanted in the public's consciousness?In my now infamous review of the 1931 James Whale 'Frankenstein'(which still garnishes hate-mail on a weekly basis from enraged Branagh fans just as effectively as the original version I posted on my old account back in 2002 did)I emphasized just what a polarizing film it can be. In contrast, Tod Browning's less-highly regarded Dracula isn't so much a film with multiple opinions regarding it so much as it is a film whose reviewers are invariably split into two camps 1)Those who regard it as an important but unwatchable curio and 2)Those who love it unconditionally whose only complaints(if any) are that it's pacing slows down after the early scenes in Romania.But films, as with life, are too complex to be summed up that easily. So the truth is that while it has a number of strengths and weaknesses, they aren't nearly as strong OR weak as they are made out. The consensus is that the film goes to hell as soon as it leaves Transylvania; and while it's true that nothing else in the film quite measures up to those scenes in becoming iconic, the film actually has several of it's most effective sequences right after wards The scenes of the 'Vesta' being found with the entire crew dead except a raving Renfield still provides a real jolt, the scenes of Dracula seducing and then coming upon Lucy are still creepy enough to make you occasionally open an eye after you've gone to bed as well, but only if the atmosphere is JUST right.While it is true that a lack of a musical score mars the film, it also manages to give several scenes an eerie feel that makes it seem as if time itself has stopped to allow the Count to do his deadly handiwork. Everything feels dead, with only Dracula himself moving about. They don't call midnight(when Dracula apparently strikes)the 'Dead of Night' for nothing. The oft-criticized scenes where things are kept off camera actually work FOR the film rather than against it, and likely are sparing us some scenes that would otherwise be embarrassing. There's no denying that 'Dracula' is slow and dull, and that this pacing technique(not helped by static camera-work) fails more often than it succeeds; but compared to some other glacially-paced horrors of this era that I've had the misfortune to witness, it's nothing to gripe about.The acting is quite different from most people's reviews too. The consensus is that Lugosi is the only competent actor on board and everyone else stinks. The truth is, in fact, the opposite. Lugosi has an undeniable screen-presence, the most hypnotic eyes I have ever seen in a human being who was not a woman, and he created a character that will be remembered when the dust of my bones is gone; but the truth is that he's so hammy he's embarrassing, and his delivery(We'll be lee--avink, to-MORRRRROW--eve-enink)is the subject of too many parodies too count that it was probably old-hat to mock it before the year was out. This is no slam on Lugosi, I've sat through too many bad films just to see him in minor roles for me NOT to be a fan, but he's done better than this, even in comedies like 'Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein'.The unfairly reviled supporting cast is actually quite good all things considered. Herbert Bunston gives a credible, if one-dimensional portrayal of Dr. Seward. Frances Dade is very natural as Lucy but sadly has too little screen time to develop the character. Helen Chandler is incredibly dull as Mina and deserves most of the barbs she gets, BUT; she does have one great moment where she attempts to bite Jonathan Harker(David Manners, who IS every bit as bad as critics have said)with this evil little gleam in her eye. It could be made into a shirt featuring the 7 deadly sins and 'Lust' would apply perfectly to it. Still, it would have been better if her role was reversed with Lucy's. Most of the film is carried by Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing. He seems to be just an old man, but his sheer stoicism and drive is astonishing. He may not be a quasi-superhero like Peter Cushing or Hugh Jackman, but you really believe in everything he says. He may seem unassuming, but rarely has Dracula had such a worthy foe.But the real standout is Dwight Frye as Renfield. His transformation from an unassuming everyman hero, to mad slave, to fiend, to martyr is absolutely incredible. He's both charming and likable in his naivet√© in the early scenes, horrifyingly deranged when he goes mad(his laugh is the scariest thing about the film), hilariously funny(he provides more real comedy than any of the comedy relief maids and guards)and ultimately, a very tragic character. One could argue that he is the true hero of the film. His death at Dracula's hands is genuinely heartbreaking. The fact that Frye was never nominated for something shows just how meaningless industry awards really are.So no, 'Dracula' is not a masterpiece, nor is it an overrated misfire only important for historic reasons with only one good performance. It still remains essential viewing for every horror fan worth his salt and should be seen at least once by any self-respecting film fan.Just try not to expect a classic in league with 'Frankenstein'.~ ","genre":null},{"date":"15 October 2009","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" OK, time to cut to the chase.
