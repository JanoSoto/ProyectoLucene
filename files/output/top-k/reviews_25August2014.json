[{"date":"25 August 2014","score":"","review":" This film reminds me of the brilliant Not the Nine O'Clock News skit Nice Video, Shame About the Song, though that isn't a perfect analogy since Danny Elfman's score is one of the best things about the film! The make-up and the set design - particularly Ape City and the ruins of the Oberon - are fantastic but it has a host of other problems. Compared with the 1968 classic (my sixth favourite film of all time), the social commentary is very diluted and not particularly well done even when they bother trying to do it. In his review at the time, Roger Ebert said that, Intellectually, it's science fiction for junior high school boys. I was 14 in 2001 and I loved it then so I think that he was onto something. He was also right when he said that in ten years time, people would still be watching the original film in preference to this one.Mark Wahlberg is no Charlton Heston and Leo Davidson expresses little to no emotion throughout the film. He's a cardboard cutout, really. He lands on a planet of apes and his reaction is basically Hmm... I had the same problem with most of the human characters. Daena's characterisation consists mainly of giving our hero doe-eyed looks, though the conflict with Ari has the (mostly unrealised) potential to be interesting. None of the other human characters add anything to the plot with the possible exception of Erick Avari's character Tival providing a contrast between the wild humans and the housebroken ones. They focused too much attention on giving the apes personalities, mistakenly thinking that the audience would be interested in the humans for the sole reason that they were humans.Among the apes, the best actors - almost wrote beast actors by mistake! - are Helena Bonham Carter as the principled human rights activist Ari and David Warner as her well-intentioned but weak willed father Senator Sandar, who appears in all of two scenes. Paul Giamatti has some good lines and is quite funny as the orangutan slave trader Limbo but, again, the character doesn't add much to the film. The usually very reliable Tim Roth is a too over the top and not all that creepy or frightening as General Thade. I think that his second-in- command Attar, played very well by Michael Clarke Duncan, would have made for a much more frightening villain. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was good but not great as Krull. Like Warner, Glenn Shadix only appeared in two scenes but managed to make more of an impression than any of the human characters and quite a few of the ape ones as Senator Nado. My favourite scene in the film was definitely Charlton Heston's uncredited cameo as Thade's dying father Zaius, who is reminiscent of the character of the same name from the original film. It's quite interesting that the only ape on the planet with a gun was played by the President of the NRA! I highly doubt that Heston, then in his late 70s, would have been willing to do an entire film in that make-up but he'd have made a better villain than Thade as well. I also really liked Linda Harrison's appropriately silent cameo as the woman in the cart when Leo enters Ape City.The film was co-written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal, who previously performed the same duty on the much more stupid Superman IV The Quest for Peace and the excellent Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country (in which the always brilliant David Warner also appeared in a fairly small role as a liberal, sympathetic politician). The script seems like a first draft rather than a finished product. It's mostly uninspired but there are a few little things that I liked in the script such as the occasional good line, the electromagnetic storm \/ temporal anomaly relaying all Earth broadcasts from across time to the Oberon, the origin of the ape civilisation, the apes' creation myth and Pericles' return. Oh, and I have to admit that I love, love, love the nutty ending, which is more or less the same as in the original novel. Part of me wishes that there had been a sequel to see how they would have followed up on it! One thing that I really hated though was Leo and Ari's romantic subplot because of, you know, the whole bestiality thing. As for the action scenes, they are decent as opposed to fantastic, with one or two minor exceptions.Overall, this is quite a bad film but I don't think that it's as awful as its reputation would suggest. It's one of the only films that I enjoyed as a young child or in my early teens that I dislike now. In spite of everything, however, I still retain a certain level of fondness for it as it introduced me to the original film series, which is second only to the Back to the Future trilogy as my favourite film series of all time. Plus, 2001\/2002 wasn't the happiest time in my life and watching it over and over again helped me forget my troubles for two hours at a time. Objectively speaking though, Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter's relationship and collaboration in almost all of his later, better films are probably the best things to come out of the film.

In that case, it was Vic Morrow. In this case, it was the always brilliant, irrepressible and irreplaceable British character actor Roy Kinnear, who broke his pelvis after being thrown off his horse and died of a heart attack as a result. Richard Chamberlain was so angry about the producers' lack of reaction to his death that he quit the film. Richard Lester, who had cast Kinnear in numerous films before this one, was so upset by his death that he retired from filmmaking. Superman II was really Richard Donner's baby and Superman III wasn't very good - I don't think that Lester really got Superman - but I loved the Musketeers trilogy and Robin and Marian. Lester's retirement, while certainly understandable, robbed the cinema of a very talented and underrated director.It's obviously very trivial in the scheme of things but his death had a significant impact on the film as his character Planchet disappears after the first 45 minutes, with the exceptions of two brief scenes with Kinnear and two others with a stand-in. Chamberlain's departure relegated Aramis to making little more than a glorified cameo. He disappears after the first half an hour and only returns in the last ten minutes of the film with no explanation for his return in the form of the usual I changed my mind scene in such circumstances. Prior to Kinnear's death, I imagine that the plan was for Planchet to accompany D'Artagnan, Athos and Porthos to England, where Aramis would have reunited with them.Leaving the real life tragedy aside for a moment, this is a hugely enjoyable film. It perfectly recaptures the sense of fun and good old fashioned swashbuckling adventure that was present throughout the first two films, in spite of the fact that 15 years had passed. The exploration of growing older is subtle and understated but it's definitely there, which I appreciated. The film also has a great cast. Kinnear, Chamberlain, Christopher Lee, Oliver Reed, Michael York, Frank Finlay and Geraldine Chaplin all reprise their roles from the first two films and are joined by Kim Cattrall, Philippe Noiret, Alan Howard and Bill Paterson (admittedly in a very small role as Charles I). C. Thomas Howell is the only weak link acting wise. Of the newcomers, Kim Cattrall, whose work I always enjoy, was the best as Justine de Winter with Noiret as Cardinal Mazarin in a close second. Jean-Pierre Cassel, who played the by now dead Louis XIII in the original films, has a lovely cameo as Cyrano de Bergerac. Another nice tribute to the earlier films is the fact that the portrait of Cardinal Richelieu, which isn't even seen in a close-up, has Charlton Heston's face. Christopher Lee is my favourite actor but I wish that he hadn't been brought back as, aside from the fact that Rochefort was impaled through the heart in The Four Musketeers and was clearly implied to have been killed, his role is rather small and he doesn't really contribute anything to the proceedings.

Whether it was because of a desire to end the franchise in a better way after the failure of Alien 3 or just cashing in on the name of a popular franchise. Either way Alien Requiem is a weak addition to the Alien franchise and one that does not live up to the legacy that preceded it. This time it doesn't even feel like a sequel, but rather like a reboot. 200 years after she died, Ripley is resurrected by a mad scientist who wants to use her DNA to create a new form of Xenomorph. But the aliens escape their cage using their acid blood (why they didn't put them in a special jail that wouldn't melt with acid is one of many plot holes) and take over the ship. Thus it's up to Ripley and a group of space bandits to defeat the Xenomorphs before they make it to earth. It's a bizarre story that is alright, but out of place for the tone of the franchise.The idea of space bandits is a good one (as evidenced by the fact Whedon used the same idea later to make the hit show Firefly). But unfortunately it is not executed particularly well here. Each character does have a memorable feature that will ensure you do remember the different characters, but it seems to lack the usual quick witted charm that makes most of Whedon's work so memorable. Whedon states the reason for this is a weak execution of the source material and some script changes after his draft. Possibly this comes from the fact that the director Jean Pierre Jeunet's style does not blend well with Whedon's with his melancholy, dramatic approach not being best suited for the script. Unfortunately just like Alien 3, Resurrection screws up the most important thing in the franchise. The Xenomorphs. Once again we see too much of them. What made them so iconic in the first two is that we hardly saw them. It was the fear of the unknown that made them so memorable. Here they appear a no better than some run of the mill monsters. They never feel as if they're too much of a threat and even their designs are different. On top of this they do some incredibly strange plot points with the Xenomorphs, the strangest coming within the final act.

That sentence alone felt strange to write&#x85; They even attempt to add some drama in to it with the alien viewing Ripley as its mother, even trying to make us feel sorry for it. But when they constantly switch between sympathetic child and murdering monster the whole thing just loses its impact.Ultimately there's nothing in this film that is particularly memorable.

That said, I found (and still find) it difficult to conclude Finding Forrester's rating I find myself vacillating between a 7 or an 8.This is a decent movie about unlikely relationships and a fair one about writing. I would certainly like to find more movies with writing as a central theme.In the acting department, Sean Connery is as brilliant as ever. Ironically, the loss of a family member (his brother) had a negative effect on his literary production and the loss of Jamal's father had a positive effect on his. Unfortunately, these dynamics and major events that inspired them are never fully treated in the movie. Finding Forrester would have been much better had the inner lives (emotions, compulsions, responses, etc.) been examined and illustrated. Instead, we never get to fully meet Jamal or William, as they seem frozen by their own, respective fears, hindered only by a superficial movie script (and perhaps a time constraint imposed on the movie.)

Anyway here we have another horror anthology (not Amicus) that's piece de resistance was having Vincent Prince and John Carradine star in the bookend story. Other horror (anthology) regulars such as Donald Pleasence and Britt Ekland also pop up but no Peter Cushing this time. Carradine portrays real life British horror author Chetwynd-Hayes whose stories are what this anthology are based upon.The film starts off in a fine manner with Price playing a vampire (he didn't play them often...or ever) and biting Carradine in a most polite way of course. To thank Carradine Price takes him to the Monster Club where various ghouls and...errrm monsters hang out and let their hair and fur down. Now this sounds pretty sweet no doubt but I'm afraid to say the entire idea is let down with the most dreadful looking sequences you'll have seen for some time. Think of the Mos Eisley space cantina in 'Star Wars' with all the alien creatures but no where near as good and with terrible costumes.When I say terrible costumes I mean it, they look like kids Halloween costumes your mum bought at the local supermarket. Absolutely horrendous, so much so in fact I'm not even sure if it was done like that on purpose for comedic relief. What's even stranger is the musical interludes between the short stories, you have a horror tale followed by some weird ass pop group dressed up with bad makeup singing a bad song, was this filler? At one point Price gets up and dances with the monsters on the dance floor...I'm still not sure if I should look on this as uber cool or just a crappy run time extension, its nothing like 'Thriller' so don't get excited.The actual stories are reasonable but pretty timid frankly, what's more they create new monsters or hybrids which sound daft. The first is based around a Shadmock which is the offspring of...something, I can't elaborate because the sequence where Price explains what monsters are called when they mate with other monsters is so confusing I just ran with it. Basically this creature looks like a pale male human but his whistle can somehow burn things to a crisp? whatever. The story is merely about a couple trying to get a hold of this Shadmocks huge fortune by having the young woman marry him under false pretenses of love. The setting and location are nice and atmospheric, bit of a 'Beauty and the Beast' or 'Phantom of the Opera' type premise but not up to the same standard.The next short is about a vampire family, well the man of the house is a vampire but his wife and boy are not oddly. Donald Pleasence is part of a secret vampire hunters team that carry violin cases that contain stakes for killing vampires (Robert Rodriguez see this film?). Pleasence follows the boy and eventually talks him into exposing his father even though the boy never knew his father was a vampire. In the end Pleasence gets bitten and must fight off his own men, its very shallow and hardly a horror tale at all, its not even spooky really. It raises more questions than anything but I guess its only a vignette.The final story is easily the best and revolves around a film director travelling to a small remote village in the English countryside to scout the location. There he discovers a century old race of ghouls that eat corpses. When trying to escape this village of the damned he only gets so far before discovering that more people outside of the village are in fact ghouls and escape may well be futile. Again many questions are raised but the tale is the most interesting and could easily be expanded, its basically your common zombie apocalypse type flick that obviously has lots of similarities with the 1960 film 'Village of the Damned'.I kinda had high hopes for this film but felt disappointed in the end. Everything looks a bit cheap and nasty and the vignettes are pretty low key with little thrills or excitement to be had.

What usurps this film compared to Ritchie's previous outing is that Snatch has more comedy provided. And even though there are more characters provided the story is far more easy-going.Our journey begins with a boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) and his business accomplice Tommy (Stephen Graham) are privately talking about diamonds. As the credits get underway,in Antwerp, Belgium we see four thieves going incognito as Jewish men as they make their ways to the eighth floor of a building. Once they reached the floor, the thieves now have possession of an 84 carot diamond. The leader, Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) leads the troop as he delivers the diamond to his cousin Avi (Dennis Farina). He has days to spare in London where he's asked to meet Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) to obtain a gun from him and place a bet on a crooked boxing match. Franky handcuffs his hand with the diamond placed on his hand in a briefcase, when suddenly the van was hit and he was out cold.In another subplot (that spells Tarantino), Turkish and Tommy have signed on a gifted, but brainless boxer name Gorgeous (Adam Fogerty). Turkish and Tommy purchased a caravan from a band of gypsies, oblivious to the fact that easily breaks down the minute they purchased it. While demanding for a refund, George demands a fight with One Punch Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt) and if he wind they will get their refund. But Mickey easily knock out George, which leads to Turkish negotiating with Brick Top (Alan Ford) if they recruit Mickey in exchange for George. But will only do it if Mickey goes down in the fourth.The third subplot has Boris not being able to get any communication from Franky, so he asks Sol (Lennie James) along with Vincent and Tyrone (Robbie Gee and Ade) to get in touch with him. When they finally reach him, he's been shot unintentionally and tribulations come into full effect when the dog enter the fray.The performances were overall very enjoyable. Jason Statham has one-upped himself here and plays a more prominent role here. Brad Pitt is really fascinating as a gypsy who talks incoherently. Alan Ford truly was delightful as a crime boss and Benicio Del Toro was remarkable as a thief who suffers from a horrible gambling addiction. He truly makes up for his role, even though it's quite limited. Ritchie's direction has improved greatly from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

What usurps this film compared to Ritchie's previous outing is that Snatch has more comedy provided. And even though there are more characters provided the story is far more easy-going.Our journey begins with a boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) and his business accomplice Tommy (Stephen Graham) are privately talking about diamonds. As the credits get underway,in Antwerp, Belgium we see four thieves going incognito as Jewish men as they make their ways to the eighth floor of a building. Once they reached the floor, the thieves now have possession of an 84 carot diamond. The leader, Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) leads the troop as he delivers the diamond to his cousin Avi (Dennis Farina). He has days to spare in London where he's asked to meet Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) to obtain a gun from him and place a bet on a crooked boxing match. Franky handcuffs his hand with the diamond placed on his hand in a briefcase, when suddenly the van was hit and he was out cold.In another subplot (that spells Tarantino), Turkish and Tommy have signed on a gifted, but brainless boxer name Gorgeous (Adam Fogerty). Turkish and Tommy purchased a caravan from a band of gypsies, oblivious to the fact that easily breaks down the minute they purchased it. While demanding for a refund, George demands a fight with One Punch Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt) and if he wind they will get their refund. But Mickey easily knock out George, which leads to Turkish negotiating with Brick Top (Alan Ford) if they recruit Mickey in exchange for George. But will only do it if Mickey goes down in the fourth.The third subplot has Boris not being able to get any communication from Franky, so he asks Sol (Lennie James) along with Vincent and Tyrone (Robbie Gee and Ade) to get in touch with him. When they finally reach him, he's been shot unintentionally and tribulations come into full effect when the dog enter the fray.The performances were overall very enjoyable. Jason Statham has one-upped himself here and plays a more prominent role here. Brad Pitt is really fascinating as a gypsy who talks incoherently. Alan Ford truly was delightful as a crime boss and Benicio Del Toro was remarkable as a thief who suffers from a horrible gambling addiction. He truly makes up for his role, even though it's quite limited. Ritchie's direction has improved greatly from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

The film has its reputation as an action movie (well it's about a contract killer), but the ninja-esque killing sequences are there to serve the plot, which they actually do, and well. Most of the movie is about building the relationship between the protagonists Léon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman).Léon has a realistic, but classy approach there's no blood showers, slowed time, nor any other special effects involved in the action, or in anything else in the movie. I think this is to highlight the significance of death, both to the protagonist characters and to the audience. It's no show in real life, and there's no reversal to it. Once someone dies, there are not any flashing lights or magic, the world goes on with the dead one being a corpse in it. Léon, and later on, Mathilda don't fear that, and the shooting supports this view.This movie's forte is its casting that happens to be just perfect. Jean Reno seems to be in his element portraying expressionlessly the cynical hit-man, Léon. The way he acts, moves, and speaks truly depict an almost depressed man with nothing to lose until the very end. Gary Oldman, for his part, doesn't keep things as simple as Reno as Stansfield the antagonist. He plays the part of a drama queenish crooked-cop and complete maniac, being fit for the role. One could really believe the character has some serious issues. The young Natalie Portman completes the trinity of leading actors, and despite her then-age (only 12 y.o.), she succeeds in outshining them all! It's just fascinating to follow how everything she does is so natural and effortless. She doesn't just appear to be the unloved orphan girl turning into a ruthless predator seeking for her revenge, she IS her. Going through a scale of emotions in a faultless display, this movie really was a stepping stone to her to-be-stardom which she rightfully attained.On a deeper level, it's all about loss and beginning anew. The theme repeats itself in both Léon and Mathilda's fates. Without spoiling anything, keep an eye on the symbolic plant. Then there's the love and death that Mathilda constantly talks about in the movie. The love part was really confusing in the beginning I thought Léon had a fatherly affection towards Mathilda - he protected her when no-one else didn't, yet turned down her advances. Later it turned out to be out of protection towards himself, but could have been more clearly explained, in my opinion. In addition, Mathilda saying  I'm not growing up anymore, I just get older seemed an odd piece of script regarding the movie wanted to show her to grow into a woman (or at least I think it wanted), she being a typical teenager in how she conducts herself. On the other hand, that's what a teen girl really would say.So, even though the acting in Léon is superb without overrating it a bit, there's plenty of good action, the tempo doesn't go particularly slow anywhere, and with there being these deep meanings behind the killing, why does it feel that the movie is somehow wanting?

It can be found here http\/\/the-professional.uw.hu\/Version_1_Script.html Shortly said, after some research on the script, it turned out that The Professional was supposed to be more violent, the relationship between Léon and Mathilda more developed, and the movie in every way more complete, but Natalie Portman's parents wouldn't let her act in the movie if it wasn't rewritten, which is completely understandable, considering her age. It just leaves you wonder what would've been had the original idea come true.Anyhow, the big picture is entertaining and thought-provoking in itself.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"25 August 2014","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This delightful disaster soap opera started off a trend of all-star popcorn movies where some sort of tragic occurrence changed the courses of people's lives. Whether it be a bomb exploding on a plane, a tidal wave tossing a cruise ship upside down, a skyscraper catching on fire or a massive earthquake, Hollywood filmmakers became obsessed with finding new ways to toss old and new actors together to bring fun onto the screen while giving its audience something to bite their nails over as famous people fought to survive something totally beyond their control.Of the four Airport films, this is by far the best, although Airport '75 is certainly more famous as a camp classic. Here, a group of strangers are tossed together in an enclosed space where they have no idea a disgruntled man has gotten onto the plane with a man made bomb he intends to explode so his wife can get money from the insurance policy he's just purchased. It doesn't matter that innocent people will be taken out with him or that there are laws that would keep her from getting anything, he's determined to put his evil plan into motion. Yet, there's a pitiful quality about this down on his luck elderly man (a magnificent Van Heflin) that prevents you from totally hating him, and his lovable wife (Maureen Stapleton in one of her finest performances) has obviously remained loyal in spite of his shortcomings.To off-set the tragedy, there's a cute old lady (Helen Hayes) who stows away all the time in order to go see her grown children. Yet, this time, she may not get away with it, giving away her secrets to amused airport executive Burt Lancaster and the no-nonsense Jean Seberg whom Hayes politely tells to lighten up after Seberg grills her for breaking the law. Pilot Dean Martin is involved with pretty stewardess Jacqueline Bisset even though he's married to the older and very rich Barbara Hale. Bisset has a secret however which will be greatly affected by the results of what occurs with Heflin's bomb.Then, there's irascible George Kennedy in the first of four Airport appearances as Patroni, a technical genius who spouts all sorts of technical jargon to give the audience the opportunity to understand how an airport works behind the scenes of the ticket counter and the baggage claim. Kennedy's dialog in these films seemed to get sillier and sillier, and by the time of 1979's Concorde, his appearances here were deemed as some sort of bad joke.Veteran actress Jessie Royce Landis is amusing in a cameo as a wealthy matron smuggling diamonds in her pooch's collar and Lloyd Nolan is memorable as an aging security guard. A ton of familiar character actors pop in and out in amusing cameos, with James Nolan very funny as a priest whose patience has run out as he deals with the obnoxious passenger next to him on the plane.While Hayes won the Oscar here for her first film in 14 years, it is Stapleton who was certainly more worthy. She would have to wait more than a decade to get an Oscar, but her performance is certainly more memorable, although Hayes is an adorable old lady. All she's missing is the tweety bird and cage and black and white cat, because ultimately, she is more of a cartoon character than a real person. This created a huge box office sensation in the early 70's and remains greatly enjoyable.

It doesn't matter that innocent people will be taken out with him or that there are laws that would keep her from getting anything, he's determined to put his evil plan into motion. Yet, there's a pitiful quality about this down on his luck elderly man (a magnificent Van Heflin) that prevents you from totally hating him, and his lovable wife (Maureen Stapleton in one of her finest performances) has obviously remained loyal in spite of his shortcomings.To off-set the tragedy, there's a cute old lady (Helen Hayes) who stows away all the time in order to go see her grown children. Yet, this time, she may not get away with it, giving away her secrets to amused airport executive Burt Lancaster and the no-nonsense Jean Seberg whom Hayes politely tells to lighten up after Seberg grills her for breaking the law.

Bisset has a secret however which will be greatly affected by the results of what occurs with Heflin's bomb.Then, there's irascible George Kennedy in the first of four Airport appearances as Patroni, a technical genius who spouts all sorts of technical jargon to give the audience the opportunity to understand how an airport works behind the scenes of the ticket counter and the baggage claim. Kennedy's dialog in these films seemed to get sillier and sillier, and by the time of 1979's Concorde, his appearances here were deemed as some sort of bad joke.Veteran actress Jessie Royce Landis is amusing in a cameo as a wealthy matron smuggling diamonds in her pooch's collar and Lloyd Nolan is memorable as an aging security guard. A ton of familiar character actors pop in and out in amusing cameos, with James Nolan very funny as a priest whose patience has run out as he deals with the obnoxious passenger next to him on the plane.While Hayes won the Oscar here for her first film in 14 years, it is Stapleton who was certainly more worthy. She would have to wait more than a decade to get an Oscar, but her performance is certainly more memorable, although Hayes is an adorable old lady. All she's missing is the tweety bird and cage and black and white cat, because ultimately, she is more of a cartoon character than a real person.

In my opinion, accompanied by the jarring soundtrack, the climatic face off between Colonel Mortimer and El Indio was the most finger biting, nerve wracking and taut showdown in the entire film. Leone had already tightened the tension into a robust knot, for example with the scene near the beginning of the film in which Colonel Mortimer guns down an outlaw in the street. Sergio had then pulled this knot much tighter for the duel between the Colonel and Klaus Kinski's hunchback. The stunts were awesome, with the action sequences packing some highly impressive kills. The jail break scene was exciting and the bank robbery really had me on the edge of my seat. The final shootout which precedes the aforementioned climatic showdown has Colonel Mortimer and Manco going head to head with El Indio's gang. This sequence was immensely exhilarating. A few chilling flashbacks provide Colonel Mortimer with the motive for wanting to kill El Indio and gave the film greater bite.FAFDM is the grittiest film in the Dollars trilogy.

Also, I like the way that main characters meet. They meet again and again accidentally. I don't have enough experiences to tell about love, but after watching this movie I can tell that lovers have to understand each other and be honest, and the most important thing when people love is their serious mind, not other people's thinking.Even though this movie is old one for me, the story made me be touched. At first, main characters have different opinions from different jobs, lifestyle, environment, private things and others. As most people think, it is hard to get into a relationship for a famous actress. But we can know that the actress is also person who wants to love a man like normal person by this movie. In this movie, she said that I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. When I heard this line, I could feel she is serious. Supporting actors' stories are also nice.

This is mostly because it has all my favorite types of comedy. It has the dry humor that Abbott and Costello use and slapstick humor that the Three Stooges (who make a cameo in this film) use and it utilizes it perfectly. The cast also employs many old comedy legends like Jonathan Winters, and Mickey Rooney just to name a couple. Most major comedy movies today are unfunny parodies or gross-out humor which I don't find funny.The premise is quite simple. Several people find a dead man on the side of the road. In his dying words he tells them of a big W and under it is a treasure of roughly $300,000 which at that time was the mother lode. It's still a lot of money today, but back then it was definitely a lot. Afterwards it becomes a frantic race of who gets there first. They also pick up new people along the way who also want a piece of the pie. You also have a police officer named Culpepper who is also after the money. He claims to be after it to turn it in by law but he really wants it for himself.There's not much to say. The premise good, the cast is great, the characters are all memorable in some way, and I just found it funny. The extreme situations these people get themselves into here is just fun to watch. I especially like the last act where they are all chasing Culpepper who has the money in a thrilling and hilarious chase scene.

Roy Scheider plays the overworked, overmedicated, playboy director who just refuses to give less of himself to his work and his body can't deal with it. This is advertised as a musical, but it's more a portrayal of a man who really has no direction to go but down because of his refusal to change his way of life. He admits to his faults but just doesn't deal with it. He cheated on his ex-wife, doesn't give enough time to his daughter, cheats on his current girlfriend, and is majorly obsessed to giving everything to his work to these faults. This movie does exactly what it wants to do almost perfectly. The only flaw, in my opinion, is an overlong slightly corny ending number. Fosse choreographs the dancing numbers -- which there are plenty of -- but they complement the story rather than just being an addition. The beautiful Jessica Lange portrays death and is used throughout to help show what's going on inside Scheider's character and introduces the inevitable very early on. The movie could be considered depressing but it's all done tongue-in-cheek(almost laughing at itself because of the choice of the subject matter). The two hours fly by because of the way the director presents the main character and gets your interest in his life. Pieces are revealed as the story moves forward and by the end you get a complete picture of the man's life. This movie is so much more than a musical even though these parts aren't bad either --- it should be held in acclaim as one of the better of it's kind -- don't miss this one.

Places you may know even, or have visited before.But you must proceed with great caution. Every step you take re-shapes the very reality around you. Beware of traps, of fruitless trails, of dangers and treasures that swap disguises at every turn. Beware of yourself. You are different here too. The Zone is a place that exists both inside and outside of your mind. How you manage that fact will mean the difference between a beautiful adventure and a funeral dirge of apathy.The way in which Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' has the potential to re-inform and re-excite your relationship with reality is in my view one of the biggest selling points here.The film follows the journey of the Stalker, a guide for hire who leads his two 'thrill-seeking' clients, a writer and a professor, on a quest for wish-fulfilment through the mysterious 'Zone', a place only he can navigate and that the state seeks to quarantine from civilians. The Stalker's profession seems to draw both respect and derision from society. The writer cheekily refers to him as 'Chingachgook'. Both the writer and the professor express doubts about the Stalker's true qualification for this adventure, and about whether or not there is indeed any actual adventure to be had. Only the Wizard of Oz style transition from monochrome to colour strengthens our presumption that the Zone is a genuinely special place. This magical sense of uncertainty, present throughout the first part of Stalker, is intoxicating. In fact, it's like the best drunken and rainy afternoon in the park with your friends that you ever had.The second part of Tarkovsky's 'anti-quest' tells us more about the agenda and sensibilities of the writer and the professor, but there is the distinct possibility that you will find none of what they have to say very interesting.The philosophy showcased in the dialogue is of an elementary sort, and a seemingly reckless amount of screen-time is given to it. Perhaps Tarkovsky wants us to find their ruminations frustrating. Indeed, as the grand design of the screenplay is revealed to us, the message seems to be that Tarkovsky's Russia is being crippled by intellectualism.By the time the writer and professor arrive at the 'very threshold' of the Zone's supernatural core, they have Hamletized themselves into positions of zero actionability. It's another bitter failure for the Stalker, whose profession is also his spiritual calling. Few people are interested in the real gift of the Zone, Even fewer are worthy of it. And those few who show promise have a depressing habit of talking themselves out of their own worthiness at the last hurdle. Perhaps reason is the true opium of the masses...So for me, the engrossing and lyrical first part of Stalker gives way to a difficult and annoyingly elusive second part. But the film is very much like the Zone itself. Different for everyone. Well. Isn't everything. You take it and shape it and model it in your mind, trying to follow what you think are the rules.But what you get in the cave is a reflection of what you brought with you. Not what you 'thought' you brought with you. What you take home might not be what you wanted or expected, but nevertheless, you will take something from it.
