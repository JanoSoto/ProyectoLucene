Also, one of them has a secret that's revealed at the end. Nothing new plot-wise, but it has a fantastic soundtrack (Gloria Gaynor, the Village People, Charlene, etc.), unbelievable costumes (a deserved Academy-Award winner) and three great performances. Hugo Weaving is good, Terence Stamp is excellent as a transsexual--this couldn't have been an easy role, but he pulls it off. Guy Pearce is absolutely gorgeous as the youngest of the bunch. Also, there are more than a few scenes of him shirtless or parading around in his little Calvin Kleins--definitely worth seeing (I know he's straight, but I can dream can't I?). Also the bitchy banter is funny (if occasionally too caustic) and they don't ignore homophobia and, at the end, present a little boy who is totally comfortable with his dad being a drag queen and his mother bisexual (it's suggested). Also, back in 1994 this helped me get over a very painful breakup. If you're gay, you've got to see it. One of the best gay films of all time.

You really feel like your gut has been ripped out after watching this truly sad story.  Lara Belmont definitely deserves some kind of award for this; her role of Jessie, the sexually abused daughter is amazing.  I didn't know who to feel sorry for most, Jessie, her brother, or the mother.The love between brother and sister through this dilemma is tear jerking.  Rarely has a movie caught such realism in the expression of utter despair and hopelessness.  My desire to reach through the screen and strangle the father was outweighed only by my desire to hug the daughter, and root for the brother.  It's hard to believe this actually happens for real, but unfortunately the reality is, it does.  I think part of the penalty for such a horrible thing as incest and child abuse is to watch The War Zone.The cinematography is outstanding and serves as almost a beautiful counterbalance to the main story's theme.  I guess it takes some of the best scenery in the world to help balance _that_ out.  This film easily gets a 10, and deserves every bit of it.
