I found it particularly enjoyable the first time around, but unfortunately the only reason to come back to it is for the Bomb Squad scenes and George C. Scott. I can't imagine how controversial it must have been for the time, but like a political cartoon it has its time and relevance. A lot of my family do not like Peter Sellers, or this movie at all and when showing this to a couple friends not too long ago they were not really impressed either (I was born in 1992, the Cold War was way beyond my time). Kubrick is my favourite director, but that doesn't mean I am also inclined to enjoy all his movies as well. Reasons I adore Kubrick are the many diverse genre movies he made, and his meticulous attention to detail. I think of all that wonderful hard work was not needed for a comedy of this calibre, but again the stories on set are quite charming. Kubrick wanted the War room table to be green like a poker table (Seeing as how these men were essentially gambling with the future in a black and white movie), Peter Sellers was originally set to play much more roles than the three he did, and he also had Kubrick rolling on the floor laughing in-between takes. Finally the original pie fight ending scene was scrapped for various reasons, ranging from being too farcical or unfortunately timed with President Kennedy's death by assassination.And honestly, I think I am right. I love that Kubrick attempted a comedy, and I think the movie is a wonderful classic and successful most of the running time. However as time goes by, this is the one Kubrick picture to me that will age the most. Of course this film would have been very risqué and controversial at the time of release, as it was a black comic adaptation of a very serious 1958 novel Red Alert by Peter George. But aside from a few scenes, nothing really makes me laugh aloud and the acting really falls apart no matter how wonderful I think George C. Scott is.Still I guess the positive things to say is I could watch it again for things like the War room set, which was great after so many iterations were developed off screen. Again, I did not hate this movie and the whole thing is a wonderful farce which I guess what was Kubrick's intention to show us in the first place (Believe me if the Cold War could be remembered as just a farce, Oh what a dream it would all be). Maybe as I get older some of it will grow on me, but I don't think I will change my opinion of it lightly. If the movie has anything going for it, I would say it possibly has the greatest end credit sequences of all time.Final Verdict Obscurely enough, I found an old review I wrote at 18 writing how much I loved this movie. As I get older it just doesn't hit as high a note for me anymore. It's a political cartoon realised, and I would advise everyone to at least watch it once. 7\/10.

Gibson pulls a Kevin Costner here and directss\/acts in Braveheart. Here's what I think is brilliant about the film-Beautiful cinematography. Although acting and script are essential elements of a good flick, cinematography is the eros, which seduces the audience into watching the film. A good cinematographer can aid the story line with the right techniques. The use of the camera, the lighting, and the scenery are gorgeous in this film. Deserving of the Oscar.- Great acting and casting. Can you think of anyone better to play the larger than life, legendary, and very mysterious historical character of William Wallace? I think Mel Gibson fits the bill very well. The supporting cast, particularly Kind Edward Longshanks, are very effective as well. The creepy Englishman who hits on Wallace's wife is also one of the creepiest characters ever put on film (licking her face...EW). - Great stunt work and practical effects. Gibson wanted this film to look authentic and he pulled out all the stops for this one. He doesn't cheap out on this movie with any computer generated effects. There where a few sequences (mostly involving the horses) where I wondered if what they were doing was even legal! This film actually looks better than about 90% of films today with all that CGI crap. - Good plot. Is it historically accurate? I doubt the story is even close to 100% accurate, but all the big name characters in the movie were historical figures who lived during the same time period. For those wanting a piece by piece historical recollection of events, go read an encyclopedia. This movie takes many historical liberties, but also manages to piece together a pretty decent plot Scottish man suffers loss at the hands of the English and leads a rebellion against them. This movie really boils down to one important thing To persuade The Bruce, to take the throne and lead Scotland to independence, which happens at the very end following Wallace's death. It's a great story.- Nice soundtrack. It really goes along well with the film and when you hear it along with Mel trudging up the Scottish highlands, you can't help but get chills down your spine. The film deserved 7 out of the 10 Oscars they were nominated for, but sadly only got 5. Thankfully it did at least clean up with the Best Picture award. The film really should have won for Best Editing, and Best Costume Design, though. If you want to watch a 100% historically valid movie about William Wallace, feel free to watch the History Channel.

The film is loosely based on a series of true events of the first ever Olympic Jamaican Bobsled Team during the 1988's Calgary Winter Olympic Games. The movie by director Jon Turteltaub takes a lot of creative liberties in the story, recreate a movie infusing enough humor, heart and charm to make this story, very entertaining. The movie tells the story of four Jamaicans athletes, seeking a new way to make their country proud after failing the Olympic tryouts in track & field. All four, find the way in, through an ex-bobsledder named Irving Blitzer (John Candy) whom was banned from the sport, due to cheating. Now, living in shame, in Jamaica, Irving has become an alcoholic has-been. The team enlists his services to be their coach, and soon we find ourselves that maybe Team Jamaica might have a chance to make it to the Olympics, after all. The comedy was funny and enjoyable as each archetype character brings in a lovable trait in that makes it worth watching. First off, there is Derice Bannock (Leon) who dreamt of Olympic grander even if it's takes him losing his Jamaican identify by copying the Swiss team to do it. Then there is Junior Bevil (Rawle Lewis) whom lives under the strict watch of his wealthy father who doesn't wholeheartedly support his Olympic goals as a sub-plot. Third is Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) who lacks a good education but makes up for that with physical strength and macho attitude. He is often mistaken as a thug. Last person in the team is Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) whom may not be the best athlete of the four, but carries the most heart and pride in being Jamaican. The bobsledders portrayed in the film are fictional, but at less, the movie could had more realistic names for the four characters than naming one out of a pot of coffee, and an old Western actor. It's like naming a fast runner, Usain Bolt. Wait a minute, the last one is really his name. Haha. In the film, the team is formed by Jamaican sprinters after failing to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics. In real life, the Jamaican Summer Olympic Trials would have occurred following the Winter Olympics in Calgary. Irving Irv Blitzer is a fictional character as well; the real team had several trainers, none of whom were connected to any cheating scandal. In the sport of bobsledding, adding weight to the sled is perfectly legal. Both two and four-man sleds have minimum and maximum weights. As of this writing, the character of Irving Blitzer did nothing wrong. John Candy is amazing in the role, and it's sad that he died so soon after this movie. The villains of the film, if you can call them 'villains' are the East German team lead by arrogant leader, Josef (Peter Outerbridge) who treat the Jamaicans with serious scrutiny. Like the cartoony Jamaican stereotypes, the East German portrayal in the film are just outlandish racist. The only thing missing is the pencil thin mustaches for them. In real life, the East German team was very supported to the Jamaican bobsled team. There were somewhat true things about the film that worth noting. They did indeed turned up in Calgary without a sled. The nightclub fight didn't happen, but they almost start a riot there, when their singer got carried away and tried to sing a country song during a fund raiser for the sled. They were disqualified by the Olympic committee, but able to gain appeal. It was because the lack of training and whole thing about not having a sled. Not because cheating. Without spoiling too much of the ending, the events that happen are way different than that in real life, but the crash footage was the real life footage shot that day in 1988. The movie is so sport clichés that it's predictable to watch. The slow-building standing ovation is an example of this cheese formula. The film's depiction of such bobsledders carrying the sled over the line on their shoulders for dramatic effect works. This film in a masterful way shows that what matters is not always the victory but just being there and participating. Throughout the course of the movie we see the team prove to the world through their persistence that they are just as good as any other team, regardless of where they come from. They learn to become a team, learn to take pride in their culture, and do a lot of self-discovery. Even if the film itself, verges on being a bit mushy. Great morals that children will pick up on. There is some mild use of profanity, and few violent, but for the most part, it's worth watching with your children. The humor works, and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to support the mood of the movie. While the film was made by Americans. I think Jamaicans can find this movie, interesting to watch. Without this film; there wouldn't be much of a Jamaican bobsled program. The Jamaican national bobsled team still represents Jamaica in international bobsledding competitions even today. One of the original bobsled team member even won a Gold Medal in the Olympic in 2006 for Canada. International fans would love it for its Olympic source material, and the use of supporting your culture. So ya mon, it's a good movie!

The team enlists his services to be their coach, and soon we find ourselves that maybe Team Jamaica might have a chance to make it to the Olympics, after all. The comedy was funny and enjoyable as each archetype character brings in a lovable trait in that makes it worth watching. First off, there is Derice Bannock (Leon) who dreamt of Olympic grander even if it's takes him losing his Jamaican identify by copying the Swiss team to do it. Then there is Junior Bevil (Rawle Lewis) whom lives under the strict watch of his wealthy father who doesn't wholeheartedly support his Olympic goals as a sub-plot. Third is Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) who lacks a good education but makes up for that with physical strength and macho attitude. He is often mistaken as a thug. Last person in the team is Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) whom may not be the best athlete of the four, but carries the most heart and pride in being Jamaican. The bobsledders portrayed in the film are fictional, but at less, the movie could had more realistic names for the four characters than naming one out of a pot of coffee, and an old Western actor. It's like naming a fast runner, Usain Bolt. Wait a minute, the last one is really his name. Haha. In the film, the team is formed by Jamaican sprinters after failing to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics. In real life, the Jamaican Summer Olympic Trials would have occurred following the Winter Olympics in Calgary. Irving Irv Blitzer is a fictional character as well; the real team had several trainers, none of whom were connected to any cheating scandal. In the sport of bobsledding, adding weight to the sled is perfectly legal. Both two and four-man sleds have minimum and maximum weights. As of this writing, the character of Irving Blitzer did nothing wrong. John Candy is amazing in the role, and it's sad that he died so soon after this movie. The villains of the film, if you can call them 'villains' are the East German team lead by arrogant leader, Josef (Peter Outerbridge) who treat the Jamaicans with serious scrutiny. Like the cartoony Jamaican stereotypes, the East German portrayal in the film are just outlandish racist. The only thing missing is the pencil thin mustaches for them. In real life, the East German team was very supported to the Jamaican bobsled team. There were somewhat true things about the film that worth noting. They did indeed turned up in Calgary without a sled. The nightclub fight didn't happen, but they almost start a riot there, when their singer got carried away and tried to sing a country song during a fund raiser for the sled. They were disqualified by the Olympic committee, but able to gain appeal. It was because the lack of training and whole thing about not having a sled. Not because cheating. Without spoiling too much of the ending, the events that happen are way different than that in real life, but the crash footage was the real life footage shot that day in 1988. The movie is so sport clichés that it's predictable to watch. The slow-building standing ovation is an example of this cheese formula. The film's depiction of such bobsledders carrying the sled over the line on their shoulders for dramatic effect works. This film in a masterful way shows that what matters is not always the victory but just being there and participating. Throughout the course of the movie we see the team prove to the world through their persistence that they are just as good as any other team, regardless of where they come from. They learn to become a team, learn to take pride in their culture, and do a lot of self-discovery. Even if the film itself, verges on being a bit mushy. Great morals that children will pick up on. There is some mild use of profanity, and few violent, but for the most part, it's worth watching with your children. The humor works, and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to support the mood of the movie. While the film was made by Americans. I think Jamaicans can find this movie, interesting to watch. Without this film; there wouldn't be much of a Jamaican bobsled program. The Jamaican national bobsled team still represents Jamaica in international bobsledding competitions even today. One of the original bobsled team member even won a Gold Medal in the Olympic in 2006 for Canada. International fans would love it for its Olympic source material, and the use of supporting your culture. So ya mon, it's a good movie!

This seems like sound advice to me, but the time has come at last to give my two cents about a film known as PULP FICTION. There are those who hate it and those who love it and those who shrug their shoulders not knowing quite what to make of it. I freely admit I belong to the third category. I don't revere it, I don't condemn it; and the way Quentin Tarantino bookends the movie with the beginning scene is kind of clever and interesting. But I sure don't see what all the hoopla is about. The stuff packed in between the two slices of narrative bread is not god awful or gems of shimmering brilliance, it's just standard shock-o-rama to me. I didn't mind watching it and would not mind watching it again except for all this undue emphasis on how important it is to Film Culture. I hope you will forgive me for not seeing it that way.PULP FICTION is a cultural curiosity to me. Sort of like the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. I can think of half a dozen films I can more easily and wholeheartedly embrace and which more naturally duplicate my thoughts and feelings and deeply felt ideas. When I first saw PULP FICTION, I was hoping at the end of the roundup there would be some kind of moral resonance to the whole thing, but it was simply too shallow to produce that kind of effect. It's more like a hodgepodge of cultural references, nearly all of which veer in the direction of the scatological. Some of the references hit an emotional chord and some don't in my mind.I remember seeing LET IT BE with my friend Scott in Black Lake, Michigan. This was a documentary about the Beatles. I found the picture exhilarating because of how it recorded the incubatory introversion of the creative process the band went through before experiencing the celebratory extroversion of live performance. Scott did not think there were enough exciting parts to hold his interest. I also remember seeing Fellini's AMARCORD with Louie Whitehead and realizing while mentally comparing it to about a hundred films in a few seconds how remarkable it was that it did not focus on Sex and Violence to carry the story forward. That being so, Louie was kind of dissatisfied with it and I confessed I did not think as highly of AMARCORD as I did of Fellini's THE CLOWNS. All I can say is that different people of necessity have different tastes and sensibilities.My dissatisfaction with PULP FICTION is that unlike Kurosawa's film HIGH AND LOW there is no 'high and low'! All the characters are lowlifes, but represented as strong and resourceful while the so-called 'straight types' like the college students are represented as ineffectual and weak. PULP FICTION completes the moral and cultural inversion first presented by Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER, but this time played even more for laughs. I just don't see much value in all of this.I suppose if Ned Beatty could be sodomized in DELIVERANCE, owing to equal opportunity Ving Rhames could be sodomized in PULP FICTION, but the truth is I would rather see him play someone like A.G. Gaston, than someone like Al Capone. I enjoyed watching Bruce Willis chose between a chain-saw and a katana before rescuing Rhames' character from the pommel horse, but even he comes across as a character of dubious honor.Perhaps, I should not quibble about the Whore with the Heart of Gold now being joined by the Hit-man with the Heart of Gold. It is just that Divine Intervention for hired killers is too perverse and cruel a Cosmic Joke for me.Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta play fascinating characters as Jules and Vincent, but they seem more like supporting characters than leads. My problem with PULP FICTION is that there did not seem to be any character, except for a few moments with Bruce Willis, I could wholeheartedly relate to and embrace. All of them, one way or another, seemed to be stained with sleaze or wallowing in it. Uma Thurman gives a creditable performance as the wife of Marsellus Wallace and Christopher Walken's off-color story is hilarious, but it all comes across as a world you want to handle in a glove or a puzzle box so as not to get any of it on you. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer (bearing the name of a character in one of my three-act plays, by the way) depart a Mexican standoff against Jules and Vincent with their lives and all their ill-gotten gains, but are they really any the wiser? Leaving, they come across as an ersatz version of Adam and Eve exiting the Garden of Evil rather than Eden.Much has been made of the non-linearity of the narrative structure and no doubt something can be learned from Tarantino's musical handling of his scenes. This leads me to conclude you can get people to believe and accept anything just by making the images flow in harmony with the musical score. Once again, it seems to me I have seen non-linearity handled better in other pieces, most notably and recently in RUN, LOLA, RUN, but Tarantino does a good job with it here.

I am surprised that Banks was not inserted more clearly as the initiator of this madness. I would normally say that Mel Gibson gives a strong performance in whatever role he inhabits, given that he is a very talented actor. Notwithstanding a loathing of him as a person outside of the movie industry, I didn't let my revulsion influence watching him act. I found his embodiment of Fletcher Christian a bit wobbly. I say this because instead of emoting something more clearly defined as turmoil when it was appropriate, too often, for my liking, he wore a blank look on his face. Compare this to the master actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins, who is famous for allowing the character he represents to be transparent and fully involved. Over all I think that it is under rated and if trashed by critics of that time, unjustly so. I saw a comment here from someone who said forget Master and Commander. Not so. It also is a superb film and adheres very closely to the several O'Brian novels from which the script is crafted. Finally, I am not really a big fan of Vangelis. I mean, the only film that I associate his soundtrack music to is the always entertaining Blade Runner. I can't imagine that film without the music. Seen these many years later, the 1984 film of the Bounty does not couple well with the electronic sounds that Vangelis was known for. A minor quibble but I'm a musician and am fussy about soundtracks. By comparison there is not one single sound of music that is out of place in Master and Commander. The Bounty is good movie making.

All of those elements make Robocop one of my all-time favorite Action films and Paul Verhoevan at his best.Set in a futuristic Detroit,Michigan,Robocop tells the story of Alex Murphy(Peter Weller),a cop who has been transferred to a police station on a dangerous side of Detroit where crime is up. While on duty,Murphy is brutally murdered by a group of criminals and left for dead but is brought back to life by mega-corporation OCP(Omni Consumer Products)as Robocop,a half human half machine Cyborg that is assigned to protect and serve the public and uphold the law. But when Robocop starts having memories of his death as Alex Murphy,Robocop wants to hunt down the men who killed him and wants to get them at all costs and whether they're dead or alive they're coming with Robocop.Robocop is one of the most brilliant and dazzling SCI-FI\/Action films of the 1980s and of all-time and is one of those movies that is an instant classic from the moment you watch it,an amazing movie that is up there with other excellent and brilliant SCI-FI\/Action classics such as Blade Runner,The Terminator,Terminator 2Judgment Day,Aliens,Predator,Predator 2,Escape From New York and The Road Warrior. Robocop is also a movie that keeps you glued to screen and is like a Comic Book or Graphic Novel coming to life because throughout the film there is an over the top and wild energy that never stops until the very end and everything in Robocop is pushed to the limit whether it's explosions,guns or the violence but despite all of those things Robocop has a style and demented weirdness that makes the movie less serious. There is a politically incorrect in your face no holds barred attitude that I love about Action movies from the 1970s,80s and 90s and is one of the main reasons the film holds up as a classic and has stood the test of time. What I also love about Robocop is that it's apart of the sub genre of SCI-FI that I have always love Dystopian Futuristic film where there is a society,major city or country that takes place in a dark future and Robocop's future in Detroit depicts a bleak future where law enforcement is falling apart,criminals are ruling the streets and big money corporations have taken over pretty much everything. While Robocop does take place in the future the movie never reveals what year Robocop takes place in giving the future in Detroit a more timeless feel. What is also great about Robocop is that while it's still an explosive Action film,there is also a great deal of Humor and Satire that is in the film and it is very funny whether it's with Robocop dealing with the criminals on the streets,the movie mocking American consumer culture,Television commercials or News Media which makes Robocop not only relevant in 1987 but for many years to come. The Humor and Satire can be seen as a precursor to director Paul Verhoeven two other amazing SCI-FI\/Action films Total Recall and Starship Troopers. All three films would make a great triple feature. Robocop also has themes in the film dealing with greed,big business corporations and urban decay commenting on the President Reagan era of the 1980s in an honest and sometimes funny way. The Action and violent scenes in Robocop are amazing,bloody and sometimes brutal,(so brutal in fact that Robocop got an X-Rating from the MPAA)but the Action is done in such a way that it matches perfectly with the film's outlandish Comic Book tone. The Action is fast and so relentless you will never have time to catch your breath. The main character Robocop is one of the all-time great movie characters in SCI-FI and Action films because even though he is a machine Robocop is still a human inside the metal flesh and while Robocop is successful as Robocop he begins to discover the human side that he used to be in Alex Murphy and throughout the movie we see Robocop trying to find out who he really was in his past while being a cop. This element gives the movie and main character sadness and levels of depth that separates Robocop from the some of the other Action movies of the 1980s and is one the reasons Robocop is a classic character you will never forget. The ending of Robocop is great,exciting and explosive and is fantastic conclusion that will have you cheering at the screen. An tremendous ending.The cast is great. Peter Weller is excellent as Robocop\/Alex Murphy,with Weller bringing power and depth to the role. Nancy Allen is terrific as Officer Anne Lewis,Robocop\/Murphy's partner. Daniel O'Herlihy is great as The Old Man,a top executive at OCP. Ronny Cox is wonderful as Dick Jones,a top man at OCP. Kurkwood Smith is fantastic as Clarence Boddicker,a vicious criminal and killer. Miguel Ferrer is terrific as Bob Norton,a rival executive of Dick Jones that helps create Robocop. Robert DoQui(Sergeant Warren Reed),Felton Perry(Johnson),Ray Wise(Leon),Paul McCrane(Emil),Jesse Goins(Joe),Calvin Jung(Steve Minh)and Lee DeBroux(Sal)give good performances as well.The direction by Paul Verhoeven is brilliant and memorable,with Verhoeven always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace while also doing a great job with the Action scenes. Incredible direction,Verhoeven.The score by Basil Poledouns is fantastic,powerful,epic and one of the best scores I have ever heard in an Action movie and matches the film perfectly. Amazing score,Poledouns.The special make-up effects by Rob Bottin are outstanding,realistic and is among the best work Bottin has ever done.

Is there any resonating quality or completely unique idea to be found here? No, not really. Still, it has a bit of a Scooby-Doo quality to it. Mischievous kids get stuck in a spooky funhouse and they are tip-toeing around with a masked killer on the loose. The only thing missing was Shaggy and Velma. The acting is typical for a film of this nature, but the dialogue isn't overly dreadful and the script is simple and unobtrusive for the most part. The movie doesn't try to be anything more than a romp in a creepy carnival. It also doesn't try to be any other movie. Is it a slasher film? Eh.. kinda? It doesn't feel derivative, for the most part, so you don't feel like you are watching Friday the 13th or Halloween - both made a short time before The Funhouse. It effectively uses the setting as the centerpiece and allows both the victims and the creepy carnival custodians to operate within that framework. Obviously, movies like this aren't a thing to take seriously and Hooper keeps the dialogue light and the tone remains Joker-esque in nature. This movie proves that horror movies can be both dark and fun at the same time.The Bad As the opening credits role, there is a montage of creepy automated puppets that are littered throughout the funhouse. It sets the stage for what you think is going to be a very creepy place. Sadly, the funhouse isn't really all that scary. It's a nice atmosphere for the story of the trapped kids and their would-be attackers, but the funhouse itself is a letdown. The other attractions on the carnival grounds like the (real) two-headed cow and cleft-palate cow are a more jarring sight than anything in the funhouse. The creepy puppets are just kind of in the background for most of the movie set in the funhouse and it feels like a wasted plot point. I also have to admit that the movie became much less scary (although it's not all that scary to begin with) after the deformed killer's true identity was revealed. There was something far creepier about not knowing who or what the Frankenstein-masked weirdo was and I felt that the reveal came too early in the film. The initial reveal is cool, but the end of the movie just wasn't as much fun because of this. It's like, Well, I know how this ends now. And it ends just like you think it does.The Carnies This is a Tobe Hooper directed movie and if anything, Hooper can tell the story of a deranged family better than most. The are a few moments that feel a bit like we are back in a certain grimy, backwoods Texas house, but they are not so overbearing that they become too derivative. He loves his mute, grunting, drooling derelicts now, doesn't he? And you know what? So do we. He effectively piques our interest through a slow reveal of the killer, who initially dons a Frankenstein mask and gloves. Is he a kid? Is he just an emotionally adolescent adult? Is he deformed? Well, slowly you find out and it's worse than you think. Although you have time to think about the killer under the mask, like stated above, the reveal does happen a bit too early in the film and you are left with a chase & slash movie for the unoriginal final act.

This is by far the best of the lot. I have a weakness for cheesy 80's films. For some reason, I'm in love with the 80's, especially movies. Everything was so simple back then. This movie really shed new light on how nerds were viewed. They went from hated to revered by the public because they were painted as underdogs. Obviously, there are still many nerds being bullied to this day, but it isn't as frowned upon as it was back then. Let's face it, who hasn't wanted to see a bully get bested by the underdog? That's what is so great about this movie. Robert Carradine is very memorable as Lews Skolnick, reprising his role in three more sequels, two of them STV. Anthony Edwards is a blast as his best pal Gilbert. He'd be reduced to a mere cameo in the second movie and written out of the 3rd and fourth movies altogether.

Developed from an un-filmed Akira Kurosawa script by Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel, and former hardened inmate Eddie Bunker, Runaway Train proves that action movies can do a hell of a lot more than blow s**t up and offer amusing one-liners.Notorious convict Manny (Jon Voight) is released from three years in confinement by hateful warden Ranken (John P. Ryan) not just because of media pressure, but in the hope that he will try and escape so Barstow may kill him. After he is attacked and wounded, Manny makes the quick decision to escape his Alaskan confines, and does so with the help of the young and rather dumb Buck (Eric Roberts). They board a train, but unbeknown to them the engineer on board has died from a heart attack and the train is heading at high speed towards various obstacles. Ground-staff are alerted to the situation and quickly set about clearing the tracks, but Ranken has soon joined them with revenge in mind.Many Hollywood movies offer moments of spectacular visual effects and sound design that should be applauded, but normally these scenes don't tend to generate any excitement in me. Runaway Train offers similar scenes, but there's two key aspects that make the film work so well. The first is emotional investment. As despicable as these characters often are, Manny and Buck are real, helped considerably by the career-best performances of Voight and Roberts. The former, in an empowering speech that may just be the best work he's ever done, informs Buck of the futility of their situation. They may just rule the world if they could hold down a job, but they can't, they're criminals, and cannot escape their societal role.The appearance of Rebecca De Mornay's character Sara, a young engineer still aboard and who is unable to stop the train, highlights this. Manny and Buck squabble and fight for the first time in front of her, showing that when put into a situation where the laws of society come into play, they reject it and turn into animals. These exchanges occur between some nail-biting scenes, which brings me onto the next aspect that makes the film work so well - real action. There's no wide-shots of gigantic explosions, just two battered men clawing and slipping their way along the snow-drenched train. In one scene, after a daring attempt to jump carriages, Manny's wind and cold-battered face craws towards the camera, ragged bandages hang off his bloodied hand, and his crooked, brown teeth are bared. The camera is so intrusive that you really feel every move he makes, to the point where I felt exhausted.Though it does occasionally slip in prison movie cliché, this is perhaps one of the most underrated films ever made. It was recognised at the Oscars with nominations for Voight, Roberts and for Best Editing, but it doesn't seem to have left the legacy it certainly deserves. I wouldn't exactly call the film obscure, but your average film-goer probably won't have heard of it, especially when compared to, say, Die Hard (1988). This is riveting stuff, tightly directed by Russian Andrei Konchalovsky (who went on to make the crappy Tango & Cash (1989)), and the film leaves you with an beautiful and slightly eerie final image that could say more than words could have.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"12 February 2014","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The next time I criticise an action movie for being brainless, only to be met by the response of well, it is an action movie!, I'll refer them to Runaway Train, a breathless, thoroughly exciting action movie that manages to portray two fully three-dimensional characters amidst underlying sociological messages about imprisonment and reform.

These exchanges occur between some nail-biting scenes, which brings me onto the next aspect that makes the film work so well - real action. There's no wide-shots of gigantic explosions, just two battered men clawing and slipping their way along the snow-drenched train. In one scene, after a daring attempt to jump carriages, Manny's wind and cold-battered face craws towards the camera, ragged bandages hang off his bloodied hand, and his crooked, brown teeth are bared. The camera is so intrusive that you really feel every move he makes, to the point where I felt exhausted.Though it does occasionally slip in prison movie cliché, this is perhaps one of the most underrated films ever made. It was recognised at the Oscars with nominations for Voight, Roberts and for Best Editing, but it doesn't seem to have left the legacy it certainly deserves. I wouldn't exactly call the film obscure, but your average film-goer probably won't have heard of it, especially when compared to, say, Die Hard (1988). This is riveting stuff, tightly directed by Russian Andrei Konchalovsky (who went on to make the crappy Tango & Cash (1989)), and the film leaves you with an beautiful and slightly eerie final image that could say more than words could have.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"12 February 2014","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The next time I criticise an action movie for being brainless, only to be met by the response of well, it is an action movie!, I'll refer them to Runaway Train, a breathless, thoroughly exciting action movie that manages to portray two fully three-dimensional characters amidst underlying sociological messages about imprisonment and reform. Developed from an un-filmed Akira Kurosawa script by Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel, and former hardened inmate Eddie Bunker, Runaway Train proves that action movies can do a hell of a lot more than blow s**t up and offer amusing one-liners.Notorious convict Manny (Jon Voight) is released from three years in confinement by hateful warden Ranken (John P. Ryan) not just because of media pressure, but in the hope that he will try and escape so Barstow may kill him. After he is attacked and wounded, Manny makes the quick decision to escape his Alaskan confines, and does so with the help of the young and rather dumb Buck (Eric Roberts). They board a train, but unbeknown to them the engineer on board has died from a heart attack and the train is heading at high speed towards various obstacles. Ground-staff are alerted to the situation and quickly set about clearing the tracks, but Ranken has soon joined them with revenge in mind.Many Hollywood movies offer moments of spectacular visual effects and sound design that should be applauded, but normally these scenes don't tend to generate any excitement in me. Runaway Train offers similar scenes, but there's two key aspects that make the film work so well. The first is emotional investment. As despicable as these characters often are, Manny and Buck are real, helped considerably by the career-best performances of Voight and Roberts. The former, in an empowering speech that may just be the best work he's ever done, informs Buck of the futility of their situation. They may just rule the world if they could hold down a job, but they can't, they're criminals, and cannot escape their societal role.The appearance of Rebecca De Mornay's character Sara, a young engineer still aboard and who is unable to stop the train, highlights this.
