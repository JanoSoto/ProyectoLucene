[{"date":"10 September 2000","score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  Uninspiring time killer which is just about watchable. Billed as a comedy, it turns out to be more of a thriller as we follow down on his luck (and alcoholic) reporter Dan Starkey (David Thewlis - Dragonheart) as he bumbles his way through being convicted of murder, chased by the IRA and the Police while he tries to unravel a conspiracy involving high and mighty politicians trying to make peace in troubled Northern Ireland. Moderately entertaining, it falls down mainly because you will not care less what happens to any of the very dislikable characters involved in the plot and if you really think about it the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Best part of the film is the gorgeous Laura Fraser as Thewlis' &#145;bit on the side', although she is not in it all that much.
