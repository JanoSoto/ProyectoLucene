[{"date":"10 November 2011","score":"","review":" *Spoiler\/plot- 1972, In 1906, an English explorer and anthropologist discovers a remarkable human like fossil in China. He believes the ancient strange humanoid is the legendary and exclusive missing link to man's earliest beginnings on Earth. The carefully crated mystery is taken aboard the train for it's long trip back to civilization and the train trip becomes a bizarre and horrifying voyage for the many passengers.*Special Stars- Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Telly Savalas *Theme- Science and superstition can be confused about the facts.*Based on- Early 18 century anthropology and Russian religious views about man's origins.*Trivia\/location\/goofs- The film was shot in Spain. Goof Early in the film, a Chinese lock-picking expert's scenes are in close-up in a train station. While dressed in 1890's garb, you can clearly see his 20th century hearing aide behind his left ear. The commanding officer uniform for the Russian squad's at the train station is clearly Communist post-revolution with it's Red Star on his cap front, wrong era, sorry. Telly Savalas plays a Russian 'Cossack role of the famous Southern Russia horsemen with a clearly laughable American (non-Russian) accent. The crudely made red-eye alien\/fossil transformation scenes are terrible by the use of bad creature make-up scenes around the actor's eyes. The main actors almost dropped out of this film project due to recent family member's deaths (wives). The alien\/fossil bloody zombie make-up is convincing. The train miniatures in this film are of interest.*Emotion- A somewhat forgettable odd sci-fi thriller taking place on the famous Trans-Siberian railroad in Czarist Russia in the late 1800's. Rather mad casting and acted road\/train trip movie consisting of international mega stars with an unusual science fiction plot twist. There's an interesting Russian Rasputin monk character in this film that is enjoyable to watch. I was reminded of all those spectacular Murder on the Orient Express mega films of similar plot and historic time periods. This film is a fun romp, not to be taken too seriously.
