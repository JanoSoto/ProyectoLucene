Consider that there are only a half dozens stories anyway, and almost all of every film is not a copy of life, but a copy of some previous film. The best copies rely on the fact that you are replaying the original in your mind, so they get that for `free' and can overlay their own message. Hitchcock's set a new template. This film is lucky enough to reference that template.It is rather like IMBD comments. What's so great about writing these is that we -- both writer and reader, though strangers -- have shared a rather intimate experience the writer can immediately assume a couple hours of a shared life. We annotate that shared experience.In the case of this remake, we have a homeopathic commentary -- the closer, the more powerful the differences. Here we have actors that are in most cases MUCH better than the originals. Heche isn't a deep actor, but she is masterfully cast. However, Macy and Moore are famously multidimensional. They act more than one film, more than one character at a time. Moore is rather a whirlwind as she brings this annotative style of acting to several films a year.So we have annotative acting where we can see two movie performances at once and groove off the resonances because of the near twinning. A large example here the sex object is played by a lesbian, her sister IS a lesbian, and Norman is not gay all a rather large shuffle of the underlying sexual dynamic. A small example when first Macy encounters Norman outside the office, see how he needles Norman both as his character the detective and also as surrogate viewer. Another when Heche is driving, we get a far deeper performance from her face -- she projects her mind on her face for the benefit of the viewer, she becomes both the character and the character's annotator. Way richer than the original. Anything Moore does exists in two spaces.This film was set up for later annotation, in fact is structured in that very way. The first half, we have the real story the theft and murder. The second half we have a second film, which overlays the first. Following that we have a more narrative annotion the `explanation.' (Which incidentally is tedious in the original, much more efficient in this version.)We also have a completely different film cinematically. Hitchcock's camerawork was clever in its time. But today we have so much more we can do with the camera that a close watching of how he choreographs his eye, it seems slow, dull, passive. I'm not an admirer of van Sant's work generally, but this new film is very intelligent in its use of the eye and the motion of color. In this case, the film is quite far from Hitchcock's, and to my mind the changes are emphasized by their differences. The result is a hyperselfaware eye.Close, annotative jazz acting on a familiar script, and colordancing distance in the eye make this a pretty rich experience. If you are serious about film, you really must see this. If you worship Hitchcock for some reason, then you are likely to be an unhappy viewer whatever you see.

One character, a dwarven warrior has almost all his scenes cut leaving you wondering why they bothered with him in the first place.Some nice scenes of dragons and a passing beholder (who does nothing but float past) doesn't make up for the rest of the film. The acting is pretty terrible even from Jeremy Irons, who you would generally expect a lot better from. Instead he seemed quite uncomfortable in his role, and constantly over acted. The only people that seemed at all comfortable in their roles were Justin Whalin (Most would know from the Superman TV series) and Richard O'Brien (playing himself pretty much). A better choice for the evil mage would have been David Warner (who did the voice of Irenicus in Baldurs Gate 2, and has always been a superb bad guy in this genre of film). Also choosing an experienced fantasy film director rather then a novice would have helped.

They could still have people on hand to make sure the film stayed accurate to the D&D world.I hope that in the future another better film will be produced set in the D&D universe as there is so much potential in there. Perhaps after the Lord of the rings film has been released interest will be ripe again for this genre. We can only hope. You never know, someone may even make a Baldurs Gate film!The extra material on the DVD explains a lot of what you miss (and is quite laughable for the cardboard cut out wraith, and the inflatable baby dragon...but you need to see it really to understand).In summary, if you love d&d don't bother with this film, instead buy the new 3rd edition rules and get playing instead!

But after all I found it rather boring, perhaps because I didn't understand Scottie´s attitude.However, now I´m a few years older, I see Vertigo (and many other Hitchcock's movies) with different eyes. Detective plot is the subject which I am less concerned inside them (though I keep a high interest), and love affair is now what makes me think that these pictures are really special.Nobody ever gave us such a romantic sight of loving obsession for a dead woman as Hitch did with Vertigo, and I have never seen such a touching amour fou tale. And  that's the reason which turns Vertigo into an unforgettable and unique film and differentiates it from other works by the same author, like Notorious or Rebecca. Vertigo's psychological depth is probably only reached by Hitchcock with Marnie, another non-conventional romance.In addition to that we can enjoy the wonderful performances of Jimmy Stewart (progressively out of his usual role of prudent man as the story moves forward) and Kim Novak (better actress than what some people think and perhaps the most beautiful woman I have seen on a screen).But Vertigo is one more thing it's a film about a city.

Only thing... Highly underestimated! I would rank it right amidst its rivals as Braveheart, Gladiator and the Patriot and I might even dare say, that some could perceive it to be fastly superiou to those other historical epics, due to the more credible story. Now you ask, what it is that makes this movie so great. I will tell you.For starters it has absolutely one of the best soundtracks ever, no doubt about it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, while experiencing the sense of drama and romance. All at once! And this is realized through the music only. In combination with the scenes all of your synapses are on overload. One minor point is, that the movie contains almost no other sound scores and one must settle for the soundtrack in mostly every scene.Next up is the scenery. Michael Mann KNOWS what a good setting for a movie is. But even more does he KNOW how to get it over to your tv screen. Every camerashot couldn't have been taken better and entices you completely.And that brings me to the action. The Last of the Mohicans portrays some of the best personal combat, comparable to a martial artists film, with actors seemingly to be as highly skilled as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. And this might not be to everyones liking, but the movie often shows very realistic gory details, like broken bones showing through  skin and weapons penetrating a body.Now I have reached the last reason for the greatness of this film and why it belongs amongst Gladiator and its kind. The viewer receives a massive dose of the entire scala of emotional triggers romance, intrigue, action, drama and adventure. And above that, the story stays credible. Something Braveheart and consorts passed by. Because the main lead is of flesh and blood and isn't made into a superhuman hero that can defeat anything on his path it keep it's credibility!Though I would like to stop now, I need to deal with one final point. The acting\/actors. Don't get me wrong the acting was of high class, only the two lead characters, who were to convert the main love story to my screen, Daniel Day Lewis as Hawkeye and Madeleine Stowe as Cora Munro, were disappointing. To me neither of them could bring the story to life, because they just weren't convincing in their part and couldn't reach me. Fortunately, Wes Studi made up for a great deal of Daniel's doing as his best performance EVER as Magua, Daniel's counterpart. The other main characters were just as good as Studi. I liked them so much I just have to name them Jodhi May as Alice Munro, Steven Waddington as Heyward, Eric Schweig as Uncas and Russell Means as Chingachgook! I would have loved for all of them to have twice as much screen time as they did, at the cost of the two leads! But hey you can't have everything.Well I guess this is why it deserves to be amongst the other great epics. The music, the scenery, the action, the versatility and the acting are all of superb quality. You must be a fool not to watch this movie. And when you do, be sure to do so on a tv as large as possible and a superb soundsystem to bring out the full greatness of this classic!

Well, I finally got around to renting this out on DVD and boy was I glad I DIDN'T see this at the movies.The movie itself runs for approximately 97 minutes, but it will feel like it has run for 5 hours once the closing credits run across the screen. I really like Winona Ryder, but her movie roles she has been choosing as of late have been rather questionable. This one pretty much takes the gold medal for 'worst career choice'.This movie doesn't really know what it wants to be. Stigmata 2, The Exorcist Returns, The Omen The New Beginning, End Of Days II, etc. It takes bits and pieces from about 10 other films that deal with exorcism, devil possession, apocalypse derived from religious texts, etc., that it actually feels like you're watching something you've already seen before.Ryder is a young school teacher who was once 'possessed' by the devil. She assists Father Lareaux (played by John Hurt), the man who presides over the convent where she resides and teaches, in performing exorcisms. We even get to see one at the beginning of the movie that takes place in an asylum. Unfortunately, this particular exorcism backfires and renders Hurt into a catatonic state of mind. The unfortunate subject of the exorcism itself was not 'cleansed' of his demonic possession and therefore extends his character to be used at a later time in the movie.Meanwhile, Ryder studies the notes that were scribbled by the exorcism subject and discovers that Satan will take possession of a human (Ben Chaplin) on his 33rd birthday. The movie doesn't really delve into Ben Chaplin's character. All we discover is that he is an author of a novel that focuses on the trial of a serial killer. He seems to be an all-around nice guy, but the dialogue doesn't allow the viewer to discover anything more about him. Ryder's character comes off as being rather dull. A series of shocked facial expressions, bad hair and running around in the rain is all we really get to know about her.So basically this movie has introduced us to two characters that we don't really care about. One must save the other from being possessed by the devil. And that's what the next 80 minutes or so of the film tries to accomplish without putting the viewer to sleep.I remember reading somewhere a long time ago that when this movie was being filmed, several re-writes actually took place during shooting of the film, and the ending was re-shot after test audiences gave it a 'thumbs down'. If it was any worse than the ending that WASN'T left on the cutting room floor, then I can't possibly see how bad it could have been. Basically, Ryder's character comes to a resolution that includes a loaded gun and the penultimate moment when Chaplin's character is possessed by Satan.Several times during the viewing of this movie, I checked my watch. I looked at the back of the DVD case to see how long it ran for. I even spent some time trimming my toe nails. The photography in this movie was bleak. Everything came off as either being 'grainy' or dark. I felt like I was sitting in a cold latrine whilst watching the movie. There wasn't anything about the script that really kept me interested. The acting was below par and none of the actors could inject any character into their characters.This movie was really a waste of time. Never have I been so disappointed in the outcome of such a dreary film. I really thought something could have been made out of the 'ending' had someone really sat down and thought about it.

I'm not going to go into big plot details, but the way the story panned out was more intelligent than a lot of supposed 'adult' action movies. There were some really beautiful touches to the animation - Willis in the meadow; and the white silhouettes of all the kids coming from the e-mails spring to mind. It was moving, and the emotion expressed seemed genuine without lapsing into being overly sentimental. Some of the humour was obvious, but most of it was laugh-out-loud funny. My one problem is the same as the one I have for the TV series - it really is not for children. I watched it with a friend (we are both in our twenties) and were shocked by some of the scenes - there is a lot of violence. Now I don't mind violence in films at all, but the producers should consider what's appropriate. Someone, even if it is a monster, having its head split in half with a sword, and limbs being blown off the lasers doesn't really strike me as suitable for young kids.
