I'm a pretty big Anime fan and I lie pretty much in the norm concerning my tastes. I enjoy all the most revered of the genre Akira, Gundam, Evangelion, Princess Mononoke, etc. These are all more than just cartoons, they are films with all the baggage that label entails. But there is one highly rated Anime that I don't understand all the fuss over Ghost in the Shell. Supposedly this thing influenced the Matrix more than anyother source. I remember seeing it several years ago an not being impressed, so I decided to see it again hoping that it would have a better effect. It was worse than I could have imagined.This is a bad, bad movie on so many levels. First, and foremost, it is the most unapologetically misogynistic piece of crap I've ever seen... And not in a good way. There are certain kinds of misogyny that no man can help but enjoy, like girly magazines or Rolling Stones songs. Juvenile, but entertaining. Well, Ghost in the Shell makes Stray Cat Blues look like a tribute to the strength of the female of the species.While its true the two main antagonists of the film are both very powerful women, they are mistreated in such a way that is so grotesque I can't seem to find a funny metaphor. First of all, the main character is nude throughout most of the film for no reason, especially during combat scenes. Supposedly she has to be nude to use an invisibility device, but a male character uses the same device fully clothed. This is a silly kind of fanboy misogyny that they could get away with little more than a chuckle from me, but then they had to get into mutilation.You see, both main characters are robots that only look like humans, so they can take quite a bit of abuse without dying. Both characters are horrendously mutilated throughout the movie, losing limbs left and right, and usually being naked while its happening. In the end their upper torsos are dragged around like trash and put on display - their faces and breasts still intact. I guess those are the only parts that are important to the director who seems to want to make the titillation of the nudity and the violence if the dripping entrails into a single arousal. This is a new form of low in a movie that actually wants to be taken seriously. This could only come from the mind of someone who viscerally hates women and wants to see them humiliated in the worst possible way.To top it all off, like most pseudo-pornography, the plot is nonexistent. People will have you believe that it's all about the line between sentience and mechanism, but that's been done to death since Pinocchio. Dialog is purely scientific and lacks any humanity. Characters are purely two dimensional and never grow nor bring out feelings of sympathy from the audience. That's the worst problem about this film - it's all about the science and not about the humanity. Akira wasn't about human evolution, it was about two friends in a disproportionate relationship. Evangelion wasn't about giant mecha, it was about a semi-autistic 12 year old learning to trust others and love himself. Ghost in the Shell is all about computer viruses and disembodied titties, and that's why it sucks. It's nothing more that an technological version of Baywatch - that is if Pamela Anderson was ripped to shreds by a shark and her carcass was hung on the wall as a trophy...

Some of the images actually managed to stick with me, like the menacing school, the corpse in the ice-cave and the avalanche at the end. However, as I saw it yesterday I realized that this film doesn't really rise above the average American thriller when you think about it. It's always refreshing to see a film in a different locale acted out in a different language,(as I, as a European does not have a problem with subtitles) but the plot basically stays the same, and the ending feels like a big cliché.Mathieu Kassovitz, who directed this film pulls off some amazing shots at the beginning of the film that are just beautiful to look at and Crimson Rivers will forever be remembered as a film containing some of the most beautifully shot footage, using a helicopter. The rest of the movie stays more or less true to the opening impression but never surprises beyond that. Credit has to be  given for the avalanche scenes toward the end though, where you really feel as though you're in there with the actors as they're covered with snow and then dug up by the rescue team. Thierry Arbogast, the films cinematographer did a great job collaborating with Kassovitz and it's probably him that should be thanked for the look of the film. However Kassovitz later did the highly atmospheric Gothika without Arbogast so maybe he didn't have so much to do with it after all?The film would have have benefited from a more powerful soundtrack. The music composed by Bruno Coulais is a bit lame and could've been spiced up a bit to elevate the atmosphere to a higher level of fear than is represented in the film. The music can sometimes be the most important ingredient in a film and here it's just not good enough.The actors do a great job and Jean Reno as a cop is something I haven't seen in any other film. But then again, I haven't seen everyone of his films.As for the movie as a whole I'm not sure what they aimed at with this film. It's never the least scary and the cops scattered throughout the film are intended to be funny (and they are, for the most). Films that don't know where they want to be placed and mixes equal doses of action and humor are generally considered mainstream. It feels sad to say it, but Crimson Rivers does not rise above it.

In Cradle Will Rock, Vanessa Redgrave's character mirrors Susan Sarandon's character in Dead Man Walking.  They're filled with a mission and they don't ask questions, but hopefully and cheerfully carry their missions out. Dramatic tension?  Nope, they're above it (the scripts, characters, and movies).  The parallel between the French monarchy (Louis XVI at the eve of the French Revolution, to be exact) and Gray Mathers and his crowd is plain tacky and void of character development.  Robbins' is a very shallow reading of history.  He can't figure out if he wants to do high art or reach the masses, and the result is not very good at all.

The film that launched a revolution in film making and made Steven Spielberg a household name!As we begin yet another season of summer blockbuster entries, I can't help but give credit to the movie that started the trend. I was just a little girl, growing up on Long Island, when I begged my mother to take me to see JAWS and afterward, it took me another 2 years before I would venture out into the ocean again! What I love about JAWS is that it was more than just a casual popcorn horror flick. It has good acting, drama, suspense, action and even some humor. It's hard to believe that it was filmed on a restricted budget and plagued by equipment failures and delays that extended the filming several months beyond it's schedule. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that Spielberg originally planned to release JAWS in the late summer of 1974. The countless delays caused filming to run into the fall of 74. Rather than open the film to a winter audience, Spielberg chose to wait until the height of the following summer to release JAWS where it would have the strongest impact. This proved ingenious. The summer blockbuster was born and the rest is box office history! With today's technological advancements and computerized special effects, not to mention the overblown, unoriginal, popularity of remakes, it may surprise some that nobody has ever attempted to remake JAWS. However, after seeing the film, you'll quickly realize that this is because nobody could ever match the action, horror, chilling suspense, and tension between the characters than in the original. The acting is first-rate, particularly by the late Robert Shaw. The cinematography is quite good considering the challenges the film crews faced filming out on the ocean. Even Bruce, the robotic shark that was built for the film, with all of his mechanical failures, is quite convincing in his scenes. One in particular is near the climatic ending where the shark breaks into the sinking ship, opens his mouth wide, threatening Chief Brody, and you see pieces of torn flesh and blood from his previous victim in his teeth! It still gets me, even today!The bottom line is, if you want to see a really entertaining summer film, definitely rent or buy this one!

When Cal finds his mother, that the brothers were led to believe was dead, and learns the truth about her, he begins to understand better why this might be. The sibling rivalry and parental relationships go back and forth for quite some time until it all reaches an unfortunate end.This is a pretty good old movie. However, it is an old movie, which means that by today's standards it's kind of silly.

And, of course, there's James Dean.I believe that James Dean was an excellent actor, and he was great in EAST OF EDEN, but maybe less so than usual. I consider this to be the weaker of his films. His performance seems to be a little bit forced at times. However, he still manages to come through strong as the tough, anti-social, but inwardly sweet Cal, and is funny as well as heart-wrenching. Seeing him try again and again for his father's attention but coming up short every time, and all of it destroying him, was enough to make me want to cry.

The Lost Boys was a fun teen horror\/comedy. Flatliners was a fairly entertaining supernatural chiller, but failed to disturb as much as it wanted to. Batman Forever was utter garbage, and quite a few others he made I don't wish to see. Still, I had heard that 8MM was a grim, disturbing movie. Anyone I know that's seen it always felt the same way about it in that respect, whether they loved it or hated it. Well, for me, grim and disturbing are terms that prove enticing, and I finally had to see this film. I was not only not let down, but found it to be a far more grim and disturbing (and GREAT) movie than I had expected. It starts off with the feel of almost any other detective\/cop-in-over-his-head movies that have been coming out left and right for quite some time. Nicholas Cage plays a private eye who, when away from his job, seems to be your everyman with a family. He is paid to check out whether an alleged snuff film was real or not, and what he discovers are not only terrifying realities around him, but also terrifying realities inside him. At the beginning, because I was used to the aforementioned types of big-budget thrillers that have become all too common even years after 8MM (which itself is easy to accidentally lump in along with the mediocrity if you haven't seen it), I quickly began to suspect that people found this disturbing because of its snuff depictions, but, even still, from that shaky start, I was fairly interested. What I didn't know was that this hard-hitting humdinger (as much of a horrifying journey of self-discovery as a suspense thriller) would slowly begin piling up the almost unbearable heaps of tension more and more throughout the film so heavily that, by the end, all bets were off and, as much as I loved it, I couldn't wait for this spellbinding and intense movie to relax its crushing grip. I found 8MM to be moving in ways both negative and positive, and, though its violent scenes certainly didn't shock me at all, how good and effective the movie was certainly did. Believe you me, this is not your typical taut thriller (as many critics are often paid to call mediocre movies). If this were even just up to the expectations I had, I probably would see it as too mediocre for review. But, thankfully, this was no average time-waster, as it is surprisingly an edge-of-the-seat masterpiece that I enjoyed much more than I thought I would. I would like to note furthermore that one shouldn't get the wrong idea about people into bondage when they watch this movie. Some people out there are sickos (and I'm sure that there are people all over the world and in this country who are very much like the hateful, smut-peddling killers in this film), but many bondage fans would consider this film (and the films that it is about) too negative. Regardless, this is a fine film, and is probably one of the few thrillers from the 1990s that I could honestly say I was thrilled by. If you like those dark, emotionally intense movies that touch upon the savage and base desires of the often fragile human psyche, I would seriously recommend this. It is an excellent film.

Also one of his most underrated.One of the oddest aspects is the tone of the film. Essentially we're watching a movie about a middle aged man who likes young girls. Yet the thing is continually being presented as a true romance story - the tears, girls rushing up stairs to fling themselves into the arms of their secret lover, that lush theme music (Lolita's theme it says in the credits and you can't help thinking of Lara's theme or Laura's theme or any of those other great love story heart wrenchers) James Mason being rejected (I want to walk 27 those steps to the car with me and spend your life, your everything with me) and staggering from the house in tears before heading off to challenge his rival in a life and death struggle.  But James Mason isn't Ryan O'Neil and Sue Lyons is a long way from Ali McGraw. It's lust for a child that we're being shown and this is a very odd way to show it.Of course, in the novel Humbert tells his own story and this is all his own self justifying view of what's going on, but the movie doesn't make that clear.Then there are the jokes. Camp Climax indeed! Nowadays jokes in a film about what is essentially child abuse are very very poor taste. But here we have all the nudging in the ribs jokes of a Carry On. She's going to have her cavity filled on Wednesday I'd like your cherry pieI look at you and go as limp as a noodle. Yes, I know the feeling.There are funny names galore. It even has slapstick schtick when Humbert and the porter try and put up the bed.  Honestly, you could cast Kenneth Williams as Humbert, Barbara Windsor as Lolita, Joan Sims as Charlotte and Sid James as Quilty and just about use the same script.And it's hardly fashionable any more to suggest that the child in this situation is anything but a victim. But Nabokov and Kubrick make it quite clear that Lolita is as much predator as prey. Humbert is used by her just as much as he uses her. She's a sort of proto-Laura Palmer. Most unsavoury by todays standards.Then half way through the whole thing mutates. What was a knockabout romp about perversion (!) turns into some sort of thriller road movie, with all the mechanics of secret meetings, strange cars silently following our heroes, paranoia over people chatting unheard to unseen drivers, weird warning phone calls in the night, kidnappings, hospital staff who know more than they'll say.By the end, when Humbert and Lolita meet for the final time so that Lo can use him dry one last time we're in romance territory - with Humbert like Mr Rochester, faced with a particularly selfish Jane Eyre.It's hardly Kubrick's most successful film. It doesn't really hang together and you get the feeling that Kibrick isn't quite in control of his story the way he was in (say) The Shining or Barry Lyndon.And let's be honest - it drags towards the end.

Any film based on an event that happened AGES and AGES ago will always be criticised for inaccuracy, wrong type of actors etc. and this one has been criticised by many for being glitched in some way or another. But I think that this Robin Hood film is one worth watching if only for the cast.I first saw this movie at the age of about 6 years old and always got too bored to watch to the end. When I first did, I was like 'OH WOW! That man has been stabbed!' To tell the truth, I was disappointed by the ending, just because it was Alan Rickman that was killed off and not Kevin Costner.I feel that this film could have tried a little harder to make Costner stick to one accent only and not switch between two like he does. It is quite annoying to hear posh-ish English phrases in an American accent or slang in a cross between English and American.I think that there is no doubt as to who steals the limelight in this film. Alan Rickman brings enjoyment to every scene he's in, storming round Nottingham castle saying things like Cancel kitchen scraps for lepers and orphans and call off Christmas! and screaming at an escaping Costner, LOXELY! I'm gonna cut your heart out with a spoon!Unfortunately for Costner, the only good scenes he has are the ones where he is fighting, galloping or getting shouted at by Rickman. I thought that he was a bit on the boring side apart from his flirty scenes with Mary E. Manstrantino (that isn't how you spell her name). Like I said at the start of the review, the cast is brilliant. Morgan Freeman adds a good bit of humour and 'wise words' to the film, Costner provides a hero and an icon, Mary (can't spell the surname) is a brilliant example of a sexy female icon who is a heartthrob for the lead character (his weakness)and Alan Rickman is an ace baddie who shows that he really is evil. The story-line and the filming and the editing could have had a bit more work but all in all, this is a brilliant film that is good for watching on those late Saturday nights.8\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"11 June 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERSLets be frank.

Some of it was, last night, inaudible to me. A lot like Sexy Beast was upon the first viewing. But I still felt the emotion of the film. It starts off with a bang. From the first moment, you're into it. There's some a great song that I don't know(I guess it's call  Mona Lisa). And the score, by the great Michael Kamen, is great.Bob Hoskins is absolutely fantastic. The film opens with a shot of the city, and the camera follows Hoskins down to his old home. The confrontation there is astonishing to watch. It's acting at its highest level.By the way. As uncool as it may be, I am a fan of a lot of 80's Genesis and Phil Collins songs. In Too Deep is a great song(Though the instrumentation could be a bit better), but does not belong where Jordan put it. I find it odd that he put it in there, but that is not enough from stopping this from being a great film. I won't discuss the plot at length, but the film deals with the relationship between Hoskins and Tyson(She is a hooker, he is her driver). Their relationship is intense and perplexing. The way the ending came about was absolutely shocking to me. But it's real and completely believable. No matter the outcome of everything, some relationship has been formed.Tyson is great, deserving of a nod. Michael Caine is also great in a small, but crucial role. Everyone else is simply ON in this film, but it belongs to Bob Hoskins. Hoskins is a great actor. Here, he gives his best performance to date. The Oscar should have been between him and Sean Penn for At Close Range. And I think Hoskins may have deserved it more. His performance is hilarious and heartbreaking. Brilliant work. This is one of Jordan's best films. P.S. Chris-132. I'm sorry, but the review you posted was forMona Lisa Smile. This is Mona Lisa. Two very different films.**** ","genre":null},{"date":"11 June 2004","score":"","review":"  It would be even better if I understood ALL of the dialogue. Some of it was, last night, inaudible to me.

I would consider Gosford Park to be one of those exceptions. It's a surprisingly well-mannered movie from Altman, less of the chaotic, improvised mess that so enamors the critics and annoys me, although as in almost every Altman movie I've seen it can be difficult to understand what people are saying sometimes (I always thought it was because he likes a lot of background noise in his movies, but Gosford is quiet and genteel so I think he just has a bad sound recordist (I thought it was just me until I saw another review here complaining about the same thing). But as I say, in spite of some murky sound this is nicely filmed (something about England apparently tames Altman's proclivity for the jittery camera and casual lighting) and quite reminiscent of Upstairs Downstairs, for those of you who were fans of that British series. While the PR people decided to market this as a murder mystery, the murder happens late in the proceedings and doesn't really have that much to do with the movie, so if you're looking for Agatha Christie you'll be disappointed. This is rather a look at the weird symbiotic relationship of servants and their employers. It's really more about the servants and how their lives go on; they know everything that goes on upstairs, while the upper class is fairly oblivious to pretty much everything.While the movie is a typical Altman ensemble piece, some performers stand out, most notably Maggie Smith, whose arrogant and intelligent grand dame is the most entertaining character of the bunch. Helen Mirren is also quite effective in a less flashy role. While it's a bit slow moving at times I quite enjoyed it, rating it 7\/10.
