I do not believe this at all. It's more likely that they are the ones who have not aged well. The first time I watched this film, I was a teenager, and it hit me like a ton of bricks speeding on a car at a thousand miles an hour.

No, there are not huge action pieces or excessively sharp dialogue or even a lot of big 'moments.' But it more than makes up for this with its atmosphere and acting.

Most I find to be basically the same story with a little different packaging. Having said that, I'd certainly rate High Noon as one of the best (probably THE best) western I've ever seen. More than that, I'd say it was one of the better movies I've ever seen in general, head and shoulders above most of the stuff being put out by Hollywood today. There's a real story here; a real moral dilemma; a real consideration of how people respond to challenging circumstances. And there's Gary Cooper - who offered a truly brilliant performance. At its most basic level, the story is simple. Cooper is Marshall Kane. It's his retirement day and his wedding day, all in one. He's marrying a pacifist Quaker (played by Grace Kelly) and he's handing in his badge as they prepare to head off into a new life. Unfortunately, just as they marry news arrives that a vicious killer named Miller whom Kane put in prison years before has been released and is on his way to town on the 12 noon train to take his revenge. Kane is faced with a dilemma - stay and face Miller and his gang, or ride off into the sunset with his beautiful young wife. Needless to say, Kane stays.But the movie isn't about a gunfight - although the gunfight that eventually comes (and which takes up only the last few minutes of the film) is a pretty good one. It's really a deeply reflective movie that addresses a lot of issues and questions. Why is Kane doing this? Why does he feel the need? Will the citizenry support him? Why or why not?To be blunt, I wasn't entirely convinced of Kane's nobility. I was actually somewhat nodding in agreement when one man in town made the point that if Kane would just leave there would probably be no trouble when Miller showed up, since Miller was coming to take revenge on Kane. In one sense, that's true. On the other hand, the point was made that under Kane the town had become safe for women and children, suggesting that perhaps with Miller back and Kane gone, the town would go back to what it was. So, although Kane is clearly the heroic and noble figure in this, I appreciated the willingness to at least raise those questions about why he felt the need to stay. Was he willing to sacrifice the lives of the townspeople for some personal cause that they had little if any involvement in? But the bulk of the ethical storyline was the response of the townsfolk. Would they fight with Kane or not? The answer was a resounding no. Only one man in town lined up with Kane (even his deputy quit on him) and that one man backed down when he discovered that no one else would stand with Kane. Was this cowardice or was it common sense? Certainly, the men of the town were afraid - who wouldn't be in the circumstances - but fear isn't necessarily cowardice. Sometimes fear is logical. This certainly looked like a suicide mission Kane was going to lead. How many of us would really sacrifice ourselves for a lost cause and leave behind our wives and children in the service of a cause that may not even have been necessary? This seemed to be a personal dispute between Kane and Miller. I found it easy to put myself in the place of the townsmen and, frankly, I don't think I would have been any more anxious to stand with Kane as any of them were. I think the movie provided an honest portrayal of human nature, and a serious consideration of when it might or might not be appropriate to make a sacrifice.This is a simple movie; a short movie. It's a little less than an hour and a half (filmed basically in real time) - but it packs a real punch. It's thought provoking, as opposed to your standard, formulaic western of the time. I loved the moral dilemma it portrayed and what I thought were the realistic reactions of the townspeople to the situation. I loved the theme. Do Not Forsake Me, O My Darlin, sung by Tex Ritter. It was so perfect and its application gradually shifted. As the movie opened, it was as if the words were a reflection on Kelly's Amy wanting Kane to simply leave town with her rather than facing and being a part of the violence that she abhorred, and possibly leaving her as a widow. Gradually, though (as the words of the song kept coming up hauntingly throughout) it obviously became a reflection of Kane's thoughts about the townspeople who were forsaking the marshal who had cared for them and kept them safe for so many years.John Wayne apparently didn't care for the film. He called it un- American (I assume because it portrayed most of the townsfolk as unwilling to fight) and in later years said that he wished he had been given the part of Kane so that he could have made it like one of his own westerns. I'm glad he didn't get the part. High Noon worked brilliantly as it was. The only thing that really threw me off was the age difference between Cooper and Kelly - and, yes, I know that Cooper and Kelly had a real-life affair while this was being filmed, and that Kelly often partnered (in movies and in life) with older men. Still, for whatever reason it bothered me. There was a certain creepiness factor watching Cooper kiss her. That's just me. Overall - the movie was brilliant.

The film is one of thrills but done in a way where it is all in the dialogue and the body language of the 12 men set up to decide the fate of a young man who is on trial for the murder of his father. The movie also explores the 12 men's lives and also any prejudices they hold against the young man on trial, different perspectives are had throughout the movie not just on the murder itself but also on the man's back story as a child and how his father brought him up. A masterpiece simply in the way that it entices the viewer so that your focus is never lost and draws you in as you explore the case in one room with one table and 12 chairs.It can't be easy to create something so astounding from 90 odd minutes of people sat in a room talking, but this achieves it and achieves it pretty fast too, it doesn't take long before you're drawn in yourself and want to know more. Sidney Lumet directs and does a fine job, he is the person really responsible for making this feel so damn well exciting I guess and combined with Reginald Rose's story and script it makes it so much more of a classic. Lumet gets the very best out of his actors and really pulls the strings, even little things like when the men move around the room; it makes what they are saying that little bit better.Henry Fonda as juror number 8 really leads the cast, after all his character is the one who at first wants to talk about the case and debate it when everyone else thinks the kid should fry. Fonda is absolutely brilliant in his role; his calm demeanour mixed with his impassioned speeches on the case make his character one of the true good guys of cinema. Lee J. Cobb's character stands out a lot because of his overall anger at the boy involved in the case, Juror number 3 who Cobb plays is one of the stand outs because of his behaviour during the debating being done. Each juror is different, from the angry to the very meek, the guy who wants to get out of the place for a baseball game to the guy who grew up in a slum just like the young man on trial did. They each bring not only different personalities but back stories too with some loud mouths and some quiet and really indifferent to the case and that together is another reason why this is flawless cinema.12 Angry Men deserves its place in the classics of cinema, not just for its acting or its directing etc but mostly because it's a story that all can enjoy and I think most who watch this can say they at least wanted to see how it ends. As said before it cannot be easy to create something like this, all in the same room and not make the audience bored by it all, but it has enough great things in it to make it more than just a good or great film, it's pretty much perfect. Another thing that this film does which is fantastic is you start to visualize the case at hand, I mean sure you listen to the jurors talk but sometimes it makes you start imagining all the things going on that the case entails, from the murder, the train and to the old man's story, the film never fails to bring new things up and shake the case about a little.

He has three wives, and is looking for a fourth. We see his wealth not in his stature or his speech, but in the architecture of the immense dwelling that can afford to house all four of them, like separate families. His face is never truly revealed, always turned away from the camera, in wide shot, behind a veil, or entirely off-screen (I am reminded of a similar treatment to the cheating spouses in In the Mood for Love), and this draws our focus towards the demure Songlian, and seems to suggest that these marriages are less emotional bonds between two people than means for furthering the family lineage. Indeed, the sexual servitude is so accepted that it is never necessary to portray it on-screen, and it has become a ritual or sorts, a competition between the concubines. The first is elderly and has already given the household its eldest son, and her dwelling has probably not been lit by the red lanterns for years, but she still commands respect. The second is waning, and seemingly welcomes Songlian with warm smiles and embraces, but yearns once more for the lanterns. And the third is still beautiful, but nearing middle age, and does not hold the same attraction as the younger, newer bride. Her room is adorned with large Peking opera masks, but what once entranced the master now annoys him. She has become the rooster at daybreak, eager to disrupt the consummation of the marriage. There is an air of importance over the family tradition. Whenever the master has made his choice, it is loudly announced, and the wives stand at each respective pathway to their own house as they watch the lanterns be lit (the first is never seen in these stare-downs, because she knows she does not even offer the massages of the second). The lanterns become a currency to garner favour and control of the household; the ability to pick the menu, and the chance to be impregnated, which is slowly revealed to be a vicious battle. When the second is forced to give a massage to Songlian, the third has a venom behind the sweet prodding smile. It is even pervasive enough to spill into the lives of a servant girl, not ugly looking, and favoured by the master, but ultimately of plain birth and unworthy. Songlian is at first nervous and intimidated, but she too learns to accept her life, and becomes furious at the invasive way that Yan'er has corrupted the lantern ritual. But she too is guilty of sin. A seemingly mundane task is made sinister as her lanterns are extinguished (and her the sound effect of the air being blown into the pipe is heightened considerably for dramatic quality) and black covers placed over them, for a seasons long punishment. Zhang Yimou imbues the film with an awareness of tradition. The first of these is the culture of gossip and scrutiny of others. Again and again we return to the same overhead shot of the central courtyard area, and servants mill around at sounds and cries of disturbance, and take it upon themselves to chastise their fellows who step out of line, and punish with severe consequence, all in the name of tradition. Another is the expectation of childbirth and sustenance of the family line, and the preference of male children over female, and how this sparks fire between the wives, and subdues the first, who is much past childbearing age. There is also much consideration to the visuals and the composition. Yimou does not seem to map out any distinct boundaries of the household, but there is no need, because the wives feel bound to their expected service over time. At first, Songlian seems to wander, curious of her new life, but only seems to bump into newer horrors. Later, she barely leaves her room, and orders food to be delivered to her. When the lanterns are lit, the colour red is intoxicating, and bathes the entire frame in a ominous glow. The first consummation, shot through a red veil, obscures the sexual act itself, and portrays it as a task that has been completed, rather than something born of passion and attraction. As the third wife sings alone on the worn grey rooftops, she is dressed in a red robe, and there is pain and longing in every syllable, but she does not wish to reveal this to Songlian, and quickly stuffs the robe away and ceases her tune, leaving the scene quiet and dull, and suffocating. Seasons pass, and one year, and a birthday, creeps up on Songlian. A maid, having being confronted with the harsh unfairness of the common class, is forced by her pride to her death. This is perhaps what keeps Songlian from complete submission into this life; she feels guilt for Yan'er's decision, and the demise of the third wife, who has committed an even bigger sin that cannot be remedied with merely covering the lanterns. As she approaches the forbidden highest room, the music grows tense, and the camera is shaky, nervous, before a cut places us far away from the discovery, framed much like the first sighting of this room. The air is silent, save for her hysterical cries of accusation, which do little in the face of tradition. The cycle continues, and a fifth wife is brought in.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"5 December 2015","score":"","review":" Don't cut yourself, from this movie. This movie worth, being connection to. Written & Directed by Tim Burton with help from screenwriter Caroline Thompson, this nostalgia romantic fairy tale hybrid is an American Masterpiece. Without a doubt, Burton's best movie, so far. The film tells the story of an unfinished artificial man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who has scissors for hands. Abandoned by his creator, a lonely inventor (Vincent Price, in what was his final film appearance); Edward is taken in by a blind optimism saleswoman, Peg Boggs (Dianne West), and her suburban family after she discovers him, alone in the ruins of a once great laboratory. Peg tries really hard to get Edward to fit in, with society by showing his talents for yard decoration, pet grooming and eventually hairstyling. However, there are those, within the community, who doesn't like Edward, because of his indifferent, yet innocent kindness. Driven by envy, jealousy and hate, they try to cast out, Edward, out of the town. Can Edward win the hearts & mind of the people, or will the people slowing turn against him, due to his monstrous appearance and his mysterious, yet frightening past? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, I love the mixer of Victorian Era Style Gothic Horror with that of the 1960s Americana Style of Comedy. It made for a very unique watch. The movie had some really wonderful set pieces. Some of them, remind me of the old German Expressionism set pieces of the silent era. The movie also had some of the best make up, I have ever witness. Great work from make-up artist legend, Stan Winston. Another beautiful thing from the film is the music by Danny Elfman. It was so enchanting to hear. I can still hear, it's haunting, but memorizing tune. It's also nice to see, that this film, started the long collaborate between Tim Burton & that of character actor, Johnny Depp. This movie indeed, shows, how good, a character actor like Johnny Depp would later become. Great acting from him. This movie also, felt like one of the last, charming performances of Winona Ryder, before she fell into mediocrity, in my opinion. She had great chemistry with Johnny Depp in this film. Supporting actors like Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, and Alan Arkin also add to the wow-factor of the film. Even, Anthony Michael Hall made a huge impact. It was so weird, seeing him, morph from a skinny-nerdy guy in his earlier films into a tough-looking bad guy here. Despite all, the praise, I gave the movie, I'm also willing to state out, that this movie does some flaws. Some of the biggest ones, come from the weak logistics of the story. It's full of jarring plot-holes, bad exposition and daydreaming direction. Some of the biggest examples are what were the reasons, why Edward was even given, scissors for hands? Another is whatever, happened to the body of Edward's so call, father? Last one, is the most jarring. Where does he get the ice to make snow in the first place? How can we even comprehend this!? The movie never answer those questions and some more. However, in my opinion, it doesn't really need to, since it's a fantasy film, and people should take it, in face-value, but I understand, if they don't. The story does seem a bit uncompleted. Another problem that people have, against the film is that it seem like it ripping off, author Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. In my view, I see the movie more like a homage to Frankenstein than a rip-off. Like Frankenstein's creature, Edward, is born virtuous. Full of tabula rasa in the beginning, it's only, when he sees the ugliness of the people, through their intolerance, that he began to withdrawn himself, from such an ignorant society. I can understand, why certain people might hate the ending to this film, since it was indeed depressing, but in my thoughts. I saw that movie tragic ending, does works within the confine of the story. Changing the ending would had, a lesser impact on its audiences. They was no other way to end the film. There is an obvious purpose on why the suburban houses look nearly identical, oversize and full of bright colors. It's to show, that despite, the majority of Americans saying, they're for a melting pot, there are still somethings; they're unwilling to accept. It's a satire joke, well played by the director.

","genre":null},{"date":"5 December 2015","score":"","review":" Don't cut yourself, from this movie. This movie worth, being connection to. Written & Directed by Tim Burton with help from screenwriter Caroline Thompson, this nostalgia romantic fairy tale hybrid is an American Masterpiece. Without a doubt, Burton's best movie, so far. The film tells the story of an unfinished artificial man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who has scissors for hands. Abandoned by his creator, a lonely inventor (Vincent Price, in what was his final film appearance); Edward is taken in by a blind optimism saleswoman, Peg Boggs (Dianne West), and her suburban family after she discovers him, alone in the ruins of a once great laboratory. Peg tries really hard to get Edward to fit in, with society by showing his talents for yard decoration, pet grooming and eventually hairstyling. However, there are those, within the community, who doesn't like Edward, because of his indifferent, yet innocent kindness. Driven by envy, jealousy and hate, they try to cast out, Edward, out of the town. Can Edward win the hearts & mind of the people, or will the people slowing turn against him, due to his monstrous appearance and his mysterious, yet frightening past? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, I love the mixer of Victorian Era Style Gothic Horror with that of the 1960s Americana Style of Comedy. It made for a very unique watch. The movie had some really wonderful set pieces. Some of them, remind me of the old German Expressionism set pieces of the silent era. The movie also had some of the best make up, I have ever witness. Great work from make-up artist legend, Stan Winston. Another beautiful thing from the film is the music by Danny Elfman. It was so enchanting to hear. I can still hear, it's haunting, but memorizing tune. It's also nice to see, that this film, started the long collaborate between Tim Burton & that of character actor, Johnny Depp. This movie indeed, shows, how good, a character actor like Johnny Depp would later become. Great acting from him. This movie also, felt like one of the last, charming performances of Winona Ryder, before she fell into mediocrity, in my opinion. She had great chemistry with Johnny Depp in this film. Supporting actors like Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, and Alan Arkin also add to the wow-factor of the film. Even, Anthony Michael Hall made a huge impact. It was so weird, seeing him, morph from a skinny-nerdy guy in his earlier films into a tough-looking bad guy here. Despite all, the praise, I gave the movie, I'm also willing to state out, that this movie does some flaws. Some of the biggest ones, come from the weak logistics of the story. It's full of jarring plot-holes, bad exposition and daydreaming direction. Some of the biggest examples are what were the reasons, why Edward was even given, scissors for hands? Another is whatever, happened to the body of Edward's so call, father? Last one, is the most jarring. Where does he get the ice to make snow in the first place? How can we even comprehend this!? The movie never answer those questions and some more. However, in my opinion, it doesn't really need to, since it's a fantasy film, and people should take it, in face-value, but I understand, if they don't. The story does seem a bit uncompleted. Another problem that people have, against the film is that it seem like it ripping off, author Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. In my view, I see the movie more like a homage to Frankenstein than a rip-off. Like Frankenstein's creature, Edward, is born virtuous. Full of tabula rasa in the beginning, it's only, when he sees the ugliness of the people, through their intolerance, that he began to withdrawn himself, from such an ignorant society. I can understand, why certain people might hate the ending to this film, since it was indeed depressing, but in my thoughts. I saw that movie tragic ending, does works within the confine of the story. Changing the ending would had, a lesser impact on its audiences. They was no other way to end the film. There is an obvious purpose on why the suburban houses look nearly identical, oversize and full of bright colors. It's to show, that despite, the majority of Americans saying, they're for a melting pot, there are still somethings; they're unwilling to accept. It's a satire joke, well played by the director.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"5 December 2015","score":"","review":" I know that this film is very well known, but I don't believe that it is generally given due credit for its accomplishments, which are myriad. Despite the surprisingly low budget for the production, director Vincenzo Natali succeeds at crafting a very taut, interesting, and extremely well-paced thriller with very fleshed out characters, a rarity in the science fiction horror genre. Throughout the film's 80 minute runtime, not only is the audience able to observe the very well-designed, claustrophobic and surreal sets progress seemingly into infinity, but also the excellent dialogue between the characters further develop them as very believable people. While this film is replete with the usual scares and thrilling set pieces for which this genre is known, it goes the extra mile by remaining totally unpredictable on a story level throughout. From the beginning to final sequence, no character's motivations, backstory, or final outcome are known for certain. With the claustrophobic atmosphere and very good acting from all around, Natali invites the audience to dive deep into the depths of human suspicion, paranoia, and ultimate decline when placed in unconquerable situations. However, while this is a significant part of the film, what truly put Cube over the top for me was its surprising subtext regarding not only the typical topics encountered in science fiction horror fare, but also a far more broad and relatable human message of the struggle to maintain some sense of being and purpose in the face of purposelessness. Perhaps I am reading too deeply into this by making these claims, but I feel that the titular Cube may represent life as a whole; a series of seemingly pointless choices and pitfalls in the form of a puzzle. Only by perseverance through even the darkest depths of human psychology can anyone hope to escape the labyrinth and achieve transcendence. The film's ending, though I won't spoil it, gives new meaning to this message, and leaves much food for thought. Despite all of this praise, I can't quite bring myself to give this film a 10. There are a few very clichéd moments in the film, near the beginning especially, and only around the 25 minute mark does it really begin to feel like something entirely original. However, once it does, it becomes an immersive and potent piece of science fiction.

In an era full of horror movies fronted by broad, almost comic villains, and audiences preferences leaning towards bland American slashers, Hellraiser took a stance as a serious piece of work - rich in atmosphere, disturbing in tone and visually arresting - the foundations on which horror classics are built.Contrary to popular belief (and his over-exposure in the - currently - 8 sequels), Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his entourage of grotesque Cenobites remain in the background for the majority of the first instalment. The plot instead focuses the grisly fate and gradual re- birth of thrill-seeking scumbag Frank (Sean Chapman), who, in seeking the ultimate sexual enlightenment, purchases a mysterious puzzle box from a Chinese man which opens the gates of Hell when solved. Frank manages to do so, and is impaled by hooks and dragged into a world of torture, mutilation and degradation. Some time later, Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his second wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into the home previously inhabited by Frank. While moving furniture, Larry cuts his hand on a protruding nail, inadvertently bringing Frank back from Hell and igniting his gruesome re-birth.The plot treads carefully between being mysterious and plain confusing. There are no attempts made to explain just why Larry's blood brings Frank back into the real world and what exactly Frank was hoping to achieve by experiencing Hell, but these small details become insignificant in the wake of such visual splendour and immersing atmosphere. It can also be forgiven for some soap-opera dramatics as Julia's previous infidelity with Frank is exposed, and her manipulation into bringing Frank bodies to feed on while her suspicious step-daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) keep her a watchful eye. Hellraiser employs a slow, careful build-up, so when the true horror springs into life near the end and the Cenobites rear their ugly heads, it is all the more effective for it.Now a fully-fledge horror icon, Pinhead and his cronies are a strange manifestation of deformed monsters and bondage fetishism. They arrive with skin pinned back in various abominable positions, parts of their face and torso pierced with all manners of tools and devices, and all twisted beyond the point of no return by their experiences searching for the ultimate pleasures of the flesh. Part BDSM nightmare and part body horror, Hellraiser's climax is still one of the most disturbing things ever filmed without being particularly scary. Despite its narrative flaws and wobbly plot explanations, Clive Barker's film stands out as one of the finest of its era, spinning a complex and dark mythology around a low-key plot, with the uncanny ability to creep under your skin and stay there for a significant amount of time afterwards.

I'd argue that Rocky defined a story in its own right, because many sports (and many non-sports) movies since have followed its formula. With the possible exception of The Godfather, I doubt so many movies have been spawned by a winning formula. But Rocky is the original and by far the best, set aside by Sylvester Stallone's winning performance and John Avildsen's direction.For many reasons, Stallone will always be intricately linked with Rocky Balboa, but the reason I consider the most important is because his rise in Hollywood is synonymous with Rocky's own. He was a street tough with a dream (Hollywood career\/boxing career) but resorted to less than glamorous work (porn\/breaking thumbs for loan sharks). He absolutely lives the role of Rocky - he's charming, a bit thuggish and he absolutely wears his heart on his sleeve. You couldn't teach the best actors alive to replicate Stallone's shyness or awkward touching the wall when he tries to flirt with Adrian. When rejected by others, you can see the hurt written plainly across his face. Rocky is so afraid of rejection, he asks out Adrian and then never gives her a chance to say no because he nervously fills the silence with rambling.Rocky's relationship with Adrian (Tahlia Shire, who is more incredible than she ever was in The Godfather series) is one of my favourite put to film. Both are so shy but show it in very different ways. They have a connection but it takes her a third of a movie to even have a conversation with him. Watching their romance blossom throughout Rocky is almost more rewarding than watching him go toe-to-toe with Creed in the ring. When the credits rolled, I felt like I'd made two new friends - that is how invested I was in their romance. Burgess Meredith and Burt Young both crop up as supporting players in Rocky's life, and both deliver solid performances. The film belongs absolutely to Stallone and Shire, and we miss them when they're not on screen.Rather than creating a villainous braggart like the opponents in Southpaw and even Million Dollar Baby, Stallone pens an opponent whose adversity comes from his stark contrast to Rocky himself. Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed is exceptionally articulate and reeking of confidence, the two areas that are Rocky's greatest weaknesses. Combine that with the huge scale of the fight and we as an audience can be severely intimidated by the ordeal Rocky is about to undertake. We feel Rocky's tearful apprehension the night before, and watching Rocky knock Creed down makes us want to cheer in triumph.Avildsen's direction is assured and he does a masterful job guiding our emotions throughout the film. The film's glorious music builds in triumphant excitement as Rocky's fitness increases - quiet piano as he gasps and pants his way up the stairs through to brazen trumpets as he bounds effortlessly up in the film's most iconic scene. He keys sad music whenever the moment calls for it - most notably a beautiful scene where Rocky is yelled at for just trying to help out a little girl. Its always hard to decide when to give credit to Stallone's screenplay or to Avildsen's direction, so I'll just praise them both. Each character is so well written and all of the dialogue feels completely natural. People say Rocky should be enjoyed without looking at it too much, but I disagree - I think Rocky is deeper and more thoughtful than many give it credit.A deserving Best Picture winner, Rocky embodies exactly what the Academy should recognise culturally significant movies that explode and change cinema forever.

","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"5 December 2015","score":"","review":" They say there are only seven stories in existence, and every movie therefore must fit one of those stories. I'd argue that Rocky defined a story in its own right, because many sports (and many non-sports) movies since have followed its formula. With the possible exception of The Godfather, I doubt so many movies have been spawned by a winning formula. But Rocky is the original and by far the best, set aside by Sylvester Stallone's winning performance and John Avildsen's direction.For many reasons, Stallone will always be intricately linked with Rocky Balboa, but the reason I consider the most important is because his rise in Hollywood is synonymous with Rocky's own. He was a street tough with a dream (Hollywood career\/boxing career) but resorted to less than glamorous work (porn\/breaking thumbs for loan sharks). He absolutely lives the role of Rocky - he's charming, a bit thuggish and he absolutely wears his heart on his sleeve. You couldn't teach the best actors alive to replicate Stallone's shyness or awkward touching the wall when he tries to flirt with Adrian. When rejected by others, you can see the hurt written plainly across his face. Rocky is so afraid of rejection, he asks out Adrian and then never gives her a chance to say no because he nervously fills the silence with rambling.Rocky's relationship with Adrian (Tahlia Shire, who is more incredible than she ever was in The Godfather series) is one of my favourite put to film. Both are so shy but show it in very different ways. They have a connection but it takes her a third of a movie to even have a conversation with him. Watching their romance blossom throughout Rocky is almost more rewarding than watching him go toe-to-toe with Creed in the ring. When the credits rolled, I felt like I'd made two new friends - that is how invested I was in their romance. Burgess Meredith and Burt Young both crop up as supporting players in Rocky's life, and both deliver solid performances. The film belongs absolutely to Stallone and Shire, and we miss them when they're not on screen.Rather than creating a villainous braggart like the opponents in Southpaw and even Million Dollar Baby, Stallone pens an opponent whose adversity comes from his stark contrast to Rocky himself. Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed is exceptionally articulate and reeking of confidence, the two areas that are Rocky's greatest weaknesses. Combine that with the huge scale of the fight and we as an audience can be severely intimidated by the ordeal Rocky is about to undertake. We feel Rocky's tearful apprehension the night before, and watching Rocky knock Creed down makes us want to cheer in triumph.Avildsen's direction is assured and he does a masterful job guiding our emotions throughout the film. The film's glorious music builds in triumphant excitement as Rocky's fitness increases - quiet piano as he gasps and pants his way up the stairs through to brazen trumpets as he bounds effortlessly up in the film's most iconic scene. He keys sad music whenever the moment calls for it - most notably a beautiful scene where Rocky is yelled at for just trying to help out a little girl. Its always hard to decide when to give credit to Stallone's screenplay or to Avildsen's direction, so I'll just praise them both. Each character is so well written and all of the dialogue feels completely natural.

Its gargantuan cult reputation is very well deserved, because, simply put, their is nothing else like it, not even in the rest of John Waters' oeuvre. Such a strangely entertaining and cartoonish film has never been made before or since. Waters seemed to somehow pull together the perfect cast for all of his persistently odd roles, a cadre of characters all willing to indulge in sexual perversities, tastelessness, bestiality, and the consumption of various human waste products. The low-grade film stock, the strange long takes punctuated only by zoom-ins, the weird overacting by everyone in the cast, and the disturbing montages set to classic oldies music all works together to become an entirely new film experience. I can't say that it's one that I fully understand, or even that I would like to see another film like it, but I can't deny that this film is truly delightful. Every scene pulsates with anarchical glee, the costume and makeup exudes cartoonish brilliance in every shot, and of course their is the unforgettably divine Divine, otherwise known as Glenn Milstead. His (her?) sheer energy and magnetism in every scene elevates the film immeasurably; no wonder he was Waters' muse. Replete with obvious line flubs, clear awkwardness during certain scenes, and shots which should probably have had a few seconds trimmed, this is certainly a trash masterpiece, the diametric opposite of high art, and Waters' crowning achievement as a filmmaker. Were this to be made by any filmmaker other than the supremely strange Waters, it most likely would have fallen flat on its face. No other auteur has ever been in the motion picture business who so well understands the value of utter garbage, and so revels in all that is dirty and depraved in the world. This film demands that the audience bask in the glory of trash as entertainment, and that we live, breath, and worship refuse. While I cannot say that I agree, or that I will partake in these activities anytime soon, it somehow manages to make it enticing. Pink Flamingos is the crowning achievement of waste throughout all of mankind's existence. The only reason that it gets a 9 and not a 10 from me is that there were several instances where the depravity did begin to sicken me rather than entice, though these were rectified shortly afterwards. Also, I think that if I gave it a 10 I might go to hell.

Taking place exactly one year after the events of the first film, John McClane is awaiting for his wife Holly (played by Bonnie Bedelia again) at the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C to spend another great Christmas with her. His plans quickly go bad once again when a group of international terrorists led by Colonel Stuart (played by William Sadler) began seizing control of the airport and taking countless innocent civilians hostage. To make matters worse, the terrorists began taking control of the air traffic control, causing runway lights to shut off and inference in traffic signals. With planes full of innocent lives (including his wife) running low on fuel and unable to land safely, McClane must once again use his incredible skills to take down the merciless terrorists and the save the lives of the passengers along with his wife, once for all. With John McTiernan returning as the director, this movie comes as a decent continuation to the franchise; with some exciting action scenes and well-drawn characters and performances. However, this film fell slightly short of the formula that made the first film a smash hit. The main villain Colonel is not quite as memorable as Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman in the previous film. While William Sadler gives a great performance, his character doesn't have the same charisma as Gruber. On the other hands, the action scenes are a bit exciting and well shot, especially the intense fight scene that takes place on the wing of the plane towards the end. Most of the action takes place outside in the snow and blistering cold winds. Then there is John McClane who still remains fresh as ever and is energized with a strong performance by Bruce Willis. Lastly, the plot works pretty well, although there some inconsistencies here and there.

All you movie-fans already know the story, and I just want to share my profits of It. The unique mind of a shoot that Spielberg holds, make him one of the greatest in my opinion. (OK, the whole team behind him should be applauded too, for getting this together.) It still stands out, as 40 year old piece of film, and matures continuously like a fine wine. Still watching It from time to time, one can always find new angles to enjoy. Born this summer, I never saw it fresh, of course. But I can imagine the hype it represented 1975. Nevermind the fake shark's failures, or the sometimes deficient facts of the script, the luck of the casting is what really stands out. Without the grumpy Robert Shaw it would have been a complete different movie. Without Richard Dreyfuss as the logical, sensitive marine Biologist it would not be the same, too. Roy Schreider's sheriff of the Amity Island struggles with both family and the city community for keeping the people out of water. You can easily find extracts of yourself in all of the three men Stubborness, fear, insecurity, resignation and anger. That is why I like this movie so much. Watch it with Brody's eyes, next time with Quint's. The other next time with Hooper's. And another time with the Mayor's? Just never, ever buy the fact of some kind of a smart shark. Because it will ruin the experience of this classic sea-thriller.

Timothy Olyphant is one of the ones who sorta made it, and he shows the personality to do so here, where he plays a rather confident and down-to-earth gay man. Zach Braff is particularly interesting...one of the one's who has been quite successful; here he plays a blonde gay man who is a bit on the shallow side. Dean Cain, who found his place as a successful television movie actor plays the hunk of the group; I always thought he should have been more successful. Andrew Keegan probably was the most talented (at least in this film), and while he isn't a household name, he's had a decent career; here he plays a not-out man. Billy Porter does nicely as the requisite Black character; he's been more successful on Broadway than flicks or TV.

As it is, its okay, but it misses the mark in several ways. He interviews people that you could meet at the mall or a flea market, no one important really. Maybe someone of import was at an industry party - where the producer would never be invited. I doubt he meets Courtney Love at all, she seems to be against this. There is NO music (so far) by Nirvana, or even Kurt (save some stuff he recorded at like 2 & 15 years old at his aunt's house). A doc about Kurt with no music by Kurt? Oh well. Even the band the producer goes to see who supposedly were influenced by Nirvana sounded like Misfits! Oh no.Also, he interviews some people who you think might have something important to say - but then, he can't put what they said in the film! What?! He sights British law issues (as he films for the BBC, or says he does) for some of the prohibition and for others he just leaves things out! Like the music. If this doesn't turn around considerably, I'd have to say miss this. If I ever do finish watching this and it turns into something good, I'll let you know. Although without any music by Kurt or Courtney, I seriously doubt it. * (of 5) at the half.Well, I saw the rest of the film. So the whole second half is pretty basic. He re-interviews Kurt's aunt and there's a guy who may have been hired to do something to Kurt, but (surprise!) his accusations couldn't be added to the film due to British libel laws. Oh well. He out accuses Courtney's dad of being a rotten father when its obvious that the man had been to hell and back with the woman. His main concern at that time was his granddaughter, and that she have a safe environment to grow up in. The doc's producer tells us he doesn't believe the conspiracies - that Love had anything to do with Cobain's death. Take that for what its worth. Given this, the later scene at an ACLU dinner doesn't make much sense. Courtney is shown to be capable of anything - the nanny that worked for the couple in Kurt's final weeks was obviously scared to say much on camera. He plays some tape of Courtney threatening the author of a tell all book, and its not a soft or veiled threat. This all culminates at the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) awards dinner where Love is a presenter and speaker. Before she takes the stage, the extreme celebrity stalker, who had been in a scene earlier in the film saying he'd do anything to show Courtney's true colors - that he'd walk right up to her and ask if she killed Kurt or something, is at the ACLU function. He gets Love right on camera with the mic in her face! So this extreme stalker - who's partner in that early scene wouldn't even appear on camera without a mask! they are crazy guys - finally asks her a question for the producer of the film. Is it, did you have anything to do with your husband's death? Is it, did you threaten and\/or assault journalists and writers? NO! He asks about a song he overheard when they went to her studio (where he was supposed to confront her and didn't!) and if she has any new members in her band! Extreme! Finally, the producer of the documentary, actually shows some real balls! After Courtney speaks, he gets on stage and basically calls the ACLU members gathered that they are hypocrites because they have a speaker who gives a speech about the importance of freedom of the press, while having intimidated, threatened and assaulted that very same press for writing and saying things about her that she didn't like. He does actually ask Love a question, and her answer is interesting. At the very end we DO get an original song.
