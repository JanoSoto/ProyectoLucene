And I have to say, Robert Wise really redeemed himself on this. While I thought the original version was good, this version is SOOOOOO much better. Its a shame that the commentary seems to have been wrote down and recorded separately instead of together as it seemed informative but was a tad boring.

But that's what it's supposed to be! Do you actually think that Ben thought this would win an Oscar? Hell no! His intention was to make people laugh and he succeeded! This movie is hilarious! I laughed all the way through and I was crying I was laughing so hard. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson were great in their roles as totally clueless male models. I loved how they acted so stupid. I also loved how they acted like they hated each other because Hansel (Wilson) had become famous and stole Derek's (Stiller) popularity. It was cute to see them walk past each other and give dirty looks. And the walk off scene was so funny. How could you not laugh?  What made those scenes even more funny was that Stiller and Wilson are really friends and they're trying to act like they hate each other. That's some funny stuff!  Will Ferrell was his usual funny, talented, and absolutely great self. He's one of my favorite Saturday Night Live alumnis. He seems to make every role he plays funnier than he's actually supposed to be. He's awesome. Ben's wife Christine Taylor was also great as Matilda and his father Jerry Stiller brought much humor to his role as well. This movie is stupid, yes, but it is definitely not the worst film ever made. It had some great hilarious scenes and Derek and Hansel's stupidity was the funniest bit of the movie.

I loved 'The Breakfast Club,' and think all the young actors are great, but what that film and others were missing, was realism and a convincingly charming leading actor, in this case Andrew McCarthy as Blane. I think Molly Ringwald (Andie) and Jon Cryer (Duckie!!) are amazing, but what makes the character of Blane so special is those beautiful, blue eyes and his amazingly nice persona, even though his friends are snobbish and arrogant.
