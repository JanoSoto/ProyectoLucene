[{"date":"23 May 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Ravenous is as fun as a movie can get for me. Honestly, this is not a movie for everybody. Not because of it's violence or subject matter, but because of its execution. Ravenous is as unconventional as any film gets.It's not an avant garde film by any means, but it doesn't take itself as seriously as it could or as much as most people would like it to. I think this is where the film excels and makes it such a rare gem.If you're tired of the same ol'thing check out Ravenous. The music by Damon Albarn (blur and Gorillaz) and Micheal Nyman is bizarre and appropriate. It makes the film light hearted where otherwise it would be an intense thriller. Though the music also plays on the intensity.The characters are unique and the performances are solid. It's a supernatural thriller with a demented sense of humor which for me made the film interesting, for others I can see why they wouldn't like it. But it's cannibalism...it's a disgusting thing, the best way to treat it is with some dark humor and imagination. This film would have been standard and boring had it been a linear tale of good versus evil. Instead we get confused and confusing characters you can never fully relate to, but enjoy watching.Bottom line, if you're looking for something unconventional and want to grin from ear to ear, check it out. It's brutal, comical and above all entertaining. Does it deserve the 10 out of ten rating I'm giving it? Probably not, but time after time I watch this movie and have a lot of fun and appreciate its unique nature.
