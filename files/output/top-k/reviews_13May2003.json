I had no problem with that, except for the way Mel Gibson said it.  It was like Oh, here's a word I've never used before.  I'm not quite sure if I like it too much.  I mean, it was supposed to be said casually, like if Nick had used it all of his life.  Catch my drift? Secondly, I really don't see the significance of the character Lola in the movie.  She didn't really seem to be that important in the story at all. In fact, it would have been much better without her in it.  At all.  You'll find my reasons for saying this later on. Third, I don't think that this movie really gave Mel Gibson a chance to drive in that he was really stuck up and self-centered.  Sure, you got the general idea, but it was kind of left hanging.  Which is why it's understandable that this movie didn't show a conversion in Nick.  There was nothing to convert from in the first place!  This was a rather long movie, and I think it would have helped if it had had a little more time to play around with Nick being a real pain-in-the-neck to most women and then slowly turn into this nice, considerate guy.  Cutting Lola out would have given the necessary time for this. Next, I'd like to comment on the character of Morgan.  First, you get the impression that he doesn't believe a word Nick is saying about being able to read women's minds.  Then, he goes and asks the attorney if she really thought he was gay.  I mean, it's like, Come on!  Make up your mind already!  Do you believe Nick, or not?!?! Fifth, the last scene was total, utter, and complete CRAP!!!!!!! Terrible scene.  It just said that whoever wrote the scene wanted to wrap the movie up, and wrap it up quick.  They didn't care whether it was totally bogus that Darcy would believe that Nick had been stealing her ideas without asking even one question as to HOW, exactly, he thought he had stolen her ideas.  She just accepted it, and that was that. Also on that last scene was the whole My hero thing.  Nick really didn't seem the type to be saying that, and Mel Gibson's stage presence wasn't meek enough for the line to fit in. My last comment on the last scene was that it left to many questions for the audience.  So she fired him.  Yeah?  And then...?  Nothing!  As far as we know, he never got another job and had to live on the streets.  And we're not even sure if she actually fired him or not.  Maybe she changed her mind later on.  Who knows??  Certainly not the audience. Then there was the `I Won't Dance' scene.  Excellent footwork on Mel Gibson's part, but I really think that someone should have chosen a different song for him to dance to.  This song clearly stated that he wouldn't dance, and then Mel Gibson has to go right ahead and dance to it anyway.  That's rather contradictory in my book. And then there's the problem of Darcy getting fired.  She'd been there, oh, one or two weeks tops and then she gets fired!  I don't think the manager knew enough about her yet to fire her straight off just because he thought Nick might be better at the job.  She only had the chance to do ONE project! How could he even think about judging her just form that?  Totally unbelievable. Last and probably least, I'd like to say that the names in this movie were awful and didn't fit their owners AT ALL.  Nick was a terrible name for Mel Gibson's character, when all of the rest of the character's names were rather absurd and not heard often.  I mean, come on.  Morgan, Darcy, Lola, and then, all of a sudden Nick!  Nick is one of the most common, everyday names for a guy.  And all of the other names are rather odd.  See where I'm going with that?I guess that's about all.  But there's one last thing.  Mel Gibson was sooooooo absolutely and utterly sexy in the I won't dance scene.  Yeah. (Hee hee hee.)

Tim Burton gave the movie its dark appearance, giving it the same cold, hard feeling that a person would expect from a movie about the Dark Knight.  Burton also did one thing that really impressed me he gave life not only to his characters, but also to their surroundings.  He took time into perfecting the look of Gotham City and the people in it.  Schumacher, however, did no such things, putting all life and energy into his characters.Now, onto these characters while I really missed Michael Keaton as billionaire Bruce Wayne, I thought Val Kilmer did an OK job in the role.  He wouldn't have been my first choice for the movie, but I thought he pulled it off decently.  Chris O'Donnell was impressive as Robin, playing the role of the Boy Wonder very well.  He showed Dick's trauma at seeking revenge for the death of his family extremely well.  Nicole Kidman, playing Batman's love interest, was decent, but nowhere as impressive as her co-stars.  Though it's easy to see why Bruce Wayne would fall in love with her, I thought she was OK at best.  Normally a terrific actress, I give Kidman a 5\/10 on her role here.  Of course, the real thing carrying this movie is Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey, who are nothing less than outstanding in their roles of Two-Face and the Riddler.  I'll admit that I'm a huge Carrey fan, and I thought he pulled off the crazed Edward Nygma better than anyone else could have.  Too bad Carrey hasn't pulled off more roles as a villain; he plays the bad guy so well.  Jones was so much fun to watch as Two-Face, and it's easy to see that he had a lot of fun working on this movie. Unfortunately, not even Jones & Carrey can save the Batman franchise.  I thought the adding of color and lighting (seen during the fight scene in the alley and Nygma's party showing his new box) looked pretty cool, but looking back on it, they were pretty much unnecessary.  The new Batmobile was really neat looking (I will give Schumacher credit for the new gadgets and vehicles in the movie, they were fun), and I did like Batman's new costume with the spikes on the sleeves, but still I felt a longing for that old-fashioned Batman style that I loved in Batman and Batman Returns.  Overall, I did like the movie, but I believe that Batman fans gave Schumacher a fair warning when he turned this out return to the roots or else.  Well, for anyone who has seen Batman & Robin, Schumacher ignored that warning.  A lot could have been done to better this movie, but as it stands, I still like it.

That's all I can really say.I'm not even going to go into the plot - There are thousands of reviews online, you can see it there.My ReviewWhen this movie came out in 1997, I was 13 years old, maybe a year into pueberty. At that time, I had just discovered my passion for free-weights (Bench Press was, and still is, my fav). My hormones were in full swing, producing more testosterone then I knew what to do with.My buds and I, like everyone else in the bloody world, had heard of the Epic Romance and laughed that it was a complete chick flick. We 'boycotted' the movie, saying we would never go see it in a million years.Well, after it had been out for about 4 months, I went and saw it with my little sister and her friend (who were 9 and begged to see it, but my dad had been reluctant due to the PG-13 rating). I sat in the back row, while they sat in the front. There were still a fair ammount of people there, 4 months after release.I sat through the 3 hours, without even going to the bathroom. I would never admit it to my buds, but I cried at the end. Not weeping or anything, just tears. I quickly wiped them away before walking my sister and her friend out.When I told my friends about it, I told them Yeah, it was so fu$!ing funny when that idiot Jack died! I laughed my a@@ off!

I can't put into words why, I just did.A lot of people bash this movie (even my friends and I now think of it as a great movie, just as a great 'chick flick' movie) but I have no idea why. Some people bash the special effects (please, they were superb), the plot (it was GREAT damnit!) or the historical relevancy (it was very accurate, except of course for Jack and Rose). I say let em' bash it. Why bother to try to change their opinions? Some people find fault with everything.My favorite aspect of the movie would have to be the cinemetography. The shots were just so damn good.My 2nd favorite would be the soundtrack (and let me tell you, I'm normally a hard rap\/hip-hop fan). I don't like Celine Deon, but the theme song was excellent.The acting was A+, nothing much to say.

This movie was a complete waste of time, and I want my $8 back!This movie is faulted from the very start; nothing fits well, and it doesn't even remotely come close to the comic books (or even the cartoon series for that matter).  First of all, let's take a look at the acting.  George Clooney is a great actor (I loved him in One Fine Day and From Dusk till Dawn), but he doesn't have what it takes to pull off a decent Batman.  I wanted to give him credit for being a decent Bruce Wayne, but I couldn't even do that; his roles just scream, Look everyone!  It's George Clooney!, not the mystery and intensity we've grown to love as Batman.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Mr. Freeze pretty well (at least he got into character and had fun with it), but I would not have picked someone like him to do the role.  First of all, it's impossible to get over the accent; Mr. Freeze didn't have an accent in the comics or cartoon series, and Schwarzenegger's accent is just too strong and too much of a trademark to not notice.  Plus, if I remember correctly, Mr. Freeze was always portrayed as a small guy who got big in the suit; Schwarzenegger did a good job, but it would have been better if someone else was cast.  Chris O'Donnell, returning as Robin, was pretty much the only tolerable actor in the movie.  He seemed to be the only returning character that had actually matured and changed from the last one.  Robin is definitely over his quest for revenge and now just wants Batman to treat him like a partner instead of a sidekick; O'Donnell played that to a T, and I was very impressed.This would be the part where I trash the female leads (Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl), but I find that I can't.  It wouldn't be fair to either of them because the roles they played were terrible to begin with.  Poison Ivy was always one of my favorite villains in the cartoon series, just because she was so interesting in her quest to avenge plants and flowers.  However, the role doesn't transfer well enough onto film, and we find ourselves just laughing at Thurman (who does seem to put up a good fight as her character) and thinking, `Come on, she's supposed to be a bad guy?'  Sorry, but her role was just too stupid to take seriously.  The same goes for Silverstone as Batgirl.  I was extremely disappointed in Schumacher's take on Batgirl's character, changing it so she would be Alfred's niece instead of Commissioner Gordon's daughter.  Batgirl was never really a partner of Batman & Robin; she ran independently from the Caped Crusaders and helped them out whenever she could.  She as well was given a pretty lousy part&#133; and I'm sorry, but the idea of Batgirl fighting in high heels was pretty stupid.The whole script is in need of a serious do-over.  Schwarzenegger had some of the cheesiest lines I've ever heard (`Very ice&#133;'), the ending was rather lousy and I just couldn't believe to be scientifically correct, and (slight spoiler herein) I didn't understand the scene after Batman, Robin, & Batgirl escape from Poison Ivy and head off to stop Mr. Freeze.  If they were in such a rush to get there, then how were they able to get back to the Bat Cave and get the new vehicles and new costumes?  Sorry, just not believeable (I'm not even going to get into the airfight scene after the rocket explodes or the chase scene where they start racing around on the giant statues).However, there is one major problem that, no matter how hard I try, I can't overlook THEY TRIED TO MAKE IT JUST LIKE THE LAST MOVIE!  `Batman & Robin' simply has way too many copies from `Batman Forever', including the fight scenes involving the bad guy's henchmen, the opening segments where we see our good guys getting dressed in their outfits, and scenes where one of the main characters crashes through a glass window on the ceiling (Batman did it at Ed Nygma's party in `Forever', and both he and Batgirl did it in this movie).  It looks just way too similar to the last movie; part of why I liked Batman Forever was because it was a major change; Batman & Robin changed nothing.  While watching this, I started to wonder whether or not they had simply borrowed footage from `Forever'.  Sorry Schumacher, learn to develop some different ideas.Overall, I was disgusted by this movie.  If you want to see Batman, then I suggest renting the original or `Batman Returns', or even `Batman Forever'.  `Batman & Robin' is just awful, plain & simple.

I can understand how someone could walk out of this movie, or call it vile, but I think those people took it too seriously.  I mean, how seriously can you take a movie about two different families competing for the title of `filthiest people alive'?  Maybe it's because I had already heard all of the buzz about the movie, so I came into it prepared to be grossed out, and ready to laugh (which I did a LOT), in any case, Pink Flamingos may hold some underlying message about the lower ends of society (which I wasn't exactly able to pull out, I was laughing too hard) it's still a movie that goes out it's way to be shocking and grotesque, and the wrong audience seeing it definitely brings out a strong negative reaction. After the film, I couldn't help but wonder how Waters made this movie. All of Waters' films have their own strange style to them, but some of the things that were in this movie were completely insane (i.e. the male stripper with the fluctuating anus).  I was baffled by the idea that someone had all of these ideas in his head, and the only thing I could picture in my mind was John Waters sitting at his desk with a pad of paper and a pencil listing out every single taboo he could possibly come up with.  This movie was fun for everyone, in the sense that I think there was something for everyone to feel disgusted by.  I mean, this movie had everything.  I think the best portrayal of this is the job description of the Marbles.  They are a couple who kidnap young hitchhiking girls, have their butler rape\/impregnate them, keep them locked in a basement, and they die after childbirth they sell the babies to lesbian couples, using the money to fund porno shops and a heroin ring in elementary schools.  Besides the ridiculous number of taboos listed above, the film also tackles incest, murder, beastiality, robbery and vandalism, etc (not the mention the great Divine eating dog shit). I think one of the most interesting characters of the movie was Divine's mother, Edie.  Reading reviews claiming this woman was a 250 pound grown woman that never left her play pen, and ate nothing other that eggs, was a vast understatement.  The thing that baffles me the most about this character is how in the world they found someone to play her.  Edith Massey, the woman who did play Edith, was said to have had trouble remembering lines for the movie, so they had to cut some out.  This stuns me, considering her lines didn't seem to consist of anything more than cries out for the egg man.  So, is this woman really like this in real life?  This leads to another important aspect of the film, it's reality.  I've read that the dog feces Divine ate were real, and I cannot help but believe that the chickens killed in the rough sex scene between Cookie and Crackers were actually killed (if they weren't, it was disturbingly realistic).  The reality of this film, I believe, is it's strongest aspect.  We're not bombarded with cutaways and silhouettes or what is going on, we see everything. Understandably, some found this honesty and reality to be revolting.  A scene to pops out in my head is when Divine performs oral sex on Crackers, her son in the film.  It's not often we see those kinds of things, so graphically, in movie theaters that don't have `XXX' in the title.  The truthfulness of the film (along with some poor camera work) gave the film a real documentary feel.

Literate, clever, and often too smart for it's own good. Don't get me wrong, I like smart movies and there is definitely a lack of them out there.  Like Doonesbury, though, I'm sure there are a number of people out there who were simply unwilling to put in the effort to understand The Royal Tenenbaums.  Although often slow, I found The Royal Tenenbaums just as often humorous.  Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is the music.  Although I found the entirety of the film less obviously calculating than some critics have claimed it to be, the music (especially the non-original music) certainly seemed overly manipulative. While there are moments of slapstick in TRT, much of the humor is dialogue based.  Consider the scene where Richie admits Royal his love for his sister.  `Isn't that illegal?' says Royal.  `No, I don't think so.  We're not blood related,' replies Richie, to which Royal's response is `True. But it's certainly frowned upon.'  Much of the film is like that jokes so quiet or subtle that if you blink, you'll miss them.  Some of the humor also results from the characters obliviousness to what they're saying (or doing). Whenever Royal introduces his daughter Margot, he makes sure to mention that she is adopted, which is in actuality really horrible and cruel, but Royal says it without any hint of malice or even awareness that he has committed a faux pas at all.  Or there are Uri and Ari, the sons of Chas, who (in an attempt to compensate for the attention his father never gave him) warps their fragile little minds by making them do fire drills at three in the morning (and telling them they're all dead afterwards) and having them work out sixteen times a week.  From the outside, as spectators, such things can be funny. While I found much of the dialogue and situation comedy very funny, the music usually made me cringe.  It isn't because the music was bad, it was just that the music seemed extremely calculated.  When Richie sets his pet bird, Mordeci, free, there is uplifting 70's pop music.  When Richie tries to kill himself, there is a melancholy pop song.  When Royal finally reunites with is family, there is happy music.  As we find out about Margot's secret sex life, there is a raucous rock song.  I am aware that all movies are trying, in one way or another, to manipulate the audience, but in a movie filled with subtle dialogue and intricate visual details, I was disappointed that the music was so.guileless.  It often seemed like I was watching the scene with the music setting next to me yelling in my ear `Okay, this scene, it's sad!  Here's some SAD music to make sure you KNOW it's SAD!'

Like Doonesbury, though, I'm sure there are a number of people out there who were simply unwilling to put in the effort to understand The Royal Tenenbaums.  Although often slow, I found The Royal Tenenbaums just as often humorous.  Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is the music.  Although I found the entirety of the film less obviously calculating than some critics have claimed it to be, the music (especially the non-original music) certainly seemed overly manipulative. While there are moments of slapstick in TRT, much of the humor is dialogue based.  Consider the scene where Richie admits Royal his love for his sister.  `Isn't that illegal?' says Royal.  `No, I don't think so.  We're not blood related,' replies Richie, to which Royal's response is `True. But it's certainly frowned upon.'  Much of the film is like that jokes so quiet or subtle that if you blink, you'll miss them.  Some of the humor also results from the characters obliviousness to what they're saying (or doing). Whenever Royal introduces his daughter Margot, he makes sure to mention that she is adopted, which is in actuality really horrible and cruel, but Royal says it without any hint of malice or even awareness that he has committed a faux pas at all.  Or there are Uri and Ari, the sons of Chas, who (in an attempt to compensate for the attention his father never gave him) warps their fragile little minds by making them do fire drills at three in the morning (and telling them they're all dead afterwards) and having them work out sixteen times a week.  From the outside, as spectators, such things can be funny. While I found much of the dialogue and situation comedy very funny, the music usually made me cringe.  It isn't because the music was bad, it was just that the music seemed extremely calculated.  When Richie sets his pet bird, Mordeci, free, there is uplifting 70's pop music.  When Richie tries to kill himself, there is a melancholy pop song.  When Royal finally reunites with is family, there is happy music.  As we find out about Margot's secret sex life, there is a raucous rock song.  I am aware that all movies are trying, in one way or another, to manipulate the audience, but in a movie filled with subtle dialogue and intricate visual details, I was disappointed that the music was so.guileless.  It often seemed like I was watching the scene with the music setting next to me yelling in my ear `Okay, this scene, it's sad!  Here's some SAD music to make sure you KNOW it's SAD!'

In fact it's not particularly cinematic.  What it is, is an honest stab at a story that explores the intricacy and honesty of relationships, in a family that is falling apart largely because they were never really that together to begin with.  I think the title of the film is apt, and Joey's monologue there in the dark speaking to her mother is the strongest scene in the film.  Allen's work suffers somewhat from being too cerebral.  Even characters who are cerebral don't come right out and say what they're thinking, but I'm a big believer in subtext.  I admire this film in the sense that it is digging for something deeper, that it is more about the characters, and is not a plot centered film, but the actors lend strength and depth to an otherwise obvious script.  There's not enough there in the writing and so there is a limit to how far the actors can take it.  The photography is masterful from an aesthetic standpoint and I suppose it suits the subject matter, but here I have to get personal.  I truly feel that Gordon Willis overdoes it with his cinematography.  Everything is underexposed and there are times when I feel certain scenes would be strengthened by more straightforward photography.  I feel that Willis' personal stamp that is obviously reminiscent of old masters like Rembrant is self-imposing.  It's too much, and it's not right for every scene.  No one questions whether Willis is technically sound or aesthetically masterful, sure he's an artist, but since we hold him in such high esteem let's be honest and say that his lighting is not always about the subject matter, it does not always seek to tell the story in the best manner possible or if it does it fails.  Gordon Willis is great, but I feel this film would have benefited from employing a much more practical and humble dp.  Overall the film is good, but not great.  It's time to stop embellishing.  Just because a film has integrity and sets out to accomplish something doesn't make it a great film.  Just as lighting a scene beautifully and distinctly doesn't necessarily make it great cinematography.  I'm for a film looking outright hideous if it's the best way to tell a story.  As James Wong Howe once said, We can try to get our own ideas in there, but we shouldn't try to get our personalities in the film.  Howe's point being that everything and everyone is subservient to telling the story.  Alone this film is a competent piece, but there is nothing so extraordinary about it as a whole.  In the context of great films this film should not even receive as much as a whisper.  Worth watching, but not nearly a masterpiece.
