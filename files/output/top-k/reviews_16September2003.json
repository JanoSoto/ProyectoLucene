it hard to keep myself from changing the channel every time I saw him.Second flaw is that there is no point with all the flashbacks, the use of them was exaggerated by the cocky and over-ambitious Soderbergh.The background story with Jack Foley and his inmate friends really fails to make a meaningful connection to the rest of the plot.The pluses of this picture were Lopez and Catherine Keener,both good to look at and solid in their roles.Also Ving Rhames was quite good as the faithful pal Buddy.The showdown scene in the end where White Boy trips and shoots himself in the head was worth watching.Don Cheadle was OK,although not impressive.But George Clooney,although he didn't give a bad performance,failed to impress and really show himself as actor the way he did in From dusk till dawn,One fine day and O brother where art thou?,and also ER.Samuel L. makes a nice cameo at the end.So my conclusion is that this film tried to be too much somehow.It betted on one horse too

The cinematographer, Conrad L. Hall, provides images of rain swept characters; men with deep, sorrowful faces looking from below the rim of their hat, the rain streaking down their long over coats. Aware of their fate, the men look into the shadows at the invisible assassin.  Sam Mendes' first film (American Beauty) found simple elegance - a bag, floating in the wind. Here he finds beauty with every camera angle and every shot. Not a scene goes by that we don't admire; a lot of thought has gone into this film. Sam Mendes is clearly a man with an eye for detail. The camera moves majestically from scene to scene, providing us with a truly great visceral experience. Unlike other films with an abundance of style (hello, The Matrix Revolutions), the plaudits don't stop at great camera work. Every actor puts in a magnificent performance as their characters gently brood over the morality of what they do. Tom Hanks plays a hitman (Michael Sullivan) for the local gangster (Paul Newman), a man he has known for a long time; a man he greatly respects. When his son finds out what his father does for a living he is deeply disturbed. It is this rift, between father and son, which dominates most of the film. There is also great sincerity shown between Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. Both the characters and the actors respect one another - the scenes between these two are great to watch. A special mention must also be given to Jude Law, an actor with immense talent. He gives us a character that is hunting Sullivan - a devious, snake-like man. He mooches around, hunched over, looking at us from beneath his brow. He seems to feel nothing, and is undisturbed by the murders he perpetrates.

Willem Defoe is also great as Colonel Elias (I think he is a colonel), who is much more understanding than Barnes. Everyone else is quite memorable too. The Cinematography is quite stunning in Platoon, probably the best cinematography I have seen in a war film. Stone's direction is perfect.

The officers are members of a mostly Australian unit called the Bushveldt Carbineers, created to fight the Boer commandos (in the original sense of the word) by employing their own tactics against them. The charges against them are that they committed murder by summarily executing captured Boers. That they have done so in not in question, but in their defence they argue that they were acting in accordance with standing orders, not least because the operational nature of the Carbineers would be hampered by having to keep prisoners under guard. The British command is keen to distance itself from this claim for various reasons; it might galvanise Boer resistance, and give Germany an excuse to provide material support to the Boers (thus extending a war which was already a serious drain on the British Empire's resources), and (though this is left unsaid in the film) cause discontent about the conduct of the war in those parts of the Empire supplying the manpower for the war, i.e. Britain, Australia and Canada. Instead, the British command clearly wishes to portray the three protagonists as rogue elements and sacrifice them for the sake of political expediency.'Breaker' Morant is about injustice, hypocrisy and incomprehension. The injustice is not that lieutenants Morant, Hancock and Witton are innocent of the charges brought against them--they're not. The Second Convention of The Hague may have been only two years old at the time, but the custom of not killing prisoners was well-established long before, and at no point do we see any of the protagonists object to the standing orders. The injustice lies in the fact that the body which is trying them for their crimes--the British army--is the very body which ordered them to commit these crimes in the first place.The incomprehension is that of the home front; in a brief flashback of Witton's relatives giving a going-away party, we see the expectation among the civilians that our boys will knock 'em for six but behave like gentlemen while doing so. Brief as the scene is, it is plain that the civilians understand only in the most abstract way, if they understand at all, that war is a messy business in which winning requires killing people in unpleasant ways. As Major Thomas, the protagonists' defence counsel, comments, The barbarities of war are seldom committed by abnormal men. The tragedy of war is that these horrors are committed by normal men in abnormal situations. While I can agree with this observation, it does not alter the fact that the acts committed by the protagonists were of such a nature as to be have been formally outlawed, even within the context of war, two years previously.Another trope, which occurs in this film but repeated in every war of the 20th century, is that only a combat soldier can judge another combat soldier. As it happens, I am a former soldier (who never saw combat) who later helped prosecute war criminals while a civilian; I think this line is unadulterated bullsh*t.

At one point in the film, Lt. Hancock pulls a dum-dum round from a Boer's ammunition pouch as an indication of the Boers' disregard for the laws of war. However, a (somewhat apocryphal) story from the opening stages of the Boer War (not in the film) tells of how the Boers lodged a protest with the British after finding dum-dum rounds in a killed British soldier's ammunition pouch; the British reportedly apologised profusely, explaining that the soldier had been issued these rounds in error, as these were intended only for use against blacks. The Boers accepted this explanation without further complaint.But however you may feel about the politics underlying this film, it is a joy to watch. The quality of the production values is top notch, and had I not been familiar with Edward Woodward and Bryan Brown, I could have believed this film was made this year, rather than in 1980. The directing and acting are also superb. At the heart of this is the script, which carried no dead weight of unnecessary scenes; likely, this is due to the fact that it was originally written (and written well) for the stage. The story might easily be transposed to any number of conflicts since the Second Boer War in which military victory demands taking nasty measures; it could easily be rewritten to Iraq in 2003 (Well, Peter, this is what comes of empire-building.), and for that reason it deserves more recognition than it's received.

The officers are members of a mostly Australian unit called the Bushveldt Carbineers, created to fight the Boer commandos (in the original sense of the word) by employing their own tactics against them. The charges against them are that they committed murder by summarily executing captured Boers. That they have done so in not in question, but in their defence they argue that they were acting in accordance with standing orders, not least because the operational nature of the Carbineers would be hampered by having to keep prisoners under guard. The British command is keen to distance itself from this claim for various reasons; it might galvanise Boer resistance, and give Germany an excuse to provide material support to the Boers (thus extending a war which was already a serious drain on the British Empire's resources), and (though this is left unsaid in the film) cause discontent about the conduct of the war in those parts of the Empire supplying the manpower for the war, i.e. Britain, Australia and Canada. Instead, the British command clearly wishes to portray the three protagonists as rogue elements and sacrifice them for the sake of political expediency.'Breaker' Morant is about injustice, hypocrisy and incomprehension. The injustice is not that lieutenants Morant, Hancock and Witton are innocent of the charges brought against them--they're not. The Second Convention of The Hague may have been only two years old at the time, but the custom of not killing prisoners was well-established long before, and at no point do we see any of the protagonists object to the standing orders. The injustice lies in the fact that the body which is trying them for their crimes--the British army--is the very body which ordered them to commit these crimes in the first place.The incomprehension is that of the home front; in a brief flashback of Witton's relatives giving a going-away party, we see the expectation among the civilians that our boys will knock 'em for six but behave like gentlemen while doing so. Brief as the scene is, it is plain that the civilians understand only in the most abstract way, if they understand at all, that war is a messy business in which winning requires killing people in unpleasant ways. As Major Thomas, the protagonists' defence counsel, comments, The barbarities of war are seldom committed by abnormal men.

I was floored. I laughed and cried, I got goosebumps all over and found a new film to add to my list of favorites. This is something special. Kenneth Branagh is just perfect as the eloquent Benedick, bringing out shades of heroism, humor, wit, romance and gaiety in his performance. Emma Thompson is hilarious from her first lines (God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured!) and she perfectly captures Beatrice wit and wisdom in her performance. She and Branagh have real chemistry, and the films most exhilarating scene is when she and Benedick admit that they love the other, and both give free reign to their emotion; Benedick by splashing through a fountain, and Beatrice by swinging like a little girl again.Kate Beckinsale and Robert Sean Leonard are quite good as fair Hero and the passionate Claudio, bringing a bit more life to the romance of the two. Claudio was properly gullible and hot-blooded, sentimental and quick to act, and Hero was gentle and modest, laughing at her cousin and obeying her father, a calming influence on her betrothed. I also enjoyed Denzel Washington's Don Pedro - he seemed always in control, honorable and solicitous of everyone, as the Prince should be. Richard Briers was also very good as Signoir Leonato, Hero's wise and gentle father. Michael Keaton was very funny - so over the top; I had never thought that much humor could be invested into the character of Dogberry, the constable, though sometimes I want to fast-forward his scenes and get back to our two couples. Very badly done was John the Bastard, played by Keanu Reeves as very wooden and one-note. He looks as if he is ready to stab someone in every scene, instead of being devious and calculating. The scenery is beautiful, and Patrick Doyle (who composed another one of my favorite films and scores, Sense and Sensibility) really outdid himself with the music. The best examples of this are the song Sigh No More, Ladies, the opening sequence, the fountain\/swing scenes, and Hero's first wedding.

'Jurassic Park 3' is like the movie translation of that game. It's like the 'lost scenes' from the original. There should be a DVD feature where you can meld the two and form the ultimate Jurassic Park ride. Also like the game, the movie doesn't really end as much as it just stops cold in it's tracks and starts ushering people - dazzed and bewildered - out of the theater. The scenes themselves are pretty spectacular in their execution and it's nice to see them come to life. Along with that, the vibrant color palette, some remarkably detailed special effects and well sprinkled doses of humor here and there elevate the movie above its mindless script to being likeable, watchable fun.

Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula I am all men as I am no man, and so - I am a God!'Bob Guccione's Penthouse International invested 17.5 million dollars into the production of Caligula, and in doing so created one of the wildest exploitation films ever made.The film, which chronicles the terrifying reign of the tyrant Gaius Caligula Caesar, Rome's fourth and most notorious emperor, who ruled from A.D. 37 to A.D. 41, took eleven months to film and attracted a multitude of talented artists into its creative team. These included renowned novelist, essayist, playwright and historian Gore Vidal, who wrote the initial screenplay the final film was based on, and Danilo Donati, four time Academy award winning designer, and frequent Fellini collaborator, who created the lavish sets, 64 all up, and costumes. The Emperor himself had 26 costume changes alone. 3,592 costumes in all were created. Actors of the calibre and stature of Malcolm McDowell, Sir John Gielgud, Helen Mirren and Peter O'Toole flew to Rome for what promised to be one hell of an experience, and it proved to be just that.Ever since its release in 1979 Caligula has been resoundly lambasted by not only the critics but by most of the participants in the production. It is well known that the production of the film degenerated into a huge slagging match between the main talents and the money men and that the director, Tinto Brass, was removed from the production after he had edited the first twenty minutes of the film. The rest of the film was edited by Guccione and a freelance editor, and if you look at the film from the moment when dawn arrives and all the freaks awake in Tiberius' grotto, they had no idea what they were doing. They probably even used the wrong takes most of the time. The blame for the films failure has been placed mainly at the feet of Brass. Brass reportedly used three to five cameras all rolling at the same time to capture the action. This was one of the reasons used by Penthouse to fire him. They claimed that he wasted film shooting this way. Yet, if you look at the first twenty minutes the film is a sharply edited piece of work, excluding the opening sequence in the forest, which is pretty dire, and which probably was never shot to open the film anyway. It's a shame Brass wasn't left in control, as I believe he would have produced an intelligent movie. Sure, it wasn't going to be the erotic\/todger pulling classic Guccione wanted, but who cares. One of the really bad aspects of the film are the stupid porno inserts featuring the pets. I believe Brass was on his way to creating a masterpiece, well, maybe not, but certainly a film of much merit. Piernico Solinas, author of The Ultimate Porno The Making of a sex Colossal, certainly believed this to be true. It would be interesting to see the film totally re-edited from start to finish again. There is certainly a lot of footage that was shot that never ended up in the final cut.Caligula is an easy film to knock. People don't like it because of its frankness. People claim it is badly acted. People claim it is badly written. People claim it is badly photographed. People claim it is just bad. Well they are wrong. What it is is a prime example of how to ruin a film in the editing stage. Anyone claiming it to be badly photographed need look no further than the Dutch Filmworks release of it on DVD. This is a beautiful, not completely blemish free, print that shows just how well filmed Caligula was. It is far superior to the Penthouse DVD. Sure, Caligula is not a perfect film, and sure it is in your face filmmaking, but at least the filmmakers had the guts to make something different, something challenging. What went wrong with Caligula was that there were too many chiefs. What Caligula was was a brave and interesting experiment that didn't quite come off.

Yet, if you look at the first twenty minutes the film is a sharply edited piece of work, excluding the opening sequence in the forest, which is pretty dire, and which probably was never shot to open the film anyway. It's a shame Brass wasn't left in control, as I believe he would have produced an intelligent movie. Sure, it wasn't going to be the erotic\/todger pulling classic Guccione wanted, but who cares. One of the really bad aspects of the film are the stupid porno inserts featuring the pets. I believe Brass was on his way to creating a masterpiece, well, maybe not, but certainly a film of much merit. Piernico Solinas, author of The Ultimate Porno The Making of a sex Colossal, certainly believed this to be true. It would be interesting to see the film totally re-edited from start to finish again. There is certainly a lot of footage that was shot that never ended up in the final cut.Caligula is an easy film to knock. People don't like it because of its frankness. People claim it is badly acted. People claim it is badly written. People claim it is badly photographed. People claim it is just bad. Well they are wrong. What it is is a prime example of how to ruin a film in the editing stage. Anyone claiming it to be badly photographed need look no further than the Dutch Filmworks release of it on DVD. This is a beautiful, not completely blemish free, print that shows just how well filmed Caligula was. It is far superior to the Penthouse DVD. Sure, Caligula is not a perfect film, and sure it is in your face filmmaking, but at least the filmmakers had the guts to make something different, something challenging. What went wrong with Caligula was that there were too many chiefs. What Caligula was was a brave and interesting experiment that didn't quite come off. Caligula could have been powerful, intelligent and stunning. Instead, it is one of the best exploitation films ever made. And, anyway, who could hate a movie that has a giant head lopping machine in it.

It continually astonishes me to learn how many of my college back in the day friends liked this film.  The preoccupation with lesbians is something that most men grow out of, say, by the 8th or 9th grade, unless they suffer some sort of arrested development.  And what is it with Joey Lauren Adams squeaky voice and the constant use of soft focus with her closeups?  I guess there is something to be said for having a relationship with the director.  Either the publicity poster for the film was heavily doctored, or Adams went off her Ritalin regimen, but she looks awful in the film.  Don't even get me started on Affleck, see my review for Pearl Harbor.  He is a very irritating performer who is clearly in love with the sound of his own voice.  The only bright spot in the film is Jason Lee, who I could watch in just about anything, he's one of the brightest new talents to come along in cinema since Johnny Depp had his breakthrough with Edward Scissorhands.
