A travelling horror show has acquired his coffin, complete with his skeleton with a stake through the heart. Dr. Niemann (Boris Karloff - no, he wasn't Frankenstein's monster in this) takes possession of the show, revives Dracula by removing the stake from his heart (which also magically recreates Dracula's clothing!) and lets him loose to gain revenge on those who had imprisoned him years before. (As an aside, Dracula just isn't Dracula when he's not Bela Lugosi; here, the part is played - rather weakly, in my opinion - by John Carradine.) Eventually Dracula ends up dead - again - and Niemann and his hunchbacked assistant (played by J. Carroll Naish) move on to Dr. Frankenstein's ruined castle where he wants to recreate Frankenstein's experiments.

Not much is really made of Frankenstein's monster until the final few scenes of the movie, but the Wolfman wreaks a bit of havoc before being killed by a silver bullet fired by the Gypsy woman who's fallen in love with him (or at least with Talbot) which caused the hunchback to become very jealous.It's clear by this point that Universal was interested in the monsters themselves more than in creating good and workable stories for them to appear in, which is probably why this particular incarnation of the monster genre (although House of Dracula would follow the next year) was mercifully coming to an end. You can only take even a good thing so far, and if you look at Universal's list of horror movies from the 30's and 40's you can see that they rode these three monsters pretty hard.

Mind you, this is the kind of guy who, during my university years, we tried to keep away, giving him even the wrong times, rooms, of classes so we'd get to see the least possible of him. And this is a track star, editor of a college newspaper, recipient of some award or other? Such a luminary, a guy already in his 20s who still lacks the most basic social skills, who doesn't know how to talk to women, who doesn't even know the meaning of an expression such as having a character, a personality? I reckon that all us at that age turned into fumbling idiots when an older woman was trying to seduce us, but I'm not even talking about that, but about the useless loafer and jerk Benjamin Braddock is shown to be from beginning to end, which is made even worse by the constant, unrelenting, sonic harassment by S&G (I loved those tunes then but now I think I'll never be able to stomach them again. Why, oh God, why).I remember having seen TG in the late 60s, early 70s, and what astonishes me the most, watching it now, is how I didn't realized then what a turkey this flick is; I must have had my mind busy with other things. So bad it is, I felt nauseous just watching it, having to stop from time to time because the only way I could stomach it was in small installments&#x97;sometimes of even a few min.. The writing is not so great to begin with, but it takes a turn for the worse with the arrival of Elaine. Her lines are so ridiculous, her general behavior so incredibly dumb, that not for a moment her character looks or sounds real. See, after being grievously offended by Ben, in the strip club, all what he needs to completely change her mood is a cursory explanation and a chicken sandwich. I've seen girls turn their back to bozos and never ever talk to them again for far less than that. But it's that easy to make her forgive and forget. Later, in Berkeley, when realizing that he's stalking her, instead of doing what any smart, sensible girl would have done--give him a 10 sec. head start before calling the cops--she goes to visit him in his room and begs him not to leave. The reason why she does it is, see, she has fallen in love with him. What!? And how that happened!? God knows. Then they start a romance, which is brutally interrupted by her cruel parents, including her adulterous mom, who think, monsters, that Ben is not good for her. After so much trouble and comings and goings, he rescues her from her own marriage, her own wedding, and both ride into the sunset in a smelly bus full of old, ugly looking folks. BTW, did I say the writing is lousy?.Now, amongst the negative reviews I see here many emphasize the immoral aspects of the plot but I rather stay away from that. I don't make part of my reviews any ethical consideration, I don't pass judgement, as long as we're talking about consenting adult when it comes to sex. I have no problem with the adultery in question and I even think this could have been a better movie if Ben had finally run away with Mrs. Robinson. That would have meant something in what breaking social norms and protocols concerns. As it is, this is just another conformist flick disguised as troublemaker--young boy commits sin of the flesh, he repents and is pardoned. As a reward he gets pure, virgin girl. But the essential moral there is, guy knows best what's good for gal--i.e. back to the fifties. More conformist than that, you die. Marx wrote once that self-appointed social troublemakers usually see themselves as ferocious wolfs, or lions, whose powerful roars shake the foundations of the system, terrorizing its keepers, while in fact they are no more than harmless sheep bleating in the enclosure they are kept. That's the feel TG gives me, that of an insignificant but pretentious flick taking its own plaintive bleating for ferocious roaring striking at the bases of society.As everyone and his dog know the plot, I'll just say writing starts mediocre and becomes more and more incredible--and idiotic--as plot advances, specially in the last 15 min. Ben's frantic race to locate Elaine is meant to be heart--stopping, watched from the edge of our seats yet, frankly dear, I couldn't give a damn if he found her or not. And those last 3 min. must be the most ridiculous ever shown in a movie screen, specially when Elaine screams in the Church. The S&G score, simply overbearing; I've heard enough of them for the rest of my life. The cinematography is one of the rare saving graces, with some good camera angles, perspectives. Pacing adequate. Great acting by Bancroft and Hamilton, okay for the rest. As for Hoffman, he seems already to be auditioning for Rain man. I can't say of Ross as her character--its lines, general behavior--is so dumb that no actress could have possibly saved it.In all, a dude. Skip it, watch American Beauty instead. 3\/10, just for the acting, visuals.

But the essential moral there is, guy knows best what's good for gal--i.e. back to the fifties. More conformist than that, you die.

Ben's frantic race to locate Elaine is meant to be heart--stopping, watched from the edge of our seats yet, frankly dear, I couldn't give a damn if he found her or not. And those last 3 min. must be the most ridiculous ever shown in a movie screen, specially when Elaine screams in the Church. The S&G score, simply overbearing; I've heard enough of them for the rest of my life. The cinematography is one of the rare saving graces, with some good camera angles, perspectives. Pacing adequate. Great acting by Bancroft and Hamilton, okay for the rest. As for Hoffman, he seems already to be auditioning for Rain man. I can't say of Ross as her character--its lines, general behavior--is so dumb that no actress could have possibly saved it.In all, a dude.

An hideous geek. Mind you, this is the kind of guy who, during my university years, we tried to keep away, giving him even the wrong times, rooms, of classes so we'd get to see the least possible of him. And this is a track star, editor of a college newspaper, recipient of some award or other? Such a luminary, a guy already in his 20s who still lacks the most basic social skills, who doesn't know how to talk to women, who doesn't even know the meaning of an expression such as having a character, a personality? I reckon that all us at that age turned into fumbling idiots when an older woman was trying to seduce us, but I'm not even talking about that, but about the useless loafer and jerk Benjamin Braddock is shown to be from beginning to end, which is made even worse by the constant, unrelenting, sonic harassment by S&G (I loved those tunes then but now I think I'll never be able to stomach them again. Why, oh God, why).I remember having seen TG in the late 60s, early 70s, and what astonishes me the most, watching it now, is how I didn't realized then what a turkey this flick is; I must have had my mind busy with other things. So bad it is, I felt nauseous just watching it, having to stop from time to time because the only way I could stomach it was in small installments&#x97;sometimes of even a few min.. The writing is not so great to begin with, but it takes a turn for the worse with the arrival of Elaine. Her lines are so ridiculous, her general behavior so incredibly dumb, that not for a moment her character looks or sounds real. See, after being grievously offended by Ben, in the strip club, all what he needs to completely change her mood is a cursory explanation and a chicken sandwich. I've seen girls turn their back to bozos and never ever talk to them again for far less than that. But it's that easy to make her forgive and forget. Later, in Berkeley, when realizing that he's stalking her, instead of doing what any smart, sensible girl would have done--give him a 10 sec. head start before calling the cops--she goes to visit him in his room and begs him not to leave. The reason why she does it is, see, she has fallen in love with him. What!? And how that happened!? God knows. Then they start a romance, which is brutally interrupted by her cruel parents, including her adulterous mom, who think, monsters, that Ben is not good for her. After so much trouble and comings and goings, he rescues her from her own marriage, her own wedding, and both ride into the sunset in a smelly bus full of old, ugly looking folks. BTW, did I say the writing is lousy?.Now, amongst the negative reviews I see here many emphasize the immoral aspects of the plot but I rather stay away from that. I don't make part of my reviews any ethical consideration, I don't pass judgement, as long as we're talking about consenting adult when it comes to sex. I have no problem with the adultery in question and I even think this could have been a better movie if Ben had finally run away with Mrs. Robinson. That would have meant something in what breaking social norms and protocols concerns. As it is, this is just another conformist flick disguised as troublemaker--young boy commits sin of the flesh, he repents and is pardoned. As a reward he gets pure, virgin girl.

Pretty much the first and only animated film released in theaters, this is Batman Mask of the Phantasm.Plot Believe it or not, there was a time when before donning the famous cowl, Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphaned son of Thomas and Martha Wayne, almost chose a normal life with his great love Andrea Beaumont. However, circumstances forced him other wise. Now, years later, a mysterious figure haunts the streets of Gotham City known simply as the Phantasm. As the vigilante begins to deliver a lethal brand of justice to several interconnected crime bosses, the Phantasm's remarkable similarity to the Batman have caused the police to suspect Bruce for these crimes. With the police hot on his trail and the past coming back to haunt him, can Batman put an end to the madness? Who is the Phantasm? And how does the Joker fit into all of this? Tune in same Bat time, same Bat channel! I've heard about this movie for years, but never got around to seeing it until now. Now that I've seen it, I must say that this is a very well-made super hero movie. The dilemmas Batman goes through and the deeper exploration of his past with Andrea are quite interesting. The violence and the dialog are actually more adult oriented than usual and that's saying a lot for a TV series kids watch. The action scenes are actually great, the stakes are raised and things just get crazier with every minute. The music is also great, extremely compelling and complementing the mood of many scenes extremely well.Kevin Conroy remains to be the best Batman ever and I applaud his continuous work in providing the voice of one of the greatest super heroes of all time. Mark Hamill as Joker is still a wonderful thing to see, his performance being fun to watch while also being rather creepy. I also love how the Clown Prince of Crime plays into the complex plot of the film. Andrea is one of the most interesting love interests I have seen in the franchise, having her own unique set of personal qualities and flaws. Finally, the Phantasm has an excellent look and spine-chilling voice that make the masked vigilante a worthy, and scary, villain.In conclusion, this is definitely one of the best batman movies I've seen and yet I feel that it seems a little underrated and that it deserves greater recognition. Mask of the Phantasm is an excellent film involving character study and epic adult dilemmas. Interesingly, the Phantasm would later make a surprise appearance in an episode of the ever-awesome series Justice League Unlimited.

But after a massive Earthquake in India, Mary is orphan and sent back to England to live with her uncle. The Northern English manor is run by a harsh matriarch, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith) and limits Mary's access to most of the house. But Mary forms friendships with the servant girl Martha (Laura Crossley) and her brother Dickon (Andrew Knott) who has great animal taming abilities, discovers her aunt's secret garden and finds her 'sick' cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse).The Secret Garden does share similarities to A Little Princess, both feature young girls who grew up in India, have lost their parents in some form, both are forced to go to move to a foreign land, have to deal with an authoritarian figure, befriends a servant girl and there is a character who has a magical element to him. But there are differences as well the main one being the central characters Mary is a more selfish, spoiled character who has to learn to open up, show emotions, be kind and help her people whilst Sara in A Little Princess has to keep her imagination and kind spirit despite the hardships and lost she suffered.

It was shot on location in Sunland-Tujunga in Los Angeles, Pasadena in Los Angeles, California and Long Beach and Burbank in California, USA and is an American production which was produced by American producers Suzanne Todd and Jennifer Todd. It tells the story about Leonard Shelby, a once happily married man and former worker at an insurance company who is staying at a motel called the discount inn. Leonard is searching for the man who raped and murdered his wife, but he has no short-term memory so he writes down everything that happens to him, gets tattoos with information on his body and takes photos of everyone he meets.

It's difficult to watch at times, if you take it seriously. But I think it was difficult to film, to write, to act. The premise is subtle even if it sounds sensational--show the inner mind and inner life of a brilliant woman who is mentally ill. She has compulsive issues, I think, and sexual repression that has led her to masochistic and finally sadistic extremes. She is admirable in some external way for her self-control which reads, to an outsider, as cold precision, the kind needed to be an extraordinary classical pianist.But the movie takes us inside her life, first to the unhealthy relationship with her mother, then the oddly stern and indifferent role she takes with her advanced students. Finally there is a young man who sees only her ability, and her external beauty. (This woman, Erika, is played by the incomparable Isabelle Huppert.) He is a pianist of unusual talent, but he wants not to concertize, but to live life. He plays hockey. He has friends. He smiles warmly. He is, in short, a healthy normal and rather handsome young man.And he falls for Erika. This is where the movie gets weirder and weirder, but also more challenging. They play an intense game of sexual chicken, at first, and lots of head games. He knows she's superior to him in some way--older, more severe---but he has no idea about her slanted view of life and of sex. He wants her. He becomes a pupil of hers just for that reason. She pretends not to care, or to rebuff him (in part this isn't pretense because she's afraid). Finally a couple of serious and demented confrontations occur. And things unravel in a very interesting way. Some people will find it simply sick and unwatchable. It also happens very slowly--if the film has an obvious flaw, it's the pace. It's in love with itself far too much. But if you get into that flow, and can take the pain that will rise up, then you will at least be greatly affected.

It's difficult to watch at times, if you take it seriously. But I think it was difficult to film, to write, to act. The premise is subtle even if it sounds sensational--show the inner mind and inner life of a brilliant woman who is mentally ill. She has compulsive issues, I think, and sexual repression that has led her to masochistic and finally sadistic extremes. She is admirable in some external way for her self-control which reads, to an outsider, as cold precision, the kind needed to be an extraordinary classical pianist.But the movie takes us inside her life, first to the unhealthy relationship with her mother, then the oddly stern and indifferent role she takes with her advanced students. Finally there is a young man who sees only her ability, and her external beauty. (This woman, Erika, is played by the incomparable Isabelle Huppert.) He is a pianist of unusual talent, but he wants not to concertize, but to live life. He plays hockey. He has friends. He smiles warmly. He is, in short, a healthy normal and rather handsome young man.And he falls for Erika. This is where the movie gets weirder and weirder, but also more challenging. They play an intense game of sexual chicken, at first, and lots of head games. He knows she's superior to him in some way--older, more severe---but he has no idea about her slanted view of life and of sex. He wants her. He becomes a pupil of hers just for that reason. She pretends not to care, or to rebuff him (in part this isn't pretense because she's afraid). Finally a couple of serious and demented confrontations occur. And things unravel in a very interesting way. Some people will find it simply sick and unwatchable. It also happens very slowly--if the film has an obvious flaw, it's the pace. It's in love with itself far too much. But if you get into that flow, and can take the pain that will rise up, then you will at least be greatly affected.

Others in the film included areMichael Kitchen,Malick Bowens,Stephen Kinyanjui,Michael Gough,Suzanna Hamilton and Iman.The book was adapted into a screenplay by Kurt Luedtke and directed by Sydney Pollack.The film's events revolves around that time when the book's author was was married to Baron Bor Blixen-Flecke.In 1914, the Baron moves himself and his wife to a plantation in Nairobi, then leaves Karen to her own devices as he returns to his womanizing and drinking. Soon, Karen has fallen in love with charming white hunter Denys Finch Hatton, who prefers a no-strings relationship. A woman who prides herself on her independence,Karen finds herself unhappily in thrall to a aloof man -- and doubly unhappy for living out such a cliché situation. This is a great movie to look at, breathtakingly filmed on location. It is a film with the courage to be about complex, sweeping emotions, and to use the star power of its actors without apology.Also,Meryl Streep provided an excellent performance as Karen despite being on-screen most of the time with Robert Redford,who somewhat delivered an unnatural American performance in portraying his Danish character.While film director,Sydney Pollack applies craftsmanship and restraint to a classic plot curve of longing, fulfillment, and loss, and although the denouement is a bit overextended, he never yields to facile, insistent sentimentality wherein his effects are honestly won.Overall,it managed to be a masterpiece inspite of its glaring flaws.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"7 October 2012","score":"","review":" Fresh off his successful television series Miami Vice, Michael Mann returns to the big screen with a landmark psychological thriller. Based on Thomas Harris' second novel Red Dragon, this film is the first in the Hannibal Lecter series and possibly the best by far.Former CSI lead William Petersen excels radiantly as emotionally scarred FBI Agent Will Graham who is about receive a last-chance opportunity from his boss Jack Crawford (played by the always admirable Dennis Farina). An opportunity to catch an enigmatic serial killer called The Tooth Fairy with a metaphysical quest to shadow the 'Red Dragon' based on William Blake's painting of the same name. In order to enter the killer's theoretical mind, Graham must confront the man that severely damaged his reputation&#x85;Hannibal the Cannibal.As masterfully played by then-unknown Brian Cox, the enquiringly misspelled Dr. 'Lecktor' is presented here as a contrast to Anthony Hopkins' portrayal. Instead of the eccentric and socially refined Hannibal, Cox gives the viewer a restrained and intangible depiction in the form of a normal-looking prisoner. From a film-goer's perspective, this is the most ingenuous version of the title character that the I've ever seen. Now, don't get me wrong Hopkins certainly deserved his Oscar and the acclaim, but Cox has accomplished more in 10 minutes of screen time than Sir Tony's monopolizing scenery-chewing in Red Dragon. The next paragraph brings me to the Tooth Fairy himself, Francis Dollarhyde.The tremendously talented and always under-appreciated Tom Noonan has been type-cast throughout his whole career as the baddie. Noonan's riveting performance successfully brought out his undiscovered talents to the forefront. Just watch the scene in which he grants a slide show of the victims' families to sleazy tabloid journalist Freddie Lounds (Stephen Lang) for evidence. In the book, Dollarhyde was given a detailed past of his abusive childhood and personal motivations. However, none of this is revealed in Manhunter because we are more concerned with Graham's investigation rather than how Dollarhyde came to be. And I'm so glad that the Dragon tattoo was never in the final version otherwise, this film would have never been taken seriously.The one scene that really stood out was the grand finale between Graham and Dollarhyde. Set to Iron Butterfly's psychedelic opus In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, this confrontation was choreographed perfectly, edited flawlessly and photographed impeccably by Dante Spinotti. From watching that sequence alone, that could have been a movie of its own for that matter.The one question that comes to the mind Can Graham ever come out of Dollarhyde's darkness? Find out for yourself!
