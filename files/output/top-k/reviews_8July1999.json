[{"date":"8 July 1999","score":"6 out of 23 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie is just your basic, sappy, pathetically romantic boy-meets-leopard story.  You know the type.  If you've ever been around a person who's in love with a dangerous predator, I don't have to tell you how annoying it is to be around them; those subtle googly-eyed looks they keep throwing at each other are just a little more than most of us can take. Sadly, this movie is just more of the same.  I mean, don't get me wrong. We've all been there.  Who can resist the shy, flirtatious glance of a large spotty beast?  I mean, we're only human.  I'm not saying I'm in any position to judge.But as tragic as this love affair ends up, it's a little hard to sympathize with the guy.  I mean, get a clue.  Most of us are smart enough to limit our love interests to members of our own species.  It's kind of a common sense thing.  Dating a man-eater is just asking for trouble.  I haven't even had a lot of dating experience, but I can tell you that much, right off the bat.  I mean, seriously, am I wrong?  Doesn't it always end up the same?  There's a misunderstanding, someone gets hurt, and before either one lets down his guard enough to show a little empathy or forgiveness, one of them is lying in a pool of his own blood.  It's sad.  Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against the director of the film.  She had some extra time on her hands and decided to adapt a short story by Balzac to the big screen. Sure, why not?Problem #1  The short story was written by a guy named Honore de Balzac.  Hello, people.  Who names their kid Honore?  It almost sounds French, for pete's sake.  His parents were probably pretty wacked-out and maybe they thought if they gave him a French name it would make him seem really smart or something.  As if the name Balzac weren't bad enough by itself.  He had to have been beat up a lot as a kid, and it's no wonder he ended up with a twisted mind.  Let's consider the source here.  But that's not even the biggest problem.Problem #2  It's not like the Balzac story starts out Once upon a time there was this man, and he met an attractive leopard.  I mean, it starts out pretty dang normal.  It's just this random guy talking to this random lady.  Then the random guy decides to haul off and tell her this wacked-out beastly love story that he'd heard from some other guy a few days ago.Problem #3  The guy he'd heard it from was DRUNK at the time.  Okay, we know that Balzac was twisted and wacked-out.  But he did have enough sense to know that man\/leopard love stories are generally a little hard to swallow.  He didn't expect us to believe it, for crying out loud.  He sure as heck didn't expect us to repeat it to anyone.  All he was trying to say is that drunk people sometimes tell wacked-out stories.  I think we can accept that.  I think most of us can agree with that observation.  And the random guy who heard the story by the drunk guy, and then told it to this random lady, was probably drunk, too.  We don't know that he wasn't.  We don't have any evidence that he wasn't drunk, or schizo, or just totally wacked.  He might have totally changed the guy's story and made it even more twisted and wacky, just for fun.  Maybe the random lady he told it to was really twisted and weird, and she liked to hear wacky, twisted stories. Maybe that's how they got their thrills, by telling perverted wacky stories to each other.  It could happen.Problem #4  The short story by Balzac, like most short stories, is short.  Movies, including this one, are around 90 minutes long. Fortunately, there is a lot of sand in Jordan to fill in the inevitably long empty spaces.  But it would have been better if Currier, instead of making a full-length movie, had made a 30-minute blurb about a drunk guy telling wacked-out stories.  It would have been more interesting.Problem #5  The guy who told the story (the one that was DRUNK) was an old Napoleonic veteran who had severe sun-stroke.  At least, I bet he did. He was drunk, and he was telling a story about something that happened to him maybe 40 years ago while he was lost in a sweltering desert without food or water and only a lot of sand to look at for weeks.  Get a clue.  As if anyone who heard him tell this wacky story was going to be like, Wow, did that really happen?, unless they were drunk too.  I mean let's get a clue, people.Problem #6  The guy, who was drunk, told this wacked-out story soon after watching a show by a wild animal tamer.  Gee.  I wonder where he got the idea for this twisted, wacked-out story about a wild animal.  If he had just come out of a bingo game, he would have made up a totally different wacky story, like maybe about how he had built a national monument out of bingo cards in a desert, or something like that.  And then some weird twisted wacko would have made a movie based on that, maybe.Come on, people.  This is what happens when you try to make a movie out of a story that was written by a wacky guy named Honore, about an old drunk guy telling a twisted, weird story.  Let's think about this for a minute.Now don't get me wrong, because I think Balzac was a genius.  He knew some twisted person would try to make a movie out of his story some day. Prove to me that he didn't.  I'd like to see you try to prove it to me. He had to know that some twisted weirdo would make a movie based on his short story and that it would be so looney that it would make him look like a freaking genius, by comparison.  That's the only reason he would have written something like this.And that's what I like most about Balzac.  Oh, yeah, he was twisted, all right.  We've established that fact.  But he wasn't a total wacko or anything.  That's one of the things I like about Honore de Balzac.  He was pretty smart.  He probably thought about making movies, but decided that writing stories would just be better.  You have to give him that much, anyway.But the movie ... well, let's just say it was pretty wacked-out.

Paul Verhoeven's Robocop was more a foray into social satire and definitely superior to its sequels. It mimicked the society in which we live or did rather in 1987 and portrayed a robot that was more human than the automaton characters that surrounded him. Robocop 2 doesn't have time for social satire, he's too busy bustin butt and blown stuff up.Frank Miller better known for his much acclaimed comic books, (which could explain the comic book feel of the film) wrote and Irvin Kershner (Never say never and Empire Strikes Back) directed this inevitable sequel, that should have been called Robocop 2 Back to Cash In!  It's basically a rehash  of the first with less heart and none of the subtle style and  undertone.  So as you can imagine Robocop busts bad guys with sufficient style and finesse, he gets beat up only to come back in a climactic showdown, and saves the day in what has to be one of the best fight scene's in recent cinema history. It almost saves this film.Sure its nothing but a blatant attempt to part you from your bottom dollar but if you allow it, it will entertain you enough not to care.  It brings home the bacon as an action film with a high body count and some big explosions.  Peter Weller does Robocop really well (like Arnie does The Terminator really well).  However Tom Noonan who portrays the role of Cain, the drug lord  and all around evil master mind really lets the bad guys down, something about a villain that looks like a hippie that tends not to scare me. It's really doesn't offer you anything new as film, but it has some good laughs and it is kinda cool to see Robocop stopping crime in a way that only Robocop can.

An underestimated and unfortunately forgotten masterpiece !The story is excellent, and it gains its inspiration directly from the european classical Legends originated from the períod of the Arabic invasions in southern europe a long time ago. Although the movie takes place a few years ahead, it is able to retain that enchanted atmosphere of those early legends. Portugal and Spain are filled of similar tales like the one in LADY HAKE altought this story takes place in France.So, just for the story this movie is worth seeing. And RICHARD DONNER made a fantastic job directing it. Great atmosphere, excelent action scenes and beautifully filmed romantic moments in the best classical way possible. The photography is out of this world and it turns every ordinary landscape into a unique fantasy world. Sometimes we don´t even remember this story is set on France, because it seems like we are watching a true TOLKIEN fantasy world.All this is done without a single flashy Hollyoood type special effect. Only by the use of the camera and a fantastic job from the director RICHARD DONNER. LADY HAWKE , is the proof that Fantasy movies don´t need to be attached to lots of special effects to create a Fantasy world. All it takes are some simple, but very good ideas, an excellent art direction, a good casting and a director with a feeling for it.The casting couldn´t be better. All of them make a fantastic and believable work. Michelle Pfeifer couldn´t be more perfect and Rutger Hauer is the best knight i ever saw in a fantasy movie, and an excellent actor as usual.And this movie has some small, but excelent details that maybe will go unnoticed by everybody, who don´t have interest in history. They could have taken them out for that matter, but it´s obvious they made an effort to make this world as accurate as possible. For example Rutger Hauer´s character, the knight NAVARRE, rides a farm horse, not the usual heros pure breed horse that we see in Hollywood adventures. And besides being the hero, he treats everyone wich is inferior to his condition like dirt. He´s very arrogant to the peasants for example. Altough we can see he´s not a bad guy, he´s just a man of its time.  All this is historicaly very acurate, which for a change is something nice to see in a knights movie or in an american movie as a matter of fact. Not that i care much about it, but i think those details only add more quality to LADY HAWKE.Many complain about the soundtrack, but i don´t think it´s that bad. The music adds a diferent atmosphere to the movie, and there are some beautiful moments in it, where the music makes it all even more atmospheric. Maybe it´s the weakest thing in this movie, but it sure doesn´t do any damage.So everybody go get LADY HAWKE ! IT´S THE BEST FANTASY MOVIE EVER ! A true MASTERPIECE ! It´s time this movie gets the praise it deserves !

Only by the use of the camera and a fantastic job from the director RICHARD DONNER. LADY HAWKE , is the proof that Fantasy movies don´t need to be attached to lots of special effects to create a Fantasy world. All it takes are some simple, but very good ideas, an excellent art direction, a good casting and a director with a feeling for it.The casting couldn´t be better. All of them make a fantastic and believable work. Michelle Pfeifer couldn´t be more perfect and Rutger Hauer is the best knight i ever saw in a fantasy movie, and an excellent actor as usual.And this movie has some small, but excelent details that maybe will go unnoticed by everybody, who don´t have interest in history. They could have taken them out for that matter, but it´s obvious they made an effort to make this world as accurate as possible. For example Rutger Hauer´s character, the knight NAVARRE, rides a farm horse, not the usual heros pure breed horse that we see in Hollywood adventures. And besides being the hero, he treats everyone wich is inferior to his condition like dirt. He´s very arrogant to the peasants for example. Altough we can see he´s not a bad guy, he´s just a man of its time.  All this is historicaly very acurate, which for a change is something nice to see in a knights movie or in an american movie as a matter of fact. Not that i care much about it, but i think those details only add more quality to LADY HAWKE.Many complain about the soundtrack, but i don´t think it´s that bad. The music adds a diferent atmosphere to the movie, and there are some beautiful moments in it, where the music makes it all even more atmospheric. Maybe it´s the weakest thing in this movie, but it sure doesn´t do any damage.So everybody go get LADY HAWKE ! IT´S THE BEST FANTASY MOVIE EVER ! A true MASTERPIECE ! It´s time this movie gets the praise it deserves !

An underestimated and unfortunately forgotten masterpiece !The story is excellent, and it gains its inspiration directly from the european classical Legends originated from the períod of the Arabic invasions in southern europe a long time ago. Although the movie takes place a few years ahead, it is able to retain that enchanted atmosphere of those early legends. Portugal and Spain are filled of similar tales like the one in LADY HAKE altought this story takes place in France.So, just for the story this movie is worth seeing. And RICHARD DONNER made a fantastic job directing it. Great atmosphere, excelent action scenes and beautifully filmed romantic moments in the best classical way possible.

Myself and three friends were about to have the privilege of seeing a private screening of The Blair Witch Project, supposedly, and based on dozens of reviews, the scariest movie in a long time, if not the scariest movie ever made period. I had read nearly 100 reviews of this film, from novice critics to established professionals, and all but about 7 declared Blair Witch to be a truly unsettling terrifying film experience.I am 44 years old...have grown up with horror movies...loved horror movies since I was six...been part of horror movies...wrote and directed a documentary about what is probably the BEST horror movie ever...and have been a radio, newspaper and magazine film critic since 1980. Needless to say I know what a good horror movie is..should be...and was nervously looking forward to having the living hell scared out of me.We waited until complete dark, then ran Blair Witch Project at 1130 PM. 87 MInutes later we all sat around and stared at each other unable to speak. Finally I said it first uh...is that the same film we've heard so much about?...because if it is...I want to know what was supposed to be so scary...so terrifying...so creepy about it. For the next hour or so we analyzed and scrutinized Blair Witch, offering what we thought was good and the overpowering majority of what was bad.We all agreed that it was an interesting idea, although heavily borrowed from Cannibal Holocaust. We thought the 'you are there' style was good and the performances of the unknown leads was mostly very good.The basic plot has a group of filmmakers, headed up by a loud-mouth bossy lady 'el direktor,' heading out to do a documentary on the legendary Blair witch that supposedly still haunts a certain area in Maryland. After interviewing some locals, and listening to some fairly creepy stories, the kids head into the very same 'haunted' woods to do some filming, video-taping and audio recording. Daytime is spent yelling, cussing and getting more and more lost. Night time is filled with sudden awakenings to creepy sounds and voices. Of course the camera and mike goes on every time to 'capture' this spooky stuff...and we know that things are only going to get worse for these movie makers. The movie history tells us that the group came up missing and all that was found was footage and audio tapes. The movie is an edited version of what was recovered. I'll stop right here with the description.We all contended that a few elements were indeed creepy...but what was intended to be oh-so-scary was pretty banal when you got right down to it. You turn a light on and shine it in any part of the woods late at night and you'll get the creeps. If all around you are eerie voices and footsteps, you get the hell out of there, you don't run holding a heavy camera and keep on filming. That's done in Blair Witch Project more than once and it's simply silly and downright unbelievable, marring the 'supposed' REAL terror engulfing these people.Admittedly the final twenty minutes of Blair Witch Project gets intense with the promise of something truly nightmarish to come. It never happens. The movie has no end..no explanation of any kind. The final image on the screen is puzzling and frustratingly vague but not provocative.I fully agree that psychological terror is great and the more that is left to the imagination...the better...but Blair Witch Project leaves so much to the imagination, coupled with what is obviously improvisational 'play acting' and numerous contrivances, that it just doesn't work nearly as well as it should have, although the potential was certainly there. At a time when horror films are pretty much overrated teen-oriented soundtrack selling 'crap,' it would have been nice to have something original and frightening. I'm still waiting. Blair Witch Project is not that film and it doesn't come close to living up to all the hype.We agreed that if we hadn't heard anything at all about this film in advance, at best it would be regarded as a direct-to-video film with an interesting concept that produces a few chills and tense moments, but nothing profound or overly effective. Keep in my mind, this is my opinion, and the opinions of my movie-loving buddies. If Blair Witch Project scared the hell out of you and you love it...great. You have a right to your opinion as well. Although I'm glad I got to see it, and I will probably see it more than once, it remains an interesting over-hyped colossal disappointment. On a 1-100 scale 68.

I have been wanting to see this film for a long time due to the fact that Scorcese directed. My father made the comment that movies should never not demean any religion(He is not a Christian). Yet when I found out that this film was now available in the state I went and got it. There was word that it was banned in Oklahoma. But who cares? I found the title to be quite strange yet it made all the sense in the world when the credits were rolling. The fact that Christ is portrayed as a man who has to come in terms with his own reality is just as much as any man's. Our minds have told of The King of Kings and other such Easter weekend movies. We have been programmed to see Christ as that and nothing less. This is a challenging movie Believe in what you cannot comprehend or see.

We also get to see how some of the characters (as C3-PO and R2-D2)get involved in the saga. The movie is played by Liam Neesan in the role of Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn, Ewan McGregor as Obi wan Kenobi, Natalie Portman(Queen Amidala\/Padme) and Jake Lloyd(Anakin Skywalker). The movie is fun to watch but lacks of that charismatic spark, between the characters, that made Star Wars a movie franchise. The main problem is that the story is lead by the character of Qui Gon Jinn, whose too calmed attitude makes him boring in most of the scenes, to the point that makes you wonder if Neesan wanted to appear in the movie in the first place. Even his relationship with Obi-Wan, is that of a Batman with a Robin that never seems to get things right. There aren´t really enough scenes in which the characters interact with each other, to get to know them enough to finally make an impression in you. The clearest example of this is Darth Maul (Ray Park), whose character you don´t even remember that was in the film after you watched it. Important scenes between Anakin and Padme are suddenly cut before you get to realize the importance of the characters in the saga. So in the end all the characters, as Obi Wan puts it in the movie, are another pathetic life form that joins in the journey.

The time when Hollywood trots out it's worst of the summer.  You know the drill.  There's a Godzilla every year, somebody has to be it. Wild Wild West clenches the title hands down this summer, and we still have eight weeks to go!The Will Smith phenomenon has now entered it's third phase overwhelming ego project. Teaming with his Men In Black director Barry Sonnenfeld, Smith has finally teetered over the edge and released an outright mess.  A film that will hang in the halls of all time bad event flicks. Should we blame Smith?  I think so.  Men In Black and Independence Day were gigantic hits, they even call the 4th of July Big Willie Weekend due to these successes. I submit that these films were hits due to the films themselves, the writing, acting, directing, and not just because of Smith.  West is finally the film that rests on Smith's comedic shoulders alone.  The truth shines through clearly.  Not everything Will Smith does is funny.Based in the television show running from 1965-1970,  the simple plot tells the tale of a Civil War era federal marshal James West (Smith), who must team up with a weapons expert (Kevin Kline, at his most painfully unfunny) to thwart the evil plans of the villain, and legless, Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh).  Along for the ride is a giant mechanical tarantula, President Grant, and the stunning, gorgeous, lovely, and just plain old hot Salma Hayek.  The plot is just a simple excuse to push the characters through endless scenes that give birth to no laughs at all.  Scenes that make the audience gringe with fear, as if something wrong is with them. Fear not my good people, these are professionals up on screen, and they blew it.The screenplay, credited to FOUR writers, has the damnedest time to make any of the jokes funny.  You would not believe just how far the cast goes to make this limp material work. It's embarrassing to watch, and even more embarrassing for the actors. There is not one funny moment in the film, not even a courtesy laugh for the attempt.  Dead silence. I also disapprove of the attempt to squeeze racial jokes into the mix.  Yes, Will Smith is African-American, but do we need to call attention to it every five minutes?  The movie would've been better served had it left the race issue alone and just played up the potential fun of the concept.Will Smith is simply miscast as the hero. He's an amiable actor who's proven himself with stronger material.  This film clearly shows just how paper thin the Smith charm can be. While Kevin Kline tries but fails as well, it's really Hayek's role that's a mystery.  She's barely in the film, and when her character is explained, you come to realize that she's not apart of the story at all.  Hayek has always been a fun performer with winning personality. All this movie asks of her is to be the butt (literally) of a few jokes and keep the cleavage coming.  A shameful waste of talent.Director Sonnenfeld has also been at the helm of better pictures (Get Shorty), but for some reason I have yet to see a truly great film directed by him. There always seems to be a spark missing from the action, like a better, funnier film was in there somewhere but he can't find it. Relying in great amounts on special effects and the considerable use of easy-to-spot green screen shots, the typical Sonnenfeld camera work is either buried under all the mayhem or just not inventive when the attempt is actually made.  This is a very top-heavy production with little chance to breathe.  But Sonnenfeld made this choice, he must be held accountable for it.The movie has been through many edits, and this shows with wildly out of tune continuity and many unexplained plot twists.  Also grating on the brain is Elmer Bernstein's annoying and featherweight musical score.  While we have Warner Brothers shamefully trotting out it's We pray it's as big as the 'Men In Black' Will Smith rap tune, Bernstein provides a flat score that serves no purpose to enliven the film.  The cinematography is also without color, and the catering probably sucked too.Wild Wild West is the product of zero imagination.  A lifeless summer film that seems to stick out even more in this unusually good movie season.  I am always wary of comic westerns, and this film seals that envelope.   If this is what 160 million buys you? I'll take the 3 million South Park any day.------------ 0  ","genre":null},{"date":"8 July 1999","score":"87 out of 154 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's that time of year.

Teaming with his Men In Black director Barry Sonnenfeld, Smith has finally teetered over the edge and released an outright mess.  A film that will hang in the halls of all time bad event flicks. Should we blame Smith?  I think so.  Men In Black and Independence Day were gigantic hits, they even call the 4th of July Big Willie Weekend due to these successes. I submit that these films were hits due to the films themselves, the writing, acting, directing, and not just because of Smith.  West is finally the film that rests on Smith's comedic shoulders alone.  The truth shines through clearly.  Not everything Will Smith does is funny.Based in the television show running from 1965-1970,  the simple plot tells the tale of a Civil War era federal marshal James West (Smith), who must team up with a weapons expert (Kevin Kline, at his most painfully unfunny) to thwart the evil plans of the villain, and legless, Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh).  Along for the ride is a giant mechanical tarantula, President Grant, and the stunning, gorgeous, lovely, and just plain old hot Salma Hayek.  The plot is just a simple excuse to push the characters through endless scenes that give birth to no laughs at all.  Scenes that make the audience gringe with fear, as if something wrong is with them. Fear not my good people, these are professionals up on screen, and they blew it.The screenplay, credited to FOUR writers, has the damnedest time to make any of the jokes funny.  You would not believe just how far the cast goes to make this limp material work. It's embarrassing to watch, and even more embarrassing for the actors. There is not one funny moment in the film, not even a courtesy laugh for the attempt.  Dead silence. I also disapprove of the attempt to squeeze racial jokes into the mix.  Yes, Will Smith is African-American, but do we need to call attention to it every five minutes?  The movie would've been better served had it left the race issue alone and just played up the potential fun of the concept.Will Smith is simply miscast as the hero. He's an amiable actor who's proven himself with stronger material.  This film clearly shows just how paper thin the Smith charm can be. While Kevin Kline tries but fails as well, it's really Hayek's role that's a mystery.  She's barely in the film, and when her character is explained, you come to realize that she's not apart of the story at all.  Hayek has always been a fun performer with winning personality. All this movie asks of her is to be the butt (literally) of a few jokes and keep the cleavage coming.  A shameful waste of talent.Director Sonnenfeld has also been at the helm of better pictures (Get Shorty), but for some reason I have yet to see a truly great film directed by him. There always seems to be a spark missing from the action, like a better, funnier film was in there somewhere but he can't find it. Relying in great amounts on special effects and the considerable use of easy-to-spot green screen shots, the typical Sonnenfeld camera work is either buried under all the mayhem or just not inventive when the attempt is actually made.  This is a very top-heavy production with little chance to breathe.  But Sonnenfeld made this choice, he must be held accountable for it.The movie has been through many edits, and this shows with wildly out of tune continuity and many unexplained plot twists.  Also grating on the brain is Elmer Bernstein's annoying and featherweight musical score.  While we have Warner Brothers shamefully trotting out it's We pray it's as big as the 'Men In Black' Will Smith rap tune, Bernstein provides a flat score that serves no purpose to enliven the film.  The cinematography is also without color, and the catering probably sucked too.Wild Wild West is the product of zero imagination.  A lifeless summer film that seems to stick out even more in this unusually good movie season.  I am always wary of comic westerns, and this film seals that envelope.   If this is what 160 million buys you? I'll take the 3 million South Park any day.------------ 0  ","genre":"Action, Western, Comedy"},{"date":"8 July 1999","score":"87 out of 154 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's that time of year.

What is surprising for a summer hit is that it is coherent and has a plot, albeit a simple one.It is 4000BC and Egypt is mighty. A great pharaoh rules and beside him his concubine, whom none but the monarch may so much as touch. Ah! But envy, lust and greed conspire against the pharaoh and he discovers his beautiful concubine trying on the head priest for size. Oh but what's this? They love each other, they say. Tough, says the pharaoh. Oops, scratch one pharaoh. Then scratch one head priest and concubine at the hands of the vengeful bodyguards. But death is not enough for the head priest. He is cursed to be the living dead.Still here, okay, jump forward to 1929, take one ex-foreign legionnaire just in from the desert with a treasure map showing the way to an ancient Egyptian necropolis, add one fresh faced, pretty English archaeologist and her roguish brother, and send them all off to find the loot.Of course, other parties are interested in the booty and nobody knows that amongst the loot is the cursed tomb. Right next to the loot actually. So close in fact that it is mistaken for it and the silly lot open the head priest's sarcophagus. From here on in it is monsters, chases and, rather interestingly, plagues.The gradual regeneration of the mummy from rotting corpse to general bad character at large is a triumph of computer work - no plodding baddie wrapped in rotting bandages here, you know. Brendan Fraser's character is a bit thin but he performs well enough. Rachel Weisz is very good but then her character has a bit more, er, character. Okay, the idea is preposterous and the people only semi believable, but it is fun and has a plot. That, in the summer, is very rare indeed.
