As a Final Fantasy fan, this was even more of a must-see. And I can say that in both terms, I was not disappointed in the least bit. I can out that theather wishing to go right back in and watch it again and again.Anyone will agree with me that that animation is astounding. Doesn't matter who you are. But for you nitpicky people out there, there is nothing else in the world that compares visually to Final Fantasy. This is a huge step for the animation world. They never said was was damn near perfect...but it was a definately a huge bound, so give Sqaure a break, they did a brilliant job there. And how can you complain about the visuals when the visuals were enough to get some people in to see the movie. And for those of you complaining about why they couldn't have used real actors. Let me ask you this, how cheesy would this movie looked had it been done with live action? How utterly fake would that have looked. Because everything is animated, you're more easily drawn in to this reality, it's more realisitic, yes I DID SAY more realistic. And I do not believe real actors have anything to fear. This breakthrough in animation allows for more fantastic adventures and fantasies to be told to an audience, it doesn't take away the life and blood of the actors and actresses today. I mean, think how much better Star Wars could be with this type of animation. Then, George Lucas could have his definitive view of the universe as he saw it and now have to deal with funny, childish looking puppets. And with the prequels, you can see how fake the scenes with both live actors and animated ones seem. If it had been all animated, it would have looked more believable than it ever could now. Also, for those of you who complain about the hackneyed storyline, when have you ever seen a story like this look so good???Now onto the Final Fantasy part of the movie. Any true gamer would have known instantly from just the trailers that this was not based on any Final Fantasy game. But the elements were there. Remember, this movie was also done by the Japanese and is not full blown American work, thank God. The theory of Gaia(not Gaya as some of you idiots spelled it) is something that has been in the Final Fantasy games again and again. It's nothing new. If people were more open-minded to different philosphies and just took everything in rather than complain every waking second, things would have made more sense. And it couldn't have made more sense, they explained every single thing enough to make it easily understood for any dunce out there. And also remember that each game's story is told in 50-plus hours, this movie was told in less than 2 hours. Something that is normally a huge and epic story is condensed into something extremely small. It's not going to be the greatest story ever told. Had Square taken the time to tell us the whole story as they would have intended it, this movie might have taken decades to finish. And there is no way you can honestly complain about this dialogue if you liked the ones in Titanic or Star Wars The Phantom Menace. And those of you that didn't even understand the ending really never even watched the movie, it was that simple. Although the music was not done by the same composer that worked on the games, it was still wonderful and complimented the movie perfectly. Especially the end song, that made me feel as if I had just finished a Final Fantasy game looking at the scene and listening to the song The Dream Within.All in all, there's no other score I can give this movie than a 10. Go see this movie and be open minded about what you see. Don't be so quick to judge and you just may enjoy this movie a lot more than you think.

Regardless of what the critics have said, I thought this was an incredible movie and is by far Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bays best.  The movie appears to be very accurate and believable (as opposed to another Bay\/Bruckheimer collaboration which was a piece of trash called Armageddon).  Ive heard some say that the whole love story is irrelevant to the film, but I say it is very important to the film. Without it, we just have a bunch of people that we end up not caring about.

If you are the type of person who doesn't appreciate every minute of your life or the people around you, then you may just need to see this film, and learn to appreciate its full potential.This film is original and clever in story, interesting in premise, acted sharply by its well-rounded cast, directed in a manner made all the more absorbing, and edgy and humorous enough to keep me going. Before I go on any further, let it be said that an actor by the name of Kevin Spacey rocks! Okay, now that I got that off my chest, let's go on.How about Thomas Newman's score? Usually I never really care about the score, let alone notice it in films. But, when there wasn't any dialogue in certain scenes and just the music, it also helped make the movie more absorbing. From the hauntingly eerie music that's in the background when we first meet Ricky when he's filming Lester and Jane in the kitchen to the music we hear when Lester dreams about Angela in the bed of roses on the ceiling.With that said, I feel as though Alan Ball may just be becoming my favorite screenwriter these days, he's very smart and funny and with this film and the series Six Feet Under to his credit, makes me want to see more films he plans to write in the future.And whenever Spacey took center stage, man stand back, cause that guy will suck you back into the thick of things, like he did to me! Having said that, this film is definitely a film to be savored by people who are in touch with themselves and appreciate a frank, sometimes brutally honest, look at their pathetic and drab existence. I personally enjoyed the strong performances by the cast, especially Spacey and the friend of his daughter, played by Mena Suvari, the finale, which seemed like it was going one way but then kept curving back every now and again, and the dark humor, which filled many of the scenes. Certainly an overly valiant effort from first time director Sam Mendes, who seems to have a solid grasp on the pulse of characters going through varied difficulties in their lives. So check this film out for yourself and see how you feel. It may just help you appreciate certain aspects of your life much better. Just look closer...

The cast of Brendan Fraser, Rahel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Kevin J.

From the moment it opens the audience is transformed to a world where the impossible is possible. I believed this movie. It had a heart at its centre and a truth far beyond anything that has been filmed in the genre of late. Boris Karloff fans and admirers of the original 1932 version will be disappointed, but please give this one a shot. It has all the elements of those old classics and more. Sommers has done his homework on this one replete  with all the Egyptian lore. I think though he excells in capturing the feel of the time and essence of flawed chracters.

You accept these idiosyncrasies as endearing traits and either root for them or boo them depending on the side you take. Particular attention should be paid to the music. Jerry Goldsmith scores a big one here. His lush love themes and expansive melodies (epecially the Caravan and the Camel Race) are reminiscent of Lawrence of Arabia. If I could give this one more than a ten star rating I would. All I can say is, I reccomend this movie highly. Don't come to it with pre-conceived prejudices from the bad reviews or other comments.

This is a film in which the plot exists only as a thinly-veiled device to set up scenes of dinosaurs attempting to consume people.  Spielberg's mistake with The Lost World was that he seemed to think he was doing something bigger and more glamorous, and he fell short.This is a movie out to have a good time; it's a Saturday matinee Ray Harryhausen monster spectacular, and it has it all.  The effects, as expected, are incredible.  The dinosaurs are more real than ever before, including a few choice cosmetic touches such as more interesting skin colorations, and little dorsal spikes.  The raptors benefit the most from this, since we have earlier comparisons, but the work is excellent all around.Does it make a lot of sense?  Not particularly.  Would a predator really single-mindedly pursue a meal across the island when it could just as easily return to its own territory?  Would a pteradon pick up a human being without spearing him with its talons, then present it to its young still alive and kicking?  Clearly, the answers to these and many other questions is no, but does it really matter?  This is a monster movie, not a Discovery channel special.The biggest problem is with the appearance yet again of the velociraptors. This is their third bow as the villains, and they're getting a bit old. With some two hundred species catalogued, was it really necessary to keep going back to the well on these?  Fortunately, the new species that are featured are well-used, particularly the pteradons, whom I personally have been waiting for all along.It also touches (briefly) on the effect that an island of living dinosaurs would have on the world.  How interested would paleantologists be in digging up fossils if they could just fly out to Isla Sorna and watch live specimens?  Would rich, risk-taking tourists buzz the island looking for thrills?This is a solid adventure\/monster film in the tradition of the 60's and 70's classics.

Because he probably killed the careers of every actor in this movie. The first Scream was pretty decent, the second was disappointing, but not all bad, and Scream 3 is just plain DULL! There's nothing left in this franchise to hold my interest. You'd think since the first Scream was fairly original and innovative, that there'd be something new and fresh in Scream 3. But it's all the same boring scenes and killings that were in the first two, just with different actors. In the original Scream film they made a point to almost mock and make fun of typical slasher films. Now this series has just become everything that the first film set out to make fun of. I knew about 30 minutes into this film that I was going to hate it. But once they revealed the BIG SHOCKING ENDING, all I could do was laugh. Laugh really loud, and really hard. And I wasn't the only one in the theatre doing so. If you're going to waste your time and rent this, you'll at least be entertained by the music. That's about all that kept me watching.

The opener was impressive (if a little familiar), and it took a while to get going properly, but when the action kicked in, I for one had a great time. It was also reasonably witty and the characters, while lacking in depth, were likeable enough. It was clear that the principals really were tromping around and hanging off a real mountain for the majority of the movie, as well. Maybe it was the melodrama that put people off? There are certainly plenty of intense, anguished close ups and shouting matches as the hackneyed characters sort themselves out, and these are more amusing than anything, but I was really only expecting a mountaintop action yarn, and that's what I got. Shenanigans with volatile canisters of nitro were a bonus as far as I was concerned, even if their presence did mean the audience had to suspend disbelief totally. I seem to recall the other patrons in the theatre got into it as much as I did.

There is a sort of light-hearted jovial attitude to this whole war business, as if everyone is just out to have a good time.  Whenever Alex Baldwin's character spoke, it made me feel like laughing.

And yet, I found myself enjoying this whole film and wanting to see what came next for almost the entire three hours.  I did not ever get bored.  I laughed (sometimes when other people were crying, but hey, that's why you get when you write lines so sappy that they get stuck in the audience's hair) and I cried (mostly during the battle scene).  And that battle scene, wow, what a tremendous piece of work.  Just non-stop gripping action for an hour.  I guess my main comment on a film such as this is that I feel guilty for liking it because I believe that some of its images are so NOT the way life (or history) is.  Everything is just too easy in this flick.  But I guess if one accepts it as entertainment, then, eh, whatever.

Farrell is the standout in what is a largely unknown cast, but all the actors do solid work here and this is the sort of film where, I predict, we'll be seeing more of these actors in the years to come, the kind of film that introduces a solid new group of unknowns who go on to make names for themselves.  _Tigerland_ is a great film and one which will appeal to a wide range of audiences.
