[{"date":"25 September 2015","score":"","review":" Poor Heath. Gone too soon. I would much rather remember him as the high spirited William Thatcher who impersonates Sir Ector, than as the sick Joker in Batman. A swashbuckling comedy-drama with jousting being the popular sport in fashion of the 14th century. I hadn't seen this film in years, and it almost made it into the reject pile as I am thinning out my Disc Collection. This film should be a bomb but it is just too much fun. Beautifully photographed in Prague, but with everything wrong modern songs, inaccurate dress, mannerisms, and dialogue. Tons of very intentional anachronisms. Note both The London Eye and The Eiffel Tower! It's like they are daring you to find all the goofs in the movie! Worst-fitting modern song is Taking Care of Business by BTO, but both Queen songs (Rock You and Champions) fit nicely, as does David Bowie's Golden Years. Chaucer wears only a smile and does a Rear Monty twice. He champions Will's fame and writes his Knight's Tale. Some rough slapstick, but very little gore for a film of this type. (Like Richard Lester's Musketeer movies). Even the villain (Rufus Sevell as Count Adhemar) is almost likable, until he strips William of his fake Royalty parentage, puts him in stocks, and beats the daylights out of him. Then, Prince Edward princes by and proclaims him to be Sir William. An impossible ending, as William wins his fatal jousting match against The Count without his armor and with the heavy lance strapped to his badly damaged arm! Of course he wins the Beautiful Princess, and it all goes down like a fairy tale. A great Saturday Afternoon popcorn movie, just don't take it too seriously. Slight nudity (men and women) so a bit too bawdy for little kids. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 September 2015","score":"","review":" Poor Heath. Gone too soon.

I remember how gobsmacked I was when I first watched it as a young teenager. That haunting boy choir melody takes me immediately back to the first time I saw it and gives me a chill!This is a film that beautifully blends two elements that don't always go well together comedy and horror. It gets it so right I'm not even sure how Joel Schumacher pulled it off. The serious and scary characters like Kiefer Sutherland's menacing David are offset beautifully by Sam, and the Frog brothers.These two sides of the film sit neatly beside each other without ever really coming together until the climactic end. It would have been very easy indeed for this film to end up neither funny nor scary but somehow it manages to be both through neat dialogue, simple jokes, and outstanding pacing.I sat through this again last night for the first time in years and I savoured every minute, and was stunned to see a lowly rating of 7.2 on here. Poor show IMDb reviewers. The blistering soundtrack is just the icing on the cake. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 September 2015","score":"","review":" The Lost Boys is a truly excellent film.
