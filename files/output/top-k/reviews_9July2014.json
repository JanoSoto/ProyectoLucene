[{"date":"9 July 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Derived from a short story of the legendary sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick (who was always decades ahead of his time) this amazing movie is truly an all-time classic for me. A story that turned into an epic sci-fi thriller in the hands of S.Spielberg, Minority Report is a very good combination of different genres and themes. One of the most amazing aspects of this film is that it has a very unique neo-noir visual style achieved by pastel blue tones, dark shadows and rain (Also some bypassing and color corrections were applied into the films negative in the post production process.) The climax point of the movie for me is where precog Agatha asks a three word question when she is taken by John Anderton IS IT NOW? Worth watching over and over again.
