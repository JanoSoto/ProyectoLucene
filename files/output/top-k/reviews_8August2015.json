It deals with the media's fixation on lurid, disgusting human beings and the violent acts they commit, glorifying such spectacle and pouring salt in the wound simply for rating. Robert Deniro plays NY detective Eddie Flemming, a burnt out hero cop who stages busts so the press can see him in action and get the scoop. When two demented, psychopathic eastern European guys come to town to collect an old debt, they go on an impulsive crime spree and discover that by filming their crimes and peddling the footage to a sleazeball news network they can gain money, and notoriety. Fleming and a rookie arson investigator (Ed Burns) are soon on their trail as their rampage reaches feverish heights of heinous villainy. Karel Roden, an astoundingly good Czech actor, gives the best work of the film as the lead nut job, giving us a grinning, cunning, joker esque portrait of evil. MMA fighter Oleg Taktarov is deadpan good as his child like, brutish companion. Kelsey Grammar plays the amoral, smutty news anchor expertly, and there's great work from David Alan Grier, Melinda Kanakaredes, Vera Farmiga, and a nice cameo from Charlize Theron. The film knows it has to be unpleasant to get its point across, and has fun with the twitchy, almost Tony Scott like excess of style. The heart of the film rests with Roden and Taktarov though, follow in them almost like protagonists and letting them do their thing, like a nightmare, Slavic version of Laurel and Hardy. It's a deliciously twisted little flick with some cool ideas, a great cast and a cheerfully trashy style.

On that level it works amazingly, and nostalgically for me, it's one of my favourite Arnie films. It just has such a palpably evil atmosphere, and good old fashioned supernatural adventure to it that's awesome. Arnie plays Jericho Cane, an alcoholic, tormented private security expert with a sketchy past. When he and his partner (Kevin Pollak) are tasked with protecting a high profile VIP, an assassination attempt is made, and they start to unravel a dark,possible doomsday plot in the making. The man they are protecting (Gabriel Byrne) happens to be none other than Satan himself, hiding in human form, and trying to track down the one girl (Robin Tunny) that he must copulate with before midnight in order to bring about the end of days upon our world. Oh yeah. Byrne brings a gleeful, carefree, alpha male malice to the role, and is one of my favourite cinematic incarnations of the devil ever. Although it's a pretty implausible, fantasy action headbanger, it has a sense of purpose and duty to its own mythology, and takes it seriously, which helps a lot. Hyams also steps in for DP, and there's some truly awesome shots of New York, from dingy back alley chases to helicopter propelled vistas. Schwarzenegger is surprisingly poignant in the role, only allowing his trademark camp to surface once in a while (you ah ah choiahhboyy compared to me, ah choiahhboyy!! Is my favourite). Tunny diligently plays the female lead with understandable confusion, but also noble grace when the heat gets hot. Miriam Margoyles is a terrifying little goblin as her evil Aunt with ties to the cult who raised her to be Lucifer's bride. Udo Kier, in his few scenes, is chilling as the head of the cult. The film has a chilling vibe that raises it above the level of other smash and grab Arnie action opuses, a vibe that's almost reminiscent of classic John Carpenter. The eerie soundtrack adds to the haunted house fun,me specially when old Satan first appears in NY as a giant invisible beast and meanders around looking for a human host. If you're looking for slimy supernatural fun anchored by a midnite movie style concept and some awesome at atmospheric chills, look no further.

The folks there fear the return of three former residents, who are now vengeance minded outlaws. Despite the rather nasty actions of the stranger, the townsfolk decide that he's their best bet to protect them from the wrath of these outlaws.The stranger makes himself at home, and takes advantage of the locals when they bend over backwards to make him happy. Eventually, he commands that they re-paint all the buildings red, and the place is re-christened Hell.Clint is at his low key best, displaying that effortless charisma in the role of a man who doesn't exactly go out of his way to endear himself to anybody (much less the audience). Yet he's hardly that out of place since the locals are - Bad Day at Black Rock style - complicit in some tragedy and barbarism in the past.The widescreen photography is beautiful, as is the stirring music score by Dee Barton. With the help of an excellent crew (also including art director Henry Bumstead), he creates a lot of impressive atmosphere. The viewers will also notice how absolutely brutal the action is, with a lot of gunshot violence and death by whipping.The cast is peppered with a lot of familiar faces and wonderful character actors.

It's not a perfect film, but it's a great time at the movies, pure spy escapism and cinematic pleasure. Val Kilmer plays Simon Templar, a mysterious, slippery international thief who takes dangerous employ from anyone willing to pay a night, discreet price for his unique talents. He also uses an elaborate range of disguises, with alias names coined by the Catholic saints. He is hired by a shadowy Russian billionaire (Rade Serbedzija) to steal the formula for a cold fusion device from a beautiful scientist (Elizabeth Shue). Naturally he falls in love with her and they end up on the run from the billionaire, his forces, MI6 and everyone in between. It's not a heavy hitting action romp like it sounds, but more of an atmospheric, romantic, theatrically inclined bit of intrigue, and a whole lot of slow burning fun. Much of the action takes place in gorgeous, picturesque Moscow, giving it a lovely, old world, almost John Le Carre esque feel. Kilmer is awesome, underplaying every disguise and clearly having a lot of fun, his own Templar identity a moody mix of guilt and passion. Shue takes the gorgeous scientist cliché and spins it for a believable, humbled character which works excellently. There's cool work from Alun Armstrong, Valery Nikolaev, and a cameo from Emily Mortimer as well. For fans of spy adventure flicks with a globetrotting, master of disguise sense of adventure, this one spins a tale worth tuning into.

A number of sharp one-liners and the outrageous methods employed by Detective Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) provide a lot of laughs but additionally, his interactions with his new female partner and his incompetent superiors create a whole series of other situations which are also great fun to watch.Harry, of course, is a walking anachronism and a male chauvinist and these qualities often get him into trouble. He does, however, have a recognised talent for dealing with some very challenging cases in a particularly forceful way and it's this ability that frequently enables him to extricate himself from the difficulties that his behaviour leads him into.When Callahan and his partner Detective Inspector Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum) arrive at a liquor store robbery where the gunmen have taken hostages and demanded a car, Callahan simply gets into his police vehicle and drives it at great speed through the store-front windows before shooting and killing all the robbers. His quick, simple and effective way of dealing with this dangerous situation isn't appreciated by his superiors who promptly transfer him from the homicide division to the personnel department.In his new role, Callahan takes part in a series of interviews with candidates who are being considered for promotion to inspector and openly shows his disgust at the imposition of quotas to ensure that a requisite number of women are appointed to these posts. In one interview with a candidate called Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), his questions reveal that she's spent all her career doing office work and has no experience in the field and has never even made an arrest. Callahan's scepticism about promoting people with no proof of their competence in the field leads to him being branded a Neanderthal and his concern about their safety on the streets is also summarily dismissed.After DiGiorgio is killed attempting to arrest a group of terrorists who are in the process of stealing rocket launchers, explosives and a variety of other weapons from a munitions warehouse, Callahan is reassigned to homicide with a new partner, Detective Inspector Kate Moore. The way in which this unlikely partnership tracks down the terrorists who try to hold the city of San Francisco to ransom, surprisingly leads to them becoming friends before their mission reaches its action-packed climax at Alcatraz Island.It's interesting that in Magnum Force Callahan's attitude to vigilantism changed because of what happened in that story and similarly, in The Enforcer, his experience of working with a woman who showed her competence and bravery, leads to a certain softening of his attitude to the idea of women working in the homicide division. With his eyes narrowed and his teeth clenched, Clint Eastwood again does a good job of showing Callahan's disdain for various types of people but it's in his scenes with Tyne Daly that he shows greater subtlety as Callahan's new partner gradually starts to win his respect and friendship.

A number of sharp one-liners and the outrageous methods employed by Detective Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) provide a lot of laughs but additionally, his interactions with his new female partner and his incompetent superiors create a whole series of other situations which are also great fun to watch.Harry, of course, is a walking anachronism and a male chauvinist and these qualities often get him into trouble. He does, however, have a recognised talent for dealing with some very challenging cases in a particularly forceful way and it's this ability that frequently enables him to extricate himself from the difficulties that his behaviour leads him into.When Callahan and his partner Detective Inspector Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum) arrive at a liquor store robbery where the gunmen have taken hostages and demanded a car, Callahan simply gets into his police vehicle and drives it at great speed through the store-front windows before shooting and killing all the robbers. His quick, simple and effective way of dealing with this dangerous situation isn't appreciated by his superiors who promptly transfer him from the homicide division to the personnel department.In his new role, Callahan takes part in a series of interviews with candidates who are being considered for promotion to inspector and openly shows his disgust at the imposition of quotas to ensure that a requisite number of women are appointed to these posts. In one interview with a candidate called Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), his questions reveal that she's spent all her career doing office work and has no experience in the field and has never even made an arrest. Callahan's scepticism about promoting people with no proof of their competence in the field leads to him being branded a Neanderthal and his concern about their safety on the streets is also summarily dismissed.After DiGiorgio is killed attempting to arrest a group of terrorists who are in the process of stealing rocket launchers, explosives and a variety of other weapons from a munitions warehouse, Callahan is reassigned to homicide with a new partner, Detective Inspector Kate Moore. The way in which this unlikely partnership tracks down the terrorists who try to hold the city of San Francisco to ransom, surprisingly leads to them becoming friends before their mission reaches its action-packed climax at Alcatraz Island.It's interesting that in Magnum Force Callahan's attitude to vigilantism changed because of what happened in that story and similarly, in The Enforcer, his experience of working with a woman who showed her competence and bravery, leads to a certain softening of his attitude to the idea of women working in the homicide division. With his eyes narrowed and his teeth clenched, Clint Eastwood again does a good job of showing Callahan's disdain for various types of people but it's in his scenes with Tyne Daly that he shows greater subtlety as Callahan's new partner gradually starts to win his respect and friendship.

Can Someone explain to me why is III in your opinion so much better than The Lost World Jurassic Park is? In my opinion III lacks on the story and is not terrible because Steven Spielberg did not Direct the movie but it is terrible because the whole movie makes no damn sense it is too short, it lacks on the story and is really awful to me. It has no character development in III at all and lying to Dr. Grant and trick him on that island is just inhuman and awful. And Why is Jurassic World so much better than The Lost World Jurassic Park? I am sorry is not better than the second movie. In my opinion is not, but is at least better than Jurassic Lark III is but is not any better over The Lost World Jurassic Park (1997).An Underrated classic sequel in the series and the last movie directed by Steven Spielberg. I have enjoyed this movie much better than Jurassic Park III and Jurassic World. The movie is very bashed and criticized by their fans of the first film. Just like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom this is the sequel that is very bashed from critics and fans again. This is the first and unfortunately last great sequel to the original Jurassic Park. I think Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore did a good job on there performances. The Lost World Jurassic Park is like Godzilla T-Rex in San Diego. I still love This movie a very underrated science fiction\/action sequel film in The Jurassic Park entry franchise. I think for it's sequel it had a good start running. The Lost World Jurassic Park is loosely based on Michael Crichton's 1995 novel The Lost World.The film won 1 award for Best Effects and Visual Effects. Things I don't like The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate itThe daughter of Ian is black in here,which makes to me no sense since Ian is white. Vince Vaughn was unnecessary to cast him and unneeded. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn,this is a science fiction\/Action film not a comedy Vince get this in your head! Vince stole Roland Tembo bullets for his shot gun and with that action Vince jeopardized and put whole people in the camp in the mortal danger and T-Rex come after them and eat bunch of people cause of him. Roland could shot the T-Rex and save people and because of Vince's action he couldn't. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn for this. I am glad he was cut by the end of the film.Peter Stormare\/Compys sequences from swarm of Compsognathus knock him and killing him were really unnecessary and unneeded etc.), plus it has a sluggish pace and such.Baby T-Rex in this movie was extremely annoying and his yelling in the trailer and in the car it annoyed me so much and on end of the movie.Thing's I love in this movie T-Rex dinosaur in a city San Diego, the chase and eating people in the city are awesome. Ian and Sarah drive to the amphitheater harbor and pick up the infant. They make sure they bait the creature with its infant and drive back to the docks and place the infant in the cargo hold of the ship.Sarah prepares a sedative dart and shoots the T. Rex as Malcolm closes the cargo hold door, trapping the animals inside. Awesome! Surviving hunters travel through an open field of tall grass. Ajay tries to warn them, shouting DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! but none of them listens and are killed one by one by Velociraptors.Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Tembo as famous animal hunter was awesome, I seriously I love the actor and his character, He came to Isla Sorna along with his hunting partner, Ajay Sidhu, in hopes of gaining the ultimate trophy and not for the money a male T. Rex.He survived in this movie. A shame a good actor Pete Postlethwaite died 4.years ago and he is not with us anymore. Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park (1993) and Julianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding did a good job on there performances.Returning of John Hammond his nephews Tim and Lex the same actors from Jurassic park (1993). Tim and Lex had a brief cameo but John did had a cameo on the end of the movie. Daughter Kelly to do some a gymnastics and kick a little raptor trough the window was really a bad ass awesome.Cgi and the film effects wasn't that bad either they were really good. John Williams did return as music composer and he did return with his theme music score. Like its predecessor, The Lost World Jurassic Park was scored by famed composer John Williams (a longtime collaborator with director Steven Spielberg).John Williams didn't write a stereotypical sequel score, but instead developed a wildly different style for the different location, cast, and darker tone of the second Jurassic Park film.I love Jurassic Park (1993) as everyone do but I also love The Lost World Jurassic Park. NOTE I still take this movie over Jurassic World and over Jurassic Lark III anytime.The Lost World Jurassic Park is a 1997 American science fiction adventure film.

Starts with an euphonious voice-over (by an uncredited Irving Pichel), Huw Morgan (McDowall) recalls his earlier life with his parents Gwilym (Crisp) and Beth (Allgood), as well as his five elder brothers and an elder sister Angharad (O'Hara). His father and all his brothers work in a coal mine, and Angharad grows an affection towards the new preacher Mr. Gruffydd (Pidgeon), and the feeling is mutual. After a happy marriage of the eldest brother Ivor (Knowles) and Bronwyn (Lee), life begins to show a stern face towards the family. In the spirit of beating the drum for the traditional family values, the Morgans stick together, against all the havoc, and as parents, Gwilym and Beth have to accept the departures of their children when mining jobs slump and an enveloping danger regards to the danger index of this line of work. For Huw, his rite-of-passage is also composed of violence and prejudice, McDowall is the sole leading actor here, a staggering child performance with earnest compassion and empathy; Crisp portrays a quintessential steely father with benevolence under his rugged surface, and Allgood is a great scene-stealer as the tough mother, abiding by her family relentlessly, occasionally, she can also give audience a good laugh to appease the daunting reality, both nominated for Oscar and only Crisp won the trophy. Although Pidgeon and O'Hara are first billed, but their story doesn't fill up too much screen- time to be considered as the lead, Pidgeon's indignant deliverance in the church before he leaves embodies an archetype of Hollywood machination of hyping up a catharsis during its climax, considerably it was soul-inspiring to behold at then, but retrospectively speaking, its gloss has lessened since the method has become universally in the cinematic realm, now, it is barely an asset for new audience. Winning 5 Oscars, including BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR and SUPPORTING ACTOR, the film can be listed as one of the most embarrassing winner, not a bad movie at all, only it revealingly reflects that the academy is not as prescient as what we give its credits for, which is a rather unfortunate gauge befalls on this one, otherwise, we could appreciate it more as a John Ford's brainchild.

The mistrust and paranoia that these beliefs engendered were palpable and duly reflected in some of the most successful political thrillers of the time which included Three Days Of The Condor.Joe Turner (Robert Redford) is employed as a reader by the American Literary Historical Society which is a cover for the CIA. He's part of a team that spends their time reading everything that's published in the world and feeding data into a computer to identify any possible secret or coded communications. Recently, he'd flagged-up interest in a mystery novel that had been translated into an unusual combination of languages.One morning, after leaving the office to buy lunch, he returns to find that all his co-workers have been shot dead. In a state of disbelief and panic, he phones his superiors from a call box to apprise them of what's happened and an arrangement is made for him to meet a couple of his colleagues who'll take him to a safe location. Turner attends the meeting but when an attempt is made on his life, realizes that the killings at his office must've been ordered by someone within the CIA. Now labelled as a rogue agent, he goes on the run and in his desperation to hide somewhere, kidnaps a lonely photographer called Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway) so that he can lay low in her apartment.At Kathy's apartment, he survives another attempt on his life by a hit-man who masquerades as a mailman and as the couple start to trust each other, they pursue Turner's boss Higgins (Cliff Robertson). Eventually, it becomes clear to Turner that an autonomous group within the CIA had devised a plot to invade some oil fields in the Middle East to avoid any future disruption to supplies to the United States and his report on the suspicious novel had been the catalyst for the massacre at his office.This movie starts off brilliantly with the shocking events at Turner's office and quickly establishes the strong sense of anxiety and mistrust that's maintained all the way through to its tremendous conclusion which does nothing to alleviate the tension. Robert Redford does a great job of portraying Turner as a very ordinary guy who's bewildered by what's going on but is also sharply aware of how high the stakes are. Faye Dunaway gives a sensitive performance as the woman whose photographs reflect her feelings of loneliness and isolation and who, after being held captive by Turner, becomes his lover and helper. Cliff Robertson and Max von Sydow (as a very cold, business-driven assassin) also stand out in their supporting roles.Three Days Of The Condor was understandably a great box office success at the time of its release and remains tense, intriguing and gripping throughout.

Willa and Vince mistakenly thinks that Rollo is a ladies man. After an incident, Rollo is demoted. Willa is still fascinated by Rollo's supposed womanizing and Vince has even crazier ideas for the zoo.This is a real disappointment and a giant step down from the same crew that made 'A Fish Called Wanda'.

It's like the gang decided to pile on wacky things on top of wacky things. But none of it is funny. If it has any chance, the movie should have started in the zoo. The opening at the corporate office is a waste of time that achieved nothing.

I watched and waited and hardly any of it was funny. Some of the predicaments were humorous, but the characters just weren't likable. I love John Goodman but his character was a psycho that didn't have very many great lines. Buscemi's talent was just wasted. I found The Dude to be stupid and clueless and how he survives each day is mind boggling.I did enjoy some of the characters and they were funny, but nothing near what I read from reviews. I have seen all of the Coen films and this is the only one I did not thoroughly enjoy.
