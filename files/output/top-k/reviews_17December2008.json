Campbell Jr. novel it was based, with an updated screenplay by Bill Lancaster (son of Burt), and directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, Starman), this is a special effects extravaganza. Basically an alien ship crashed to Earth, and then we see a helicopter circling an Antartican snowfield, trying to shoot a dog, and this is where American researchers work in their facility. They let the dog into their facility, but what they don't realise is that it is an alien copy, and it is only when they see the remains of a mangled body they discover and realise this Thing can transform and take the appearance of anyone amongst them. Everyone is now a suspect, because they don't know who is the Thing, and one by one, the unlucky few are suffering the horrific terror attacks to it. The only way to determine the alien is taking blood and putting it in a dish, to see reaction to a hot needle, and they have to make sure all other remains of it are with it to be destroyed. Starring Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford Brimley as Dr. Blair, T.K. Carter as Nauls, David Clennon as Palmer, Keith David as Childs, Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper, Charles Hallahan as Vance Norris, Peter Maloney as George Bennings, Richard Masur as Clark, Donald Moffat as Garry, Joel Polis as Fuchs and Thomas G.

It is almost unbelievable to think that absolutely every effect in this film was created by animatronics, no CGI whatsoever, and you have to remember that things and people are being ripped apart, and they still move! The story is good, the acting is as good as you can get, and the special effects, what can I say, a good horror classic. For some reason it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Musical Score for Ennio Morricone, I'll admit it isn't amazing, but it's not that bad. It was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments.

Although I was aware of its availability as a Special Edition DVD from Anchor Bay, I eventually acquired it from ulterior sources but, ironically, my copy sported a compromised aspect ratio which squashed the characters somewhat and no manner of fiddling with the picture settings on both my DVD and TV remote had any effect on remedying the situation! Anyway, it's a typical if not exceptional entry in its sub-genre (of which I was clearly fonder upon first viewing) &#150; though possessing stronger visuals (shot by Stanley Kubrick regular John Alcott, no less) than plot or characterization; we also get the obligatory rousing score (courtesy of Lee Holdridge) and which I actually still recalled from the time of my first viewing all those years ago!

In fact, for all the film's adult-oriented elements (read sexiness &#150; as in the afore-mentioned witches and a gratuitously naked Roberts having a riverside bath), the film mostly comes off as a child-like retread of CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982)!

It's one of a handful of sword-and-sorcery titles made around the early 1980s incidentally, I watched a number of these last Christmas (Arnold Schwarzenegger's three Barbarian efforts, ATOR &#150; THE FIGHTING EAGLE 1982, THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER 1982, etc.) but this is probably the only one that will make it this year. Although I was aware of its availability as a Special Edition DVD from Anchor Bay, I eventually acquired it from ulterior sources but, ironically, my copy sported a compromised aspect ratio which squashed the characters somewhat and no manner of fiddling with the picture settings on both my DVD and TV remote had any effect on remedying the situation! Anyway, it's a typical if not exceptional entry in its sub-genre (of which I was clearly fonder upon first viewing) &#150; though possessing stronger visuals (shot by Stanley Kubrick regular John Alcott, no less) than plot or characterization; we also get the obligatory rousing score (courtesy of Lee Holdridge) and which I actually still recalled from the time of my first viewing all those years ago!

Hawks and Wayne hated High Noon because veteran town marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) lost his nerve in a crisis when a quartet of hardcase gunslingers arrived in town to kill him. Kane's regular deputy quit on him and Kane resorted in desperation to citizen deputies to help him stop a revenge-driven villain that Kane had sent to prison. Hawks and Wayne contended that the professional High Noon lawman should have stood his ground alone. At the last minute, Will Kane's Quaker wife came to his rescue. Wayne didn't like the ending where Kane tossed his badge in the dust. Quoting the Wayne biography by Randy Roberts and James Olson, the Duke said, It's the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life. The last thing in the picture is old Coop putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Hawks puts his Rio Bravo protagonists in a similar crisis. Town sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) must confront an angry rancher and his army of trigger-happy gunmen after he arrests the rancher's younger brother for murdering an unarmed man during a saloon brawl. The primary theme of professionals versus amateurs pervaded Howard Hawks' movies and the highest tribute that any Hawksian hero or villain could pay to each another is that they were 'good' at their job. Unlike the weak-kneed High Noon hero, the heroic Rio Bravo lawman maintains his poise under pressure despite insuperable odds.After the disastrous box-office reception of his 1956 Biblical epic Land of the Pharaohs, Howard Hawks went into a self-imposed, four-year exile in Europe. Hawks made his comeback with Rio Bravo and assembled a stellar cast including Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Walter Brennan and Angie Dickinson in a thoroughly ordinary but often suspenseful oater about a fearless lawman who has to hold a killer, Joe Burdette (Claude Atkins of Return of the Seven), in jail until the deputy marshal shows up in six days to take him. Predictably, Nathan Burdette (John Russell of Unforgiven) isn't about to let Chance turn his brother over to the sheriff. A recovering alcoholic deputy, Dude (Dean Martin in his first dramatic role), and an old, crippled jailer, Stumpy (Walter Brennan of Sergeant York), stand alongside Chance. When one of Chance's loud-mouthed friends, Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond of The Searchers), tries to convince citizens to help Chance, Burdette's men ambush him in the street. Dude wounds the killer in the foot and Chance and he track him into a saloon where the patrons say they saw nobody enter. Meanwhile, the Wheeler's killer stands in the rafter dripping blood into a whiskey glass and Dude spots the blood and guns the felon down. Wheeler's ex-bodyguard Colorado (teen singing sensation Ricky Nelson of The Ozzie & Harriet Show) joins them after rescuing Chance in a street shoot-out. A lady gambler, Feathers (Angie Dickinson of China Gate), complicates matters in a romantic subplot. Eventually, Burdette's gang abducts Dude and arranges an exchange for Joe. The resourceful heroes thwart Burdette's plans to free Joe and kill Dude in an explosive finale. The entire picture looks like a metaphor for the Cold War and specifically the eve of the Berlin airlift about the Soviets bottled up the Allies and let nothing get into the city.The critics and the public hailed Rio Bravo as a superlative western, and Hawks was back on top again. Later, Hawks recycled material from the Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett garrulous screenplay and made El Dorado (1966) and Rio Lobo (1970) with Wayne who finds himself in a similar predicament facing long odds. Despite its popular and critical reception at the time of its release, Rio Bravo is far from being a classic western. Hawks himself has said in interviews that he detested dull pictures where the heroes stood around and palavered. Essentially, for most of its indulgent 140 minutes, the sympathetic Rio Bravo heroes stand around a jabber with several comic interludes involving a Hispanic innkeeper Carlos (Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez) over peripheral matters. The subplot about Feathers is clearly material that Hawks used in his first Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall thriller To Have and Have Not, but Wayne and Dickinson don't generate the same chemistry. The Rio Bravo heroes never seem like they are in jeopardy. They have time to argue and sing songs. Meanwhile, Burdette's bad guys lurk on the fringes. Aside from a miscast Ricky Nelson, who resembles Mickey Mouse with a pair of pistols, the cast qualifies as first-rate.Rio Bravo boasts many entertaining scenes and the Furthman & Brackett screenplay does an admirable job of setting up situations at the outset that they pay off at the showdown. Apart from its title credits scene, Rio Bravo emerges as a claustrophobic western that confines itself to the environs of the town with no wide open spaces. Academy Award winning High Noon actor Gary Cooper wasn't impressed and called Rio Bravo phony. Nevertheless, this memorable Hawks movie has acquired a reputation among many genre aficionados as one of the top ten westerns. Ironically, although its title refers to the famous river the separates Texas from Mexico, none of the Rio Bravo action takes place anywhere near it. Incidentally, there are three close-ups in Rio Bravo. The first one is Joe pulling his six-gun and firing it. The second is the blood dripping into the whiskey glass on the bar. The third is Dude's fingers trying to shape a cigarette out of tobacco and papers. Rio Bravo is a good western, but John Sturges' Last Train from Gun Hill with Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn tops it for drama, suspense, and action.
