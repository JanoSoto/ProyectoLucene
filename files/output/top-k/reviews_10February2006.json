It is rather unfortunate because Roger Moore was a capable Bond, and this and Octopussy both tarnished his image - I never thought he was very bad...his tongue-in-cheek humor was a nice alternative; taking over the role right after Sean Connery was always destined to be a mistake. No one can live up to The James Bond.In this film, Bond is sent into outer space (yep, that's right) to investigate into possible plans for mass genocide on the earth below. So basically what Bond assumes is that the space station floating around in orbit by the earth is being run by Damned Commies or whatever the typical villains are in this case - I guess they're more fascist.It is a pretty poor film. It's utterly unrealistic and at times waaay too over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek -- to the point of self-parody and absurdity, which in this particular case is a bad thing.It's easy to see the jump from exaggerated realism (Bond getting the girls, thwarting the baddies) to outright fantasy - orbiting space stations, plans for world domination via laser-induced mass murder...Nevertheless, this film WAS the basis for Doctor Evil's secret evil lair in Austin Powers, so we must credit it for at least providing pop culture with SOME benefit.

He travels on a bus from Texas to New York City trying to be a hustler. However, all he finds is his friend Ratso and a run down building with no heat. He never really seems to fully understand just how bad things are. Throughout the film we see unbelievable poverty, with Ratso stealing clothes and food just to stay alive. At the beginning of the film Ratso Rizzo seems like a character you should not like but somehow end up feeling bad for. Joe is so innocent that he stays with Ratso in this horrible situation; partly because he has no where else to go and also because he just wants to take care of his friend.This film uses a lot of flash backs to help us understand Joe's past; to see what he's running away from and where he wants to be. We are shown flash backs of his girlfriend who seems to have been attacked and taken away from Joe. We also see flashes of his grandmother who didn't care about him all much and leaving him alone all the time to go out. There is another clip in which we see who is probably his mother, giving him away to her mother. All his life Joe has been given away and left alone to fend for himself. However, he still doesn't know how to truly take care of himself.Voight and Hoffman's performances were excellent. Voight really showed his innocence with his facial expressions when he was confused or shocked. Hoffman's portrayal of a poverty stricken con man was amazing and a type of role I had never seen him in before. His limp and cough added a whole other dimension to his character and made us feel sorry for him. As he tries to teach Joe how to be a hustler in the big city, Joe never really learns anything and continues to get confused or thrown out of places. When Ratso gets really sick Joe finally agrees to take him to Florida. As their traveling, there is again a sense of hope with Joe. He feels like this is a new start and Ratso will be alright. However, this time he ends up alone again, holding his dead friend in his arms with no idea of what to do or where to go next.

Clue's cover-art\/poster exclaims, taking pride in its origins, and with good cause. Plenty of movies have inspired boardgames, but rarely does it go vice-versa. Clue is the exception, and it is exceptional. Everyone knows the story, whether they actually know how to play the game or not. Six strangers -- Prof. Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Col. Mustard (Martin Mull, of TV's Sabrina...), Mr. Green (Spinal Tap's Mike McKean), and the rest of the usual suspects -- are called to the hill-top mansion of the strange and sinister Mr. Boddy.Set against the treacherous backdrop of the Cold War, each of the six has some deep dark secret, and Mr. Boddy has the means to expose them all. But who is Mr. Boddy, and what does he want? There isn't long to ponder such things, as before too long, one of the guests has killed Mr. Boddy and put a stop to his deadly blackmail scheme. But who? Led through it all by Mr. Boddy's faithful butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry), the group must uncover the murderer's identity before the police arrive, and before they can strike again! Loaded to the brim with clichés, Clue is over-the-top fun. Director Jonathan Lynn (My Cousin Vinny, Sgt. Bilko) does a good job with a talented cast. But really, this is Tim Curry's movie and he is absolutely brilliant in it. While many films suffer from a poor endings, Clue has endings flying out the wazoo. It is the first (only?) movie to ever show a different ending depending on which theater you attended, and what night you saw it on. All three work well (though one is clearly best), and you can choose to watch each consecutively on the DVD.OVERALL SCORE 8.9\/10 = AQuotable and infectiously fun, you can't not have a good time watching this movie. Racing through the mansion as the film comes to its close, Curry is something to behold. A truly funny film.

The job Jackson does on this picture is truly amazing to say the least. His confidence to try mirimax and various other film companies to get a three film deal portrays his true devotion to these films and this ambition to create amazing works of film shines through. The Film from start to finish captures the magic of Tolkien's work in 3 hours of non-stop entertainment, ride of emotions and belief in the characters. The Fellowship of the Ring in effect picks up where 'the Hobbit' novel leaves of. We sees the main Character Frodo Baggins embark on the start of what will prove to be a long, emotive truly outstanding journey filled with love and Freindship. Beginning in the lowly free land of the Hobbits, the shire, we see the story unfold until Frodo begins his journey after a 17 year possession of the ring of Power eventually acquiring 8 companions to help him with this overwhelming task. The Fellowship i feel is the true heart of the trilogy and set of The Lord of the rings on its way to world fame in film.

We sees the main Character Frodo Baggins embark on the start of what will prove to be a long, emotive truly outstanding journey filled with love and Freindship. Beginning in the lowly free land of the Hobbits, the shire, we see the story unfold until Frodo begins his journey after a 17 year possession of the ring of Power eventually acquiring 8 companions to help him with this overwhelming task. The Fellowship i feel is the true heart of the trilogy and set of The Lord of the rings on its way to world fame in film. Elijah Wood portrays the character of Frodo so much to the extent that you become lost into the film. I feel however despite fantastic performances from Orlando bloom, Ian Mckellen and most noticeably Sean Austin, Viggo Mortensen Shines through in the role of Aragorn showing his character with strength passion and emotion. The Lord of The rings The Fellowship Of the Ring is a story of love, companionship,fantasy, courage and friendship and is vital to anybody who wishes to create a perfect collection of films because the Fellowhip truly deserves a place. This film is the true gem of the early decade and i hope it will remain timeless like its 2 counterparts.

It is sacrilegious to say this film is not the most amazing, perfect, beautiful film to ever have been made, so I won't say it... The effects are okay, and most hold up, but the sheer length of it is silly and the grooviness and heavy themes are not as interesting as people want to pretend. But then again, I was born after we landed on the moon. There's my review (Okay Space Odyssey lovers! There's your cue to click Not Helpful!!). Here's a summary Opening Scene pre-human beings encounter a black rectangular Something-er-other known as The Monolith and it transforms the primitives into tool-wielding smart guys.Act 1 Moon astronauts dig up The Monolith (40-feet below the surface of the Moon) and when sunlight hits the surface of it, it emits this horrible sound, which you the audience are supposed to figure out is a signal to the planet Jupiter (perhaps where the owners of The Monolith live or want their messages forwarded to at any rate) So The Monolith that made the Apes smart has been found in a place that only very smart humans could have gotten to. End Act 1.Act 2 Dave and Frank are now on their way to Jupiter. A lot of gee-whiz showing off of technical stuff follows. The on-board computer HAL 9000 fakes like there is a problem with a certain device. Dave and Frank who are awake (the other astronauts are in hibernation) work together; one inside and the other outside (EVA Extra-Vehicular-Activity) to fix the device. They both conclude that there is nothing wrong with it and are suspicious that HAL 9000 is full of it. They confer in what they think is private and tell each other frankly that HAL might have to be unplugged since he's gone wacky. Unbeknownst to either guy HAL can read their lips through the window of where they are talking and sees that they are going to deactivate his ass. So he tricks them into going outside into space. He kills Frank and locks Dave outside. While Dave figures out a way to get back inside the craft without his blood boiling, or him freezing to death (this sequence does kick butt, I have to admit)from exposure to space, HAL powers down the life support on the others in hibernation, killing them all. Once back inside, Dave immediately drops the powerful HAL down to Threat Level Zero. A video flickers on stating that the mission to Jupiter is secret and there is some freaky stuff going on there.ACT 3 Dave encounters The Monolith floating around out by Jupiter. He goes on some looooooooonnggggg ride through a bunch of lights and comes out very aged at the end in a weird house. He turns and sees himself even older, then older still. Then, reaching out from his death bed, he sees The Monolith. Which renews him as a fetus. The end.

In a sentence or 2, Norton's character struggles with self-worth, meaning and general self-loathing in a culture that has castrated what it is to be a man. That is, until a chance meeting with Pitt's character changes his life, signaling the creation of the violent, male becoming exercise of Fight Club (a brutal, secret, hand-to-hand combat ritual). This leads to a larger movement of cultural anarchy and revolution. Its a wonder the film got made because it is dark, misogynist, violent and left-leaning (all good in my book). FC is one of those films that can be life changing and get under your skin (particularly for men), with its messages of male self-awareness and identity, rage at the state of the world and vitriolic bashing of the consumerism, materialism, conformity and vanity that some of us see and detest. It is also one of those movies that is ripe for misunderstanding, as some people do not get it (the fighting, for example, is more a metaphoric exercise, not a call for frat guys to go punch each other silly). Pitt is a revelation, Norton is just as magnetic, and Helena Bonham Carter steals several scenes playing against type. I think the first 3\/4 of the movie is brilliant. It falls apart at the end for me on one thing (spoiler warning) - Pitt HAS TO BE A REAL PERSON, not a figment of Norton's imagination - even though they are clearly alter-egos in the metaphoric sense. Though the struggle is clearly Norton's own internal one, it has to be externalized, which it was for the 1st 3\/4 (this has been handled much better in much lesser movies- Bad Influence with James Spader comes to mind). When I learned the Pitt character is not real, it ruined it for me. Kind of like the it was all a dream ending you see in really bad movies. The attempt to go back at the end & stick Norton in all the scenes that Pitt was in is clunky & doesn't work. Just an opinion - still a fantastic film and an icon-making performance by Pitt.

It was hailed as the movie of its generation. But A River Runs Through It is the story about all generations. Long before Dustin Hoffman's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia, Norman Maclean and his brother Paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world. But how could a place like post WW1 Montana be a showcase for the American family, at a time when the Wild West still was not completely gone? Just what has Maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves? As the movie opens, Norman is an old man, flyfishing beside a rushing river, trying to understand the course his own life has taken. The movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness, against time's current and back to when he was a boy. He and his younger brother Paul were the sons of a Presbyterian minister and devoted mother. The parents fit snugly into their roles. Mom takes care of house and home. Dad does the work of the Lord. The boys ponder what they will be when they grow up. Norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad. Given the choice, little Paul would be the boxer, since he's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesn't even exist. The boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks, fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do, all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing. They are at similar points in their lives before college. But when Norm returns from his six years at Dartmouth, things are very different. Paul is at the top of his game. Master flyfisherman. Grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench. Norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life, even as his father grills him about what he intends to do. You're left feeling that at least to Pops, God will call you to your life's work. But you have to stay open and ready to receive it -- all your life. Father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate God's eternal words. Listen, their father urges. It's both Zen and Quakerly. Pretty radical for a stoic clergyman. But with all the beauty and contemplation, and even though the Macleans are truly a God-fearing, scripture-heeding household, how is it that Rev. Maclean's family is unraveling? Paul is true perfection as he fishes the river, but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing, while his family doesn't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed. Mom, Dad and Brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help. Pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm. But the junior brother is losing his grip. Norman starts getting his life on track, finding love and career, but Paul continues to slide. The family that loves him watches helplessly. Mother, Father, Brother flounder in their own ways trying to help, but none very effectively. How can a family that loves each other so much be so ill-equipped to handle this? How can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in God's nature, yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that God's peoples have made for themselves? These are all questions Norman will ponder his entire life. The eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him, yet keep their secrets. The movie is beautiful to watch. This is certainly God's country, and filming it won an Oscar. Director Robert Redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting, and it works well. But do go back and read the book, too.

The story (the headless horseman) is an American classic. The movie doesn't quite follow the original story but is a very good version. Johnny is great. Johnny's character (Ichabod Crane)is very different from the Washington Irving's character but Johnny plays it wonderfully, he is quite funny sometimes and you never know what is going in his mind. Miranda Richardson is fantastic as always (playing once more one of the bad characters), Michael Gambon as well. Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths and Ian McDiarmid are great actors but this movie does not show them at their best. Christopher Walken was great as the headless horseman, he was really scary (with those blue eyes and sharp-edged teeth who wouldn't?!). Christina Ricci was the one that disappointed me. Her character was not what I expected and she didn't seem very convincing to me. No offence. I hope it isn't taken because I think she's a good actress but this one didn't got out very well. The special effects were fantastic, the tree of the dead and the windmill scene... well you will see what I mean after watching the movie.

You either love it to death, or you pan it as the worst film you have ever seen. There really isn't any between ground, because it isn't necessarily the most audience friendly film on the planet (sorry). It has a long runtime, it's story is complex and somewhat muddled, it moves fairly slow, and there are periods in which nothing is said for 10 minutes at a time. However, if you're like me, you will truly appreciate the epic beauty and groundbreaking achievement that this film is. It is perhaps the most influential science fiction flick ever. Maybe even more so than Star Wars.To people who can truly appreciate the poetic vision that Stanley Kubrick had, 2001 is an unforgettable film. You have the majestic theme song (one I had heard before I knew of the movie), a truly classic villain (HAL 9000 in all of his creepy glory), and special effects that still hold up today as out of this world and glorious visuals.Though this film is fairly slow, I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen for the whole runtime. The special effects have a look and feel to them that looks 100% believable, maybe even more so than most viz fx today. The imagery mixed with the lovely orchestral music create images that will stick with you forever. And, being that it was released before man even landed on the moon, it is a truly visionary look at the then-future. It's amazing to see how close our world today is to that in the movie.The segment of the film with the astronauts with HAL 9000 is classic. The quiet atmosphere throughout the whole story sets the mood of a so-tranquil-you'll-kill-yourself feel. And once HAL 9000 gets some glitches, you really REALLY see the sh*t hit the fan. Everything about HAL 9000, the smooth and calm voice, the red light that always watches, and a computer with a desire to stay alive. Groundbreaking stuff.Though the story is muddled and the ending almost incomprehensible, the theme of the movie can really be applied to today. How humans have remained dependent on technology, from the humanoids in Africa to the astronauts on Jupiter, and how eventually us humans will not be the most intelligent life form in the universe.For anyone turned off by the ending, I would highly recommend reading the novel of the same name. It was released simultaneously with the movie and really sheds some light on the Monolith and the mission to Jupiter. It's as good as the movie, which is really saying a lot.That being said, 2001 is either a movie that you will love or hate.

The acting is great, the visuals get a thumbs up, and it's guided to its final destination by a deft filmmaker with a knack for creating suspense. Mel Gibson stars as former reverend Graham Hess, who has given up the faith after a freak accident takes his wife (ironic, as Gibson's next major film would be The Passion). Living on the family farm with his brother Merrill (the always excellent Joaquin Phoenix), they're scraping by and raising Graham's kids (Rory Culkin, the most talented of the Culkin clan, and Abigail Breslin). Unlike Harvery Keitel's character in From Dusk Till Dawn (Do you still believe in God, Daddy? Yes. I'm just not happy with him.) however, Gibson's Hess has given up the faith completely. There's no one watching over us, he tells Merrill.Soon, crop circles are showing up in his cornfields. His animals are going haywire. We know what's coming next, but what works about the film is the sense of claustrophobia the setting creates. A massive invasion is being launched across the globe, and not once do we ever leave the perspective of the Hesses, in their small farmhouse entrenched by cornstalks. Shyamalan understands that an audiences imagination will always scare them more than anything concrete, and teases us with shadowy figures. It works. The first half of the film is beautifully suspenseful. The first straight on shot of an alien is pure goosebumps.And then things kind of fall apart. Actually seeing the aliens, they look a lot less intimidating than we previously imagined. The level of tension drops. It's not gone, but it's nowhere near intense. Then Shyamalan goes for one of his patented switch-endings, which worked so well The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Here, not so much. In a way, it's good storytelling in that the movie begins planting the seeds of its ending from the very beginning. In the end, the pieces are all in the rearview mirror and it is exciting to watch it come to fruition. The problem is a logistic one; it makes no sense. For aliens with such a weakness to even attempt an invasion of Earth seems downright hilarious. Still, while this stretch seems far-fetched, at least the movie works (for the most part). Unfortunately, we can't say the same for The Village. Good call, M. Night. Way to follow up a dud with a stinker.OVERALL SCORE 7.0 = C+The score is inflated by an excellent first half and terrific acting that makes it worth watching. This is a movie that your senses will love, but your mind will reject. Still, if you can get past the twist, you will have a good time.

But simultaneously he is a petty delinquent for which he has already got a criminal record mainly for assaulting other people in street fights with the likes of him. Despite being a real genius he is also an insecure boy fearing life and love due to the very unhappy childhood he had, which makes it very hard that he can take advantage of his intellectual ability. It also leads him to be rude to those who want to help him since he doesn't trust anybody. All through the movie we see the work of the two men who try to bring him to life and to take conscience of his own value a maths professor and above all a psychiatrist who had his own problems in life too. This is shown in a brilliant way in terms of players' performances, images and dialogues with deep analysis of feelings and behaviours. All the players are excellent. A special reference to Minnie Driver as the boy's girlfriend with her spiritual and intelligent look and her moving reactions to some of Will's difficult to understand attitudes. This story is genuine indeed in terms of sentiments and actions and very well put on film. One of the best movies of its year.

Not when he was elected vice president of the United States (twice) and not when he was elected president of the United States (twice). He was a profoundly unhappy man given only to degrees of sadness. And while it will no doubt be open season on Nixon for its fast and loose approach to facts, you nonetheless walk out of the theater after 195 minutes of Nixon believing that Stone probably got Nixon's personality right. As one character in the film observes, He's the darkness, reaching out for the darkness.A sprawling psychodrama starring the unlikely Anthony Hopkins as the 37th president, Nixon embraces the gloominess, paranoia and vast contradictions that marked Nixon's tenure on the American stage. He was a Communist witch-hunter of the Joe McCarthy school who pursued improved relationships with the Soviet Union and China; a man who justified his own dastardly deeds by rationalizing that they weren't as offensive as those of his predecessors; the self-loathing product of a working-class family whose envy for the Kennedy clan knew no bounds; a hard-drinking, bigoted, profaning Quaker whose mother and father held to strict Christian codes; and a man who pursued peace in Southeast Asia by way of the most savage conventional bombing in history. Nixon is remarkable for the territory it covers and the passion with which it pursues its subject although it would be unusual for a filmmaker to come up short with such generous time in which to tell the tale of one man's political life. The chief failure of Nixon is we don't come away feeling we've learned anything new except that Stone, the obsessed conspiratorialist who concocted three hours of historical conjecture and called it JFK, is even willing to add Nixon to his list of the thousands who had something to do with John F. Kennedy's death. It's as though the self-destructive filmmaker tries hard to discredit himself. (His cheap-shot gay-bashing attack on J. Edgar Hoover, played by Bob Hoskins, seems excessive.) That Stone may understand on some intimate level Nixon's own worst urges -- the late president did, and Stone still does, take criticism far too personally -- is surely what gives Nixon its power to command our attention. Never mind that we've seen it all before, it is compelling material. The heart of Stone's film is Nixon's Watergate debacle. The cover-up. The so-called enemies list. And so on. But it's a history lesson, too, with Stone flashing back to Nixon's rise, fall -- the infamous You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore comment -- and rebirth in presidential politics, a path paved, as Nixon notes, by the bodies of the Kennedy brothers. Nixon is Stone's impressionistic portrait of the man. In this kind of film, the details are interesting, but almost beside the point. Stone seems fascinated by Nixon's drive to be a great man, and the demons that block his progression. People nowadays love to talk about the character question in politics; well, Nixon is the poster boy for that debate. That Hopkins neither looks nor sounds anything like Nixon is jarring. He attacks the role without the use of makeup or prosthetics, and never seems fully comfortable in the Nixon persona. Yet, that's precisely why the actor is able to locate the essence of Nixon the man, if not Nixon the mask. Nixon was a famously clumsy individual who appeared ill at ease in his own body, and so there is an accuracy in Hopkins' performance. The rest of Stone's acting bench is deep, talented and too voluminous to list. Still, a few stand out James Woods as H.R. Haldeman, Joan Allen as Pat Nixon (humanizing the former first lady for the first time), David Hyde Pierce as John Dean, Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Kahn as Martha Mitchell. Stone is not content, however, to let his actors and his script tell the story.

I thought aloud in a normal speaking voice, 'Be a fly on the wall and take in the scene babe, that's what it's there for.' Then, a few minutes later I hear her complain, 'they're holding the shots way too long.' Again, I thought aloud just above a whisper, 'But, isn't this a great shot of 'America the Beautiful' worth holding for a minute or so, even though it does break cinematic rules.Indeed, 'Heaven's Gate' is the fictitious accounting of the Johnson County Wars of the 1880's when land barons, cattle barons and other marauders in suits were having immigrants killed for stealing a cow or two to feed their families and themselves. Sam Waterston is the All American leader of 'The Association'', a group of even more incredibly ugly members of the Human race on American soil, breathing the same air of freedom as the enemy to their bottom line.

In my view, this film is a suck city production hardly worth the investment in celluloid and paper mache. An exercise in cinematic chaos that only an Italian director could get away with. Alright, to be fair, Suspiria does exude a certain flair through its use of color, lighting and soundtrack that keep it just this side of the to-be-burned trash bin. But in cinema, any cinematic genre, there are basic things that we commonly refer to as 'story' and 'editing' that are utterly missing from this kaleidoscopic jumble of images. It is as if they'd had a few grappas one night and someone got out the scissors, asked for the blindfolds and said, 'How about doing it in strips of five feet?' They could have run this film backwards and it really wouldn't have made much of a difference. Amongst the numerous WTF scenes is one where Suzy rolls a dolly into the bathroom after her phone is cut. Silver platters with a late night meal (luxury room service in a ballet school?) or trays of medicine? Who knows? She proceeds to toss half the ingredients into the toilet bowl. Superfluous close-ups that show little more than a napkin (sanitary?) and then she flushes. Next, a glass of some red substance is poured into the sink. Poisoned tomato juice, blood? It looks like paint. Why didn't she just flush it down the toilet as well like you and I would? So that she could proceed to scrub away at the now red-stained sink. Close-up again. The substance doesn't rinse away and now her hands are 'soiled'. This matter-of-fact exposition should end with a moment of drama where Suzy reacts with either frustration, anger, tears or at least curiosity. Instead Suzy saunters off nonchalantly to open a window which allows her to be duly attacked by the fat pigeon bat instead. By the way, was it only my copy, or is the sound of her whacking away at the beast timed to the upbeat when the whacking chair is above her head. Talk about sound synch!As for the horrific stilted dialogue, it reminded me of something between the narration of a Soviet travelogue and a Cliff notes-based high school play translated into English from...English by the Buenos Aires marching choir. Everyone in this movie speaks as if they had just graduated from a U.N. interpreter's institute. Flat, grammatically correct yet lacking emotional inflection. No soul, no umphh. In fact this film was probably dubbed into multiple languages using the same language school people. Bargain! The textbook dialogue peaks in the scene where the Rosa Klebb-ish ballet instructor throws Jose Feliciano the piano player out of the institute with a parting...Good Riddance. Straight out of a 1930s comedy.Family affair that this film was, Suspiria might have been tag-titled Dario vs The Argentos for the gap between a vision and its execution. It's a shame considering the money and effort that went into the Art Nouveau sets and other production values. Perhaps, this multimedia maze of a movie would better have been released as a simple slide-show with the random-sequence option permanently enabled. As it stands it's best suited for MST3K material. The Beast from Yucca Flats--now there's a movie that takes dubbing to new heights!

But in cinema, any cinematic genre, there are basic things that we commonly refer to as 'story' and 'editing' that are utterly missing from this kaleidoscopic jumble of images. It is as if they'd had a few grappas one night and someone got out the scissors, asked for the blindfolds and said, 'How about doing it in strips of five feet?' They could have run this film backwards and it really wouldn't have made much of a difference. Amongst the numerous WTF scenes is one where Suzy rolls a dolly into the bathroom after her phone is cut. Silver platters with a late night meal (luxury room service in a ballet school?) or trays of medicine? Who knows? She proceeds to toss half the ingredients into the toilet bowl. Superfluous close-ups that show little more than a napkin (sanitary?) and then she flushes. Next, a glass of some red substance is poured into the sink. Poisoned tomato juice, blood? It looks like paint. Why didn't she just flush it down the toilet as well like you and I would? So that she could proceed to scrub away at the now red-stained sink. Close-up again. The substance doesn't rinse away and now her hands are 'soiled'. This matter-of-fact exposition should end with a moment of drama where Suzy reacts with either frustration, anger, tears or at least curiosity. Instead Suzy saunters off nonchalantly to open a window which allows her to be duly attacked by the fat pigeon bat instead. By the way, was it only my copy, or is the sound of her whacking away at the beast timed to the upbeat when the whacking chair is above her head. Talk about sound synch!As for the horrific stilted dialogue, it reminded me of something between the narration of a Soviet travelogue and a Cliff notes-based high school play translated into English from...English by the Buenos Aires marching choir. Everyone in this movie speaks as if they had just graduated from a U.N. interpreter's institute. Flat, grammatically correct yet lacking emotional inflection. No soul, no umphh. In fact this film was probably dubbed into multiple languages using the same language school people. Bargain! The textbook dialogue peaks in the scene where the Rosa Klebb-ish ballet instructor throws Jose Feliciano the piano player out of the institute with a parting...Good Riddance. Straight out of a 1930s comedy.Family affair that this film was, Suspiria might have been tag-titled Dario vs The Argentos for the gap between a vision and its execution. It's a shame considering the money and effort that went into the Art Nouveau sets and other production values. Perhaps, this multimedia maze of a movie would better have been released as a simple slide-show with the random-sequence option permanently enabled. As it stands it's best suited for MST3K material. The Beast from Yucca Flats--now there's a movie that takes dubbing to new heights!
