Not more than a word was said, and I think that's the best compliment anyone can give this movie.  Out of all the teenagers and Gen-Xers that were in the theater, not one of us felt compelled to speak after watching this.  I can say that the opening sequence hit me harder than anything I have ever witnessed in my (albeit short) life. I found myself wrapping my arms around my knees, trying to hide my eyes but unable to avoid the horror unfolding on the screen.  I actually felt like somehow I was in danger.  The horror I felt as the soldiers stepped out of the boats into the gunfire was gut-wrenching.  All the movies we watch in school, all the History Channel specials don't even touch what this movie touched, honestly.  I never realized the horror of what D-Day and this war was until I saw this movie.  It took it out of the abstract and forced those of us who have never had to live through a real war to see it as they did. It makes me want to thank every one of the men who were in this war for what they sacrificed for those of us who live here now.  I don't know if I would be strong enough to handle it, and I hold as my heroes anyone who was.About the movie in itself, I actually thought the scenes at the beginning and end were touching.  A bit too theatrically staged, definitely, but I thought it was a nice beginning and end for the movie.  The battle scenes, enough said.  Phenomenal.  The one and only criticism I have is that I think the script was a little weak in its character development.  I had a hard time really feeling for the characters, and I think that maybe the battle scenes were emphasized so much that we lost who the men really were.  It's hard to develop characters while the audience is concentrating on gunfire. However, this was an excellent, excellent movie, definitely, a 9 out of 10.

Vampires defines a nice middle ground between the absolute carnage of Blade and the nipple-fest of Bordello of Blood. It's incoherent and laughable in parts, but hey, 90 percent of Hollywood movies are that and more.In Vampires, James Woods, who has made a career lately out of playing brooding, violent sociopaths, plays a brooding, violent sociopath who hunts vampires. It's drudge work to him, really, and he doesn't even get into the fun at the hooker hotel with his crew, who cavort with topless sluts under the benevolent smile of their priest. I'm NOT making this up!Well, in horror movies, anytime anyone has a good time partying and women go topless, people die. Sure enough, who shows up but master vampire Valek, played by Thomas Ian Griffin, who is a dead ringer -- pardon the pun -- for the lead singer of the '80s hair-wave band Youthquake.Valek does neat stuff like spinning people 'round, 'round, like a record baby 'round, 'round. Then he rips 'em in half and reaches through a guy's chest to strangle a woman. But the part that will endear him to the ladies is that he is apparently the best muffin muncher this side of the underworld. Oh, sure, they spread some bull about him biting her on the thigh -- don't believe it! He puts his mouth to good use, and turns her into some sort of pre-vampire mind slave.I know what you're saying, ladies. You'd turn into a pre-vampire mind slave for the right guy who knows how to seriously suck a girl's, ah, blood. Well, we find out about this plot development in a series of screaming arguments between the James Woods character (his name is Crow -- though, to his credit, he never tells the hookers to eat Crow)  and his sidekick, Montoya, played by the decidedly un-hispanic, definitely flabby Daniel Baldwin.Flabby. Did I say Daniel Baldwin is Flabby? He's bloated, for God's sake! His pants don't even fit, wardrobe couldn't keep up with him. Obviously Daniel's well-publicized off-screen battle with cocaine has reached a crucial stage. In the movie, Montoya is a cipher, but a bloated, glaze-eyed cipher who's in about as bad a shape as...well...ME! Can you imagine me getting into slice-and-dice tumble-fests with screaming, snarling rabid-dog vampires? I should say not.Anyway, after Valek crashes the party, Crow and Montoya escape with their lives and the pre-vampire mind slave Katrina, played by nubile nymphet Sheryl Lee.For reasons never really explained, the guys separate. Montoya checks into a sleazy motel with Katrina, and she wakes up the next morning tied up, face down naked on the bed. I believe it was at this point that every guy in the audience whispered aloud Ye-e-e-es.Anyway, as Katrina flails around, realizing how helpless she is, at the mercy of whatever dominating bad boy did this to her, Montoya wanders in and explains how he cleaned her up, mumble-mumble mumble. Yeah, sure. We're all thinkin' that bloated, jaded Daniel Baldwin is definitely a guy who knows how to make good use of a tied-up naked woman, some ice cream and lubricant.Meanwhile, Crow goes to meet his Vatican contacts. Previously, in one of his chummy screaming matches with Montoya, they'd established that the team had been betrayed. Well, one look at Maximillian Schell playing a Cardinal and I'm thinking Hmm...this ain't no walk-on. Maximillian probably sold Crow out to the Youthquake dude! Was I right -- read on!The middle part of the film is spent establishing that Crow is a sadist who likes to beat up priests, and that the filmmakers are sadists who like to decapitate priests, set them on fire, turn them into blood fountains (?!) and so on. Does someone here have an issue with the priesthood? Actually, there are S&M themes running throughout the entire film, even more than your average vampire movie. After being bitten by vampire-possessed Katrina, Daniel Baldwin's character, get this, actually SETS HIS ARM ON FIRE, even though he knows it won't stop the vampire process. Either that, or he was just particularly stoned that day on the film and they wrote it in. The vampire leaders are called Masters, and the followers are called Bottoms. Well, okay I made up that last part.Oh, and there's some incomprehensible plot point about finding some cross that will allow vampires to walk in daylight. Apparently Valek and his Youthquake cronies have been on a road tour of the Southwest looking for it for the last 300 years. The flimsy plot devices they threw into place makes no sense. But then it makes no sense that shooting vampires with high-caliber ammunition not only doesn't hurt them, but doesn't leave a mark on them. Yeah, Vampires has its flaws.But what it all boils down to is a big fight at the end. Who shows up but the Cardinal -- and he's working for the Youthquake bad guys! Well, I was just shocked at that!The Cardinal gives some lame excuse about losing his faith, not being able to believe in God, deciding a vampire's eternal life was the only option open for him. I'm thinking The only reason I'd become a vampire is for the endless kinky sex. But sex doesn't matter to Catholic priests, so what's he joining up for...unless priests ARE into kinky sex. Nah...can't be.Sadly for Valek, he makes the classic James Bond mistake of not killing the hero right away, but saving him for an especially evil, especially slow death. Naturally, Crow comes back and kicks his ass. No big surprise. But luckily, the movie makers did take one final opportunity to tie up Sheryl Lee. Ye-e-e-e-es!What happens to Daniel Baldwin's character is so especially lame and stupid that I won't even go into it. Maybe he was just wandering around on the set in a drug haze as James Woods frantically improvised dialogue, I don't know.All in all, I'd say see this movie before the Republicans take over and make films like this illegal.

You'd turn into a pre-vampire mind slave for the right guy who knows how to seriously suck a girl's, ah, blood. Well, we find out about this plot development in a series of screaming arguments between the James Woods character (his name is Crow -- though, to his credit, he never tells the hookers to eat Crow)  and his sidekick, Montoya, played by the decidedly un-hispanic, definitely flabby Daniel Baldwin.Flabby. Did I say Daniel Baldwin is Flabby? He's bloated, for God's sake! His pants don't even fit, wardrobe couldn't keep up with him. Obviously Daniel's well-publicized off-screen battle with cocaine has reached a crucial stage. In the movie, Montoya is a cipher, but a bloated, glaze-eyed cipher who's in about as bad a shape as...well...ME! Can you imagine me getting into slice-and-dice tumble-fests with screaming, snarling rabid-dog vampires? I should say not.Anyway, after Valek crashes the party, Crow and Montoya escape with their lives and the pre-vampire mind slave Katrina, played by nubile nymphet Sheryl Lee.For reasons never really explained, the guys separate. Montoya checks into a sleazy motel with Katrina, and she wakes up the next morning tied up, face down naked on the bed. I believe it was at this point that every guy in the audience whispered aloud Ye-e-e-es.Anyway, as Katrina flails around, realizing how helpless she is, at the mercy of whatever dominating bad boy did this to her, Montoya wanders in and explains how he cleaned her up, mumble-mumble mumble. Yeah, sure. We're all thinkin' that bloated, jaded Daniel Baldwin is definitely a guy who knows how to make good use of a tied-up naked woman, some ice cream and lubricant.Meanwhile, Crow goes to meet his Vatican contacts. Previously, in one of his chummy screaming matches with Montoya, they'd established that the team had been betrayed. Well, one look at Maximillian Schell playing a Cardinal and I'm thinking Hmm...this ain't no walk-on. Maximillian probably sold Crow out to the Youthquake dude! Was I right -- read on!The middle part of the film is spent establishing that Crow is a sadist who likes to beat up priests, and that the filmmakers are sadists who like to decapitate priests, set them on fire, turn them into blood fountains (?!) and so on. Does someone here have an issue with the priesthood? Actually, there are S&M themes running throughout the entire film, even more than your average vampire movie. After being bitten by vampire-possessed Katrina, Daniel Baldwin's character, get this, actually SETS HIS ARM ON FIRE, even though he knows it won't stop the vampire process. Either that, or he was just particularly stoned that day on the film and they wrote it in. The vampire leaders are called Masters, and the followers are called Bottoms. Well, okay I made up that last part.Oh, and there's some incomprehensible plot point about finding some cross that will allow vampires to walk in daylight. Apparently Valek and his Youthquake cronies have been on a road tour of the Southwest looking for it for the last 300 years. The flimsy plot devices they threw into place makes no sense. But then it makes no sense that shooting vampires with high-caliber ammunition not only doesn't hurt them, but doesn't leave a mark on them. Yeah, Vampires has its flaws.But what it all boils down to is a big fight at the end. Who shows up but the Cardinal -- and he's working for the Youthquake bad guys! Well, I was just shocked at that!The Cardinal gives some lame excuse about losing his faith, not being able to believe in God, deciding a vampire's eternal life was the only option open for him. I'm thinking The only reason I'd become a vampire is for the endless kinky sex. But sex doesn't matter to Catholic priests, so what's he joining up for...unless priests ARE into kinky sex. Nah...can't be.Sadly for Valek, he makes the classic James Bond mistake of not killing the hero right away, but saving him for an especially evil, especially slow death. Naturally, Crow comes back and kicks his ass. No big surprise. But luckily, the movie makers did take one final opportunity to tie up Sheryl Lee. Ye-e-e-e-es!What happens to Daniel Baldwin's character is so especially lame and stupid that I won't even go into it. Maybe he was just wandering around on the set in a drug haze as James Woods frantically improvised dialogue, I don't know.All in all, I'd say see this movie before the Republicans take over and make films like this illegal. They don't want America to know the truth about our on-going struggle to wipe out vampires and keep Sheryl Lee tied up. Yahoo!

Obviously too old for the lead, Kenneth Branagh literally steps into his shoes and does such an effective job at playing Woody that he must have watched every Allen movie at least six times.  The film is hilarious but deep--like his best films. It explores our obsession with celebrities and the media's obsession with them, and I wonder how much acting Leonardo DiCaprio did for this film.

After her lecture is over she visits the restroom, and is attacked by one Daryll Lee Cullum(Connick). Flash forward 13 months. We see Hudson yet again, but this time she's confined to her apartment. You see, she's now an agoraphobic, having retired after that fateful day. At the local police precinct detectives M.J. Monahan(Hunter) and Ruben Goetz(Mulroney) are tracking a killer of their own, played by William McNamara. He appears to be mimicing the MO's of various famous serial killers. Hudson hears about this over the radio and calls the precinct with some information. She speaks to Monahan, who thinks it's a crank call. Monahan and Goetz pay a little visit to Hudson's residence, carrying with them photographs of the recent crime scenes. Hudson determines the killer is indeed copying other serial killers. A while later, an unseen visitor breaks into her apartment, leaving the dress she was wearing the day she was attacked by Cullum neatly spread out on her bed. Her home is no longer safe. Monahan and Goetz have dragged her back into the world she tried to leave behind. Now Hudson must help the detectives catch the copycat before she becomes the next victim.Realistic in just about every aspect, Copycat is right up there with Silence of the Lambs. Comparisons to Seven are not unwarrented, but the plot here is more believable. A very good cast, with Weaver giving one of the best perfomances of her career. Hunter and Mulroney are also excellent. The film is provided a very tense and terrifying atmosphere, thanks to director Jon Amiel. It doesn't need to wallow in needless violence and gore, because it has what every great Thriller needs suspense on an epic scale. The violence is kept to a minimum, but what it contains can be a bit unsettling, if for no other reason than because we get to know how the killer thinks. Along the same lines, Weaver's portrayal of an agoraphobic is perfect. You don't have to imagine what Weaver is feeling when she steps out of her apartment, or what the killer is feeling while he murders his victims. You feel every bit of it, which is why this film succeeds so masterfully.Copycat is that rare film that comes along every other year or so that has the ability to pull you into it. It takes you on a most terrifying journey into the mind of a serial killer and the doctor that understands him. I can't say anything more, except that I love this film.

Regardless of how incredible Schindler's List is, it should only be the first of many Holocaust movies to be made.  Thus, I agree with people who argue that there was more to the Holocaust than this film, but to not recognize the greatness of this film for that reason is simply ridiculous.  This movie explores human nature, therein lies its true greatness.  It asks each and every one of us to search the depths of our character, and ask ourselves what we would do in a situation where our moral, spiritual, and physical beings were threatened from every direction.  Do we really expect film to be reality?  I don't.  I go to movies to make me think, to make me look inward and learn something about myself, to tell explore a part of reality that I had not ever seen before.  Schindler's List does exactly this better than almost any other film through nearly flawless acting, beautiful cinematography, and a fantastic story, historically accurate or not.  I don't want to relive the Holocaust, I consider myself quite fortunate that I have never had, and hopefully never will have, to make the decisions facing either Stern, Goethe, or Schindler.
