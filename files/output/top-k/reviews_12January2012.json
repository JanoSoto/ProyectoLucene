Elsa Lanchester makes quite an impression in her brief screen time, creating the franchise's most unnerving character, with her twitching movements, screams, and hisses (I find her far more frightening than the monster, who is very sympathetic).The film also adds more humor and camp, which, in my opinion, doesn't quite work as well, but it really doesn't hurt the film as a whole.

After all he was going to see The Good the Bad and the Ugly, an epic 3 hour movie. The movie starts, it blows the young man's, my, mind and suddenly it ends. 3 hours have gone and I haven't touched my popcorn and only once sipped from my soda. This movie changed my perception of the art of film.The Good the Bad and the Ugly is not only the greatest western ever made, it's one of the best and epic pictures ever. Still in my opinion probably the most underestimated movie. While watching this masterpiece you can enjoy it with all senses. The scenes are beautiful in many ways, the music is spectacular in itself and really carries the film into new dimension, the story itself is grand and ambitious and the characters revolutionary for their time played by fairly good actors. It seems there are not enough adjectives to describe the greatness of this movie.Sergio Leone had a very unique style in his movies, which I think culminates in The Good the Bad and the Ugly and in this film you can see this style has grown mature to its true glory. There is something unbelievably beautiful in those wide screen shots of rough plains and desert terrain, the close-ups of faces time after time and long drawn scenes where tension can grow. Sometimes it almost seems Leone was testing how long he can hold on a single scene. The visual art itself tells a million stories without any words needed. For example it takes almost 10 minutes in before anyone says anything at all. Still you can sense the film and the tension. Another one is the final triello where the main characters stare at each other for what at first seems like an eternity, but before you know it, one of them lies in a grave dead. What other director has the guts to extend his scenes to the ultimate? And all the worn faces? They all have a story of their own to tell about their scars and wrinkles and adds to the epicness. The desert scenes are like from a surreal and captivating painting. A glorification of visual art!The music by Il Maestro Ennio Morricone is epic itself, bold and different. The score of this film is not like any other. At times it makes you cry, at times it makes you excited. It sometimes adds to the visual of the movie and sometimes supports and carries the viewers through those long scenes making sure you will not be bored for even a second of those 179 minutes, making it an experience you will not forget. Not only the main theme, but any piece of music played is a symphony of its own e.g. The Ecstacy of Gold, La Storia di un Soldato and Il Triello just to mention a few. The work of a genius!The story about three greedy renegades searching for a case of gold coins is a good story in itself, but it certainly doesn't end there. The story has many levels. For one there is the Civil War and when you start to dig deeper into the story you can truly see the anti-war reflections and symbols. For one condemns concentration camps in WW2 and other wars and also shows how brutal the trench wars of WW1 could have been for the gain of nothing. The film also shows how towns get filled with veterans without legs or arms and cemeteries grow gigantic in days. The crimes of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly suddenly seem minimal in scale in comparison with the war. Another thing is, we really don't seem to get any information about the lead characters and only Tuco seems to have a background. Still we see these three know each other from a long time ago as they refer to each other as old friends. There is some serious tension going on between the three of them. The Ugly is a criminal of the worst kind who cheats everyone and has an obscene language. The Bad is pure evil incarnate and seems to have no feelings at all. He calmly shoots everyone in his way in search for the gold. The Good you cannot really figure out. He is a mysterious and obsolete character who seems to be above all moral, but in the end shows he has some feelings after all. You can't really say he is a good person though, being a quite controversial character.In a sense I think it is, or at least was, the most underestimated movie of all. At the time it was made critics hated it. It's not a Hollywood production, Leone was at the time unknown in the world, so was Eastwood just being in the beginning of his career. Eli Wallach wasn't that famous either and Lee van Cleef was a forgotten movie veteran. It contained brutal violence and it was dubbed and worst of all, westerns was a dying genre. But this movie only grows with time. Not only did it solely revive the westerns, it recreated the movie hero to its modern shape the controversial Clint Eastwood character. Its score was revolutionary and has affected to modern film score probably more than any other. Still it remains unique. No one has been able to copy the style of Sergio Leone.To me The Good, the Bad and the Ugly truly is the greatest movie ever made in almost any aspect you can measure it in.

Before I get on with the review I will say this I have never been a massive fan of any Dracula films but I do like the original and this film for what they were. I also think that even if this remake was a nice blend and touch to the original, it was still not what I had expected. The other thing I'll say is that I didn't have many problems, and I did like this version from 1992.Dracula 1992 basically follows along the same lines as the original plot. A man is near getting married but he is called on to go to Transivania and he meets an unknown fiend named Coutn Dracula who loves blood. When Dracula gets to this man, he pursues in going to London and wishing his soon be wife away with him. A lot of trouble brews throughout England as people get hurt, Dracula gets a new look and a vampire killer\/slayer named Van Helsing is on the catch to get him.The story is all round the same but there are two major differences that I found with this film The overall atmosphere and feel of this film was really different. They took it to a whole new level as they got well known actors (being Gary Oldman playing Dracula and Anythony Hopkins as the Vampire Slayer), the music was full of dread, costumes and make up was also quite up to date style and the film followed the lines of Gothic and old times (obviously as this film is set in the 18th century). The remake (like the Halloween Remake) was much more longer than the original film itself giving us more detail, back story, and a lot of story.Gary Oldman was an excellent choice as Dracula. He made this role really creepy, dreadful, loving, romantic-like, soothing but also Gothic. I also loved how they kept the contents of how the vampire(s) must be killed and I liked in general what they did with Dracula's character here. They gave him a lot to do in this film e.g. (his over shadow moving in a direction that he wasn't, the way he can change from a cold blooded creature into a handsome young devil. Anthony Hopkins also did a top notch job on his role and he really bumped the film to it's peak. The other actors were good as well.The film does suffer with a few problems.

It doesn't have a primary text, if you will, to accurately relate or deviate from. It's based on other works, but it is a mixture of two (1) the speculative natural history book titled Flight of Dragons (1979) by Peter Dickinson, and (2) the novel, The Dragon and the George (1976), by Gordon R. Dickson. I'm not familiar with either of these works (though I wish I was). Needless to say, the narrative of this film is unique and not one that precedes its production.Some brief plot summary the film concerns the adventures of a former biology student turned fantasy novelist \/ fantasy game maker. He creates a very Dungeons and Dragons type game and a world to go along with it. And, through some various magical happenings, he gets whisked away to the fantasy world he created. There he finds out that he is the champion of this world. He has to fight an evil necromancer named Ommadon (voiced by James Earl Jones). The story is filled with dragons, elves, rangers, knights, magical spells, fairies, slime worms, dreary taverns, etc..On the level of plot, it's very thrilling.But the plot is not the only thing that endears me to this film. Let me just list some of the elements that make it a masterpiece.The animation style Rankin and Bass's unique animation style comes through here. Slightly strange, borderline grotesque, the artistic style creates a tension between the real world elements the drawings are derived from and the abstractions the drawings are supposed to represent. Thus, there is a kind of rawness \/ baseness to it.The drawings are stylized, for sure, but the nature of the stylization is such that it might even be described as a resistance to stylization. In other words, the artists strived for reality while realizing that reality was beyond the pale of animation. In other animated films, artists seem to abstain from any ambition to realistically represent something. And in this way you get the four-fingered hands of so much animation \/ cartoons.The voice acting There is some strange voice acting in this film, but it endears me to it. Particularly, the voice actor who plays the voice of the Princess character, Millisande, is quite awkward yet completely satisfying for its mystical, almost recitative quality. Also, the voice actor who relates the character of Smrgol the Dragon&#x97;James Gregory&#x97;is brilliant! He's an old dragon, tired out by life, and the husky voice no-nonsense delivery completely communicates this. John Ritter does the voice of the main character, Peter Dickinson, and he ramps up the nerdy quality of his voice to the extreme. And, of course, James Earl Jones as the archvillain is just brilliant. He evil laughter is pure art.The thematic content For a kid's film, this flick engages with some serious philosophical issues.

It doesn't have a primary text, if you will, to accurately relate or deviate from. It's based on other works, but it is a mixture of two (1) the speculative natural history book titled Flight of Dragons (1979) by Peter Dickinson, and (2) the novel, The Dragon and the George (1976), by Gordon R. Dickson. I'm not familiar with either of these works (though I wish I was). Needless to say, the narrative of this film is unique and not one that precedes its production.Some brief plot summary the film concerns the adventures of a former biology student turned fantasy novelist \/ fantasy game maker. He creates a very Dungeons and Dragons type game and a world to go along with it. And, through some various magical happenings, he gets whisked away to the fantasy world he created. There he finds out that he is the champion of this world. He has to fight an evil necromancer named Ommadon (voiced by James Earl Jones). The story is filled with dragons, elves, rangers, knights, magical spells, fairies, slime worms, dreary taverns, etc..On the level of plot, it's very thrilling.But the plot is not the only thing that endears me to this film. Let me just list some of the elements that make it a masterpiece.The animation style Rankin and Bass's unique animation style comes through here. Slightly strange, borderline grotesque, the artistic style creates a tension between the real world elements the drawings are derived from and the abstractions the drawings are supposed to represent. Thus, there is a kind of rawness \/ baseness to it.The drawings are stylized, for sure, but the nature of the stylization is such that it might even be described as a resistance to stylization. In other words, the artists strived for reality while realizing that reality was beyond the pale of animation. In other animated films, artists seem to abstain from any ambition to realistically represent something. And in this way you get the four-fingered hands of so much animation \/ cartoons.The voice acting There is some strange voice acting in this film, but it endears me to it. Particularly, the voice actor who plays the voice of the Princess character, Millisande, is quite awkward yet completely satisfying for its mystical, almost recitative quality. Also, the voice actor who relates the character of Smrgol the Dragon&#x97;James Gregory&#x97;is brilliant! He's an old dragon, tired out by life, and the husky voice no-nonsense delivery completely communicates this. John Ritter does the voice of the main character, Peter Dickinson, and he ramps up the nerdy quality of his voice to the extreme. And, of course, James Earl Jones as the archvillain is just brilliant. He evil laughter is pure art.The thematic content For a kid's film, this flick engages with some serious philosophical issues.

I never felt enough and somehow I always end up crying.Now seriously Milos Forman did an amazing job. It keeps impressing me when Salieri takes original sheets how we see the projection of what he sees and of what's written on the paper. How on paper it looks so ordinary, but what we see and what we hear doesn't match. First a gentile sound of flute, just a few notes, nothing else, and then violin interferes... But then, suddenly Salieri turns the page. Now it's a whole new piece,the music changed into to a much more vibrant tempo, it's a whole new story now, and with the music changes the atmosphere. Also, the story's beautiful. The way that Saliery envies Mozart and desires something that he has, how he turned his back on him, how he fought with God for giving Mozart the talent and giving him for reward only the ability to recognize it. The hardest part for me is when Mozart dies. In the background you can hear his Requiem, La Crimosa at that time. And instead of Salieri's expectations of his funeral- a big cathedral, music playing, many people, we see how he's thrown into a hole with the rest of poor people who didn't have money to afford a decent funeral. It makes you ask yourself Doesn't he deserve more? Now we don't even have a stone to call his grave, we know there was no difference of the final resting place of one of a kind music genius and any ordinary man who made no difference in this world. But we still have his music.Tom Hulce and F.Murrey Abraham acted wonderfully, the movie became so real that it touched me even more with every passing minute.

Stepping out of the first impression, It would be banal if I would spend lines describing the perfection of the Director, writers, and the composer of the music.instead I prefer to put down my one point of view right away. and as a modern movie watcher, I would say that Sound of music is an impressive classical American movie. and I totally agree with the Oscar not choosing the actors for the prize, because I think the movie had a some sort of deficiency on this specific aspect, the character were definitively well composed but we might figured that they would apply much better to a theatrical performance, of course I'm not saying that out of lack of classical movies interest, because i don't think that anyone can compare the characters of the sound of music with the ones in a streetcar named desire or Casablanca or vertigo. that would be the only thing that sort of annoyed me in this movie. After all, the sound of music is a musical, and indeed a successful one, it's a cultural element that whole families grew up with, especially because the movie is very popular among kids.

Oliver Platt plays the son of a famous comedian (Jerry Lewis). When his comedy act bombs, he sneaks off to Blackpool, England, to hook up with some old acquaintances and possibly assemble a better act.Despite the presence of Jerry Lewis*, this isn't any kind of silly movie at all. It has a very serious side. A major focus is how the father expects the son to follow in his path, despite the son's having a different set of talents. But all in all, what results is a very fine piece of work, definitely one that you should see. It's too bad that Peter Chelsom went on to direct Town & Country and Hannah Montana The Movie.Also starring Lee Evans (Tucker in There's Something About Mary), Leslie Caron, Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon in the Harry Potter movies), Oliver Reed and Ian McNeice.*Other serious movies in which Jerry Lewis starred are The King of Comedy by Martin Scorsese and Arizona Dream by Emir Kusturica.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"12 January 2012","score":"","review":" A bunch of liberal grad students (played by then unknown Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Coutney B. Vance) accidentally kill, at dinner in their house, a seriously deranged conservative (Bill Paxton) and bury the body. They figure they did the world a favor and invite ultra conservatives to their house, poison them and bury the bodies in the back yard. Among the victims (in cameos) are Charles Durning, Mark Harmon and Jason Alexander. Nora Dunn plays a policewoman investigating all the disappearances.DARK dark black comedy but it's well-done. The script is sharp and witty and insults BOTH conservatives and liberals. With the sole exception of Vance (who's horrible) the acting is good and we see hunky Penner with his shirt off and walking around in his underwear. Well-directed too with a good eye to compositions and color. Great music score too. If you examine the plot closely there are loopholes and lapses in logic (like they bury about 10 people in their backyard and the neighbors never notice?) but still this is funny and makes you think. Ignored at the time of its release this made a little splash on VHS and deserves to be rediscovered.
