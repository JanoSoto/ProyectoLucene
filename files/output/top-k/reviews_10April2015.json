Either way, I won't go into detail about that portion of the plot except to note that the ever-mounting conflicts in the story center around Lenny's childlike mind and manner and that Curley's wife Mae (Betty Field) is no help in the easing-tensions department.Director Lewis Milestone squeezes a lot of blood from Chaney and Meredith. It's not surprising that this role led to Chaney's getting several likable-monster roles (he'd appear in The Wolf Man a couple of years later). For Meredith, this was probably his best role until playing The Penguin in TV's Batman. But I can't say enough about their performances.So should you read the book or see the movie? Yes.

Part of that is because it's based on an epic novel that would be difficult to put on screen in a single film even in 2015. So it was an extremely ambitious task to try to make it in 1984. But the result has some of the most gorgeous and interesting sets and costumes I've ever seen in a movie. I was blown away by a lot of the imagery.Some of the special effects are really cool and impressive and some are fairly weak (but not terrible). The force-field thing was pretty awesome and unique and the worms were also quite convincing and majestic. The acting is very solid overall with many famous people making appearances. Kyle MacLachlan (from Twin Peaks) is really cool in particular, plus there are several strikingly beautiful actresses that I would totally never develop a crush on ever. The cast of characters is quite colourful, providing lots of variety of personalities and points of view.I read Dune a few years ago and thought it was awesome although I still haven't read many books let alone sci-fi ones so I don't have a lot to compare it with. I liked the richness of detail, all the different kinds of people and cultures, the cool names, the weapons, the philosophy. It makes you believe in its world and want to learn more. I've always had a thing for fantasy and sci-fi, that it fulfills some deeper urge or purpose for humans. We're not meant to just be sitting around in offices or watching TV, we are meant to have grander lives, incredible journeys.This movie seems to be fairly true to the book, Frank Herbert was apparently impressed and generally satisfied with what it was able to achieve. It's main flaw is that it's far from polished. The script has too many gaps. The movie doesn't flow very well. I roughly knew the story so I could get what was happening and was overjoyed to revisit the story for the first time since I read the book. I think it has the makings of a great movie. They just needed to spend more time on the script or give more creative control to the director. Something like that.Apparently David Lynch considers this his only failure. It's funny because I'm pretty sure it's also one of his highest grossing films (and I think it's actually very good for a worst film). The issue, of course, is that it cost a fair bit to make and bombed relative to that amount. But the box office can depend a lot on marketing and timing (and luck) as much as quality. Many films have become far more popular as videos than in their original cinematic release.It was very interesting and exciting to see a totally different kind of Lynch movie as well, more of a Hollywood spectacle than a creepy dream-like thriller. I think he's very brilliant when it comes to imagery and style in general. I wish Hollywood would take more chances with auteur directors, giving them large budgets and solid franchises to work on (like Christopher Nolan with Batman for example).I have to say I liked the music a lot. It grew on me over time and seemed to fit the tone and mood of the subject matter very well. There is a lot of mystery but also inevitability, that something profound is due to happen soon. Together with the visuals and some of the philosophical quotes, it can give you shivers down the spine. I sometimes find movies are like a way to add to my dreams. They give you more emotional states to play with. I can close my eyes and be Paul Muad'dib and hear the music and recite one of his mantras and feel enlivened. It can give you strength and calmness. It's all about escapism isn't it? And yet, perhaps, delving inwards and finding new things or finding closure.

In many ways KUNDUN remains the unknown film by Scorsese . I remember it being released but I very much doubted if it played outside established art house cinemas in big cities . I also remember it being very difficult to get on VHS\/DVD which led me to wonder if it was ever released on this format . Despite being made almost twenty years ago I can't recall it ever being broadcast on even the more obscure and unwatched TV channels . Therefore I was somewhat surprised to see it uploaded on perhaps the most obvious platform - youtube . After watching the movie all I can say is that it probably deserves much of its obscurity Now I've got to put my hand up here and say I have militantly atheist views . As Richard Dawkins is fond of pointing out You're only one God away from being an atheist and so it is with all religions . I have done a bit of travelling to exotic lands and I'm often amazed how Westerners are quick to reject the idea of the Abrahamic God but are extremely open to the suggestion of Eastern mysticism along the lines of Hinduism and Buddhism . It's understandable in many ways because people are superstitious by nature and a belief in karma is only a slight extension of this superstition . Bad things happen in life and they are as common as air . Good things happen and they are as rare as the most precious commodities and we're all wondering why this must be . I'm digressing but what I should point out is that the reason I disliked this movie was not down to it being a biopic about the 14th Dalai Lama but simply because it is a badly told story regardless of its subject matter Scorsese isn't really someone who cares much for plotting . You could never see him making a high concept plot movie along the lines of MOMENTO . Instead his movies are character driven with those characters trying to find an aim in life ( Often an illegal aim ) having it all , losing it and at the end being worse off than when they started . A story like KUNDUN should be easy for Marty to develop in theory . In practise however he doesn't even try and you never for a second get the feeling you're watching a film directed by America's greatest cinema auteur According to the trivia section on this page Melissa Mathison's screenplay went through fourteen different drafts . Some people might claim the story has been rewritten to death but it's impossible to think any of the drafts could have possibly been worse than the final product . It contains two distinctive parts of the Lama's life - his childhood and then his escape from Tibet which is annexed by Red China . Both parts contain a whole lot of nothing . The screenplay drags at a snail's pace which makes for a very boring and totally uninvolving film Scorsese seems unable to improve upon the very poor material as though his heart isn't in the story . The worst aspect is that he's made a film with a totally amateur cast . Worse than that despite being an obvious amateur cast it's an amateur cast who don't speak English as a first language which means they deliver their lines in an absolutely dreadful way . You've probably seen less wooden acting at a primary school play .

What harm exactly did he do to her? We don't quite know. All we can really gleam is that he loves her passionately but, you know how the Golddiggers song goes, huh fellas? This is not to say that this film is misogynistic, or rather I don't think that is really Kieslowski's game with the satire here - and make no mistake, this is as biting satire (and out-and-out comedy) as it can get for such a director. While Dominique is conniving - she leaves poor Karol with nothing but a suitcase, and despite him trying to get her back he turns up (in more ways than one) flaccid. Can he win her back some how? He's still crazy about her - he even buys a statue that looks remarkably like her to keep by his side.Through a rather crazy set of circumstances, which include meeting another Polish man in France who wants him to commit a murder for money (a lot of it) and then finding a way back to Poland by, you guessed it, stuffing himself inside of a suitcase (sure, it gets stolen and he's beaten up by the thieves, but it's the price to pay for getting back to Poland). He tries to build himself back up, and does by chance and ingenuity - and screwing over other crooks before they get the chance to steal people of their land - and all of this is really to do one thing find a way to get Dominique back into his life. How will this be done? By some unlikely means necessary.A couple of points in White, perhaps mid-way through, seemed a little slow when the film wasn't sure quite what to do with Karol. What is he doing back in Wasaw exactly? Where will this story be going to? And, most confusingly, why does Delpy's Dominique pop up - randomly, to my point of view - two times in the middle of the film, just clips of scenes of her later on in the film? Kieslowski is much more sly in this film than he is in Blue or Red, films that dealt on more concrete terms about existential anxiety and about not connecting with people after traumas of lapses in connection (re Binoche, who randomly pops up in a bling-and-you'll miss cameo and Trintignant).I think the key to me came after seeing the film and noticing a reviewer comparing Kieslowski's approach as a critique of capitalism in the modern age. Before reading that, White was an entertaining film but, comparatively, light in what it has to offer. It is all still a divorcée-con-job story, with overtones in the third act of, of all things, The Third Man in its trickery of a character playing dead. But what does carry over in this film - which features its title color revealed at moments of revelation, the wedding dress Delpy wears, and an actual climactic moment - is the humor and commentary on a society picking itself up, as Poland was, in the days of the end of Communist rule. I wish I had put that context more for when I was watching it, and maybe on a re-watch it will be more interesting with that in mind.If it does keep from being great overall, it may be because it's a little too... short, in a way. A part of me wishes there was just a scene or two more development of Karol\/Dominique's relationship, but on the other hand it's easy to see why Kieslowski keeps it to what it is love that is more about need and desire than full-on compatibility, on both sides.It goes by in a brisk 90 minutes, and Delpy is there for all of 20 minutes, tops (her appearance on the cover is more for advertisement purposes). When she does appear in the film, her character is raw and duplicitous at first, but strangely vulnerable when it comes to her sorta comeuppance when she really returns. In this midsection, and really our hero, we have Zamachowski, and he is terrific and funny and sad and all sort of things as this hapless guy who knows he loves his wife, even (especially) when he's enacting his obsessive-revenge-type of response to her rejection of him. If there was ever an American remake - not that one should want it, but hypothetically - Paul Giamatti would fit the role perfectly. He's an average, shlubby every-man who is three dimensional likable, unlikable, fairly slick one minute and idiotic the next.For a director who is often looked at as having very Heavy films, and for good reason, a film like Three Colors White is, for lack of a better word, fun, and it's enjoyable mostly to see the director work in such a mood - though the ending turns out to be rather tragic in what it suggests will come for these characters' double crossings.

It doesn't seem like something from 2001. It could have come out in 2015 and I wouldn't have noticed anything odd about it. It's set in 1993 of course so everything is meant to be appropriate for that time. I was also amazed at how many famous actors are in it, many of them before they became big stars.It's funny to see complaints that the movie is shallow because it supposedly doesn't give enough back-story to the characters. In fact, I find that quite ironic because I often find family scenes in war movies to be the most melodramatic, shallow and unnecessary parts. We know they have families. We don't need to be shown. And that can actually be more powerful. The soldiers themselves might not know much about each other. Maybe they'd like to talk about it and maybe they wouldn't. Black Hawk Down starts and ends where it should. It's a brutal experience that puts us right in there with the soldiers. We are one of them and all of them. There needn't be a main character.Black Hawk Down is an epic action film. It is relentless and never compromises its tone and style. It doesn't tell you what to think or feel. There is no preaching or tragedy or politics. It just presents what it feels is an important or interesting story. The acting, special effects, editing, sound are all top-notch. You have to sit back and wonder at how they did a lot of it. It just seems completely real. From what I've read, they did a lot of training and preparation for the film. The real people were consulted with. It makes such a difference and shows that the film-makers cared about doing it right.Some of the scenes were quite scary and painful to watch. I was strongly emotionally affected by parts of it. And it gave a lot of context to see how much emotion the soldiers hold back. At most they might shed a tear. Not because they don't care but because they have no choice but to push on and be tough. I think that's an important sort of thing though. To share some of the inner details of a world most of us will never see but probably fear or dread. I think many people like to avoid it. So to bring it to attention is really positive. We have to have some understanding of what war is actually like. What can go wrong. Some glimpse of how it might affect the people involved. I personally find all of it terrifying and I'm glad I've never had to go through any of it myself.This movie had me getting furious at all the Somalian people with guns. Where did they get so many weapons? Why are they shooting at soldiers who are just doing their job? They forced the soldiers to kill them. Even women and children. Why are they anywhere near such a violent area? It made me curious about the true story and I'm keen to read more about it.So, in conclusion, Black Hawk Down is a very violent but impressively made film. Not exactly light-hearted fun but important as an intense experience that gives you a better feel for some of the things that are going on in the world. Plus it does have some nice messages about camaraderie and plenty of food for thought about war in general.

Not exactly light-hearted fun but important as an intense experience that gives you a better feel for some of the things that are going on in the world. Plus it does have some nice messages about camaraderie and plenty of food for thought about war in general.

It doesn't seem like something from 2001. It could have come out in 2015 and I wouldn't have noticed anything odd about it. It's set in 1993 of course so everything is meant to be appropriate for that time. I was also amazed at how many famous actors are in it, many of them before they became big stars.It's funny to see complaints that the movie is shallow because it supposedly doesn't give enough back-story to the characters. In fact, I find that quite ironic because I often find family scenes in war movies to be the most melodramatic, shallow and unnecessary parts. We know they have families. We don't need to be shown. And that can actually be more powerful. The soldiers themselves might not know much about each other. Maybe they'd like to talk about it and maybe they wouldn't. Black Hawk Down starts and ends where it should. It's a brutal experience that puts us right in there with the soldiers. We are one of them and all of them. There needn't be a main character.Black Hawk Down is an epic action film. It is relentless and never compromises its tone and style. It doesn't tell you what to think or feel. There is no preaching or tragedy or politics. It just presents what it feels is an important or interesting story. The acting, special effects, editing, sound are all top-notch. You have to sit back and wonder at how they did a lot of it. It just seems completely real. From what I've read, they did a lot of training and preparation for the film. The real people were consulted with. It makes such a difference and shows that the film-makers cared about doing it right.Some of the scenes were quite scary and painful to watch. I was strongly emotionally affected by parts of it. And it gave a lot of context to see how much emotion the soldiers hold back. At most they might shed a tear. Not because they don't care but because they have no choice but to push on and be tough. I think that's an important sort of thing though. To share some of the inner details of a world most of us will never see but probably fear or dread. I think many people like to avoid it. So to bring it to attention is really positive. We have to have some understanding of what war is actually like. What can go wrong. Some glimpse of how it might affect the people involved. I personally find all of it terrifying and I'm glad I've never had to go through any of it myself.This movie had me getting furious at all the Somalian people with guns. Where did they get so many weapons? Why are they shooting at soldiers who are just doing their job? They forced the soldiers to kill them. Even women and children. Why are they anywhere near such a violent area? It made me curious about the true story and I'm keen to read more about it.So, in conclusion, Black Hawk Down is a very violent but impressively made film. Not exactly light-hearted fun but important as an intense experience that gives you a better feel for some of the things that are going on in the world. Plus it does have some nice messages about camaraderie and plenty of food for thought about war in general.

The power to kill can be just as satisfying as the power to create.With the aftermaths of the effects of World War II, Patrick Hamilton's play seemed like the perfect choice for Alfred Hitchcock's next film. A plot which centers on two highly intellectual men that decide to commit the perfect murder. The victim being one of their classmates who they consider to be inferior to them. This concept of superiority is handled pretty heavily as there are several discussions about it through the film, and it is easy to compare it to Hitler's ideal of the superior Nazi race. Rope isn't subtle at all, but the film is still engaging and perfectly executed as a criticism for such a dangerous concept at the time. Brandon (John Dall) and Phillip (Farley Granger) aren't satisfied with having murdered their friend, David. They want to celebrate their perfectly executed plan by having a dinner party with David's father (Cedric Hardwicke), his Aunt (Constance Collier), his girlfriend, Janet (Joan Chandler), Janet's ex, Kenneth (Douglas Dick), and their former tutor, Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) as their guests. Brandon is convinced that no one will suspect that they murdered David for the sake of experimenting, and it would be great to have his body hidden there while his relatives and close friends dine next to it. Phillip on the other hand is a nervous wreck and thinks that inviting Rupert is a terrible idea and that they are going a bit too far with everything. Of course the first thing that comes up when talking about Rope is the way that Hitchcock decided to film it as if it were one continuous take. The film is actually shot in 10 long takes, and the audience can easily spot those moments (it isn't subtle as in Birdman) but for a film made in 1948 it was a feat to pull off. This is by far Hitchcock's most theatrical film and shooting the scenes as if they were taking place in real time was a way for him to approach the material in a different way. He had to build the suspense without relying on the score or parallel action scenes. Rope has a very exciting climax, but it is very predictable for audiences today. It is also a very wordy film, but Hitchcock never misses an opportunity to include his morbid sense of humor. I love James Stewart, but in this film his character has several flaws, one being the way he rationalizes murder at first during a conversation with the rest of the guests and later the character seems to take a 180 degree turn. I still have to give Hitchcock a lot of credit for trying something new with Rope and continuing to innovate in his films. Beside the experimental element of Rope there is a strong underlying homosexual vibe between the two murderers although it is never referenced directly by anyone. They are going to travel together to the country and they use that as an excuse to invite their friends for a farewell party. The performances are all strong in this film and it is by far the most stagy film in Hitchcock's career. He may have just been playing with the concept, but there is no doubt that he also inspired future filmmakers to do the same. Rope is another rich legacy from Hitchcock. The performances in the film are solid and Farley Granger plays a very different character from the one he went on to play in Strangers on a Train. James Stewart was obviously the star at the moment, but he doesn't appear until almost thirty minutes into the film. His screen presence does elevate the film once he arrives at the home. John Dall plays the main villain very well, but it was his only collaboration with Hitchcock. I'd probably rank Rope around the middle of Hitchcock's filmography, but it sure was ahead of its time.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"10 April 2015","score":"","review":" I've always wished for more artistic talent.

First of all, there is reality. We all know as a general rule, saboteurs do not have a distinctive look. Now, inasmuch as World War II had just broken out, I suppose that if Barry had been Japanese or German, her remark would have been appropriate. Of course, today we would call that racial profiling, but since this movie was made in 1942, she could have gotten away with it. But Barry does not appear to be either.Second, there is type casting. A movie producer might call up an agent, and say, We're making a spy movie. Do you have anyone who looks like a saboteur? If so, send him over for an interview. And then the agent might send over someone like Norman Lloyd, the man who plays the saboteur named Fry in the movie. But the agent would not have sent over Robert Cummings.Third, there is the reason why Pat said it. After she expresses her difficulty in believing that any American would be a saboteur, Barry responds, Well, you believe it about me! She replies that he is different, because he looks like a saboteur. And that is peculiar, because neither reality nor movie stereotyping would make anyone say that about someone who looks like Robert Cummings. Besides, she had a very good reason for thinking he was a saboteur, which has nothing to do with his looks. When she first met him, she saw that he was wearing handcuffs, and she realized that he was the fugitive the police were looking for.Actually, it is precisely because Barry does not look like a saboteur that he is able to avoid the police. After he jumps out of the police car, he jumps from the bridge into the river below. The truck driver that had earlier given him a ride recognizes him, and he misdirects the police so that Barry can escape. Now, why would anyone do that? I would have helped the police by pointing out where Barry was hiding. All we can conclude is that the truck driver figured Barry did not look like a criminal, so he helped him escape.Barry takes shelter in a blind man's house. When his niece Pat turns up, and she sees the handcuffs that her uncle Philip already knew about on account of his acute hearing, she says he should have turned him in to the police. Her uncle accuses her of being cruel. He assures her that Barry is not dangerous. And besides, he argues, a man is innocent until proved guilty. Now, because Philip is blind, he obviously cannot be coming to these incredible conclusions simply on account of Barry's looks. But Philip tells Pat that he can see intangible things, like innocence.Pat pretends to go along with what her uncle wants, which is to take Barry to a blacksmith to get the handcuffs off, but she tries to take him to the police instead. That doesn't work, however, and after some complications, they find themselves in the company of some circus freaks. Some of them want to turn Barry over to the police, who are inspecting the circus trucks, but the deciding vote is the bearded lady who blathers about how fine it is that Pat has stuck with Barry through his difficulties, and therefore they must be good people. This makes about as much sense as when earlier a man and a woman saw Barry kidnap Pat, dragging her into the car against her will, and the woman said, My, they must be terribly in love.What these three instances&#x97;that of the truck driver, Uncle Philip, and the freaks&#x97;have in common is that appearances, in one form or another, make people decide to thwart the police and help the fugitive. Toward the end of the movie, Tobin, one of the villains, says of Barry that he is noble, fine, and pure, and that is why he is misjudged by everyone. But save for the police, Barry is not misjudged by others. The point of this line is to show just how much evil foreigners underestimate Americans. Americans, being basically noble, fine, and pure, can readily see the goodness in others, which is why they are willing to help a fugitive from justice escape from the police they can just tell that Barry is noble, fine, and pure.In some ways, this movie reminds us of The 39 Steps (1935), made several years earlier. In that movie, a man is also falsely suspected of being a spy and has to convince a woman that he is really a good guy. There is a pair of handcuffs in that movie too, except that the man and woman are handcuffed together in that one. However, Saboteur also made me think of Shadow of a Doubt (1943), which Hitchcock made just a year later, in which appearances, instead of being dependable, turn out to be deceptive. Perhaps the one was a reaction to the other.

I would have helped the police by pointing out where Barry was hiding. All we can conclude is that the truck driver figured Barry did not look like a criminal, so he helped him escape.Barry takes shelter in a blind man's house. When his niece Pat turns up, and she sees the handcuffs that her uncle Philip already knew about on account of his acute hearing, she says he should have turned him in to the police. Her uncle accuses her of being cruel. He assures her that Barry is not dangerous. And besides, he argues, a man is innocent until proved guilty. Now, because Philip is blind, he obviously cannot be coming to these incredible conclusions simply on account of Barry's looks. But Philip tells Pat that he can see intangible things, like innocence.Pat pretends to go along with what her uncle wants, which is to take Barry to a blacksmith to get the handcuffs off, but she tries to take him to the police instead. That doesn't work, however, and after some complications, they find themselves in the company of some circus freaks. Some of them want to turn Barry over to the police, who are inspecting the circus trucks, but the deciding vote is the bearded lady who blathers about how fine it is that Pat has stuck with Barry through his difficulties, and therefore they must be good people. This makes about as much sense as when earlier a man and a woman saw Barry kidnap Pat, dragging her into the car against her will, and the woman said, My, they must be terribly in love.What these three instances&#x97;that of the truck driver, Uncle Philip, and the freaks&#x97;have in common is that appearances, in one form or another, make people decide to thwart the police and help the fugitive. Toward the end of the movie, Tobin, one of the villains, says of Barry that he is noble, fine, and pure, and that is why he is misjudged by everyone. But save for the police, Barry is not misjudged by others. The point of this line is to show just how much evil foreigners underestimate Americans. Americans, being basically noble, fine, and pure, can readily see the goodness in others, which is why they are willing to help a fugitive from justice escape from the police they can just tell that Barry is noble, fine, and pure.In some ways, this movie reminds us of The 39 Steps (1935), made several years earlier. In that movie, a man is also falsely suspected of being a spy and has to convince a woman that he is really a good guy. There is a pair of handcuffs in that movie too, except that the man and woman are handcuffed together in that one. However, Saboteur also made me think of Shadow of a Doubt (1943), which Hitchcock made just a year later, in which appearances, instead of being dependable, turn out to be deceptive. Perhaps the one was a reaction to the other. ","genre":"Thriller, War"},{"date":"10 April 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" You look like a saboteur, Pat says to Barry accusatively.What are we to make of this remark? First of all, there is reality. We all know as a general rule, saboteurs do not have a distinctive look. Now, inasmuch as World War II had just broken out, I suppose that if Barry had been Japanese or German, her remark would have been appropriate. Of course, today we would call that racial profiling, but since this movie was made in 1942, she could have gotten away with it. But Barry does not appear to be either.Second, there is type casting. A movie producer might call up an agent, and say, We're making a spy movie. Do you have anyone who looks like a saboteur? If so, send him over for an interview. And then the agent might send over someone like Norman Lloyd, the man who plays the saboteur named Fry in the movie. But the agent would not have sent over Robert Cummings.Third, there is the reason why Pat said it. After she expresses her difficulty in believing that any American would be a saboteur, Barry responds, Well, you believe it about me! She replies that he is different, because he looks like a saboteur. And that is peculiar, because neither reality nor movie stereotyping would make anyone say that about someone who looks like Robert Cummings. Besides, she had a very good reason for thinking he was a saboteur, which has nothing to do with his looks. When she first met him, she saw that he was wearing handcuffs, and she realized that he was the fugitive the police were looking for.Actually, it is precisely because Barry does not look like a saboteur that he is able to avoid the police. After he jumps out of the police car, he jumps from the bridge into the river below. The truck driver that had earlier given him a ride recognizes him, and he misdirects the police so that Barry can escape. Now, why would anyone do that?

But I think it is a good entertaining movie. Maybe not the most unpredictable plot out there, but good for a Sunday with nothing else to do. i could do with a bit less gore and a LOT less F bombs but with a movie that has other aspects that make me like it enough, I can look past that. I want to address a few recurring complaints I have seen in other reviews. For one, GET OVER Kristen steward's boyish look. The comment didn't know at first if it was a boy or girl is a common comment in reviews I've read. When she started filming panic room she had just finished shooting a movie where she plays a girl that looks like (and is mistaken for) a boy. Thats why her hair is so short in this movie. (obviously she chose to really cut it rather than use a wig). Get over it. It's not that big of a deal and there's a very logical explanation behind it. If you don't want spoilers click off of this review right now. Also some have talked about the unrealistic depiction of diabetes. You want unrealistic, watch Con Air, where a character claims he'll die without his insulin in a short time. (Unlikely.) In panic room it IS realistic that Stewart, a type 1 diabetic who is thin, is prone to low blood sugar in times of stress. She probably took a little extra insulin because she drank extra coke (watch the pizza scene where Foster tells her to go easy on the soda but then ultimately pours her more). Taking her insulin like she should (and a little extra maybe) WOULD put her at risk of dangerously low sugar if there is something unexpected like missing her next meal, exercising, being under stress. It is realistic, I know Type 1 diabetics who have to stay up all night some nights to monitor their blood sugar because it's too low and won't stay up. Hypoglycemia can go downhill very quickly. And in the almost coma scene, Forrest Whittaker is NOT giving her insulin (as someone complained) they are giving her a shot of sugar, most likely glucagon, which diabetics do keep in syringes for emergency and is an appropriate treatment for this situation. It does not have to be given intravenously as someone claimed, and would be easy for someone who doesn't know much about injecting. (He should have cleaned the site first though and it shouldn't have been kept in the fridge but rather room temperature.) The most unrealistic thing about the diabetes storyline is the special monitor she wears on her wrist. From what I understand that technology (especially in 2002) is still very much in the works and isn't really a thing' yet. My last rebuttal to other reviews is the scene where Forrest Whittaker gets arrested and loses all the money. OK maybe you want him to get away with the money because he's not such a bad guy. Im' not saying I felt differently, but I always saw this part of the movie differently. I saw it as a noble sacrifice, like the man in A tale of Two Cities who dies so the woman he loves can live happily ever after with the man she loves. In Panic Room, Forrest Whittaker is getting away with the money when he hears and realizes that the mother and daughter are still in danger. He hesitates a split second before going back to help them. I think it's a conscious decision he made, the ultimate sacrifice and redemption, that he KNOWS going back to help them can cost him his escape, but chooses to do it anyway because they're innocent and he can't live with himself if they come to harm. He values their lives over his own freedom. That's why when he does get caught and releases the money into the wind he has a look of resignation. I think he mourns his freedom, family, and the wealth he almost had, but that he knows he did the right thing and that gives him a peace about it all. I think it speaks volumes about what kind of person he really is deep inside. That makes him ultimately my favorite character.

It takes a director of strong moral character to craft films like Kieslowski did, with Blue, Red, and especially his Decalogue series. In Red he has two people who shouldn't have anything to do with one another - a young model\/student and a retired judge - but puts them together and has them finding a connection to one another in an extraordinary but human way (all about a dog - and eavesdropping).There is also a metaphor in the film about there being a sub-plot that may really be all about the judge as a young man (at first I wasn't sure what it had to do with the main plot at all aside from the guy being the neighbor of the young model, but wanted to stay with it). It ends up also functioning as a critique of knowing too much or too little about the ones one loves.The acting is so strong and touching in what is communicated in such short (or long) stretches of time, and yet so subtle. Kieslowski cast his actress Irene Jacob I suspect for her eyes as they are kind, generous but also hungry-for-knowledge and emotion type eyes, and they invite the audience to notice everything she does but that she does so well. And Trintingnant (sic) is amazing here as well, having to convincingly be a curmudgeon but then switch to being somewhat sympathetic in the second half of the film. And it succeeds because of how Kieslowski fleshes out the character and that the girl brings out the best in him.Bottom line, it's not by much but more satisfying than Blue (which I liked but had some stylistic issues with), and quite the opening that is amazing in its scope and originality, but doesn't have much to do with the plot of the film.

Redford wants revenge so he looks up big time con man Paul Newman who himself is dodging law enforcement as is Redford also.They work the big con on Shaw and it's a beauty. The scheme they have is something to behold. They also have to do a couple of improvisations on the fly that lend a few twists to the scheme.The costumes and sets really do evoke Chicago of the Thirties and director George Roy Hill assembles a great cast to support Newman and Redford. My favorite in the whole group is Charles Durning, who plays the brutally corrupt, but essentially dumb cop from Joliet who nearly gums up the works and has to be dealt with.Special mention should also go to Robert Shaw. He's got a difficult part, maybe the most difficult in the film. He's not stupid, he would not have gotten to the top of the rackets if he was. But he also has to show that hint of human weakness that Newman, Redford, and the whole mob they assemble that makes him vulnerable to the con.During the sixties and seventies Robert Shaw was really coming into his own as a player, getting more and more acclaim for his work. His early death was a real tragedy, there was so much more he could have been doing.Can't also forget another co-star in this film, the ragtime music of Scott Joplin that was used to score The Sting. It probably is what most people remember about The Sting. Music from the Theodore Roosevelt era, scoring a film set in the Franklin Roosevelt era made while Nixon was president. Strange, but it actually works.

It is also one of the sequels everybody can agree on is better than the original. Everything that T2 has to offer is innovative to all of film. Sure there are some head-scratching moments that people can't help but question, but that is when James Cameron expects people to infer and figure things out for themselves. I don't give much thought to these questions. Just sit back, relax, and be wowed.In 1997, machines take over the world causing most of humanity to be wiped out. John Connor is the leader of the resistance who is gaining the upper hand. The machines send back a cyborg (Schwarzenegger) back in time to 1984 to kill his mother, Sarah (Hamilton), a prevent Connor's birth. John sends his friend (Biehn) back in time to protect her, who ultimately becomes John's father. The whole paradox of John's father is very interesting. They destroy the Terminator and Sarah's knowledge of the future has her going crazy. That is where T2 comes. T2 is a sequel where it helps if the first is watched. All the questions are filled in with this, watching 1984's just makes this experience better. In the future, the machines have created a liquid-metal T-1000 Terminator (Patrick) that can transform itself into anything. They send it back in time to 1994 to kill John's 10-year-old self (Furlong). John and his crew steal an Arnold model and program it to be good and send it back to protect him. Arnold gets John and explains what's up. There's some action between him and Patrick which is awesome. Patrick is a skinny guy who is more powerful than Arnold. I think it's funny how both their facial expressions never change during any of their fights. They are machines, and both men must've found it hard to keep their faces from changing shapes. We get a good look into the life of Sarah Connor, who has been put in a mental institution where she is abused. John and Arnold break her out, but Sarah is still hunted by her previous encounter with his model and an idea of judgement day. They must work together to protect John and thwart Patrick. Patrick makes lots of really cool kills and transformations. For 1991, the effects are as real as can be. Of course, there's some dazzling effects with Arnold's model. The innovative effects were the first things that were noticed. Of course the action plays a big part as they were very well done too. The complex plot and ideas of how modern technology can destroy the world, trust, and family are played about in very important and unique ways. I love the way the movie constantly unfolds and gets from place to place. So many moments just fly by that cause you to keep your eyes on the screen. Cameron does this the right way, with build-ups and pay- offs, showing that it was necessary to have. The thrills and suspense are done so in perfectly, wondering how Patrick can get kills and if he can destroy the trio. Cameron also adds some humour. Arnold is the king of one-liners, making every movie he's in funny in some parts. Playing a robot with more lines is guaranteed to make almost everything that comes out of his mouth a gag. The chemistry between him and Edward Furlong is wonderful and funny too. Furlong has a squeaky voice, so he's just as funny as Arnie. He teaches him how to be hip, with hilarious results. In the process, Arnold becomes the closest thing John ever had to a father and makes him feel important. I love everything T2 has to offer. It was the first R-rated movie I'd ever seen and still blows me away all these years later.

To me, there were just TOO many artificially inserted elements and distractions that I feel were put in in order to give it 'Authenticity'. However, all the grating voice-overs of newsmen and announcers, and a number of other little things, just seemed irritating and I feel greatly detracted from what COULD have otherwise been an excellent film.

I looked up his other films and other than 'WHERE THE DAY TAKES YOU' prior to this film (I have not see it) it doesn't seem like he has really done that much of any import, and has done nothing since, which is kind of odd. Although he did pass away at a rather young age in 2009.I think he DID bring out some nice things that were important and helpful to the story. And, like I mentioned, the performances overall were very good. My lowly and wretched impression is that the director, while having some really good ideas, tried TOO dang hard to add SO many little touches that, if done well, COULD have been called 'Stylish', but ultimately to me anyway just struck me as artificial and somewhat jarring to the overall flow of the movie. I don't mind a highly stylized film if it is done well or even if just the style alone is what makes a movie interesting enough to watch.

I finally decided to watch it as part of a paper for my film class, because as the first adaptation of a Grisham novel, it was important to the paper, but I still can't explain why it was the first novel they decided to turn into a movie. The story follows a younger lawyer who is graduating at the top of his Harvard Law class. As the offers pour in, he has a tough decision to make, and finally settles on a small Nashville firm, that has made him an offer that is too good to be true. As he starts working for The Firm, Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) comes to realize that their only client is an organized crime syndicate and he's trapped inside. Eventually, the FBI comes to McDeere and tries to recruit him as a whistle blower, and his response is somewhat unorthodox. What I never understood about this story is why McDeere went to the lengths he did. He could have achieved the same outcome by simply complying with one side or the other. He jumps through all these hoops and does all these secretive things in order to achieve the same outcome. To me, this always made the second half of the book and film to be pretty much pointless. Tom Cruise stars and shines in the type of role that defined his early career. At this point in his career, if Tom Cruise is not starring as a dark loner or a sci-fi action hero, there isn't any point to watching his movies, but back in the early 90s he really had that special spark that has garnered him the reputation he has today. Cruise was paired with Gene Hackman, making the perfect dynamic of the old star, turning things over to the new.
