One of many films that has become a great success and followed on with even greater success as a musical theatrical production. I think this film may have been one of the first to kick start that trend as it were, can't quite remember.The tale of a humble miners son whose aspirations to become a male ballet dancer are frowned upon by his blue collar father and similar blue collar brother. Set in north eastern England around 1984-85 during the miners strikes against a powerful Thatcher led Conservative regime...errr I mean government. Billy is destined to become a miner like his older brother and father and is pretty much forced to take part in boxing at school by his father. His dad obviously wants more for his boy with the possibility of boxing but he knows the pit beckons.On the other hand Billy discovers his love for dancing in ballet and wants to follow that path. Naturally this disgusts his strong proud father and gets him into trouble for disobeying. The whole plot could be the tale of many many northern born men within England at any point in time really. I have lived up north in the UK and it can indeed be a bit bleak with little job prospects for youngsters (no offence to the north). The whole film is one big stereotype really, but a very real and truthful stereotype. Billy's tough working father is a typical northern bloke who likes beer boxing and a good plate of drippin' sandwiches. The area they live in is of course very working class with small terrace housing along steep hills and flatcaps everywhere and the general attitude of all the men is somewhat old fashioned. Boys partake in football rugby and boxing, girls do ballet and sewing, there is no middle ground...dare I say homophobia is lightly touched upon too.I am exaggerating yes? well not really, as I said I've lived up north for many years and in some areas this is exactly what its like to this day. Thinking back to 1984-85 it would have been ten times worse!.The main crux of the story is Billy's struggle against 'the norm' and his fathers rules. He wants to be a ballet dancer, his school dance teacher thinks he's good enough but the money isn't there to fund it any further and his father hates the fact his boy might be a sissy. I think many people will be able to relate to this story as I said, but not just with dancing, with many areas. The scenes where Billy fights against his dad are naturally emotionally strong and really hooked me. There are many scenes where Billy gets into trouble by playing with his homosexual friend whom he doesn't understand is homosexual, not going to boxing lessons, going to ballet lessons and the intense strike sequences which are all terrifically acted out and really sucked me into the moment.The moments of spontaneous dance from Billy are really cool to watch, I really found myself wanting to dance too, yeah maybe I can do what Billy does!. Every character is wonderfully portrayed, Bell is a little bit too full of himself at times, a bit too eager to please by over acting perhaps but he's certainly fun to watch. The only character I thought was maybe a bit off was Billy's dad played by Gary Lewis. I really thought this character needed to be much harsher, stricter, he was tough but I didn't really fear him or his rule. I'm not saying there should have been nasty beatings but he just didn't sell the gruff northerner aspect to me despite the fact he's Scottish. I think the fact he is actually Scottish (and in the film it seems) means he doesn't have the REAL English northerner spirit inside him, unlike a real Geordie, Yorkshireman, Mackem etc...The build up to the finale is quite moving and did pull on my heart strings I can't deny. Its all very cliché but it damn well works...damn it!. The whole notion of anyone trying to simply make their father\/mother proud by their good actions or dedication to something is a warm path to tread and guaranteed hanky dampener at the movies. Again many will be able to relate to the lovely final curtain sequence as Billy finally shows his family what he has achieved, it does put a lump in your throat and made me wish I could do the same with my own father.I think you will get more out of this film being British and knowing of the north south divide and stereotypical views within the UK. I think if you live up north then you will certainly know the vibe this film gives off and will be able to relate and hopefully enjoy. It can be a feel good film but at the same time it can also be a slightly depressing film on various aspects...the miners strikes, being on the breadline, the grim north and being a youngster trying to break out of a situation. In the end the film is a joy to watch and should leave you upbeat. I hope I have not upset any of my northern countrymen, my dad is a Yorkshireman born n bred so I have experience ^_^9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 February 2014","score":"","review":" The film that started it all...well for this particular franchise\/story that is.

It concerns a student who foresees a plane crash and gets himself and 6 others off the plane, before a month later death starts coming after them in freak accidents and they have to work out how to stop death. That might be the best horror movie premise ever, and while the final product is a mixed bag it's never boring. Final Destination doesn't care about those who aren't horror fans and therefore some of the most important film elements such as acting and writing are neglected. In terms of acting, Devon Sawa gives one of the best performances of the series; Tony Todd steals the show as the creepy mortician and Sean William Scott adds some comic relief to the film but many of the other performances certainly aren't stellar. The script is the most developed and character driven of the franchise, but it's still not a great screenplay. Despite it's amazing premise, FD doesn't take the premise as far as it should and if it had done this it might have reduced the need for the now somewhat excessive stream of sequels.What people forget about FD is that despite not being scary (Then again, neither is Carrie or The Wicker Man but they're still fantastic) it is menacing, suspenseful, eerie and well directed. There is a sustained sense of intrigue throughout, and it holds up very well on multiple viewings. FD is not so much a film as a spooky, deliriously enjoyable and gleefully silly fun fair ghost train attraction, and it speeds through its eerie visuals, tense disaster sequences and Gothic thrills with admirable enthusiasm. Despite some less than great CGI, the plane crash is awesome, and the bus death scene is truly shocking and unexpected. The finale with Clear Rivers (Portrayed in an overly understated manner by Ali Larter) is also very tense, although the ending feels more routine. FD is a very fun horror film and I still hugely enjoy it although more as an enjoyable thrill ride rather than a work of actual quality.

Then it was last year after watching it again (it's a staple in my film rotation now of course) I fell in love with Jimmy Stewart. The man is a legend for a reason. He is mesmerizing on screen. I was very excited to watch this latest film because I had never heard of it and stumbled on it for 1$ in a Goodwill store. Simply put...wow. This is legendary film right here. It was easily one of the most unique, brilliantly written courtroom dramas I have ever seen. The first thing I noticed was the run time...nearly three hours for a courtroom drama...that seemed excessive and I thought for sure it would drag longer than it needed to. The magic of this film is that it doesn't drag for even a minute. The characters are so vibrant and the story intriguing and real and you can relate to it. More than 3\/4 of the film is in a courtroom and its witness, question, re-direct, question, witness, question and so on and so forth. You are watching a murder case unfold and you cannot turn away from it. It is a mystery of sorts but the investigation is simple and straight forward and then you're in the throes of the legal system.Jimmy Stewart just simply mesmerizes in this movie. His jaded and often sarcastic Paul Biegler is such an amazing character. Its not an in your face and over the top performance but he endears himself to you and is incredibly convincing in this role. He is subtly brilliant and watching him do what he obviously does best is perfect for the film. There is a back story to his character that certainly doesn't get in the way of the main plot but still does a lot to give him some depth. The stunning Lee Remick plays the wife of the accused. She is a sassy and perhaps abused woman dealing with issues she has with men. If there is one character I wanted to know more about it was hers but she is excellent in the part and her chemistry with Stewart is perfect. Ben Gazzara is the accused murderer and he is also very good. His character is brooding and stoic and he isn't very likable which is the entire idea behind his character. The very first interaction between him and Stewart shows that the two men don't like each other but Stewart still goes above and beyond to get him off. Arthur O'Connell is the perfect addition as Stewart's partner and adds a certain emotional depth to Stewart's character. O'Connell doesn't have a big role but its enough to really be important to the cast. Eve Arden also has a small role and yet it helps to really give depth and an emotional connection for Stewart's character who may come across as hard and jaded at times. Perhaps the only characters in the film that lacked depth and we're even very shallow performances were George C. Scott (a BRILLIANT actor but not so much this time around), Brooks West and Joseph Welch as our esteemed Judge who just seems bored and deliver his lines poorly.This film is brilliantly made. It was like they covered each and every detail and made sure it made sense and was fascinating enough and each character had purpose and would appeal to the audiences. All their bases are covered that make this a near perfect film watching experience. Otto Preminger should be heralded for this piece of film history because I just noticed so many little details that make this great. I think the film also stands up to the test of time because it actually is way ahead of its time. I mean it was banned in many cinemas due to some salty language for the time (panties was one of those words just to give you an idea of what I mean by salty) But beyond that I feel like Stewart and his team are forward thinkers and there is a moral message here about the law and perhaps even a satirical look at the legal system. It was fascinating. Law students should latch onto this and if you're looking for a film that you can talk about for hours or you can just sit back and enjoy this is one to see!

Then it was last year after watching it again (it's a staple in my film rotation now of course) I fell in love with Jimmy Stewart. The man is a legend for a reason. He is mesmerizing on screen. I was very excited to watch this latest film because I had never heard of it and stumbled on it for 1$ in a Goodwill store. Simply put...wow. This is legendary film right here. It was easily one of the most unique, brilliantly written courtroom dramas I have ever seen. The first thing I noticed was the run time...nearly three hours for a courtroom drama...that seemed excessive and I thought for sure it would drag longer than it needed to. The magic of this film is that it doesn't drag for even a minute. The characters are so vibrant and the story intriguing and real and you can relate to it. More than 3\/4 of the film is in a courtroom and its witness, question, re-direct, question, witness, question and so on and so forth. You are watching a murder case unfold and you cannot turn away from it. It is a mystery of sorts but the investigation is simple and straight forward and then you're in the throes of the legal system.Jimmy Stewart just simply mesmerizes in this movie. His jaded and often sarcastic Paul Biegler is such an amazing character. Its not an in your face and over the top performance but he endears himself to you and is incredibly convincing in this role. He is subtly brilliant and watching him do what he obviously does best is perfect for the film. There is a back story to his character that certainly doesn't get in the way of the main plot but still does a lot to give him some depth. The stunning Lee Remick plays the wife of the accused. She is a sassy and perhaps abused woman dealing with issues she has with men. If there is one character I wanted to know more about it was hers but she is excellent in the part and her chemistry with Stewart is perfect. Ben Gazzara is the accused murderer and he is also very good. His character is brooding and stoic and he isn't very likable which is the entire idea behind his character. The very first interaction between him and Stewart shows that the two men don't like each other but Stewart still goes above and beyond to get him off. Arthur O'Connell is the perfect addition as Stewart's partner and adds a certain emotional depth to Stewart's character. O'Connell doesn't have a big role but its enough to really be important to the cast. Eve Arden also has a small role and yet it helps to really give depth and an emotional connection for Stewart's character who may come across as hard and jaded at times. Perhaps the only characters in the film that lacked depth and we're even very shallow performances were George C. Scott (a BRILLIANT actor but not so much this time around), Brooks West and Joseph Welch as our esteemed Judge who just seems bored and deliver his lines poorly.This film is brilliantly made. It was like they covered each and every detail and made sure it made sense and was fascinating enough and each character had purpose and would appeal to the audiences. All their bases are covered that make this a near perfect film watching experience. Otto Preminger should be heralded for this piece of film history because I just noticed so many little details that make this great. I think the film also stands up to the test of time because it actually is way ahead of its time. I mean it was banned in many cinemas due to some salty language for the time (panties was one of those words just to give you an idea of what I mean by salty) But beyond that I feel like Stewart and his team are forward thinkers and there is a moral message here about the law and perhaps even a satirical look at the legal system. It was fascinating. Law students should latch onto this and if you're looking for a film that you can talk about for hours or you can just sit back and enjoy this is one to see!

While it certainly has its flaws, this was the first time that casual Western audiences who were new to manga had seen a cartoon be as meditative as is explosive.

Major Motoko Kusanagi (Atsuko Tanaka), a soldier working for government agency Section 9, is a cyborg, and is able to access this network through plugs in the back of her head. She and her team are assigned to catch an elusive 'ghost-hacker' known as the Puppet Master (Iemasa Kayumi), an intelligent entity created by the government, who they lost control of when it became self-aware. When the Puppet Master surfaces in the mangled body of an artificial human shell, Kusanagi faces a crisis of identity.Disappointingly, the film begins with gratuitous nudity, showing off the fine female form (with giant breasts, of course) of Major Kusanagi just before she takes a plunge off a building to nail some bad guys. Manga caters heavily for its audience, be it sexually-frustrated, highly- stressed businessmen or horny teenagers who have no doubt been bombarded with images of giggling, short-skirted school girls throughout their young life.

Things are grim in the future, but they're certainly beautiful to look at.The sexism aside, Kusanagi is an interesting character. When a man realises his wife and daughter are nothing more than an implanted memory, he fails to comprehend it.

Lawrence's funeral at the beginning of David Lean's biopic to end all biopics set forth two interpretations of the man that this film grapples with over its almost 4-hour runtime. Some are there to mourn a hero, a man who seemed to embody British hardiness and courage in an age of empire and global war. These true believers had followed his exploits as a leader in the Arab uprising against Ottoman rule, and for them he was an exotic, dashing figure out of Oriental legend, but with blue eyes and blond hair. Others in the crowd at Lawrence's massive public funeral are there not to mourn him, but to mark the passing of a rude, irresponsible braggart. Many present claim to have known him, but the ones who knew him best seem to be the ones who like him least. With this dichotomy of opinion in mind, the film takes us through the key events in Lawrence's campaigns. It does not insist upon a particular interpretation, but neither does it try to remain merely (and impossibly) objective.The depictions of Lawrence's treks across the desert have a majesty rarely equaled. Lean holds long shots of endless sand and blinding blue skies until they become sublime. Other directors known for their landscapes, like John Ford and Peter Jackson, usually have the advantage of filming soaring mountain ranges or colorful canyons, but Lean and his 3-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Freddie Young take vistas and palettes that are almost minimalist and turn them into visions of raw beauty. The score by Maurice Jarre, also a 3-time Academy Award recipient (all of Jarre's and Young's Oscars were for their collaborations with Lean) does its part and more, bringing a weighty romanticism to each scene and mirroring Lawrence's own unbounded emotionality.But of course the greatest and most indispensable element of the film is Peter O'Toole's performance as Lawrence. The young actor manages to present both Lawrences, the compelling and the off-putting, as a complete person with an inner universe of ambition and fear and assuredness and madness that he wears on his sleeve but that remains tantalizingly unknowable, the way historical figures' essential natures almost always are. O'Toole draws attention to himself seemingly without trying, even while sharing scenes with actors of such skill and presence as Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and Claude Raines, to whom are given most of the script's juiciest one-liners.I used to quibble with the sequence in which which Lawrence is taken captive by a Turkish commander during a nighttime sabotage mission and subjected to an implied threat of sexual abuse. I had always felt that it didn't quite fit; it suggested ideas that did not return for exploration later and that did not seem to have a lasting effect on Lawrence in spite of O'Toole's particularly tormented performance in the scene. I changed my mind about it when I learned, as many fans of the movie probably know well, that it is based on Lawrence's own public account of the incident. His private account, uncovered much later in a letter he wrote to a confidant, suggests that more happened than he was willing to admit, and O'Toole's heightened acting in this moment now seems perfectly consistent with the real Lawrence feelings about the event. I now think that to go further with this scene or to call it back later would be to enter the realm of speculation, while to omit it would be to excise one of the most remarkable episodes in Lawrence's own writings.The real Lawrence was an unreliable but fascinating narrator of his adventures, and the film adaptation of his life is exceptionally effective at creating a well-rounded portrait of the man. By the end, we cannot agree with the people at his funeral who see only the courageous and noble Lawrence. We have seen him at his most unstable, and have learned to question his motives and his sanity. In a moment of obvious but delicious irony, we have seen him, his identity concealed, earn the enmity of one of the very men who would later speak highly of him. All the same, we cannot dismiss him as easily as his detractors. His achievements are too spectacular, the life he lived too remarkable not to elicit some degree of admiration. As for the movie itself, the degree of admiration warranted is unambiguously very, very high.

The score by Maurice Jarre, also a 3-time Academy Award recipient (all of Jarre's and Young's Oscars were for their collaborations with Lean) does its part and more, bringing a weighty romanticism to each scene and mirroring Lawrence's own unbounded emotionality.But of course the greatest and most indispensable element of the film is Peter O'Toole's performance as Lawrence. The young actor manages to present both Lawrences, the compelling and the off-putting, as a complete person with an inner universe of ambition and fear and assuredness and madness that he wears on his sleeve but that remains tantalizingly unknowable, the way historical figures' essential natures almost always are. O'Toole draws attention to himself seemingly without trying, even while sharing scenes with actors of such skill and presence as Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and Claude Raines, to whom are given most of the script's juiciest one-liners.I used to quibble with the sequence in which which Lawrence is taken captive by a Turkish commander during a nighttime sabotage mission and subjected to an implied threat of sexual abuse. I had always felt that it didn't quite fit; it suggested ideas that did not return for exploration later and that did not seem to have a lasting effect on Lawrence in spite of O'Toole's particularly tormented performance in the scene. I changed my mind about it when I learned, as many fans of the movie probably know well, that it is based on Lawrence's own public account of the incident. His private account, uncovered much later in a letter he wrote to a confidant, suggests that more happened than he was willing to admit, and O'Toole's heightened acting in this moment now seems perfectly consistent with the real Lawrence feelings about the event. I now think that to go further with this scene or to call it back later would be to enter the realm of speculation, while to omit it would be to excise one of the most remarkable episodes in Lawrence's own writings.The real Lawrence was an unreliable but fascinating narrator of his adventures, and the film adaptation of his life is exceptionally effective at creating a well-rounded portrait of the man. By the end, we cannot agree with the people at his funeral who see only the courageous and noble Lawrence. We have seen him at his most unstable, and have learned to question his motives and his sanity. In a moment of obvious but delicious irony, we have seen him, his identity concealed, earn the enmity of one of the very men who would later speak highly of him. All the same, we cannot dismiss him as easily as his detractors. His achievements are too spectacular, the life he lived too remarkable not to elicit some degree of admiration. As for the movie itself, the degree of admiration warranted is unambiguously very, very high.

Lawrence's funeral at the beginning of David Lean's biopic to end all biopics set forth two interpretations of the man that this film grapples with over its almost 4-hour runtime. Some are there to mourn a hero, a man who seemed to embody British hardiness and courage in an age of empire and global war. These true believers had followed his exploits as a leader in the Arab uprising against Ottoman rule, and for them he was an exotic, dashing figure out of Oriental legend, but with blue eyes and blond hair. Others in the crowd at Lawrence's massive public funeral are there not to mourn him, but to mark the passing of a rude, irresponsible braggart. Many present claim to have known him, but the ones who knew him best seem to be the ones who like him least. With this dichotomy of opinion in mind, the film takes us through the key events in Lawrence's campaigns. It does not insist upon a particular interpretation, but neither does it try to remain merely (and impossibly) objective.The depictions of Lawrence's treks across the desert have a majesty rarely equaled. Lean holds long shots of endless sand and blinding blue skies until they become sublime.

It takes place in a small town of New Jersey. Sylvester Stallone plays sheriff Freddy Heflin who wanted to become a cop, but couldn't due to the incident that caused one of his ears deaf. There is corruption going on where crooked cops have mob connections. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) is an Internal Affairs officer who is investigating the case and asks Freddy for his help. Freddy at first is reluctant, but later comes to suspect that Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) might be one of the cops who is corrupt. He is then forced to make a dangerous choice between protecting his idols or upholding the law. Crime dramas are some of my favorite genre of film. I have always liked this film and enjoyed this film for its good writing, competent direction, and superb cast. One of the main reasons why I really like this film is because this movie makes a good point that nobody is above the law. No matter how much power you may have the law will always get to you. Also, it teaches you about doing what's right. James Mangold has written and directed this film. As far as his films go, this is in my opinion his best film he had directed. Mostly why I really like this film so much is it is filled with a wonderful cast. When you have Stallone, Keitel, De Niro, and Liotta in a film, you just cannot refuse that offer. Ray Liotta is good in his performance as Figsy, but out of the four actors he is my least favorite. Harvey Keitel is superb as a crooked cop Ray Donlan. Robert De Niro as Moe Tilden doesn't have a lot of screen time, but when he appears on screen, he is wonderful. Last but not least, I have to talk about Sylvester Stallone. I am a huge fan of Stallone and I have always felt that Stallone is often overlooked when it comes to his acting. For those people who think Stallone cannot act, watch this film. This movie shows that he can be a capable actor when his role is under good direction and writing. Freddy Heflin is a character you sympathize with right away due to the fact that he is treated very poorly by other cops. He deserved at least a nomination for his performance. Outside the lead actors, the supporting cast is filled with many familiar faces. A lot of them you either know or have seen from other films. Cop Land is a wonderful crime drama that features a superb cast, competent direction, and writing. I feel that this is an extremely overlooked film that deserves more recognition. If you like crime dramas then this might interest you. 10\/10 stars.

Is the plot unrealistic? The answer to this question depends on which part of it one means. To its credit, the movie opens by listing a series of counter-factual events to help get the viewer over the most unrealistic premise, namely that the Soviet Union would ever have tried to invade the United States in the face of the Mutually Assured Destruction our nuclear arsenals could have effected. We can thank Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and a number of other believers in peace through strength that these events are counter-factual, and join with Milius in razzing the peace-at-any-price bleeding hearts who would sooner have made this scenario a lot more plausible with their endless calls for unilateral disarmament.Of course, even with the counter-factual events, it's a bit of a stretch to suggest the Soviets would actually invade America rather than subvert it from within or just fire off their nukes and let the chips fall where they might. The Soviet Union was, after all, the wretched real-life dystopia that deliberately starved millions of its own peasants to death in order to collectivize farming, and its hellish collectivist system in turn is the one that left record crop yields to rot in the fields unharvested on numerous occasions while its peasants continued to starve; somehow, I doubt a government known to be so utterly heartless and indifferent to the starvation and suffering of its serfs in more agriculturally successful years would have behaved any differently in the event of a crop failure.So why the invasion-and-counter-attack plot? Well, maybe Red Dawn could have been about a full-fledged nuclear war, but The Day After (1983) had pretty effectively covered that story already. Soviet subversion? The short film The Children's Story (1982) had that story covered too. Knowing this, and in view of what we'd seen of actual Communist invasions in other countries (such as Cambodia and Vietnam), a story about such an invasion happening here in middle America might not seem so far-fetched if presented with a few proper hand-waves to the aforementioned obvious objections.In contrast to this one weakness, the vast majority of the rest of the story holds up a lot better to scrutiny, while critics' objections to it do not. Would Soviet and Cuban Communists really have been so cruel as to shoot up a high school (with RPGs, no less) the way they do at the beginning and then mass-murder civilians practically at random in reprisals for the young Wolverines' attacks? Anyone who asks this question must either be entirely disingenuous or thoroughly ignorant and naive of course they would! Try reading about the killing fields of Cambodia, of Mao's mass murders in China, Stalin's daily massacres that rivaled and surpassed Hitler's in their cruelty and enormity, of the Soviet gulags and the torture and terror ordinary civilians daily faced for making the tiniest mistake; even the Nazis were never so cruel and evil to so many populations of entire countries as the Communists, albeit not for lack of trying. Really, Red Dawn is actually rather kinder to the Communists than they deserve.Is it realistic having practically every one of the Wolverines be white and male? What kind of stupid question is that!? This is a war movie set in Colorado! Of course nearly everybody is white and male! Everybody's pulling his and her weight here, including the Hispanic guy (though I do wish the story could have made something of his fluency in Spanish; like maybe have him spy on the Cuban invaders for valuable intelligence) and race is thoroughly irrelevant.Is the characterization of a homegrown insurgency realistic? Well, ask a member of the Dutch Resistance NPR did, and he said it was a very accurate depiction of the kind of desperation, mistrust, and infighting he experienced as a resistance fighter in his own time. Could a few of the actors have given a better performance? Maybe. The scene where one of the kids' fathers yells after them to Avenge me! is likely to pull an unintentional laugh from the audience and probably should have been cut from the final product; but on the whole, I'd say everyone turned in at least a competent performance and some were quite excellent.Is the propaganda a little heavy-handed? In places, sure. Has that ever stopped people from enjoying a movie? Screen Junkies's honest trailer for James Cameron's CGI-saturated propaganda crap-fest Avatar neatly and effectively summarizes that flick's message as military=bad, trees=good. For Red Dawn, one could just as easily summarize the message as Commies and gun control=bad, American patriotism and survivalism=good. Hey, if the gun control freaks and America-haters and grievance-mongering Commie parasites infesting Hollywood and Washington D.C. and nearly all of academia get to have their propaganda flicks, why shouldn't we patriotic right-wing gun-owning taxpayers get to have ours?Red Dawn is not exactly perfect, but in the final analysis, it's fun, it's watchable, and it's far superior to the mindless action flicks Hollywood cranks out these days. Also, Commies and gun control ARE bad and patriotism and survivalism ARE good. The only thing appalling about this film's message is that anyone felt the need to remind us of these truths at all, a testament to the damage the Soviet subversives did to America's culture during the Cold War. More appalling still is that Hollywood actually thought it could dip back into this movie's success for a remake in this day and age when the Cold War is over and any idea even remotely patriotic and right-wing has been permanently banished from Hollywood's treasonous far-left culture forever.

The only thing appalling about this film's message is that anyone felt the need to remind us of these truths at all, a testament to the damage the Soviet subversives did to America's culture during the Cold War. More appalling still is that Hollywood actually thought it could dip back into this movie's success for a remake in this day and age when the Cold War is over and any idea even remotely patriotic and right-wing has been permanently banished from Hollywood's treasonous far-left culture forever. This movie came out in the right place at the right time, but now that time is past.

It's not just used for a rush of adrenaline; its deep moral keeps it from becoming a simple blood and gore horror flick. The film it truly made a noticeable effort to be important in its cinematic form. To start off the film, the un-burying of a corpse is already unsettling, but the twilight lighting, the forsaken crucifix in the background and the close-up of Dr. Henry Frankenstein's face bearing his wild eyes make for a very creepy beginning. Dr. Frankenstein's desperate will to play god is the driving force behind the plot, and letting the audience know both how crazy he is about his dream and how far he is willing to go to achieve it. His famous line, It's alive, it's moving, it's alive! It's alive, it's alive, it's alive! It's ALIVE! shows his ecstasy as he raves around the room. He has yet to realize the flaws in his creation, the least of which being his phobia of fire. Fire symbolizes The Monster's flaws, which is hinted at through the camera's slow fading of a scene until all that is visible is the burning light, before that also disappears. Examples of this are when Fritz is torturing The Monster with a waving torch, and when the angry group of villagers wave their torches down the trail to the monster. The movie is creepy overall, but a major drawback of the fundamentals of the entire film is the lack of sound. Instead of a thrilling score to sway audience members toward each emotion, the sound throughout every scene lacks depth. Unfortunately, this is a flaw that could have easily been remedied. Frankenstein's moral is indisputably clear. Dr. Henry Frankenstein, played by Colin Clive, is desperate to play god. He is a crazed doctor with a ghastly dream to fulfill to create man. But he also somehow understands the consequences, as at the last moment before his creation, played by Boris Karloff) is woken, he falters and betrays his recognition of how real his dream is becoming (pushed to this by his fiancée, Elizabeth), and how wrong it is. His creation, however, rises from the grave (or, as he is kind of a quilt of many corpses, the graves) and although the Dr. wishes to be proud of his dream coming true, after only a little while he can no longer bear to see his monster alive. He flees to his home, and prepares to marry Elizabeth, and because of his blatant skirting of his responsibilities as The Monster's rightful killer, it goes on a murderous rampage, but only because it doesn't understand consequence (he must have learned that bit from his creator) and is angry at being not only prodded at but at being left to fend for himself. As the Dr.'s life is now in danger (his life being his loved ones and his reputation) he finally faces the monster he created, but only to let others do his dirty work and kill his dream. After the misunderstood creation dies by the only thing he really fears, the Dr. happily marries Elizabeth, recovers, and everybody raises a toast to the house of Frankenstein. Therein lies the frustration of every audience member. Seeing the injustice of the man who played god live happily ever after despite the blood on his hands is the sole cause for the dissatisfaction of this film.
