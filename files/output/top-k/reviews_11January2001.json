I saw it opening night and it started and I thought to myself, wow, this is a good movie. The acting was great, the different moods for the different cities was great. I liked it. Then a problem arose. The theater I was watching this movie in was beeping. This was normal to me because I have seen many other movies in this theater and I knew about the beep. Apparently the woman next to me didn't think it was the theater. She thought I was for some reason playing a joke and beeping every five minutes. In the middle of the movie she cursed at me and told me to stop. I told her it wasn't me, but she didn't believe me and told her very large husband about the situation. He gave me a look. I was scared and remained scared through the rest of the movie. Every time the beeping happened, I tensed up and was unable to pay attention to the movie. She would whisper in her husband's ear everytime it beeped and he would give me a look. I'm sweating now. I tell my friend of the situation and he laughs. Because he laughs, she thinks he's also making the beeping noise. At one point she went into her purse and pulled out what looked to me like a can of mase, but ended up being lipstick. So as it went, I didn't enjoy the movie. I kept asking my friend what was happening. I would get a piece of gum out of my pocket and the beep would happen at the exact same time, making it look like I have a beeping device in my pocket. So the credits came up and I wanted to get out. I turned and looked at this woman for one last look and she attacked me. She grabbed my hair and my ear and bounced my head off the arm of the chair five times. (This is true) When I came to, I escaped and stood up. The lights came on and I realized we now had an audience. I called her a bad word and her very large husband stood up. He must have been hot because his face was all sweaty and he looked very mad and I think me calling his wife the swear word didn't help. I jumped over the seat and managed to escape my attackers and get into my car with my friend. I got a baseball bat out of the trunk just incase, but yeah, Traffic was good.

Even though the movie is only an hour and half, the movie is packed with action, right from the very start. Planes overhead, explosions, good looking women-what more can you ask for in a movie!  This certainly is not one of the normal, boring, and usually horribly acted Christian movies that I have seen.  Kirk Cameron and Brad Johnson led this cast with superb performances as Buck Williams and Rayford Steele.  The two characters battle with the spirituality they know and come to find something bigger and better.  And yet they end up trapped in the middle of good and evil every time.  Perhaps one of the best casting moves this movie has made was that of Gordon Currie as Nicholae Carpathia. Currie portrays the Anti-Christ character as he will be when he really comes-as a great, likable, and all around generous man.  One doesn't realize his true identity until the end of the film.Amazingly enough, this movie is a great adaptation of the book, and follows very closely with what happened in it.  Had the viewer never read the book, however, the movie would have been just as good, if not better.  The characters are masterfully developed; bringing out who they truly are and watching them change as the movie progresses.  The plot twists, the hidden personalities of the characters, their conversions are all unforeseen when the movie begins.  Knowing nothing about the Biblical story or the Left Behind series would even further express the point that this movie is trying to get across.The cinematography, directed by Peter and Paul Lalonde, rivals that of some Hollywood producers.  The use of different camera angles, colors, lighting, and overall direction is astounding, drawing the viewer into the film simply with how the film appears.  If you are thinking about seeing this movie a second time, please do.  After watching a second time, I realized that I liked the movie even more than the first.  To be honest, I wasn't too impressed the first time around, but maybe me expectations were too high. I was able to catch many of the special production tricks that the Lalondes added to spice up this movie.Left Behind is a must-see, whether a Christian or not, this film will spark your interest and most likely leave you with many questions (and a burning desire to see what happens next) but you will also find yourself happy that you spent the money to see a great movie.

And after watching this version of `Psycho,' directed by Gus Van Sant, two things come to mind immediately  What's the point, and what on earth were they thinking?  Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same screenplay (by Joseph Stefano, taken from the novel by Robert Bloch) that Hitchcock used.  The final result here underscores some of the finer points of the art of filmmaking  First, that a `remake' should be just that; a retooling of the original, rather than a `copy' using new players; and second, that shooting in color, using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film. \tAlthough this was a noble effort by Van Sant, ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which Norma Bates was afflicted  The `mind' of the film was divided; half was Hitchcock, half Van Sant.  And the twain, though met, shall never be bound.  Van Sant, even working from the original script, would have been better off making his own film-- all the way through-- rather than attempting to duplicate exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes.  The opening shot of the movie, for instance, and especially the `shower' scene, arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema.  Copying Hitchcock, from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain, and using the same `skree! skree! skree!' sound effects-- even as homage to Hitchcock-- again, only distracted from the story.  And, if you factor in the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast), you have yet another split in the psyche of the film.   \tMacy is a terrific actor-- one of the best character actors in the business-- and his performance here is excellent; but as good as it is, the attitude and delivery are pure David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times), and seemingly out of context with what Van Sant is doing.  So the film winds up with a triple personality disorder  Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet.  I felt like I was watching `House Of Good Will Psycho Games.' \tAs far as performances go, Macy's was as solid as they come, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job of creating an original character, escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of Janet Leigh.  The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made Marion's boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place; and Vince Vaughn, who--to put it as delicately as possible-- was simply awful as Norman Bates.  His whole performance was that of an actor playing a role (and not very convincingly at that); affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with `spontaneous' bursts of maniacal laughter made his Norman more of a caricature than a character, altogether unbelievable and pretentious.  It gave the movie the feel of a reenactment of a `True Incident' you would see on a television show; it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from Norman sitting alone in his parlor to a shot of a sober-faced Peter Graves, intoning, `Such was the mind-set of Norman Bates on that fateful, rainy night when Marion Crane stepped out of her car and into his life--' \tThe supporting cast includes Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney (Mrs. Chambers), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie the Car Dealer).  If nothing else, Van Sant's `Psycho' is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director, a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily insure a success.  Granted, todays era of psycho-babble, `American Psycho' and Hannibal Lecter have effectively taken the edge off of a character like Norman Bates somewhat; but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims that will forever remain inherently disturbing and terrifying; but Van Sant is unable to convey that sense of dread, that throat-clenching fear, with this film.

Then, to make matters worse, hikers seen earlier by the quad are found dead on Coffin Rock in good old Stickman Pentagram fashion and strange Wiccan Alphabet symbols are etching themselves onto their skin.That is the overall premise of BW2. Mixed with interviews with police, townspeople, flashes of strange rituals and murders and the occasional dead child waddling around, a certain creep factor begins to appear, but not nearly as much as it's predecessor.Overall, BW2 had it's own sort of appeal. If you just wanted a strange movie with a fun witch back-story then it'd do, but as a follow up to an actual scary movie with a more creepy sub-text then it sadly falters.The actors are great, with the occasional worried look and shocked appearance during trippy murder visions. Burkettsville is looking as spooky as ever, though a Mill is the new scene of madness for this outing.The Blair Witch Mythology, created for the first movie, kinda takes a back-step in this film.

","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"11 January 2001","score":"","review":"  The Blair Witch Project was a revolutionary experiment in fear through an audience's perceptions of what could have happened to those three student film makers in their ill fated trip to Burkettsville after their footage was found showing their strange demise.Blair Witch 2 Book of Shadows is really just another film where strange flashes and frights are rampant, though a mild sense of fear is created.The difference between the two? The 1st Blair Witch was actually believable, the 2nd one isn't.This time around, rather than the more convincing shaky black and white snippets of film mixed with shaky coloured film, the piece is a Fictional Re-enactment of events that occurred after the first film was released at cinema's everywhere, following four budding students into the Black Hills once more to find out just what happened to Heather, Josh and Mike.Sadly, the fact that it is a Fictional Re-enactment takes the fun out of believing that this piece could possibly be true. BW2 is simply too professional looking to seem realistic, even for a Re-enactment Whereas BW1 had a certain sense of mystery and reality.Although entertaining in it's own right, the fact that you don't really believe that these bizarre things happened to people lets down the aura that the first created. Because of the shakiness and poor quality of the picture in the first Blair Witch it made things more believable...But this time, with a literal cast of thousands, a soundtrack, cinematic score, boom mike and casting director, you begin to feel that the Blair Witch makers are just out the make a buck...And I hear you all gasp.My bitterness though did not spoil my outing, though a wayward film reel did. Actually, it added to the movie, as during their first visit to that Mill the film on screen was strangely angled and I thought it was clever. Until the Cinema Man walked in and apologised before having it promptly reassigned.Onto the movie now...there were actual scary bits. The bit where the Gothic Girl sees the fun dead kids was kinda creepy. The good 'ole laughing and crying children made a comeback, plus flashes, distressed looks and visions of what took place during a lost 5 hours.Which is where the story comes in. The four new people, one was called Tristian I remember that much, go on The Blair Witch Hunt into the Black Hills to have a camp out in the ruins of the Rustin Parr  ( see the first film to find out who he is ) house to catch a glimpse of our favourite Blair Witch.After a drinking and smoking session, the four awaken to discover strew paper and smashed, lost video equipment, before realising that they had in fact lost 5 hours during the night. Then, to make matters worse, hikers seen earlier by the quad are found dead on Coffin Rock in good old Stickman Pentagram fashion and strange Wiccan Alphabet symbols are etching themselves onto their skin.That is the overall premise of BW2. Mixed with interviews with police, townspeople, flashes of strange rituals and murders and the occasional dead child waddling around, a certain creep factor begins to appear, but not nearly as much as it's predecessor.Overall, BW2 had it's own sort of appeal. If you just wanted a strange movie with a fun witch back-story then it'd do, but as a follow up to an actual scary movie with a more creepy sub-text then it sadly falters.The actors are great, with the occasional worried look and shocked appearance during trippy murder visions. Burkettsville is looking as spooky as ever, though a Mill is the new scene of madness for this outing.The Blair Witch Mythology, created for the first movie, kinda takes a back-step in this film. Sure, there's the whole blame the witch possession aspect, but no actual explanation of what happened to Rustin Parr's house since the last film. The whole Coffin Rock past murder things. The disappearance of Heather and Co. in the last movie. Or even the Blair Witch herself, though the facing the corner Rustin Parr murder style thing is seen for a brief moment.The absence of the mythology and the sort of twist that the ending takes leads viewers to believe, rather reluctantly, that the apparent 3rd movie will consist of five students going to the Mill to find out what happened to the students in the 2nd film, who in turn were just trying to find out what happened to the three students in the first film and so on and so forth for another 59 sequels...Hopefully the guys take the first BW approach and just send people out and chase them around shouting Oooga Booga for the 3rd one Prequel thing.The point of all my rambling simply comes down to Blair Witch 2 Book of Shadows being a great movie in it's own right. Creepy, strange and thought provoking. But, it doesn't quite make it as a sequel to the original Blair Witch as it misses the essence of its predecessor.Go see it just to see what everyone is complaining about and get your own opinion of it.

What I find amazing about this film is the objective way that he tackles it. Two people could watch it at the same time and come away with completely different opinions on the Drug War itself, along with the movie. That may be the movie's greatest strength and weakness.This film is based on the British miniseries named Traffik. I haven't seen it, but that didn't detract anything from Soderbergh's epic. I found the whole thing quite fascinating and found that the movie's 2 and a half-hour running time flew by.Some people may be distracted or confused by how the 3 separate (but vaguely related) storylines switch back and forth. I found it pretty easy to keep track since the director used different kinds of film for different locations. The Tijuana storyline is shot in a bright, grainy style that almost leaves a dusty taste in your mouth. The San Diego scenes are shot in a bright, soft light that tastes like a peach. The east coast (mostly Washington) scenes are more stark, and sometimes gray and colorless. It leaves a taste of grime in your mouth. But it's expensive grime.The Washington story follows Michael Douglas' character as he is being groomed to ascend to the office of Drug Czar. To those not in the know, the Drug Czar is charged with keeping illegal drugs out of the country and out of the hands of Americans, not the other way around as the title suggests. This is all made more complex by the fact that his daughter, your standard, over-achieving, straight-A student, is becoming a heroin addict. In my opinion, this is the one weak link in the film. Perhaps it's because I have some personal experience in this matter, but her downward spiral wasn't quite convincing enough for me. Douglas gives an excellent performance as a well-meaning, but distant father. Through the course of the movie we find that Douglas's character and his wife (played by Amy Irving) are having marital difficulties which are relevant to the issue at hand.Meanwhile in Mexico, a cop named Javier Rodriguez (Benicio del Toro), an underpaid and under-appreciated nark, crosses the path of General Salazar. Salazar (Tomas Milian in an excellent role) is a mysterious man out to eradicate the Obregon family's drug syndicate. He is poised to become the Mexican equivalent of the Drug Czar. Javier starts working for him, but soon becomes suspicious of Salazar's methods (this might as well be set in present day Columbia - the situations are very similar). We gradually learn that Javier is the one honest cop in all of Mexico (or so it would seem). Benicio del Toro gives an awesome performance in this flick - it could make him a big time star. Someone called him the soul of this film and I would have to agree. He's a simple man, but he's honest, and that's more than you can say for most of the rest of the characters.The third storyline deals with Catharine Zeta-Jones' character (Helena Ayala) and her shock as her husband is inexplicably arrested by federal agents. She learns he is a drug lord. But she is used to their lavish lifestyle. She grew up poor and she doesn't want her young son and unborn child to suffer the same fate. She also finds that her husband has debts which will have to be repaid with the life of her child if she can't find several million dollars. Reluctantly, but firmly, she starts taking over his business and plots to kill the stool-pigeon who is the star witness against her husband.Confused yet? Yes, it's a fairly involved story - this is not a popcorn flick. Soderbergh deals with the drug war in a serious manner befitting such a serious issue. I was able to glean his personal feelings on the issue, but I was impressed by how he doesn't let them swamp the film. Again, this is a balanced film, and it let's you go on believing whatever you want to believe about our nation's costly, ineffective and ridiculous drug war. It does, however, make it clear that the war is unwinnable. It hints that the cure may be worse than the disease.Some people have commented that certain characters tend to give lectures on the cold realities of the war, but I think this is quite realistic. I am prone to such lectures myself, but they are a function of the incredible repression (social & political) that came with the Drug War zealotry with Nancy Reagan in the 80's. Ever since then, criticizing the Drug War has been taboo, and perhaps that is why Soderbergh feels he must try to be so objective. It also explains why people, given the chance, can erupt into long rants about the injustice of the war. We've been bottling up our opinions for so long, they tend to explode when we let them seep out. That is why I am so impressed with Soderbergh's balanced and fair direction, even though the Drug War is so full of fallacy and lies and corruption and hatred and racism that it probably doesn't deserve it.But don't worry. If you think that the best way to cure addiction is to throw people in jail, take their house, car and computer, terrorize their family and ostracize them, then this movie won't completely change your mind. But it will give you something to think about. One last thing, though - if you believe that the Drug War is still winnable, this movie will destroy your fantasy world and you will be forced to concede that there is no way we will be able to keep drugs out of the hands of our fellow Americans.

However, Arthur Miller's Crucible commits the same crime of taking real people and distorting history for dramatic effect; I don't attack that work or Quills, because essentially both are allegories addressing bigger social issues.Quills is perfect for the age of Eminem- another artist whose profane scandalous works of sex and violence are selling like wildfire around the country and world  (The Real Slim Shady was No. 2 on the top 40 in Ireland.) Meanwhile, the content is assaulted by rights groups, coalitions of rightist Christians along with liberal feminist and homosexual groups. Questions of free speech, rights of record labels to profit off such lyrics, the place of government, and whether work such as Eminem's will incite violence all arise.Quills handles these very issues in a provocative manner.  Abbe Coulmier poses the same questions to De Sade that we pose to Eminem.  Why can't he write more positive work?  De Sade I write of human fundamentals.  We live. We eat.  We s**t.  We f**k.  We die. It's religion's obligation to illustrate virtues, not art, and a religion that can't tolerate the opposition is a weak one.  Coulmier says that De Sade writes wooden characters and flat dialogue, just as many accuse Eminem's work of repeating the same self-aggrandizing themes over and over again.There is the issue of profiting from such work- De Sade's wife eventually uses the tainted money from Justine to fund the renovations of the asylum, just as Collard later uses profits from the Opus Sadicum to further expand Charenton, and probably funnel a good deal to his mansion.  The film enters an ambiguous moral territory by showing De Sade's work used to further the oppressive potential of Charenton.Quills seems to see corruption as the first step to redemption, but nowhere does one get the sense that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  You leave the theater asking questions and having no answers. The virtuous dashing hero, Abbe Coulmier, turns into a madman.  The Marquis is progressively stripped, in every sense of the word, of any power or potential.  There is no one to root for.  While inspired by the ingenious measures De Sade takes to write, I turn against him when faced with his monstrous insults to the Abbe, his lechery towards Madeleine, and violence towards his wife.Indeed, the character you end up rooting for is the nun-turned-whore wife of the Doctor.  She inspires De Sade's most volatile play, and De Sade's Justine in turn inspires her to escape her cage and run away into a lewd affair.  The film seems to just barely hit upon the sexual rights of women.  Part of what inspires the furor about De Sade is the way he seems to inspire women to sexual awareness- witness the first shot of the film, a ravishing young woman stripped of her maiden head at the guillotine while the crowd roars.  In some strange way, the Marquis seems to wish the liberation of these women from piety and convention through eroticism. Indeed, the only moment when De Sade hits a genuine emotional note (SPOILER) is in discovering Madeleine died a virgin he collapses in sorrow.Quills sacrifices any possibility of a happy ending from the moment the government decides to silence De Sade for the good of the nation. Napoleon seeks to end the scandal caused by the Marquis' words is to silence his tongue.  The words are sometimes brilliant, but often just childish perversity.  The people enjoy De Sade though- why not just allow the open consumption of his books?  There are rumors that readers of his books are led to murder and infidelity.  The response of the Abbe is simple If a man tried to walk on water and drowned, you wouldn't blame the Bible.The only answer seems for the government to neither fear the Marquis' work, but equally discourage making it into an enterprise.  De Sade should have been allowed to write freely and to be published, but not for profit. You don't have to listen to Eminem (and you certainly shouldn't award him before a national TV audience), but you do have to stop trying to shut them down.  You can try to counter his brand of rap with a more positive activist kind.  Unfortunately,  political rap gets little attention from commercial radio stations here, because the lyrics so often go against their commercial ends, sympathies, and hope to reach the largest possible audience by stripping the music of any genuine social or political positions.  Sorry for the thoughts, but like I said, Quills is a quite provocative allegory. It's also one of the best films of the year.Quills should win best adapted screenplay.  Kate Winslet, Joaquin Phoenix, Geoffrey Rush should be nominated for their work, along with cinematography, art direction, and director Philip Kaufman.

Sorry for the thoughts, but like I said, Quills is a quite provocative allegory. It's also one of the best films of the year.Quills should win best adapted screenplay.  Kate Winslet, Joaquin Phoenix, Geoffrey Rush should be nominated for their work, along with cinematography, art direction, and director Philip Kaufman.  ","genre":"Biography, Drama"},{"date":"11 January 2001","score":"","review":"  FargoFan's reaction to how Quills treats history is totally valid. However, Arthur Miller's Crucible commits the same crime of taking real people and distorting history for dramatic effect; I don't attack that work or Quills, because essentially both are allegories addressing bigger social issues.Quills is perfect for the age of Eminem- another artist whose profane scandalous works of sex and violence are selling like wildfire around the country and world  (The Real Slim Shady was No. 2 on the top 40 in Ireland.) Meanwhile, the content is assaulted by rights groups, coalitions of rightist Christians along with liberal feminist and homosexual groups. Questions of free speech, rights of record labels to profit off such lyrics, the place of government, and whether work such as Eminem's will incite violence all arise.Quills handles these very issues in a provocative manner.  Abbe Coulmier poses the same questions to De Sade that we pose to Eminem.  Why can't he write more positive work?  De Sade I write of human fundamentals.  We live. We eat.  We s**t.  We f**k.  We die. It's religion's obligation to illustrate virtues, not art, and a religion that can't tolerate the opposition is a weak one.  Coulmier says that De Sade writes wooden characters and flat dialogue, just as many accuse Eminem's work of repeating the same self-aggrandizing themes over and over again.There is the issue of profiting from such work- De Sade's wife eventually uses the tainted money from Justine to fund the renovations of the asylum, just as Collard later uses profits from the Opus Sadicum to further expand Charenton, and probably funnel a good deal to his mansion.  The film enters an ambiguous moral territory by showing De Sade's work used to further the oppressive potential of Charenton.Quills seems to see corruption as the first step to redemption, but nowhere does one get the sense that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  You leave the theater asking questions and having no answers. The virtuous dashing hero, Abbe Coulmier, turns into a madman.  The Marquis is progressively stripped, in every sense of the word, of any power or potential.  There is no one to root for.  While inspired by the ingenious measures De Sade takes to write, I turn against him when faced with his monstrous insults to the Abbe, his lechery towards Madeleine, and violence towards his wife.Indeed, the character you end up rooting for is the nun-turned-whore wife of the Doctor.  She inspires De Sade's most volatile play, and De Sade's Justine in turn inspires her to escape her cage and run away into a lewd affair.  The film seems to just barely hit upon the sexual rights of women.  Part of what inspires the furor about De Sade is the way he seems to inspire women to sexual awareness- witness the first shot of the film, a ravishing young woman stripped of her maiden head at the guillotine while the crowd roars.  In some strange way, the Marquis seems to wish the liberation of these women from piety and convention through eroticism. Indeed, the only moment when De Sade hits a genuine emotional note (SPOILER) is in discovering Madeleine died a virgin he collapses in sorrow.Quills sacrifices any possibility of a happy ending from the moment the government decides to silence De Sade for the good of the nation. Napoleon seeks to end the scandal caused by the Marquis' words is to silence his tongue.  The words are sometimes brilliant, but often just childish perversity.  The people enjoy De Sade though- why not just allow the open consumption of his books?  There are rumors that readers of his books are led to murder and infidelity.  The response of the Abbe is simple If a man tried to walk on water and drowned, you wouldn't blame the Bible.The only answer seems for the government to neither fear the Marquis' work, but equally discourage making it into an enterprise.  De Sade should have been allowed to write freely and to be published, but not for profit. You don't have to listen to Eminem (and you certainly shouldn't award him before a national TV audience), but you do have to stop trying to shut them down.

I felt that the director simply overlaid a generic story onto the Revolutionary War theme, and did so in a very unbalanced, black and white manner. I don't want to restate the many views already expressed, so I'll just say that my main objection to this film, was the way it assumes the viewing public are all simpletons. For example, why was it necessary for the director to bludgeon us with his obvious bias against the British in this film? I mean, how many atrocities did he require Col.Tavington to commit before he ensured that everyone in the audience was baying for British blood? Come on Mr Emmerich, haven't you ever heard of subtlety?Apart from the black and white nature of the whole picture, there were far too many totally unrealistic scenes. Are we really to believe that Benjamin Martin and his two young boys could so easily despatch an entire company of British soldiers?What a shame that what could (and should have) been a balanced, stirring narrative on an important period of America's history, was ultimately reduced to such formulaic Hollywood fluff. I sincerely hope that another studio\/director revisits the topic, and does it right. As always, I suppose it all comes down to making a film that will score big at the box office, versus making a film that will actually mean something long after the movie posters for it have been torn down.
