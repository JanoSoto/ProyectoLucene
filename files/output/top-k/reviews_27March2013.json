This is just as good as a lot of other Willis actioners. Most of Willis's films I like, and this is no exception. It's really a very well plotted revenge thriller, with a great car chase, I might add, which left this flick playing over a couple of months in Adelaide. I like the family angle to it. Willis like his father, (John Mahoney, before Frasier, and years after Code Of Silence, which he made a brief appearance in) is a Pittsburgh cop. So is his Uncle (Dennis Farina) and his two other sons, one of them who's on trial for battery, where Willis gone up against him, telling the court the real version, much to the bitter dislike of his fellow officers. Like Willis's character, Tom Hardy, (catchy) says Look where telling the truth's got me. Sadly at the end of the chase, things went awry, where Mahoney is executed. There's a bigger picture to this story, and I'm not gonna spoil it for ya. Soon after, Farina's bad cop son, where things are not looking to good for him, threatens to jump off the bridge saying Cops don't go to prison. I'm not going. Well, bad cops do. Well, he jumps. His body's never recovered. Cut to a couple of years later, disgraced cop, Willis, now drowning his sorrows in alcohol, and making the best of his stinking situation, now works as a river cop. Everything's just dandy. He lives on a houseboat, has a cat, even gets a surprise visit later from Farina's other out of control, boozing son, now ex cop, (Tom Sizemore, quite impressive here) who like the other cops, initially had it in for Hardy too. Things are looking up when he's partnered with Jo, new to the job. But now things are about to become a living hell, where for Hardy, his haunted past returns, though he's always been haunted, since those tragic events years prior. A score of dead young women, start surfacing on the river waters, all of who have been sexually involved with Willis. He's convinced this is the work of the same killer, responsible for his father's execution. So here's a great thriller ride for you. Too, as an added treat, we have an unrelated action scene on a houseboat, where some hijackers have taken it over, so it's good ol Bruce to the rescue. Too near the end, in it's horrifying revelation, where the killer comes into light, we really learn about family and loyalty, where again to finish the killer off, a cattle crod is used, that instantly had me remembering that scene in The Last Boy Scout. And like the end of Cobra, Willis gets to punch out the loud mouthed cop. See, this film has everything, including a bit of romance and a nice after ending. For Willis fans, specially.

It's a scary movie that foreshadow a bleak Malthusian future if we don't do anything about it. This movie was made at a time when Paul Ehrlich's The Population Bomb was causing alarm throughout the academic and cultural elites in this country. Directed by Richard Fleischer, the film is a science fiction film noire. The meat of the story is that in 2022, the environment of the world has been nearly wipe out due to over population. Homeless people fill the streets and food is scarce; and most of the population survives on rations of Soylent Green produced by the Soylent Corporation. The food is believe to be high energy plankton, more nutritious and palatable than its predecessors Red and Yellow, but in short supply. The Soylent Company is running as all-time high, as the lack of a productive democratic government allows for a corporate take-over of the government, that become an unbalanced privatization, where increased profits are prioritized over the well-being of individuals and societies. Think of the Nazi regime and how they supplied corporations such as ThyssenKrupp with slave laborers. Here government also supplied the security forces for the Soylent Company with a special brand of fascism called corporatism. Still they have a thorn in their rose garden that trying to prick them. By Thorn, I meant Detective Thorn (Charleston Heston) who is investigating into the murder of a wealthy businessman in the Soylent Company, but what he finds might shock him and the world even more. Charleston Heston was great. There's a scene in an orphanage where Heston talks to a burnt out priest that is especially powerful. Based on Harry Harrison's book, Make Room! Make Room!, the title was changed by the producers, who feared that audiences would confuse it with the Danny Thomas' TV series Make Room for Daddy. The word Soylent is supposed to suggest soybeans and lentils. New York City Police Department detective Robert Thorn lives with his aged friend Solomon Sol Roth (Edward G. Robertson), a former scholar who helps Thorn's investigations. Edward G. Robertson was amazing in this film as the funny and poignant cranky partner who constantly talks about the good old days. He really put it all on the line. See at the time, he was in very poor health with cancer, Edward was almost totally deaf when he made this movie, and only able to hear anyone if they spoke directly into his ear. His best performance was the scene where he was 'going home'. Charlton Heston was really crying because he was so moved by Edward G. Robinson's performance. Robinson knew he was dying from cancer and kept it from the cast and crew. He knew this would be his last film, and only Charlton Heston knew about the Cancer. Edward died just ten days after shooting wrapped. The music overture in that scene alone was beautiful and the beautiful shots of stock footage of nature felt nostalgia for a character that saw those natural landmarks disappears in his own eyes. Great use of classic music like Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, the Pathetique. Follow up with Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony #6 The Pastoral and Morning from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite #1. This movie is very slow at times, but the big reveal, the payoff of the movie was pushed through pretty fast. I feel like I just wasted an hour and a half in some scenes. The ending scene is a still a big twist to those who haven't saw the movie, but it's never going to be a big enough surprised as it was in 1973. The DVD cover pretty much gives it away anyways. Plus, it's so out there, that most people who knows about the film, knows what Soylent Green before watching the film. Everyone by now knows the plot and the famous catch phrase. So the movie lose a lot of suspense, do to that. Still, Hannibal Lector would love the movie, Soylent Green. Dog eat Dog world just became people eat Soylent Green world. This movie is just amazing with its message. I just wish it had more technology or futuristic sets. The sets look like cardboard and the effects are primitive. In one scene a woman plays a modern video game that looks like first generation Missile Command. The movie can be a bit sexist, as women in the film are wooden characters just there for eye candy and the random sex scene. Perhaps we should just educate the women and make condoms in surplus. Educated women usually have fewer children and the availability of condoms will allow people to control their reproductive cycles. Just an idea. Anyone who has taken the time to research will find out the scenarios portrayed in that book know that something isn't right. Instead of mass starvation, we have a crisis in obesity in much of the world. The famines we have are largely human-engineered, the result of war and population displacement. It is ludicrous to believe New York City or any other place in 2022 will look anything remotely like it does in Soylent Green, but it's still possible. Still, the demographics are a little off as, amongst the hoards of milling masses are nearly all white. Wouldn't the largest amounts of people be Asian or Hispanic? Shouldn't the movie be call El Soylent Verde? The movie is dated, but 'Soylent Green' has always been a favorite of mine. I love it. Pick up a copy of the film and treat yourself. Definitely worth a purchase! Enjoy! ","genre":null},{"date":"27 March 2013","score":"","review":" It's for the people to wake up and look at all the current issues, we're dealing with today!

","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"27 March 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Walter Hill's 48 Hrs is an excellent,landmark classic that greatly mixes Action and Comedy. Filled with great direction,excellent performances from Nick Nolte,Eddie Murphy and the rest of the cast and a wonderful score,48 Hrs is Hill,Notle and Murphy at their best.Set in San Francisco,California,48 Hrs tells the story of tough cop Jack Cates(Nick Notle)who wants to bust two cops killers escaped convict Albert Ganz(James Remar)and his associate Billy Bear(Sonny Landham). With nowhere to turn,Jack wants help from Reggie Hammond(Eddie Murphy,in his film debut),a smooth talking,wisecracking prisoner who used to run with Ganz and Billy Bear. With Jack getting Reggie out for 48 Hrs,Jack and Reggie must team up and try to get Ganz and Billy,that is if they don't kill each other first.48 Hrs is a great film and is the movie that started it all and also set the standard for Action-Comedies that came later on. This film did for Action-Comedy like 2001A Space Odyseey did for Science Fiction and Halloween did for the Horror\/Slasher genre after all Where would all of the Lethal Weapon films,Beverly Hills Cop films,Rush Hour films and others be without 48 Hrs' influence. One of the reasons 48 Hrs is excellent is because the film is a combination of violent 1970s early 80s Action films with edgy Comedy. Unlike most of the Action\/Comedies that came which were light in comparison,the Action and tone in 48 Hrs is gritty and sometimes dark and very violent which in my opinion separates 48 Hrs from the other Action\/Comedies because the film has a great balance between seriousness and laughter. The film was in between and a transitional period from the gritty Dirty Harry type film of the 70s to the Lethal Weapon\/Beverly Hills Cop type films of the 80s and beyond. The Comedy and humor in the film is great because it's sometimes played straight and to the point with memorable dialog and characters which are aggressive and very profane. What I also love about the Comedy and humor is how politically incorrect it is because where most Comedies now play it safe and hold back,48 Hrs' Comedy is edgy,risky and uncompromising. It's the kind of Comedy that would offend most people and studio heads and that's one of the things I love about the film. The now classic Bar scene is a prime example of politically incorrect Comedy. The two main characters Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond are one of cinemas greatest tag team duos and it is a classic pairing that can be seen as a great precursor to Riggs and Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon series except in this film Jack is a Cop and Reggie is the criminal. Like in any entertaining Buddy Action-Comedy,Jack and Reggie at first really hate each other and the back and forth dialog between the two memorable characters is hilarious and truly unforgettable with Jack being tough and gritty and Reggie using his wisecracks and sarcasm and the banter and back and forth between the two doesn't feel forced or fake but real and natural and you as a viewer are fascinated with Jack and Reggie and their natural back forth dialog is what makes the film and the two main characters classic and memorable. While the two hate and dislike each other in the very beginning,Jack and Reggie start to like each other as the film goes on and the two begin to really start to understand their own motivations and reasons for wanting to catch the bad guys and the two main characters are well developed and likable. Co-Writer and Director Walter Hill is a master at dealing with tough male characters and male bonding and 48 Hrs is no exception. The Action and shootouts in the film are amazing,intense and fast-paced like a lot of Walter Hill's films. The Action in the film also gives the film a great balance between Action and Comedy. The ending of the film is Action-packed as well as funny with the characters Jack and Reggie and is a great conclusion.The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Nick Nolte is excellent as cop Jack Cates,with Nolte bringing toughness,grit and humor to the role. Eddie Murphy(in one of the great film debuts of all time)is brilliant and hilarious as Reggie Hammond,with Murphy bringing great Comedy to the performance and having great chemistry with Nolte. Annette O'Toole is good and beautiful as Elaine,Jack's girlfriend. Frank McRae is wonderful as Haden,Cates' boss. James Remar and Sonny Landham are great and intense as Albert Ganz and Billy Bear. Brion James does a good job as Ben Kehoe,one of Jack's fellow officers. David Patrick Kelly does a great job as Luther,an associate of Reggie and Ganz. Margot Rose(Casey),Denise Crosby(Sally),Kerry Sherman(Rosalie),Olivia Brown(Candy)and Jonathan Banks(Algren)give good performances as well.The direction by Walter Hill is excellent,with Hill bringing an intensity,energy and great atmosphere to the film and Hill also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction,Hill.The Score by James Horner is wonderful and intense and adds to the energy and greatness of the film. Great score. The film also includes the classic song The Boys Are Back in Town by The Bus Boys and Brian O'Neal.In Final Word,if you love Action films,Comedy films,Walter Hill,Nick Nolte,Eddie Murphy or films in general,I highly suggest you see 48 Hrs,a excellent,landmark classic that you can watch again and again.

Filled with great direction,excellent performances from Nick Nolte,Eddie Murphy and the rest of the cast and a wonderful score,48 Hrs is Hill,Notle and Murphy at their best.Set in San Francisco,California,48 Hrs tells the story of tough cop Jack Cates(Nick Notle)who wants to bust two cops killers escaped convict Albert Ganz(James Remar)and his associate Billy Bear(Sonny Landham). With nowhere to turn,Jack wants help from Reggie Hammond(Eddie Murphy,in his film debut),a smooth talking,wisecracking prisoner who used to run with Ganz and Billy Bear. With Jack getting Reggie out for 48 Hrs,Jack and Reggie must team up and try to get Ganz and Billy,that is if they don't kill each other first.48 Hrs is a great film and is the movie that started it all and also set the standard for Action-Comedies that came later on. This film did for Action-Comedy like 2001A Space Odyseey did for Science Fiction and Halloween did for the Horror\/Slasher genre after all Where would all of the Lethal Weapon films,Beverly Hills Cop films,Rush Hour films and others be without 48 Hrs' influence. One of the reasons 48 Hrs is excellent is because the film is a combination of violent 1970s early 80s Action films with edgy Comedy. Unlike most of the Action\/Comedies that came which were light in comparison,the Action and tone in 48 Hrs is gritty and sometimes dark and very violent which in my opinion separates 48 Hrs from the other Action\/Comedies because the film has a great balance between seriousness and laughter. The film was in between and a transitional period from the gritty Dirty Harry type film of the 70s to the Lethal Weapon\/Beverly Hills Cop type films of the 80s and beyond. The Comedy and humor in the film is great because it's sometimes played straight and to the point with memorable dialog and characters which are aggressive and very profane. What I also love about the Comedy and humor is how politically incorrect it is because where most Comedies now play it safe and hold back,48 Hrs' Comedy is edgy,risky and uncompromising. It's the kind of Comedy that would offend most people and studio heads and that's one of the things I love about the film.

That's after all of the summer blockbusters have been released and before the academy award possibilities start cropping up in October\/November. And remember, 1996 was the year that the word blockbuster was defined by unwatchable schlock such as Independence Day and Twister.Jack Keats (Damon Wayons) is an undercover cop posing as a car thief in order to get information from a real car thief, Archie Moses (Adam Sandler). The two have actually developed a kind of friendship during the time they are working together. After gaining his trust, Moses offers to introduce Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton (James Caan). Keats jumps at the chance to home in on bigger criminal game. Thus as Keats is meeting Colton for the first time, the police appear on the scene to make their arrests in the case. In the resulting chaos, Keats is shot in the head. Keats has a slow but sure recovery. On the bright side, he falls in love with the woman who helps him recover. On the negative side, he now has a metal plate in his head. Afterwards, when he is back on duty, Keats is assigned to escort Moses back to testify against his former employer Colton, a situation neither one is looking forward to. Keats is angry because thanks to Moses he has a metal plate in his head, and Moses is angry because Keats lied to him over the entire year that he thought they were friends and colleagues. This movie seems to be going for the buddy\/road film angle, with the exception of the fact that Keats and Moses run into a series of attempts on their lives since Colton, the big drug kingpin, is out to kill them both. This forces them to work together to figure out why their every move seems to be known by Colton before they even make it.Both Wayans and Sandler can be very funny if given the right material, but neither has anything particularly funny to do or say here, since the material they are working with is totally lacking in the imagination and genuine humor that could have exploited the talents of the two leading men.

Jackson) who murdered the two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter. Soon the lawyer comes under attack from the KKK while at the same time he tries to find a way to get his client off. There are certainly flaws to be found in this film but for a mainstream courtroom drama I think it offers enough that makes it highly entertaining. We could debate the political issues in the story for years but I'll freely admit that I agree with what Jackson's character did. I think what makes this film so entertaining is that we're given some very memorable characters and the actors do a terrific job bringing them to life. McConaughey easily became a star thanks to this film and I think he showed a great talent as he really nailed this character and the various emotions that he goes through. Jackson is also very good in his part as the sympathetic father and Sandra Bullock is also terrific in her role as a woman trying to help the case. Donald Sutherland is also very memorable in his supporting role as is his son Kiefer who plays a racist. Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Brenda Flicker Chris Cooper and Ashley Judd are also very good in their roles. The story itself is one that could cause a heated debate but I thought for the most part it was professionally told by director Joel Schumacher. With that said, I think the director creates some rather not-so-good moments including a few silly close-ups and over-dramatic moments that happen with them. Take a look at the evil juror who wants to fry the Jackson character and during one scene he says something bad and we get a cheap thunder sound effect. Another thing that keeps the film from being perfect is how evil everyone is. I mean there's an evil cop, a cheating D.A., a crooked judge and just about everyone else is guilty of something. I think the story was strong enough without having everyone being dirty of something. At a minute short of 150-minutes, the film runs on a bit too long but thankfully the performances and story are strong enough to carry most of it. A TIME TO KILL is certainly far from perfect but it's certainly entertainment at its highest level.

Maybe in 1972 this was cool, but today (2013) it comes off as obnoxious, and it pushes the film over the boundary from environmentalist to hippie, which may be a serious turn-off for many viewers.Beyond that, great film with Bruce Dern being his wacky self.

Damien is thirteen years old and has been adopted by his uncle, Richard Thorn. Soon people start realizing the truth after seeing a 13th Century monk's paintings on a wall that was excavated after a character from the first one and his friend die inside. After people start realizing Damien dispatches them one by one.Now the deaths of the people in this movie could be shocking (but these deaths aren't over the top like the later Final Destination movies) but in terms of horror that is about all it has to offer, whereas the first one used cinematic tension as a way to convey horror to the audience. It might not be much but I'm just saying that so people don't see this without that expectation.So as I said this movie is good for what it is. I will watch the Omen III The Final Conflict.

It's been over 50 years since the film's initial release and more than 20 since I last viewed it on the big screen. When Cinemark announced it as part of the Classic Film Series, I circled the date on my calendar. While most movies are best viewed in a theatre setting, no other film absolutely demands such a setting.There are many elements that contribute to the well deserved classic label David Lean's direction, Freddie Young's photography, the star-studded support cast, the historical significance, Maurice Jarre's iconic score, and of course, Peter O'Toole's standout and unusual performance. This is an action-adventure film with up close battle scenes filmed with no CGI aid. The famous shot of Omar Sharif's Sheriff Ali slowly making his initial appearance on the desert horizon is breathtaking on a 60 foot screen. Watching Lawrence's victory dance on top of the train is majestic in the theatre, and the big screen provides the necessary ominous feeling as the Arabs slowly navigate the blowing sands of the Nefud Desert.T.E. Lawrence was a fascinating man, though there has been much debate about the film and his legend. Lawrence's own writings in Seven Pillars of Wisdom provided many details used by screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, as well as the writings of American photo-journalist Lowell Thomas ... depicted in the film as Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). The real life Thomas was looking for a hero and likely sensationalized his story of Lawrence, but most believe the foundation is fairly accurate.While the story of T.E. Lawrence is incredibly interesting, the story in the film is somehow just part of the experience. Director David Lean's movie is a true experience for movie lovers. This was Mr. Lean's middle film of an incredible streak of three ... The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Doctor Zhivago (1965) being the others. Lean insisted on filming on location, rather than in studio despite the nearly four hour run time. This decision drove the cost up, but allowed for the stunning visuals that set it apart.In addition to O'Toole's performance, it is quite exciting to see the dynamic Omar Sharif, the powerful Anthony Quinn (as Auda abu Tayi), the classy Alec Guiness (as Prince Faisal), the kinda creepy Jose Ferrer, the familiar Jack Hawkins and the slightly slimy Claude Rains. Missing from this list is any actress. The movie features exactly zero speaking roles for women.Maybe the only two actors of the era who could have competed with this fabulous landscape were Peter O'Toole and Marlon Brando. Brando was actually first cast as Lawrence, but soon dropped out to star in Mutiny on the Bounty. O'Toole's blue eyes and white robe created quite the contrast to the sandy desert. Speaking of contrast, the two times he admires his reflection in his knife are visual keys to his evolution from God complex to broken man. After attending the premiere, writer Noel Coward told O'Toole, If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia. The movie received 10 Oscar nominations. It walked away with 7 wins including Best Picture, Director, Cinematogapher, and Score. O'Toole lost out to Gregory Peck (To Kill a Mockingbird). Mr. O'Toole has received 8 Best Actor nominations without ever winning. Watching this film (more than once) is a must for any movie lover. The opportunities to view it in a theatre setting are quite rare, so please seize the chance should it present itself. Your four hour commitment will be rewarded with a movie memory you'll never lose.

Although I personally think it is overrated (I think it's because I wasn't alive in the 80's). I was surprised by it a little bit, especially towards the end.The plot of this movie - 5 stereotypes go to a Saturday detention a jock, a delinquent (who I thought they put a little too much emphasis on him as opposed to the entire group), a geek, a quiet girl that's extremely strange and the popular girl. The teacher supervising them wants them to write a thousand words on who they think they are.

It's not my personal favourite of John Hughes (I think that it's Ferris Beuller's Day Off). As I said earlier I think that they should have been focused more as a group and less on Judd Nelson's character (of which I didn't really like - the same with Molly Ringwald's character). This movie is a decent watch but if you want to hear my opinion it isn't as good as what people are saying.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"27 March 2013","score":"","review":" For the 1960s, this was a courageous ending to a tragic picture. How many viewers were wishing for Ms Remick to return from the street into the arms of Mr. Lemmon with a vow never to drink again. But rather we see an ending where the husband character knows that the only way to save his own life,and in a sense hers, is to watch her walk across the street from his window. Love is not diminished with the ending, it is enhanced. The picture deals with the alcoholic differently that most movies before it. More realistically, the drinker in older movies is shown as a loner outside society drinking for only one reason to get soused. Here we have two codependents in a marriage,drinking because they find it exhilarating, great sport and an escape from the dismal world they both find themselves in. I did think that the giddy swinging of bottles in the air was way overdone and more should have been made of their compatability as drunks by showing more affection for each other during these scenes. However, he scene of Mr Lemmon tearing up the green house was startling, although his alcholic rages were also taken a little too far.

So I selected this for our weekly bad movie night and I have to say we were very disappointed; this movie was very well done. It had an interesting story, its characters were well developed, I understood their motivations and the girls in the film behaved like actual human beings and not just screen candy. I have to say the advertisements were a bit misleading; it made it seem like the whole thing would be a big shopping montage and teenage girls loose on the town, but this turned out to be a reasonably well thought out movie. The abundance of 80s gold in this movie more than makes up for its lack of so-bad-it's-good qualities, so I would recommend it as a movie for bad movie nights and regular movie nights as well. ) ","genre":null},{"date":"27 March 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw the trailer for this and thought it was going to be awful... in a good way.
