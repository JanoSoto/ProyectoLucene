Suddenly one night an armed intruder enters his house and shoots him in front of his wife. Crowe appears to be badly injured but lucid enough to realise that the shooter (a young adult man) used to be his patient years ago when he was a child.The scene terminates and we see again Crowe a few months (or a year) later providing counseling to an 8 year-old boy (Cole Sear) who lives with his mother. The movie is centered on the interaction between the psychologist and the child. Crowe also is shown to speak to his wife throughout the film but she appears oddly aloof, something that suggests marital problems or at least some detachment of the couple.Anyway, Crowe tries to help the troubled kid, and to understand the cause of his problems and heal them. Curiously most of their meetings do not take place at the doctor's office; it is obvious that Crowe makes larger than usual effort to help the youngster and visits him also at home and at school. Soon we start to wonder about the source of the kid's anxiety and fears and how these are related to Willis' character. The movie answers these questions.My rating is 9\/10 for this movie. One among the 2-3 better movies by Night Shyamalan. But not the best. In fact the 'Sixth Sense' reminded me of another Shyamalan movie 'The Unbreakable' which I think is the best movie that Shyamalan ever directed. Bruce Willis has again the central role. The 'Unbreakable' and the 'Sixth Sense' have some things in common. First, the place is the same. Both movies take place in Philadelphia, which is a Greek name (of the old Byzantine city of Asia Minor) and literally means the City of Brotherly Love. I believe that Willis character (in both movies) tries to do just that to help his fellow human being inside the community. Secondly, the theme in both movies has similarities in both movies the central hero is haunted by some event from his past. This event drives his actions and in both movies it is revealed to us at the end.

Ever since I became a fan of classic film its hard for me to find one I don't at the very least appreciate and The Wolfman is no exception. The film actually holds up very well for the most part considering its age and actually is presented like a very fascinating stage play. I think the Hammer horror films are amazing because they made them on such a small budget and use ambiance and mood to capture the imaginations of the audience and what they probably weren't accounting for was the fact that it still works 7 decades later!! The shadowy and foggy landscape, the bold characters with very little depth but a lot of charisma on screen, a simple but fun story and The Wolfman is also downright creepy making it a worthy horror film for any generation!! Now I won't say that its perfect. The acting is very cheesy and yet somehow works for this particular picture. If you stopped and really picked apart the film it wouldn't stand up to scrutiny because it was made so simply but for sheer entertainment, sit back and enjoy, because you most certainly will.This is the first film I have seen starring Lon Chaney. I knew the name and knew this role but had never seen him in action. I actually thought for some reason he was a small homely man and he's anything but. Actually Chaney is tall and handsome and almost has a Cary Grant look to him. He actually is very, very good in this part because you see his boyish ego in the beginning and you also see the fear he feels when he realizes what is happening to him. He takes this part seriously and really nails it. A legend in his own right and not to be outdone, Claude Rains is also very good as Chaney's father. I actually think his character could have been used more but he gets some very good scenes opposite Chaney and gives a very good performance. Evelyn Ankers is perfect for this type of film. It is easy to see why she was an original scream queen for Hammer. She is very, very cheesy. She's lovely to look at and she runs and screams and is incredibly melodramatic and it just seems to work for this particular genre of film. I didn't really care for her in the role but I understand her purpose. Her chemistry with Chaney was decent enough but any woman looking for a strong female lead, won't find it here. Jamie Lee Curtis she ain't when it comes to scream queens. The supporting cast are all decent and play their roles well. Most of the characters are very one dimensional but they are what they are. Bela Lugosi appears briefly in a cameo role, Maria Ouspenskaya is perfect and creepy as the mysterious gypsy woman who randomly appears throughout, Warren William, Ralph Bellamy and Patric Knowles all keep the story rolling.Films like this are easy to review in one sense. It doesn't matter what I can say about a movie like this, good or bad, because its already a classic. Movie lovers have kept this alive and well for decades and sometimes I completely understand why and sometimes I don't. In the case of The Wolf Man I was completely entertained and really enjoyed the story. The special effects actually hold up decently all things considered and the only thing I thought really looked dated and quite terrible was The Wolf Man's make-up itself. Despite it being an iconic character, the make-up is downright terrible and comedic but once again it is all part of the classic experience. If you're a fan of Hammer Horror or you're just starting out with classic films...this is where the horror genre truly began. If you look at it with the right perspective, you will fall in love with The Wolf Man. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 October 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This Halloween I got a special treat because my local theatre showed The Wolfman with The Mummy in a double feature...two classic films I had never seen.

To someone like me, a child of the future where toilet paper sometimes doesn't have rolls in it anymore and plastic bags are illegal in California, the plot seemed sort of cookie-cutter, but now that I've found out that was just because this is the film that made this cookie cutter that other cookie baking bakers have been using to cut their own femme fatale shaped cookies with I've become a staunch admirer of this film and the legacy it left for the people of the future that have developed the technology to use our toilet paper rolls for paper bags to carry our groceries in.I started watching Double Indemnity under the jaded pretext that any 'thrills' it contained wouldn't have the same effect on me that they would've had on a moviegoer from 1944. It's what I've had to do whenever I've watched an older horror film, so I guess I started thinking proper, nail-biting tension was something that hadn't quite been discovered by film yet. After so much apathy you can imagine my joyous surprise when this film ended up being able to hold its own against the better contemporary thrillers I had grown up with. I was completely ecstatic when I realized the film was actually bringing me to the edge of my seat, and the scene where Keyes almost finds Phyllis in Walter's apartment actually made me get out of my chair and pace around the room while I watched. For me, the champion of this movie was Edward G. Robinson as Keyes. Where Walter Neff was bland, monotoned, and same-faced; Barton Keyes was a sharp, quick-witted bloodhound and Robinson gave him all the disarming charisma he needed to set up every major antagonatory force in the film and single-handedly unravel Neff's plot in a way that seemed completely plausible. The film may have had its problems, but Keyes didn't, this guy was gold.Double Indemnity is a movie deserving of multiple viewings. Not because of a complex plot, but because it's a fun movie with pacing so good I feel like it understayed its welcome. At 107 minutes, I wouldn't say it felt rushed, but I definitely wish there was more.

Where did he think of that? He LOVED the show Dexter and thats what Dexter does, cut bodies into pieces. I honestly could see that happening with this movie, someone symbolizing the first hour of this movie, up to when he grows hair. Despite that one piece, this movie is incredible. The way that Edward Norton does this character is truly incredible and he deserved that Oscar more than anyone else that year, well I guess Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan did pretty good too.This movie really shows the impact of the older brother and how much his younge brother is taking after him and how he is the one that can change him to being a better person and lose the racism.

A year later their footage was found. Everyone hated this movie because its not about how shaky the camera was, but how they were extremely disappointed that the movie was not real; they all thought this was for real when they were stuffs about the three missing students, and most of all the Blair Witch that does exist in our world. I understand this movie is not real, but did it need to be? No. It does not need to be real because if it did, then it might as well ended up as a snuff film and that is not good. No one wants to see a movie that happens to be real, where they get lost into the woods and ended up being killed. That is completely stupid! I have never seen a snuff film, and I am not sure if I want to see one. I might as well not want to. I enjoy this movie for what it is! It may look like real footage, but it is not real. With that said, The Blair Witch Project is one of the most effective horror movies ever made, and it is not only one of my favorite horror movies but it is my absolute favorite of the found footage genre. I do enjoy other found footage movies such as Cloverfield; Chronicle; Zero Day; and the Paranormal Activity movies. The majority of the movie works so well to not include any music as it makes it very effective. However, it does appear at the film's end credits where it plays that strange creepy soundtrack that plays with all of this creepy sound as you hear something unusual. Tony Cora did that music piece for the film's credits, I thought he did great job for creating something as what I said previously unusual. The three main actors Heather Donahue; Joshua Leonard; and Michael Williams all do a wonderful job for playing themselves in a fictional way as if they were filmmakers. When I watch this movie, I get a sense of feeling that I was actually with those three and did ending up with them for getting lost into the woods; it almost like virtual reality and you feel like that you are actually there. I give credit for both Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for writing a great story, and directing for what they had envision it; as well as editing it. To those that hate this movie, I suggest that you should give this movie another shot, and maybe understand the movie better for what it is; also, to those that may have not seen the movie, I say check it out because it feels like an experience.

Directed by Barry Sonnenfled, the Addams Family Values is the sequel to the 1991 American dark comedy film, The Addams Family. The success of the first movie was what inspired a trend of film adaptations of TV series throughout The Nineties. So, it was no surprise that a sequel was greenlighted. Based on the characters from the cartoon of the same name created by cartoonist Charles Addams. 'The Addams Family' film series paint their characters as much more macabre than the 1960 TV show sitcom, playing off as light dark humor. Often a nostalgia cult follow brand, the movie saw the return of many of the cast members from the original 1991 film. The movie has the same plot of the first movie. Instead, of a gold digger mother trying to manipulate Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) to get to the family money, we get a gold digger murderous wife, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack) trying to do the same. The movie tends to focus more on Uncle Fester than ever in this film, as characters like Gomez (Raúl Juliá) and Morticia Addams (Anjelica Huston) are given, nothing much to do. Raul Julia really gives some good hammy one-liners to make up for that time. I love how they shot Morticia on the camera. Her lighting always consists of one beam of light across her eyes that gradually fades outward to add to her grim look. She is so beautiful in the film. She is equaling as funny as Raul Julia. I love the oddly place dance number. It made the little amount of scenes between them, so memorable for me. Still, I'm not really complaining, about how much Gomez and Morticia lack screen time. Seeing the serial killer, Debbie try to attempt to kill Uncle Fester are pretty funny and most of their scenes, together are well acted. Joan Cusack is great as Debbie. Not only that, she make an unlikeable character, into a likable character. She also gave the film, some really needed sex appeal. I have a crush on her character when I was a kid. I love the fact, how clueless and lovable, Christopher Lloyd makes Fester to be. It's one of his best roles, besides Doc Brown of the Back to the Future series. As humor goes, the best parts of this film are the Wednesday Addams (Christina Ricci) & Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) going to a pretentious summer camp subplot by Debbie. Christina Ricci is great as Wednesday Addams, and I wouldn't see anybody else in that role. She delivers nothing, but deadpan snark, which only serves to make her all the more hilarious. The whole Thanksgiving play\/raid was such a memorable scene that every time, I re watch this film, I looked forward to seeing this sequence. I have no idea; why a Thanksgiving play is being perform in the middle of the summer, but I love it. I love the conflict between the over the top snobby living in a fantasy world, rich kids, played well to the realist grim Addams kids. The sub-plot is so much better than the main plot in some ways. If anything, the fault of the film could be, the main plot offered nothing new; while the sub-plot should had more focus. Even the sub-plot of Gomez & Morticia looking after newborn Pubert wasn't really needed. The movie is pretty smart for a kid's movie, bringing social satire commentary to a lot of adult themes such as criticize of consumerism, the mistreatment of Native Americans, realism vs idealism and others. This movie doesn't treat kids as babies. There are tons of things in the film that might be view as today as not suitable for children. It really depends on the parent, if this movie is worth your children watching it. There are lot of dark humor, such as trying to kill a baby joke, sexual innuendos, and lots of foul language. There are a lot of things that kids might not get. The movie is also really shot, well. Lots of fantastic scenery and special effects. The theme song is really catchy. Still, the Addams-themed remake of Whoomp! (There It Is) by Tag Team was a bit cheeky. Kinda made me wish for the days of McHammer rap from the first film. Michael Jackson was signed on to write and perform a song for the film's soundtrack and to promote it with a music video. Although he was able to finish the song, contractual difficulties coupled with the child molestation allegations made against Jackson resulted in the song being dropped from the soundtrack, and the video was never filmed. The song, Is It Scary, was later included on Jackson's 1997 'Blood on the Dance Floor HIStory in the Mix' album and was also used in his short film, Ghosts (1997). Overall The movie is not to be taken too serious in a logic sense, it is a tongue-in-cheek comedy that work so well in its own world. It's worth the watch on Halloween or any good day, when a good laugh is needed.

This is what teenagers Kit and Libby say to Steve Marak (John Ireland), whom they've randomly dialed as a prank. Trouble is, they don't know that Marak's just killed his wife, who was about to leave him, and has buried her in a shallow grave. Now he thinks his mysterious caller knows too much - and he's out to find her.This is another post-gimmick horror movie from the legendary William Castle, and like The Night Walker and Strait-Jacket, there are plenty more genuine scares than campy laughs. This is also the kind of movie that couldn't quite be duplicated in this day and age, of course.

Amy is obsessed with Steve - it's unclear whether they'd been having an affair, but Amy's intentions are transparent - to the point where, once she realizes what Steve's done, she attempts to blackmail him into marrying her and having a whopping fun life together.

I'm going to start this review out with a big qualification on my opinion. First, I am obsessed with horror films. I'm that geek that's seen hundreds of them and talks about obscure trivia that no one really cares about in the first place. However, as much as I love horror, I have always found ghost stories to be my least favorite subject in that genre. Even more so, I prefer to ghost stories to have some actual action going one, things flying through the air, etc, and generally don't like movies where the scariest thing occurring is some banging noises. Thirdly, I'm even less a fan of the sort of ghost story where it may have all been in the head of some crazy person and not ghostly phenomena at all.So, having said all of that, this movie is destined to be the kind of movie that I just don't find all that entertaining. Take that for what you will and I'm sure many now think I'm an idiot, but reviews are just our opinions right? So, my opinion is just as valid as anyone else's.Director Robert Wise was a disciple of Val Lewton, who firmly believed in the less is more principle and that a viewer's imagination is far more terrifying than anything shown on screen. His movies often left the action in the shadows and Wise employs this same tactic in his adaptation of Shirley Jackson's famous novel. The directing is the one saving grace, for me, in this movie. It's magnificently filmed and shot. Each angle is perfectly chosen. The use of a wideshot lense that was still in development and not yet ready for use gives many shots a distortion that really adds to the feel. In the story, we're told that the house was built with odd angles and the whole movie carries this feel. Nothing feels quite normal and, as a result, the viewer is left with the same unsettling feel as the characters in the house.The acting is, also, top notch here (for the most part). The two male leads play their roles well. Richard Johnson, in particular, plays different sides of his personality well, from the intellectual looking for an experiment, to the human concerned for Nell's well- being, to the annoyed husband upset at his wife's presence, he plays all these angles well. Claire Bloom is excellent as Theo. Her chiding veneer hiding the sensitive, frightened psychic underneath. Then, there's Julie Harris. I'm not going to knock her acting. She does a fantastic job with the role given to her and plays it well. It's the role itself. Nell is the sort of annoying lead character that you'd rather just slap in the face by the end of the movie. Clearly unhinged from the beginning, the entire movie revolves around her gradual mental decline and her reactions to the events going on. I understand that I'm giving some shallow criticism here, but again, it's my opinion, right? I can't stand her and she's a big reason I don't enjoy this movie.I'm not going to bash this movie a lot. There are a whole lot of people out there that would tell you this is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and I can understand and respect that opinion. There is a lot of great film making here to enjoy. For me, personally, it's just not my cup of tea. I'll tell you another person that felt very much the same -- Richard Matheson. He, too, wanted more action and wanted a movie that clearly showed you supernatural phenomena rather than leaving vague questions over whether anything was real or in someone's head, so he created what, to me, is a superior movie, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE.

Although the movie is good, I have to say that it is rather inaccurate. I want to be fair considering that John Wayne put a lot of effort into it, but he also put a lot of liberties and a lot of his political beliefs into it as well. Basically, as long as you don't acknowledge this movie as completely accurate, then you are okay to go. Inaccuracies aside, the movie is well made with some good performances, among these performances include John Wayne, Richard Widmark, Laurence Harvey, and Richard Boone. The cinematography and the costume designs are great, and not to mention the set designs, as it faithfully replicates what The Alamo actually looked like. So while John Wayne may have stumbled in the accuracy department, he certainly made the right choice in many of the other departments. And not to mention that many of the battle scenes are quite exciting.I'll go ahead an mention a few inaccuracies with this movie. A few minor ones include the following. Case in point, in real life, Jim Bowie never wielded a six barrel volley gun that could take down multiple targets, nor did his wife die during the siege of The Alamo. And while Bowie and Will Travis did not like each other, they both believed that The Alamo should be defended, and they never agreed to a duel. One major inaccuracy occurs near the end of the movie. That is, Col. Fannin and his men were not ambushed and killed during the siege, they were killed several weeks after The Alamo fell. However, the movie did get a few things accurate. For example, in the final battle, Travis really was killed early on, while defending the north wall, and with one shot. Also, Jim Bowie really was killed when Mexican troops charged in on him while he was lying on a cot. So the movie may be mostly inaccurate, but not completely inaccurate.In short, if you don't count the historical inaccuracies, then the movie is good, otherwise, then you'll probably find it to be average or lower than that. I know some people who didn't like this movie because they couldn't separate the facts from the fiction.

You may only watch it once, but if you like Roger Moore's 'lighter' Bond, you may get some enjoyment out of this.

The first two were about a &#x96; seemingly unstoppable &#x96; killer called Michael Myers and his relentless desire to generally murder youngsters. However, Part 3's ultimate 'failure' was that it basically has nothing to do with the first two instalments.Part 3 is a completely new story which doesn't follow on at all. And that was the main 'problem' people had with it. So, it got immediately slated and has kind of fallen off the radar, as far as horror movies go.However, if you don't really look at it as a 'Halloween' movie and simply a stand-alone horror film, it does tend to take on a life of its own.

Therefore, Dr Dan teams up with the man's grieving daughter to investigate. And, their investigation takes them to an out-of-the-way town in the middle of nowhere, run by the &#x96; somewhat creepy &#x96; Conal Cochran.First of all, Dr Dan is a rather different hero. He isn't very reliable, frequently forgets to visit his ex-wife, buys his kids rubbish present, flirts with pretty much anything in a skirt in the hospital where he works and then sleeps with younger women in meets in a bar (all while wearing a handkerchief hanging out of the back of his trousers).

They think that the students there are bunch of losers or untouchables who will have no future besides working in a fast- food. Escalante sets out to prove to the teachers that they are dead wrong and to prove both to his students and himself that they can , they only need to be shown how. It's not that they're stupid, it's just they don't know anything. To demonstrate his abilities he starts to make up a personality for himself, not long after he wins over all the students, each one in a unique way . He truly knows how to connect with each one of them. His ability to transform even the most troublesome student _Pancho_ to a dedicated learner is actually nothing short of a phenomena. Throughout the first year Escalante learns that his students are far more capable than what he thought they might be so he sets out a new goal calculus AP test.Despite all the disbelief and skepticism that his colleagues have he went ahead and designed an intense math program which required all those loser and untouchable students to even take summer classes. In the spring of their senior year, Escalante's students take the AP test and they all pass with flying colors, which caused The Educational Testing Service to question the validity of their results. Escalante believed that this is so because of the social and economic statues of his students so he made the Educational testing service committee agree to retake the test, in the end of the summer with only one day to prepare students retake the test and passed even better than the first time to prove their mathematical abilities to the school, ETS, the nation and more than anything else to themselves. And to show the power of belief. To show what a man can do if someone truly believed in him. His students, despite all odds truly stand and deliver what he always believed in them. For me this movie is the story of a man who is willing to take the extra mile. One man who is willing to go through all the harshness and struggle to try to improve people's life. Story of a math teacher who so selflessly loves his students. these people expand their lives with greater struggles, but also greater rewards.

When confronting pancho he doesn't threat him, he simply uses humor and let his other classmates to laugh at him as the worst punishment in the class . He knows he audience and connects with them one by one, from hugging and STD jokes to threatening to cut fingers of the wannabe gang members.It is obvious that Olmos worked really hard to take into this kind of personality portraying even the slightest personal traits. he truly delivers a perfect play.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"31 October 2014","score":"","review":" In an era of blood and gore horror films (which are just fine in their place; in fact some of them are my favorite movies), director Peter Medak and star George C Scott gave us the best, most intense low-key haunted house movie since Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963). This film gave me goosebumps that lasted for days when I first saw it in the theatre and it still has that effect on me when I put the tape in my VHS thirty-four years later.As with all really great haunted house films, it is the house that is the star. George C Scott, the human star power of the film, appears here with his wife Trish Van Devere, and delivers a subtle, low-key performance in which a raised eyebrow is as eloquent as Hamlet's soliloquies.Scott plays John Russell, a composer and professor of music. The film begins with a tragedy Russell and his wife Joanna (Jean Marsh) and young daughter Kathy (Michelle Martin) are pushing their disabled station wagon to the side of a snowy road; they are on vacation, presumably headed for the ski slopes. Russell goes across the road to a telephone booth to call for help, and a truck comes along, slipping and sliding on the icy road, and smashes into the Russells' car, killing Joanna and Kathy as John looks on in helpless horror.Scene shift Seattle. John has taken a professorship at the University of Seattle in the hope that the change of scene will shake his depression. With the help of a Claire Norman (Van Devere), a lovely woman from the Historical Society, he finds a handsome old mansion to rent, completely furnished and with a functioning music room, an amenity which attracts the music professor. He moves in.But all is not peaceful in the somewhat gloomy but otherwise handsome old house. The ghostly shenanigans start with nothing but a series of loud bangs that awaken Russell early in the morning. He goes in search of a source but finds nothing.The tension builds from there in a simply brilliant and measured fashion. A woman at the Historical Society warns him that the house does not want people. The events keep escalating until we are deep in a really scary and mystifying story. There is a seance, a voice that appears on a recording even though it was not heard when the recording was made, John and Claire go digging into the house's history, and there is even a real excavation in a child's bedroom, of all places.Add to all this a political connection there is a link between the goings on in the house and the Senator from Washington, Joseph Carmichael (Melvyn Douglas in possibly his last great role). The tension builds until it is almost unbearable, and I won't give away the ending except to say it has a certain feeling of inevitability.George C Scott's performance in this film has been much talked- about; Roger Ebert felt he was too reserved, and that his lack of emoting detracted from the impact of the story. I do not agree. Scott (no doubt with Medak's approval) made the choice to play the educated man as the skeptic, drawing him slowly and unwillingly (also disbelievingly) into the truth of what is happening, and why.I do enjoy a good old fashioned gore-fest, but there is something special about the horror movie that terrifies the viewer without resorting to blood and guts. Sometimes a whispered suggestion is more powerful than a scream. And the passage of thirty-four years has done nothing to diminish the impact of this fascinating and frightening film.

With the help of a Claire Norman (Van Devere), a lovely woman from the Historical Society, he finds a handsome old mansion to rent, completely furnished and with a functioning music room, an amenity which attracts the music professor. He moves in.But all is not peaceful in the somewhat gloomy but otherwise handsome old house. The ghostly shenanigans start with nothing but a series of loud bangs that awaken Russell early in the morning. He goes in search of a source but finds nothing.The tension builds from there in a simply brilliant and measured fashion. A woman at the Historical Society warns him that the house does not want people. The events keep escalating until we are deep in a really scary and mystifying story. There is a seance, a voice that appears on a recording even though it was not heard when the recording was made, John and Claire go digging into the house's history, and there is even a real excavation in a child's bedroom, of all places.Add to all this a political connection there is a link between the goings on in the house and the Senator from Washington, Joseph Carmichael (Melvyn Douglas in possibly his last great role). The tension builds until it is almost unbearable, and I won't give away the ending except to say it has a certain feeling of inevitability.George C Scott's performance in this film has been much talked- about; Roger Ebert felt he was too reserved, and that his lack of emoting detracted from the impact of the story. I do not agree. Scott (no doubt with Medak's approval) made the choice to play the educated man as the skeptic, drawing him slowly and unwillingly (also disbelievingly) into the truth of what is happening, and why.I do enjoy a good old fashioned gore-fest, but there is something special about the horror movie that terrifies the viewer without resorting to blood and guts. Sometimes a whispered suggestion is more powerful than a scream. And the passage of thirty-four years has done nothing to diminish the impact of this fascinating and frightening film.

I grew up watching Star Trek The Next Generation so I know and love the characters. And the Borg were always my favourite bad guys. So how could I possibly not love this movie?OK I do accept that it's basically nothing more than an extended TV episode with some extra money thrown at the special effects (i.e., the Borg queen 'floating torso' scene), but hey I'm not complaining!I thought this movie worked perfectly - capturing all the best elements of the TV show. There is plenty of action, from a massive star-fleet firefight to one on one combat and even a space-walk battle on the outside of the ship. There are great Sci- Fi themes\/conundrums - time travel, android with feelings, etc. And lots and lots of unnerving moments with the Borg.A firm favourite.
