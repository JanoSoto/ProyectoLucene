I always see all or almost all of the nominated films every year before the Oscars, so I decided to give it a chance and hoped it would be good.Guess what? It's about a young woman who is slowly going insane. She's hallucinating, dreaming up a lot of self-inflicted gore and violence. She's very paranoid, anxiety-ridden, fearful, but she's brilliant....Of course, Natalie Portman IS actually brilliant. Her performance was incredible, as were many of the actors' performances in Black Swan; but sadly, the story and script are TERRIBLY SIMILAR to Pi. I wouldn't see Pi again on a bet.

Critics savaged it, horror fans were mad, everyone else was confused as to what kind of movie they had seen, and the movie tanked in the box office. So, did director Philippe Mora own up to the movie being a disaster? Of course he didn't.Like many directors whose movie was poorly received, Mora said it wasn't his fault. Nope, it was the studio and the producer's faults, as they compromised his vision. Well what luck for him-the studio wanted nothing to do with the series after Howling II, so Mora could now make a second sequel, and this time, he could do it in his vision. He could show those studio execs what's what, and he could show the world that the failure of the previous movie wasn't his fault.It didn't work out that way.Oh sure, like Howling II, it was a bigger hit on video than it was in theaters, and it's gained a cult following, but also like that movie, it was poorly received by horror fans, critics and the general audience alike, and did poor box-office, only this time it killed any chances of another Howling sequel getting a theatrical release. So, is it bad like everyone says it is? In a word yes.Having nothing to do with the prior movies, Howling III revolves around a strange Australian race of werewolves that are part man, part wolf and part marsupial. You can't say there isn't any originality in this movie. Anyways, Jerboa (Imogen Annesley) is trying to escape her tribe after her stepfather attempts to rape her. Traveling to the city, she meets Donny (Leigh Biolos), whose the assistant director for a horror movies called Shape Shifters 8. Donny offers her a role, and they soon fall in love. However, it soon becomes apparent that something other than her lycanthropic tendencies is acting up, and to make matters worse, Professors Beckmeyer (Barry Otto) and Sharp (Ralph Cotterill) are after them. Then there's that Russian Ballerina Olga (Dagmar Bláhová).Like Howling II, much of the humor here falls flat-the only times I laughed are when Olga kills her ballet partner and the poster for Mora's The Beast Within hanging on Donny's wall. In fact, the humor here is even worse than the prior effort's. Say what you will, but at least Howling II tried to come off as a horror movie. Here, Mora goes for a full on satire of horror movies, but none of his jabs at the genre (such as a fat, Alfred Hitchcock looking director played by Frank Thring, and a few parody movies and a tribute\/spoof of the original's conclusion) hit the mark. As it's been said a billion times, balancing horror and comedy is a tricky thing, and there's nothing wrong with opting more for laughs. However, when most of the jokes are bad, why should you care? When Dame Edna and a town called Flow (ha ha) are all you got, and even werewolves disguised as nuns can't be interesting, your movie has problems.It also doesn't help that only Annesley stands out as far as acting is concerned. Everyone else here ranges from mediocre (Biolos makes for a bland love interest) to terrible (Thring is really annoying and all around bad as main director Jack Citron), and they don't really do anything to warrant a reason to care about them. To make things worse, Mora's direction is even worse this time. Watching this, it was hard to believe that this came from the same director of Mad Dog Morgan and Communion, as he shows none of the skill those movies offered.Needless to say, the four sequels that followed it went straight to video, and it somehow manages to be slightly worse than Howling II. At least that movie had moments of inspiration. This movie will mostly just inspire fits of boredom.

The red flag that they hoist is only the most obvious so I believe I'll just skip that one. All right now communism has a few basic tenants that are shown in this movie. One of which is that the whole is more important than the individual. Now this is shown throughout the movie as rarely is a character named, in fact only a few characters in the entire movie are given names.

(Man, that was BAD.) But the kids acting is VERY weak at points. He seems to act like he is in a made for TV Disney film. One person that seems to be under appreciated in this film is the villain. He does a spot on job making you feel like something is off, and he only has a view lines.==Characters==The characters are, surprisingly, very good. The kid is a complete ass and idiot Noob who doesn't know what in the hell he is doing.

The villain is amazingly powerful and creepy.==The story== First off; James, James, James. It seems like you really bring down this movie with your horrible script writing. Can you PLEASE hire somebody to write your scripts for you? You are BAD at it. BAD. Now, luckily, this movie still delivers on a OK plot and good action, but there is a VERY badly made moral to the movie about how Arnold learns the Value of human life, Guess what. HE DOESN'T. All that happens is the stupid Noob kid commands that he doesn't kill anyone because the kid is a huge pussy. And guess what. He doesn't learn the Value of human life All that happens is KILL=TRUE MAIM=FALSE turns into KILL=FALSE MAIM=TRUE. So Arnold just maims everyone instead of killing them. How nice, yeah. Real value of human life there. It's just standard James Cameron SO DEEP BS that bogs down every one of his films. This is the BIGGEST problem with the movie.(Note Luckily, because of the fact there is no idiotic romance in this movie, it makes it FAR better then the first. The romance in the first had no chemistry and seemed VERY forced.) The second worst thing about the story is the fact that they have the mother narrate parts after the first half of the movie. Why? We would much rather watch Arnold beat the crap out of the bad guy then hear some idiot whining. THANK YOU. ==Final score== The fact that this movie has no bad romance, amazing action, and AMAZING special effects and stunts gives it a 10. The fact that the kids acting is VERY lackluster, the movie has a REALLY bad moral loosely attached to it, and has a very boring slow part in the middle lowers it a solid 2 points down. 8\/10.

The film is thrilling, entertaining and darkly amusing from the beginning to the ending. Indeed, Pulp Fiction is just one of these films where things reach such a level of whatever makes movies worth being admired; on the top of that  writing. This is what makes Pulp Fiction rhymes with perfection and what most defines the Tarantinesque style.Chapter 1. The Cannolis of the Nineties.Writing is the special ingredient. When characters talk in a Tarantino film, the subtlety is that it makes you think it has nothing to do with the plot, that it's totally irrelevant, when in fact it is totally irrelevant and random yet it serves the plot. One golden rule in screen writing is that what you put must be related to the story  Tarantino throws away this rule and still respects it. The discussion about the little differences and how they call hamburgers is mentioned again when Jules asks Brett about it and till now, Vega's Royale with Cheese still resonates as the Canolli's quote of the 90's. The foot massage discussion finds another relevancy as it helps to characterize Marcellus's sensitivity and electrify the whole interaction between Jules and Mia. The Gold watch story, makes Butch' burst of anger totally understandable when Fabienne admits she forgot it. There were 1000 ways to make us learn about the Gold watch story, Tarantino takes a legendary actor telling us with such conviction we don't know if we're supposed to laugh or take it seriously. Deeper than that, notice how the Divine Intervention that saves Jules and Vincent's asses, inspired different reactions and the one who decides not to retire will ultimately be killed. God seems to play with fate like Tarantino with plot devices. Notice how Jules' decision will save Ringo and Pumpkin and lead to an Ezekiel's bloodless recitation. And of course, the reappearance of the two robbers at the end of the film is another tribute to Quentin's creative trademark non-linear narrative structure. Sure Quentin didn't invent that, but he transcended it, making it an element of entertainment and total unpredictability. We'll go back to unpredictability later.Chapter 2. From Misirlou to Surf Rider Music is one of the key qualities of Quentin Tarantino films. It's like a second casting, Quentin casts his music like he does for his female characters. What would have been this film without the dazzling Misirlou start, without Girl, You'll be a Woman, and the iconic You Never Can Tell featuring one of the weirdest but most memorable and reenacted cinematic dance sequences. Quentin doesn't embarrass himself by choosing a composer or a grandiloquent score, no, he drains his inspiration from Pop Culture, from existing songs that would have probably sunk into oblivion if there weren't touched by Tarantino's selective instinct. The music is like a second language in his film, and it sure mixes perfectly well, with the dialogs. Whenever I hear the shrill voice of Honey Bunny shouting &#x85; last one of ya I immediately imagine Misirlou starting, like the emblematic hymn of the 90's. But music ain't the only one element ejecting the movie from the land of normality &#x85; Chapter 3.

Who else could have made Samuel L. Jackson look so bad-ass with this ridiculous wig? Who else could have convinced Ving Rhames to re-enacts Ned Beatty's deliverance? Oh, I should get to the point, who else can make so close to perfection female castings, covering all tastes of women we can imagine  from the hypnotic Uma Thurman, to the hysterical Yolanda, to the punky pierced Jody, from the sweet and tender Fabienne to the sensuous lips of Esmarelda Villalobos, they're all defining a specific feminine charm. And thanks, Mr. Tarantino to make us finally assume out little fetishism &#x85; Chapter 4. Black Humor and White TowelsUnpredictability relies on what I would call the little differences that makes Pulp Fiction a classic film. It has this thing in common with other masterpieces like The Godfather or Citizen Kane, where every single scene is a classic, from A to Zed. The meaning of the title, the robbery preceding the opening credits, the mysterious glowing stuff inside the briefcase, the foot massage discussion, the square visual effect, the dance contest, Mia's feet walking on the floor, the adrenaline shot, the Coolidge vs. Hoover fight, Esmarelda's feet stepping on the accelerator, Fabienne's oral wish, Fabienne's f&#x85; sweet accent, Vincent's death, Marcellus crossing the road with his box of donuts, Zed and Maynard, the Gimp, Marcellus's medieval speech, Zed's demise, Marvin &#x85; now that was unpredictable, who could see that coming?

Quentin doesn't embarrass himself by choosing a composer or a grandiloquent score, no, he drains his inspiration from Pop Culture, from existing songs that would have probably sunk into oblivion if there weren't touched by Tarantino's selective instinct. The music is like a second language in his film, and it sure mixes perfectly well, with the dialogs. Whenever I hear the shrill voice of Honey Bunny shouting &#x85; last one of ya I immediately imagine Misirlou starting, like the emblematic hymn of the 90's. But music ain't the only one element ejecting the movie from the land of normality &#x85; Chapter 3. Perfection  from Head to Foot.Tarantino is the goddamn casting fairy of them actors &#x85; no seriously, he has like a magic power, who else could have made Travolta resuscitating after his Look Who's Talking career? Who else could have made Samuel L. Jackson look so bad-ass with this ridiculous wig? Who else could have convinced Ving Rhames to re-enacts Ned Beatty's deliverance? Oh, I should get to the point, who else can make so close to perfection female castings, covering all tastes of women we can imagine  from the hypnotic Uma Thurman, to the hysterical Yolanda, to the punky pierced Jody, from the sweet and tender Fabienne to the sensuous lips of Esmarelda Villalobos, they're all defining a specific feminine charm. And thanks, Mr. Tarantino to make us finally assume out little fetishism &#x85; Chapter 4. Black Humor and White TowelsUnpredictability relies on what I would call the little differences that makes Pulp Fiction a classic film. It has this thing in common with other masterpieces like The Godfather or Citizen Kane, where every single scene is a classic, from A to Zed. The meaning of the title, the robbery preceding the opening credits, the mysterious glowing stuff inside the briefcase, the foot massage discussion, the square visual effect, the dance contest, Mia's feet walking on the floor, the adrenaline shot, the Coolidge vs. Hoover fight, Esmarelda's feet stepping on the accelerator, Fabienne's oral wish, Fabienne's f&#x85; sweet accent, Vincent's death, Marcellus crossing the road with his box of donuts, Zed and Maynard, the Gimp, Marcellus's medieval speech, Zed's demise, Marvin &#x85; now that was unpredictable, who could see that coming? Should we laugh? Yes, 'cause it's funny as hell. It was an accident, as if it was supposed to be an excuse. The whole movie and what follows is the ultimate proof that this film is a masterpiece of comedy; the whole Bonnie situation creates so many gags, including the memorable appearance of Winston Wolf. This part sacred Pulp Fiction as a great film; and the last minutes made it a classic.End of story. When Jules and Vincent leave the restaurant, with the Surf Rider song starting, you know your eyes have been watching something new and fresh, something that will change the face of movies for a bunch of years to come. Just for Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino deserves to be admitted in the directors writers' hall of fame.

Of course it has star power like Stallone(best performance since 1981's Nighthawks), DeNiro, Keitel(plays a great bad guy), and a great performance from Ray Liotta, whom I rarely seen since, but I digress; I also enjoyed Robert Patrick's performance as a dirty cop and his scenes were mainly entertaining. Cathy Moriarty, Jeanine Garofalo, Peter Berg, and Michael Rapaport round out a very solid and professional cast and most of them have important scenes. I won't explain the plot, as you'll probably know it by now, but let me add that I was hardly bored throughout the movie, and the atmosphere of a tiny city against the backdrop of a big one worked for me, as the setting was almost flawless; throw in a few Springsteen tunes from the River(1980)for added measure and we have a very good film that's often forgotten. Perhaps the cowboy ending was a bit unrealistic(as was Freddy telling Ray when he's taking Murray to the authorities at 6am), but overall this film's a winner.

The big difference is that Cuckoo's Nest is hilarious, and a comedy in the truest sense It's also a tragedy. There's a quietly unmitigated close-up of Nicholson a little more than halfway through. We become aware of it because it hangs on warily. It shows R.P. McMurphy pensive. It comes at the match point flanked by the mirth and mischief of the previous portion of the film, and the closing deterioration into misfortune. What is he feeling? Is he plotting more insubordination? Grasp that all is hopeless? The vagueness of what McMurphy is thinking is the film's driving ambiguity. It all leads up to a late scene where he's found asleep on the floor next to an open window. Has his soul finally expired? Subdued for the post-classical '70s into a fable about society's imposition of conformism, it almost knowingly disregards the truths of mental illness so as to turn the patients into a set of snuggly characters ready for McMurphy's egging on. We learn that one is not actually mute, one doesn't have to stammer, and others need not be debilitated by introversion or dread. They'll be healed not by Nurse Ratched's medication, Muzak and counseling sessions, but by McMurphy invigorating them to be guys, to watch the World Series, go fishing, play basketball, get smashed, get laid. The memo for these miserable patients is Be like him.The movie's naive attitude toward psychosis is not actually a weakness of the movie, as it has no concern with being about that. It's about a freethinker in a lockstep system. Nurse Ratched, who is so uncompromising, so insipidly certain she's right, characterizes the American cult of motherhood at its militant maximum, and McMurphy is the local color who wants to escape from her form of society. The movie is among other things deeply afraid of women. The only two depicted optimistically are McMurphy's hooker acquaintances Candy and Rose. I mean this as an comment, not a censure.McMurphy's backstory is inferred early on. He was sentenced to a prison farm for doing the deed with an underage girl, and has been sent to the mental institution for evaluation. He's observably a rabble-rouser, and yet acutely egalitarian He takes the patients head-on, treats their disorders as choices that can be reordered, and attempts by pure power of determination to break them free into a nibble of independence. The movie views them that way, too. The cinematography and editing provide reaction shots that nearly always have the same implication A given patient's rigid expression is misconstrued thanks to the new perspective given by McMurphy. For instance, McMurphy has stolen the boat and has the group aboard. When he's interrogated, he introduces them all as doctors, and there are quick cuts to close-ups of each one looking vaguely formal like clockwork. This has nothing to do with mental illness but everything to do with slapstick.Nicholson's performance is one of the acmes in a lengthy career of enviable anarchists. Jack is a much-loved American presence. And if his performance is rightly praised, Louise Fletcher's, notwithstanding the Oscar, is not valued enough. This may be since her Nurse Ratched is so meticulously loathsome, and since she exemplifies so utterly the traits we all have been trained to fear in a particular variety of female authority, a woman who has fused sexuality and sympathy into responsibility and rectitude. Dressed in her distantly militaristic nurse's uniform, she is at once bondage mistress and dungeon master, followed everywhere by the petite, non-speaking nurse who is her altar assistant.Since we react so ardently to her we barely see Fletcher's performance. Her uncanny composure, her pokerfaced fairness, her obstinate observance of policy, as in the scene where she orders McMurphy to get a majority vote in order to watch the World Series on TV, regardless that a majority of the patients don't comprehend what they're voting on. Later, when McMurphy's ultimate fortune is settled on, note how the male overseer hesitantly proposes he be returned to the prison farm, though Ratched resolutely gainsays him.This great human comedy stays everlastingly well-liked as a subversive fable, but realizes its triumph by thoughtfully electing to utilize the mental patients as droll exaggerations. This initiates the fishing excursion, which is simultaneously the most enjoyed, and the most deceptive, scene in the movie. It's McMurphy's noble-cheerful flip of the bird at Ratched and her breed, but the oomph of the sequence can't camouflage the anxiety and bewilderment of men who, in several instances, don't know where they are, or why. Bear in mind by contrast the understated, late-night monologue by the Chief, who talks about his father. This is a window into a genuine character with genuine and fascinating issues, and leads up to the bittersweet release of the very final scenes.

The movie has almost the approach of a thriller and gets quite fast interesting in comparison to the rather slow paced approaches of most of David Lynch's movies. This movie isn't as intense, surreal and surprising as many of his other works are, but it is filled with tension and dominated by a strong acting by Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan and especially the legendary Dennis Hopper. The charismatic acting of those three cornerstones of the movie makes this flick work and makes me pardon the fact that the movie is not as imaginary as one should expect from such a great director. Some secondary actors like Laura Dern or Jack Nance also do a great job as usual.To sum it all up, this is a rather weak movie considering the other works of David Lynch and a little bit too general and mainstream orientated but it is nevertheless an entertaining psycho thriller with some stunning acting.

Yes, the characters talk a lot and there is some sex, but compared to most films, everything is rather humdrum ...(I believe that a rival director described the film as being about a man ... masturbating.) But if you look more closely, all sorts of things are happening. Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) is an atypical 1980s heroine she knows what she wants (financial independence, sex, her artwork, her plants) and she goes for what she wants. And gets it. She even ends up on reasonably good terms with the sister with whom she has clearly had problems dating back to their childhood.Ann (Andie MacDowell) is an unassertive character who ends up taking back some of the control over her life which she handed over to her husband John (Peter Gallagher - good in a rather thankless role).And writer-director Steven Soderbergh has such an unusual twist on themes.

It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special.

I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does.That is such a tiny point.

You hear the words sex, lies and videotape and think that a lot of films contain those three ingredients. True, but how many also contain blackmail? Almost all of them. It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special. Plus, what do you think when you hear a film is about a man who is impotent (unless alone) and has no job? Were you thinking it was a grim British film, probably set up North somewhere? I would have been.Although the film is well-written and well-edited, there are still some small mysteries for fans to pore over. Where does Graham get his money from? Do he and Ann have full sex on the occasion when she decides to seduce him? I rather like the hints that Graham may have experimented with his sexuality (reference to being impotent in the presence of another person, rather than specifying a woman; saying he preferred taping women to taping men).There are lots of little mysteries about the accessories Cynthia and Graham each own a dart board. Does this mean anything? Is so, what? (Spader's then-wife was one of the people who decorated the set.) Really, my only quibble is that we never find out what Ann does in the job she ends up with. Does she, perhaps, recycle the garbage that allegedly concerned her when she was a rather desperate housewife? I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does.That is such a tiny point. Spader and San Giacomo are both, in my opinion, very sexy in this film, and that would be reason enough to watch it over and over again.

They were hippies who thought their voice could change the world, but now all of them are either rich or settled into a sort of comfortable suburbia. Kevin Kline and Glenn Close are a married couple who invite their buddies to stay the weekend after the funeral. They are about to sell their chain of stores to a corporation, becoming quite wealthy in the process. Tom Berenger is a television action star. William Hurt is a dope-head who suffered an unfortunate injury in Nam and is similar in ways to the friend who committed suicide. Mary Kay Place is a lawyer who has had little success in her sex life and simply wants a child. Jeff Goldblum is a writer for People Magazine. JoBeth Williams is an unhappy suburban housewife still in love with Berenger. Meg Tilly was the younger girlfriend of the suicide victim who remains in the house they were starting to renovate. These characters will spend time together, reminiscing, dwelling on the past, enjoying each other's company, while at the same time discussing adamantly the mistakes and disappointments which have occurred in their lives. Not exactly a real plot to speak of, more or less THE BIG CHILL works off it's awesome cast of incredible 80s talents assembled, the tone often a mixture of laughs and melancholy. It is sad that it took one of their own killing himself in order to bring these people back together, and the film follows them as they come to terms with the loss and their own futures. Developments include the revelation that Close had an affair with the suicide victim, Berenger and Williams' growing closer as the weekend continues, Kline given permission by Close to assist Place in her desire to be a mother, Hurt's interesting relationship with Tilly, etc. The soundtrack is incredible and speaks for the cast's generation, along with a screenplay that has a great deal to say. While I do prefer THE RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN, written by John Sayles, THE BIG CHILL is a movie I find irresistible because the cast appeals to me, and there's a watchability to it, in that I can return to it and never tire of it. I do believe some might consider this movie a bit ponderous and too relaxed, but I think that's part of why it continues to endure. The use of a camcorder derives some funny moments such as Hurt's chat with himself(along with Goldblum's antics, cerebral discussions with both Close and Berenger)and Tilly's airheaded nature(her sexiness is used to effect as well)is utilized to the hilt. The courtship of Berenger and Williams, and Close's deep, close friendship with Place, are given a great deal of screen time. I personally think Hurt steals the film, but the entire cast(also in abundance are the Goldblumisms)shine, each member given an opportunity to strut their stuff. There are times when conversations get a bit heated, particularly when the suicide victim is brought up, but we see how long-term friendship is lasting even during times of hurt and grieving.

They have two wings and they're not bent backwards. You'll laugh. But, on the plus side, they don't serve peanut snacks, so your Mom doesn't have to worry about allergies.) Rogers and Arlen have grown up together and are best friends, though they happen to be in love with the same girl, Clara Bow. Arlen thinks she loves him, but she really loves Rogers, but Bow and Rogers keep it a secret from Arlen because they don't want to hurt his feelings or something and meanwhile -- the viewer pendiculates.The movie gets off the ground when the two buddies get to jab their elbows in each others' ribs while going through flight training. There's something a little odd about that friendship, by the way. I see no reason to get into it too deeply but when one dies in the other's arms and they're confessing their mutual adoration I thought they were going to have one last great big French kiss. There IS a kiss but it's on the cheek, an expression of comradeship, and after all this is France. Of course, the director, William Wellman, might be willing to tackle such an unusual homoerotic theme but it would never be allowed on the screen. A highly stereotypical ethnic -- Herman Schrimpf -- yes, but not the love that dare not speak its name.I don't want to give the ending away. That's not usually the case but here the resolution of the plot is both important and ironic. What isn't surprising is the climax of the love affair. The minute that I saw these two rivals for the girl's hand march off to war, I wondered which of them would be the survivor.It is, as I say, a pretty good movie. The affair with Bow is handled tactfully and doesn't take up an inordinate amount of time. It's a long movie, though, and one scene could have been condensed or even eliminated without too much trouble. I refer to the longish scene in the café in Paris where Rogers gets loaded and carries on about the champagne bubbles he's hallucinating. It seems like an excuse for an exercise in contemporary photographic legerdemain -- all those bubbles coming out of nowhere and floating towards the ceiling.Willaim Wellman was quite a character, full of thumos, as the Greeks would have called it. A spirited youngster from an aristocratic Boston background he wound up flying in combat in the Lafayette Squadron in France, winning the Croix de Guerre, so he knows whereof he directs. And the air combat scenes are very good indeed. And some aerial shots give us panoramic displays of the battlefield itself, full of zig-zagging trenches, craters, and lines of barbed wire. I don't know how much money the movie cost but it must have been more than my own salary. Or yours. The acting is unexceptional, hemmed in as it is by the strictures of silent film making. At one point, I'm reasonably certain, an angry Rogers looks into the camera and clearly says, Bastards! Wellman would easily have been capable of that.He was always more of a craftsman than an artist but he tackled some startling subjects, as in Wild Boys Of The Road, and sometimes produced some truly sensitive and underplayed work, as in, The Story of G.

The opening credits indiscreetly recall The Twilight Zone. One teary mother echoes The Stepford Wives. The worry of sleep, which was in the original film, has since been declared by the Elm Street series. Ferrara and his capable writers fellow exploitation veteran Larry Cohen and uniquely Bohemian horror director Stuart Gordon must've understood this, but there's no lighthearted drollness about these loans.

And yet the best biopics do justice to an individual's life by offering a slice of their existence, giving an impression of who they were and what they did. Bound for Glory covers only a few years in Woody Guthrie's life, and yet the portion it covers is a transitional one, showing his change from a friendly, easygoing country boy, to a man more cynical but firmly politicised, with his emotions shaken but his core honesty intact, and his career on the verge of national fame.A good biopic is often as much about tone as story, and this requires a good director. Consummate 70s filmmaker Hal Ashby is perfect for the project. His style is just so wonderfully light and tentative. He won't force an idea upon you, but he'll give you time to notice some little snippet of life which adds texture to a scene, for example a split-second shot that reveals one of the hobos being pulled off the train has only one arm. There's a lot of darkness in this movie, a lot of enclosed spaces and shuttered windows. The countryside appears achingly beautiful, but it is only fleetingly glimpsed, over the top of a railway carriage or through a gap in the swirling dust, like some unattainable paradise. The sublime cinematography of Haskell Wexler picks out every mote of dust and finds shape and definition in the swathes of black and brown.Let's give a word a two now to lead man David Carradine. Carradine has long been one of my favourite actors, even before he was in Kill Bill and everyone had heard of him. He worked mostly in TV and B-Westerns before landing this, his greatest and most apt role, the one he seems born to play. He has no ego. He doesn't play to the camera, and yet he has such presence here, such charisma. He thereby gives a good account of the real Woody, as well as giving us the impression of a life being lived rather than a performance being played. And of course being a proper folk musician he can do the songs justice.And the songs are crucial to this adaptation. Bound for Glory works much like a semi-musical King Vidor movie from nearly fifty years earlier by the name of Hallelujah. All the music is diagetic &#x96; it makes sense within the scene, and yet it is used to comment upon the narrative and move it forward, just as a true musical does. When Woody decides to leave his dustbowl home, he never actually states his intention to do so in dialogue, but we hear him singing a lose version of So Long, It's Been Good to Know You with its appropriate line about dusty old dust, which is then picked up in instrumental form as he heads out of town. Later, the scene of Woody playing I Ain't Got no Home in the radio studio segues into a shot of workers in a field as the tune continues, linking the man and his music to their social context. The songs are never merely presented while the story takes a break, the songs exist alongside and become part of story. Bound for Glory does not just show the life of a musician, it shows a musical life.

You may adore this movie or hate it because there is not much left in the middle but the sure thing is that you will never forget this film once you have seen it.The crazy, diversified and simply unforgettable characters where each one seems to be at a near equal level even though everyone seems to have a personal favourite (mine is probably Columbia), the catchy songs where one hit hits literally the next, the very creative and surprising scenario which honours many clichés of the horror and science-fiction genre and the different actions that have to be done during certain scenes of the movie have all contributed to the fact that this movie has become a masterpiece that has still a big group of fans and followers nowadays and has been presented as a musical in many countries. I have seen the musical as it came into my hometown when I was ten years old and I will never forget it. This is the perfect movie to get together with friends and have a good time, to sing, drink and laugh along no matter to which generation you belong as this movie seems to connect them all.To keep it short, anyone who likes the cinema and music in general should have seen this movie at least once in his lifetime as it would take too much place and would effectively never really work to describe this flick about transvestites in a few words because there is such a high amount of sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, love, passion, horror, drama and slapstick in this masterpiece.

The whole concept is the patriarch of this mobster family seeing the end of a profit for innocent leisure activities such as gambling and running molasses when new mobsters want in on the narcotics business which is just dirty business since it involves addiction and not just plain drinking and gambling. The viewer sees how the old ideals of the 1920s which are embodied with the Don conflict with the new ideals of the 1950s which is the business of narcotics. It is an epic of the Don's youngest son, Michael, how he refuses the idea of being a part of the family and how his love for his father forces him to be more ruthless and calm than his father and his brother, since he takes action right away by killing Solozzo and the police captain for being corrupt and to top it off kills off the heads of the five families just to solidify the Corleone family power. This is the essential mobster movie since solidifies the idea of an organized crime effort with the Boss, the Underbosses who are next in line, the Capo Regime and the soldiers modeled after the Roman Empire as mentioned in Part II by Tom Hagen. While the sequel is arguably one of the best sequels of all time, the original excels in showcasing how this mobster empire conflicted with new ideals but came up on top with nothing but ruthlessness and calm precision by Michael.
