First of all, the special effects were good.  Not great by any standard but still good.  The dinosaurs LOOKED good but their movements were a bit stiff.  Secondly, the acting was good and the characters were well developed and likeable.  Next, there was some genuine suspense in this movie.  Granted, you can kind of tell who is going to survive from the begining, but the action moves at such a great pace that you soon forget that it is obvious who will live.  Just in case you don't forget, there is a nice plot twist towards the end involving the (spoiler ahead! spoiler ahead!) fate of the female lead that will keep you on edge for the rest of the film.  True, it is not very original (in fact it is a downright ripoff of ALIENS) but I wouldn't worry about that too much since the film just works so well.  This is a must-see.

The fact that Hopkins' will soon be dead put an immediacy on things and then we have to see a character who is bright and intelligent think about the things that are most important to him. This film handles everything so beautifully, the way the characters are also well placed but are then put with the rogue factor of Joe Black, I wasn't sure who was to be more unwelcome in their environment, death or the people that came into contact with him.

This is an art that is often never attempted and even less often achieved. It is a fine line between interest and boredom, if the storyteller is having the patience to develop his charactors.

I'm an avid movie goer but haven't been in months due to the sharp decline in  quality that usually happens around post oscar time. Anyhow, there were ideas and events in the film that I really enjoyed, problem was that they were usually only given a moment to mull over, or were treated as one-liners. I thought the lead female was awful and it was an extreme stretch to see the two of them get back together again. The two dorks at the store were great.. and Top 2,3,4 breakup girls were all good. I just didn't find any chemistry between his latest breakup and himself. Also, why the hell was it downpouring all the time?

It had been attempted previously with For Your Eyes Only.  The problem with For Your Eyes Only was that it went too far in the other direction, possibly a knee jerk reaction to the ludicrous Moonraker.  Roger Moore gave one of his best Bond performances (after The Man With the Golden Gun) proving that he could deliver the goods when required, there was a good plot with a twist, and one of the better Bond girls in Carole Bouquet's Melina, but nothing stood out in the film.  The Living Daylights on the other hand successfully combined the plot 'believability' of For Your Eyes Only with the exhilarating high concept stunt work of films like Moonraker which we'd come to expect from recent Bond films.  The only thing that seemed slightly out of place in The Living Daylights was Dalton's purist portrayal of Bond.Licence to Kill was the film that saw Dalton come into his own.  As has been noted, Dalton gives the closest portrayal of Fleming's Bond as yet, or you're ever likely to see.  Licence to Kill has been constructed to enable him to do that.  Queen and Country was never a good enough reason to kill someone for Fleming's Bond, he needed to justify to himself that the person deserved to die.  A lot of his missions in the books comprise of a personal vendetta against SMERSH.  Connery created the ultimate fantasy hero with his Bond (no mean achievement) but it was quite removed from Fleming's character.  Connery will forever define the screen image, and Dalton's naysayers often unfairly compare them.  With Licence to Kill, the film makers decided to build a film around Fleming's Bond and Dalton carries off the role with style.Along with a more serious Bond, comes a film with a much harder edge, an element that proved disastrous at the US box office.  Ironically, David Hedison reprises his role as Felix Leiter from Live and Let Die and is fed to a shark in a scene which was lifted from the novel Live and Let Die, following the murder of his wife on their wedding night by a Colombian drug baron.  This scenario strongly resembles the ending of On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Licence to Kill can be viewed as a sort of unofficial sequel to that film, providing Bond with the revenge that was denied him in Diamonds Are Forever. The Bond films have been plagued by week villains since Blofeld's departure but Robert Davi is a winner in the role as Franz Sanchez, providing Bond with his most physically threatening foe since Red Grant in From Russia With Love.  Benicio Del Torro's psychotic henchman is even more frightening and is one of few actors who has the ability to genuinely come across as unstable.  Carey Lowell's Pam Bouvier is the most appealing Bond girl since Diana Rigg, and will be surely remembered as one of the best ones.  Talisa Soto while not classic in the part is perhaps a little unfairly maligned.  Her performance is very 1980s, and is perhaps more of a product of its time rather than being hammy.As for whether the film is actually any good, yes, it is.  Visually it is the best looking since Thunderball, with the deep blues of the ocean, the lush greens of Sanchez's island hideaway and the dusty roads of Mexico City mixed to spellbinding effect.  The star of the show is John Glen though.  He hooks you from the start and drags you along at breakneck speed climaxing with an awesome set piece.  James Cameron had created a new gold standard in action films with Aliens, and had been matched by the likes of Verhoeven and McTiernan.  John Glen managed to surpass them with a truck chase that remains to this day the best action sequence ever filmed.  John Glen was the unsung hero of 80s action - he managed to make Octopussy and A View to a Kill enjoyable despite confused plots which could have been abysmal in anybody else's hands - and with Licence to Kill he was given material that he could mould into something special.  Licence to Kill is without a doubt the best Bond film since the sixties, and Glen doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this film.  I'd take Glen over the likes of 90s action stylists John Woo and Jan de Bont any day of the week.  I'm amazed that audiences seem to prefer the bland Brosnan efforts to this.  With Goldeneye, Bond returned to the formulaic Moore era, but lacks even their sense of fun and spectacular action sequences.  I hope we don't have to wait another 20 years for an instalment as innovative as Licence to Kill.

Oh well, his pacing a little off, so what? So I shrugged it off and watched the rest of it.At the end of the movie, I lost something.  I didn't feel that absolute satisfaction that I was supposed to feel at the end of a Star Wars.  I waved goodbye to my friends.  I felt jilted.  Then I felt I must have missed something in this film, so a couple of months later, I saw it again, vowing never to be so ignorant.  Two hours later, zippo.Then I realized it  I was watching a Saturday Morning Cartoon.  This film had the substance of Saturday Morning Cartoon.  I wasted ten friggin dollars on a Saturday Morning Cartoon.  ARgh!Some of you might think of me as rather harsh, but listen  How many of you liked Jar-Jar?  The Return of the Jedi had the Ewoks, but no one sent death threats ewoks.  Why?  Because Ewoks were better implicated in the film. Jar-Jar was there so Lucas could plaster him all over the place to make money.  Another thing, the pacing was shot to hell. Lucas took little time to develop the plot, even though it was over 2 hours!  You basically sat through a technology showcase, like back in the early twentieth century when people would crowd in seats to see a moving train.  Come on people, we deserve more than a spectacular advertisement.  We want plot. We want a memorable experience.Again, George Lucas knows what he's doing.  I heard that the other two are going to be better, but.....  Would it be worth your while?  Will it be worth the hype?  In the end, I'll see them all.  Why? Because Lucas defined the genre, and I want to see if anyone else in the business will best him.\\God, I hope so.

The way writer\/director\/producer Paul Thomas Anderson uses his initials puts me in mind of P. T. Barnum, who said There's a sucker born every minute.  And when I walked out of the theater, I felt like a sucker, having spent seven dollars and three hours on this movie.This movie wants to do for drama what Pulp Fiction did for action-comedy.

In Magnolia, they just scream and curse and whine about how their parents ruined their lives or how they're really bad people.  The opening narration states that this is a film about coincidences.  My guess is that Anderson came up with a few scenes he wanted to put into a movie, but couldn't figure out how to make them into a cohesive whole.  (Woody Allen had the same problem with Deconstructing Harry, but came up with a better, funnier solution.)The best storyline (i.e. the only one I really liked) featured Jason Robards as a dying TV producer, the always-great Julianne Moore as his sexy young wife, Philip Seymour Hoffman as his nurse, and a never-hammier Tom Cruise as his prodigal son.  I almost cried during those scenes, despite Cruise's bad acting.The worst storyline is about a boy genius on a game show who isn't allowed to use the bathroom during a taping of the show.

His latest foray, For Love of the Game, doesn't quite approach the magnitude of those two; it's kind of a mixed bag. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a 40-year-old baseball pitcher at the end of a brilliant career. His team, the Detroit Tigers, has just been sold to corporate investors, and the old owner thinks it's time for Billy to call it a career. There's only one game left in what's been a miserable season for Detroit, against the dangerous New York Yankees, who can clinch their division with a victory. Chapel's on the mound of course, making what might be his final major league appearance.   While Chapel pitches his game, scenes depicting his life up to that moment - specifically his relationship with Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), a magazine writer. Jane's beautiful and headstrong, but she and Billy have a love-hate relationship, since he is unable to love her more than the game of baseball. While Billy struggles on the mound, we see how their relationship develops, and the struggles he feels while pitching starkly mirror the tribulations of their relationship.    This is not an unflawed production, however. For one thing, Costner has been rumored for years to only cast women in his films who are either less-talented than he is (no mean feat!) or who are less overstated; in other words, actresses who may steal the film from him need not apply. Kelly Preston falls into the former of these two categories. There is no single scene in which Preston's Jane offers anything sincerity. I kept getting the feeling that he was acting - ok, I know, she IS acting, but it's not supposed to look like it! Preston's not terrible, but she would have looked a lot better if her male lead had been a little more commanding in his performance. The book on Costner for years has said that he's an actor who continuously underplays his roles. There isn't much expression on his face - which is getting more wrinkly by the second, it appears - has he ever heard of Retin-A? - and his emotions are about as deep as a shot glass. Maybe with a better actor, the overall affect of the movie would have been more pronounced. As it is, the movie's a little lackadasical. That said, the directing itself is masterful; Sam Raimi (known mostly for his Evil Dead movies!) shows off his talent in his most mainstream movie to date, and he is much more of an asset than Costner.   So what else is wrong with it? Well, the film is manipulative to a degree - although if you allow yourself to be manipulated, I guess you're just as much to blame. I myself am proud to be manipulated! I say, Manipulate me, O Lords of Cinema! Even so, I felt a creeping feeling that my emotions were being toyed with. Did I really give a damn about these characters? Not when I saw how they behaved. Also, the score was a little presumptuous and overbearing. But that's just nitpicking.

While Billy struggles on the mound, we see how their relationship develops, and the struggles he feels while pitching starkly mirror the tribulations of their relationship.    This is not an unflawed production, however. For one thing, Costner has been rumored for years to only cast women in his films who are either less-talented than he is (no mean feat!) or who are less overstated; in other words, actresses who may steal the film from him need not apply. Kelly Preston falls into the former of these two categories. There is no single scene in which Preston's Jane offers anything sincerity. I kept getting the feeling that he was acting - ok, I know, she IS acting, but it's not supposed to look like it! Preston's not terrible, but she would have looked a lot better if her male lead had been a little more commanding in his performance. The book on Costner for years has said that he's an actor who continuously underplays his roles. There isn't much expression on his face - which is getting more wrinkly by the second, it appears - has he ever heard of Retin-A? - and his emotions are about as deep as a shot glass. Maybe with a better actor, the overall affect of the movie would have been more pronounced. As it is, the movie's a little lackadasical. That said, the directing itself is masterful; Sam Raimi (known mostly for his Evil Dead movies!) shows off his talent in his most mainstream movie to date, and he is much more of an asset than Costner.   So what else is wrong with it? Well, the film is manipulative to a degree - although if you allow yourself to be manipulated, I guess you're just as much to blame. I myself am proud to be manipulated! I say, Manipulate me, O Lords of Cinema! Even so, I felt a creeping feeling that my emotions were being toyed with. Did I really give a damn about these characters? Not when I saw how they behaved. Also, the score was a little presumptuous and overbearing. But that's just nitpicking.
