I just saw it for the first time now. I'm a vampire movie junkie, and I admit a fan of Twilight, being a girl and a teen when that first came out, what choice did I have (lol). Thirsty for more I have been venturing out and watching older movies and came across 1994 Interview with the Vampire on Netflix. Not what I expected. I'm now confused about my entire Vampire World, and not because of Twilight or Interview with the Vampire, but more because of 1992 Dracula, which I also recently saw (it came out when I was about 2 or 3),but I'll get to Dracula in a moment. As I mentioned I'm a Vampire junkie, and I came across and read Anne Rice's novel which got me to watch the Interview with the Vampire movie. Differences, some, Brad Pitt's character (Louis) was upset at the beginning of the movie about losing his brother, he didn't have a wife and kid in the book, but that's okay, point is, he was depressed. Also, when a Vampire's cries in the book, they cry tears of blood, but in the movie it was regular tears. I think they should have did the blood tears. Minor, but still felt an important detail. Here comes my biggest problem, I found it very Gay at times and almost uncomfortable. Brad Pitt was beautiful in the movie, and I'm not homo-phobic, trust me on that, but at times it was a little too effeminate for me. I know Vampires are A-sexual, and it's about the love and there is no sex more or less, but I felt in this movie it WAS about the sex the way the actor's played it, and their lust or their motivation for desire was homo-erotic and more sex driven and portrayed or should I say exploited than it should have been played. Their love or lust was Gay, and again, I'm not hating on Gays, I like both men and women equally in that department, I just feel that the way it played out in the movie was more about sex than what it should have been. They were portraying Vampires, not humans. Not easy to explain in so many words, but it just did not come across as what two vampires should share, it came across as two mortals that were Gay. Before any one throws the first 'rainbow' stone at me, read what I've written, homosexuality doesn't bother me, or to be to the point, I'm Gay. I just feel they played it on a homo-erotic level suited for humans and not the love of two Vampires. Let me carry on from here, earlier I mentioned that I was confused after watching the 1992 version of Dracula. Here is why, I've been watching the Twilight movies, and several others (including Interview) and then I watched Dracula. Dracula is on a completely different level. Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins are masters. I feel like a fool for being a fan of other Vampire movies. It's like I've been given Movie Goggles and now I can see the difference. I guess Interview with a Vampire was somewhat the Twilight of it's day, it looks great, it's cool, it's sexy, but Dracula feels real and not so, well, stupid. Interview with the Vampire was definitely worth the watch. Biggest drawback for me is that when I want a man, I want a man, and in fantasy land when I want to be taken by a Vampire, I want a Vampire. I like my women effeminate, not my men. Most of my friends are Gay, but when I want a man, I want a MAN. Felt like if I got into a threesome with these Vampires I'd have to strap on my strap on and take charge, and then smoke a cigarette after as they make me dinner and do my laundry.

In films that focus on emotional effect or mood, it is possible to identify a single mood or emotion that prevails throughout the film, (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). The mood that prevails throughout the entire film is horror. The Fog starts out slow and it takes a while to gain an interest. In the beginning, young children are being told of a ghost story around the campfire about a ship wreak that happened 100 years ago. Throughout the beginning of the film, the characters were implemented poorly because only a few of the characters actually pertained to the reason behind the fog. Basically, the beginning showed the fog, which was followed by revengeful ghosts, who attacked people for no reason. Later in the movie, it was known that the fog wanted revenge to the six founders who caused a shipwreck where everyone on the ship vanished. The people who vanished were known to be the revengeful ghosts. This is the point in the movie where things start to make sense and have meaning. There were many different characters throughout the film, The Fog. One character was a radio DJ named Stevie Wayne, star Adrienne Barbeau, whose son found a piece of wood that read Dane, which was part of the name of the actual ship that was shipwrecked 100 years earlier. There was also a priest named Father Malone, star Hal Holbrook, who found his grandfather's diary. When Father Malone read the diary he found that of the six founders, his grandfather was one of them. Stevie was able to watch as the fog came inland and towards the town. She was able to transmit to the town where the fog was heading. The fog ended up at the church where Father Malone stayed. It was known by that point that the fog was after Father Malone as a way to get back at his grandfather. There were many techniques in the film that was relevant to the theme. One being sound effects. The Fog carries a spooky, windy, eerie sound with it when it arrives. This changes the viewers state of mind to an uncomfortable, uneasy sensation. This feeling allows the fog to be scarier than it really is which helps out on the horror effect. Another technique was the motif of the fog. The image of the fog being bright and glowing made it obvious that it was not something normal and it was something to be spooked about. The pattern of seeing the bright, glowing fog, the electricity going out, and then the knock on the door impacts the theme as well. The film reminded me of the horror film, Halloween, which was also a movie about many murders. Unfortunately, I could not appreciate this film.

It was known by that point that the fog was after Father Malone as a way to get back at his grandfather. There were many techniques in the film that was relevant to the theme. One being sound effects. The Fog carries a spooky, windy, eerie sound with it when it arrives. This changes the viewers state of mind to an uncomfortable, uneasy sensation. This feeling allows the fog to be scarier than it really is which helps out on the horror effect. Another technique was the motif of the fog. The image of the fog being bright and glowing made it obvious that it was not something normal and it was something to be spooked about. The pattern of seeing the bright, glowing fog, the electricity going out, and then the knock on the door impacts the theme as well. The film reminded me of the horror film, Halloween, which was also a movie about many murders. Unfortunately, I could not appreciate this film. I am one who enjoys horror films, but this was not my type. References Boggs, J. M., & Petrie, D. W. (2008). The Art of Watching Films. New York McGraw-Hill. Carpenter, J. (Director). (1980).

What's more, It could as well be placed in the same box as the James Bond franchise, because it may in some aspects remind of the well-known spy movies (Cary Grant could have been a perfect 007, with his elegance, handsome face and fantastic overall presence). However, I must say that it combines a better-developed structure, more wit in its dialogues and greater suspenseful sequences than any Bond movie does. Also, personally I thought that Eva Marie Saint was much more appealing than all of the Bond girls combined.The main plot introduces the whole movie as a serious and thrilling mystery of a man, who is mistaken for an agent and embarks on a journey to clear his name. Still, apart from that, there are various comedic aspects of the film, along with my favorite scene in the first few minutes, when Roger Thornhill (played brilliantly by Cary Grant) is being held captive, forced to get drunk and then ride a car. As for the romantic section, there is the ongoing chemistry between the devious Eve Kendell and Thornhill.All those aspects make up for an amazing and most enjoyable plot. The ideal mix of all the conjoint, yet rather opposing, factors marks the true genius of the director himself. Even though all of Hitchcock's pictures are undisputed masterpieces, North by Northwest captivated me the most. I haven't really seen a movie that offers so much - perfect plot-subplots combination, intelligent script, memorable scenes, many distinct sceneries, tremendous acting (great supporting roles by James Mason, Leo G. Carroll and Martin Landau) and, most importantly, the building of suspense until the very last minute. It is also the best Hitchcock- Grant collaboration you will find. Even though the picture didn't win an Oscar in any of the three categories that it was nominated in, it surely could have won an Award for the best picture of the year. Or the decade. Or the century. Because every time you watch this fantastic movie you will be able to find a new part that will catch your attention. That is the true genius of Hitchcock.

Despite the dialogue between them verging on the melodramatic, director James Cameron also thought up some truly witty lines that especially suited Kathy Bates as the Unsinkable Molly Brown. And, yes, it's still very touching seeing Jack and Rose willing to stay together during all that chaos as the title ship keeps sinking. And how cool is it seeing Golden Age veteran Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting how it was during Titanic's only voyage. And not to mention James Horner's iconic score. And while I thought Celine Dion's Oscar-winning song My Heart Will Go On was overplayed on Top 40 radio stations then, I actually enjoyed hearing it again during the end credits (though we only stayed through the cast list).

For me, an unknown director and two lead actors was given credence by solidly good reviews and when it was shown on Sky Arts, I recorded it. I had heard of - and seen Parker Posey in films before, though.Henry Fool covers vast areas of literary philosophy and it is itself literary in its sheer story-telling. Ever intriguing, the characters jump off the screen, larger-than-life, yes, but, oh, so honestly displayed, we feel we know these individuals, like they were friends and neighbours.James Urbaniak, as the gangly, bespectacled refuse collector, Simon, whose social graces are near nil, who we see right at the start stumbling across a fornicating couple, is superb. Via several narrative routes, Simon gets to meet up with roguish, ex-con (sex offender) Faustian, Henry Fool, who is a confident, scruffy novelist (Thomas Jay Ryan). Henry gets Simon to write, in an attempt to get his thoughts and feelings out and to communicate better with the world.Over the film's two-and-a-quarter hours, we witness Henry messing up his life more and more - getting Simon's sister (Posey) pregnant and drinking into addiction and getting further into debt. Meanwhile, Simon's poetry is cautiously received, initially cited as 'pornographic' but daring and brilliant, culminating in a Nobel Prize. Henry, meanwhile, always on the cusp (but never getting there) of finishing his own great memoirs, being actually rather untalented, falls further apart.What ensues from Hartley's Cannes-winning screenplay is a detailed, original and very realistic tale of two oddballs and their surrounding loved ones and associates, which never rushes either them, nor us.The sparse, atmospheric score (also attributed to Hal Hartley - source IMDb) superbly adds to the feel and tone of the film.This indie flick is probably too oddball and has no star names to draw it from near obscurity into the mainstream. Not only is it immensely enjoyable but involving and engaging, too. I usually delete films from my provider's box, once seen, but this one I want to see again. Fine film.

Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) agrees to become the caretaker at the Overlook Hotel over the winter. Jack's desire to become a novelist is part of the driving force for his decision to take the job. In the need of some quite time, Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd) make the long winding trip to Colorado. There is a hauntingly disturbing history that comes with this hotel. One piece of this history is in regards to a previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (Philip Stone), that brutally murdered his wife and two daughters with an ax. Grady subsequently takes his own life with a shotgun. Jack's son Danny, as we see in the beginning before it is known if Jack has accepted the job, is reluctant to go to the hotel. Danny has a psychological gift known as the shining that resonates within his imaginary friend Tony. This gift allows him to see visions of what has happened in the past or what will come to pass. The film builds upon his ability and Jack's, as the Torrance family's stay becomes one of physical and psychological terror and fear.Effectively used throughout the film are segment cuts. This technique utilized in the editorial process enables a compression and expansion of time. Each segment is shown as a black screen with white lettering and all capital letters. The body of the film takes place after the first month of the Torrance family's stay at the hotel. By utilizing jump cuts as well as flash cuts at various speeds throughout the remainder of the film time between segments, although shorter in length, seems to stretch beyond realistic boundaries. The drastic difference in the segment labels adds to the grandeur of the Overlook Hotel and the feeling of isolation that is dramatically apparent throughout the film. The audience receives its first inclination of Jack's slow loss of psychological coherence as he stands over the model of the large, menacing hedge labyrinth. An uncanny smile comes across Jack's face as he gazes into the maze and the scene slowly transitions to an aerial view of Wendy and Danny running through the actual maze outside the hotel. The carryover, of the maze from one scene to the next, shows that there is an unnatural evil looming in Jack's mind. In conjunction with the scene cuts and transitions, music adds to the intensity, suspense and terror. The high toned, almost screeching, sound of the music is similar in reaction to that of nails on a chalkboard. The sound makes you cringe. The cringe feel in the film is dramatically effective in terms of association. This music is initially used to alert you to the onset of visions experienced by Danny. The progression of Jack's loss of sanity brings out increased use of this music. The new association of music to film gives you the sense that things are only becoming worse than initially portrayed. As we witness Jack's evolution to madness, we find that he too, like Danny, may have the shining. Jack begins to have visions of events that took place in the past at the Overlook Hotel. One such scene is of a party in the Gold Ballroom where Jack meets Grady and reaches the final stage of his insanity. Another scene is in room 237 where Danny is supposedly attacked by a woman in the bathtub. Jack makes his way to the room and discovers a woman that is much to his delight. As the scene continues, the woman transforms to an older woman that is depicted as having rotting flesh and most likely died in that bathtub. A striking similarity to this film is that of M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense. We get the sense in both these films that the obvious focus for special abilities is on the child character. As both films and characters grow we see that it is not only the apparent character(s) that have this ability, but that multiple characters have these abilities as well.It has been many years since I've sat down to watch The Shining from start to finish and thought it was probably time to do so again. I remember how I felt watching this film the first couple of times, jumping at every turn, and not much has changed. The beauty of this film is that it makes you really think about the situation. What would you do in that situation? Do you think you are a person that could handle that type of isolation? Would things have turned out differently if Jack was not aware of the hotel's history? Are Danny's visions merely just the imagination of a young child that is afraid of being alone in such a large place? Are we all capable of losing our minds to some degree? It takes many elements to make a film successful in achieving its goal. The Shining was able to keep the focus on psychological decline through various techniques used in film making. Through the use of music, sound, editing, acting, cinematography, etc. the film kept the viewer hanging on to each scene. Sitting on the edge of your seat, heart pumping, fear and terror are just a few emotions and ways you will feel throughout a viewing of The Shining.

The world it is set in is so rich, so unique, and so beautiful that you will often find yourself marveling at the sheer wonder of it all. The set and the locations are incredible, and absolutely gorgeous. The characters and writing are superb, and they are translated to screen wonderfully. They are all exactly how I imagined them while reading the books. The special effects are the best I have ever seen. The action scenes are amazing, but the films does incredible even when it is just people talking. Overall, they are the greatest films I have ever seen, and anyone who has yet to watch them needs to do so immediately. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"}]
