It was discovered after the death of its author that some of the research was created to help make the conspiracy.

Martha Tabram, the first murder in the movie, is not listed among the canonical five victims (Mary Nichols, Annie Chapman, Liz Stride, Katherine Eddows, and Mary Kelly) but Tabram, along with about a dozen other women, are theorized to be victims of the Ripper.  The death scenes were not as gory as I might expect;  though to show the body of Mary Kelly as seen in the black and white photograph at the actual murder scene 100 years ago would surely give the move an NC-17 rating.  The murders were handled well, with just enough of the gore factor to give them the scare factor.Depp gives a very solid performance as Fredderick Abberline (which is pronounced a-ber-leen, not a-ber-line as far as I know) though much of his character was made to suite the story.  From a historical standpoint, Abberline did not smoke opium, was married, and was actually demoted to returned to Whitechapel for the Ripper cases.  And he certainly did not die afterwards.  Depp, as we all know from his previous endeavors, plays a wonderful detective, and he handled this role beautifully, as far as I'm concerned.Ian Holm as William Gull was solid.  I was a bit perplexed about the change in his voice from certain scenes to the next.  I know that originally, Nathaniel Hawthorne was casted as Gull, but I'm unsure if he shot any of the scenes -- I'm wondering if his voice was used as the Ripper's.Coltrane adds some of the very few comical moments, and Graham gives an pretty good performace as Mary Kelly.I read somewhere that there were two endings shot for this film, one of which Depp and Graham got drunk and acted badly for on purpose so that it couldn't be used.  When I read this, I thought they would be doing this for an ending where everyone lived happily ever after.  I was sorely mistaken.  This movie's take on Mary Kelly living and\/or falling for Abberline or even MEETING Abberline is completely made up.  It does help the plot along, however.The most wonderful aspect of the film, in my opinion, are the visuals -- the scenery.  Absolutely brilliant shots of London in what it could have looked like in the 19th century.  The shots of the skyline above the rooftops of the East End were equally breathtaking.

Based on what I already knew I think anyone would have to admit that a story about him would be very interesting to see, and if anything terribly disturbing and frightening. Not so in from hell.I have a 5 minute rule that I apply to every movie I see. It is always on the money. If after the 1st five minutes I am not into it the chances are extremely high that I will not get into it. The reason I am so adamant about this rule is that in my oppinion if the director couldn't be bothered to grab you in what should be your first impression of the 2 hour film then what the hell is he\/she waiting for?From hell was gruesome and bloody and so violent, violence which I have not seen since that horrible movie the cell with Jennifer Lopez. I understand that the movie is about JACK THE RIPPER and he was an extremley violent man, however I find that the most scarry movies I have seen in my life use great direction, and editing, and acting to invoke fear in the viewer instead of gratuitous blood and gutz throughout. It's kind of like a comedian who uses profanity. Just saying the word fuck is not funny. However putting it in all the right places can be hilarious.This movie was about the detective played by Johnnie Depp who was on the case to catch the elusive Jack the Ripper. Throughout the film we were shown numerous possible suspects that were all indicated by wearing a masonic ring. OOh. Scarry. It gave you all sorts of false leads and you were supposed to be surpised when you learned who he really was. I frankly was not only not surprised, but I did not care.

But after watching it again this summer, you really get an appreciation for the characters and the unfairness and hardships that their lives became.  Watching the movie, you really sympathize with these orphans and the friendship and bonding that they go through. A good example is Dirty Steve and Chavez.  Two guys who hated each other in the beginning and by the end are almost like brothers after what they went through together.  Did you notice in the last shootout that Chavez got away and Steve died because Steve gave him his horse and told him to go? Another example is when Chavez was going to walk out on the posse after telling the guys the fate of his family with the U.S. army, but then Billy tells him were your family now, you got 4 or 5 good pals, then you got yourself a tribe,aint nothing stronger than that, you desert us then you brake our sacred hoop.Character change was also big in this movie, if you really noticed.  Take Billy for example.  Look at his two different meetings with pat garret. the first one he is awed by Garrets size and then says im gonna be as big as him someday, no ill be bigger.  The second meeting at Charlie's wedding, Billie is much more stronger against Garrett and threatens him with his pistol.  this is after Billie has become the most wanted man in New Mexico. and speaking of Charlie, he went from a kid so afraid of dying to being absoloutely trigger happy in the last shootout when he takes on John Kinney, the bounty-hunter he feared the most, and takes down Kinney before he falls too.To be general, this movie is much more than a shoot-em-up western (although the gunfights were absoloutely fantastic).  The characters were brialliant and well-portrayed.  Especially Emilio Estevez who was hilarious as Billy the Kid (yeah i seen Red Smitty hang, I see his head come clean off, it was a hell of a sight! and Pippin, Charlie Crawford aint with you anymore!) To put it simply, when you watch this movie, dont just watch it for the shootouts, try and appreciate the characters and the storyline too.

They bring up non-Brooks films such as Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Hot Shots.But am I the only one who remembers that Mel Brooks actually parodied Robin Hood PREVIOUSLY? He produced a TV series in 1975 titled When Things Were Rotten. It is amazing that nobody, not even Roger Ebert, has compared Brooks' earlier foray into Robin Hood lore with the most recent one.So I guess it's up to me. The earlier treatment was, of course, episodic. This was a one-shot film. The earlier one drew from the legend itself while poking fun at TV sitcoms in general. For example, the real legend didn't feature a set of twins -- one working for Robin Hood, the other for the sheriff -- but that's the kind of cute thing that TV does. (When Brooks' writers had an episode explaining how the brothers split up, it was less funny afterward.)This outing draws a great deal from Hollywood and in particular the Costner pic. Brooks keeps Prince John, a character in the Errol Flynn movie and other treatments, even though Costner removed the prince from his tale.In the TV show, only the sheriff and his chief lackey spoke with English accents. This time, they make a point of an English-accented Robin.Both featured Brooksian sight gags and visual puns. But I think they worked better in the TV show. Maybe they were just fresher.

This time, they make a point of an English-accented Robin.Both featured Brooksian sight gags and visual puns. But I think they worked better in the TV show. Maybe they were just fresher. Brooks' humor was insane and hilarious when contrasted to the starchy confines of 1970s TV. But now his work is getting stale. There were some cool gags in Men in Tights, such as the quarter-staff fight and the Everlast chastity belt, but far too much of the parody is aimed at a single previous movie. And a good parody goes for general conventions, not specifics.Rabbi Tuckman, though, was a good touch. Pure good ol' Brooks! Interesting that Dick van Patten, the TV show's Friar Tuck, gets to play the Abbot this time with a similar allusion to Abbot & Costello.And I think for Brooks, 1975 WAS when things were rotten. Because not enough people were watching his show. It lasted one season. Despondent, he went out to make a Silent Movie and left TV for good....

For those not aware of this ever-important catch-phrase in the Hollywood industry; allow me to explain. This relates to a film's cinematic 'style' in which the film's outlandish visuals' outweigh the poor plot and weak storytelling ( a.k.a.substance). This terminology can apply to such recent films as 'The Cell' to a disturbing little film from Terry Gilliam called 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' .      The concept of 'Style over substance' was my main worry in the Hughes' brothers' latest film &#145;From Hell'. After an almost 6 year break from their last major Hollywood film; 'Dead Presidents', the brothers who burst onto the scene with their first  film 'Menace II Society' create a crafty film set around the classic tale of Jack the Ripper.       My main concern as aforementioned would be how these young filmmakers would balance the visuals of the film with its' heavy content. As previews started to roll in theatres months ago, the film's gothic London look resembled Tim Burton's set pieces drastically. And so my mind started to wonder, questioning the craftiness of the film.       It is apparent that while these filmmakers have only made a documentary on pimps during their hiatus, it is evident that these filmmakers have studied the art of cinema and have put a lot of thought into the film. From nifty dissolves (an editing technique) to a dark look, these Brother Directors try to earn respect from the film going industry and partially have. Yet, they should have concentrated equally between the film's archaic set pieces and production values to what ultimately 'makes or breaks' a film. In a nutshell, the film's lacklustre pace that fades out after a entertaining first act makes this film seem longer than its' two hour running time.      'From Hell' stars the incredibly talented Johnny Depp who seems to completely reinvent himself after every role. He bites into his characters and allows himself to be deeply immersed in this role as Inspector Abberline who is assigned to solve these mysterious strings of murders. Yet, the same cannot be said for Heather Graham who plays Mary Kelly, a prostitute working the streets of London who seems to be the next victim on the killer's list. In my opinion, it is evident that Graham is miscast as she wanders astray in the film with the help of a wasted English accent that serves more as a detriment than an aid in setting the film's tone.      Set in the gothic town of early London, this film puts a spin on the classic Jack the Ripper tale. The film's composition is quite simple yet complex at the same time. The Hughes brothers open the film with an entertaining yet congested first act. After all, this is a murder mystery and the suspects are thrown at you within the film's first 10 minutes. Following this display, the motives are thrown at you opening up the forum for educated guesses from the very beginning of the film.     And of course, the murder sequences. Quite simply - stunning. They maintain a certain sense of calmness while displaying the evil maliciousness the 'Ripper' character possesses. In watching these graphic scenes, it can be thoroughly observed that every one of the murderous sequences has been explicitly deconstructed in order to be filmed on the screen in a stylish and subtle violent manner. The interesting detail about these scenes is that the violence displayed escalates and develops with each murderous sequence. Witness the bloodless first murderous sequence in which the audience is surprised and terrified as all we see is the glare of the knife slowly being tainted with blood as it appears then disappears repeatedly into the glint of the light as it pierces the body outside of the frame. Perhaps an homage to Hitchcock with the 'less is more' angle, yet in the end it is absolutely a treat to watch.       What is not so great is as the blood and the victims increase, the film's pacing and storytelling decreases in a slow yet diminutive manner that the film never seems to recover from. The Hughes Brothers' work so hard to establish a crafty and surprisingly effective opening only to see it go to waste as the courting of Mary Kelly and Inspector Abberline bog down the film's pacing and set up the depressing and awkward ending.      While the film's visuals are outstanding and the foggy London backdrop add a trait of creepiness to the film. The film's ultimate weakness is the imbalance of plot, storytelling and its' look.  Yet all this cannot hide the fact that while the Hughes Brothers have displayed their cinematic maturity at creating a bloody, dark and entertaining piece, it does not hide the fact that they could have created a real treat, yet stalled at turning a good film into a great film.Giancarlo's Rating  **  ","genre":null},{"date":"20 October 2001","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"        'Style over substance'.

'From Hell' stars the incredibly talented Johnny Depp who seems to completely reinvent himself after every role. He bites into his characters and allows himself to be deeply immersed in this role as Inspector Abberline who is assigned to solve these mysterious strings of murders. Yet, the same cannot be said for Heather Graham who plays Mary Kelly, a prostitute working the streets of London who seems to be the next victim on the killer's list. In my opinion, it is evident that Graham is miscast as she wanders astray in the film with the help of a wasted English accent that serves more as a detriment than an aid in setting the film's tone.      Set in the gothic town of early London, this film puts a spin on the classic Jack the Ripper tale. The film's composition is quite simple yet complex at the same time. The Hughes brothers open the film with an entertaining yet congested first act. After all, this is a murder mystery and the suspects are thrown at you within the film's first 10 minutes. Following this display, the motives are thrown at you opening up the forum for educated guesses from the very beginning of the film.     And of course, the murder sequences. Quite simply - stunning. They maintain a certain sense of calmness while displaying the evil maliciousness the 'Ripper' character possesses. In watching these graphic scenes, it can be thoroughly observed that every one of the murderous sequences has been explicitly deconstructed in order to be filmed on the screen in a stylish and subtle violent manner. The interesting detail about these scenes is that the violence displayed escalates and develops with each murderous sequence. Witness the bloodless first murderous sequence in which the audience is surprised and terrified as all we see is the glare of the knife slowly being tainted with blood as it appears then disappears repeatedly into the glint of the light as it pierces the body outside of the frame. Perhaps an homage to Hitchcock with the 'less is more' angle, yet in the end it is absolutely a treat to watch.       What is not so great is as the blood and the victims increase, the film's pacing and storytelling decreases in a slow yet diminutive manner that the film never seems to recover from. The Hughes Brothers' work so hard to establish a crafty and surprisingly effective opening only to see it go to waste as the courting of Mary Kelly and Inspector Abberline bog down the film's pacing and set up the depressing and awkward ending.      While the film's visuals are outstanding and the foggy London backdrop add a trait of creepiness to the film. The film's ultimate weakness is the imbalance of plot, storytelling and its' look.  Yet all this cannot hide the fact that while the Hughes Brothers have displayed their cinematic maturity at creating a bloody, dark and entertaining piece, it does not hide the fact that they could have created a real treat, yet stalled at turning a good film into a great film.Giancarlo's Rating  **  ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"20 October 2001","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"        'Style over substance'. For those not aware of this ever-important catch-phrase in the Hollywood industry; allow me to explain. This relates to a film's cinematic 'style' in which the film's outlandish visuals' outweigh the poor plot and weak storytelling ( a.k.a.substance). This terminology can apply to such recent films as 'The Cell' to a disturbing little film from Terry Gilliam called 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' .      The concept of 'Style over substance' was my main worry in the Hughes' brothers' latest film &#145;From Hell'. After an almost 6 year break from their last major Hollywood film; 'Dead Presidents', the brothers who burst onto the scene with their first  film 'Menace II Society' create a crafty film set around the classic tale of Jack the Ripper.       My main concern as aforementioned would be how these young filmmakers would balance the visuals of the film with its' heavy content. As previews started to roll in theatres months ago, the film's gothic London look resembled Tim Burton's set pieces drastically. And so my mind started to wonder, questioning the craftiness of the film.       It is apparent that while these filmmakers have only made a documentary on pimps during their hiatus, it is evident that these filmmakers have studied the art of cinema and have put a lot of thought into the film. From nifty dissolves (an editing technique) to a dark look, these Brother Directors try to earn respect from the film going industry and partially have. Yet, they should have concentrated equally between the film's archaic set pieces and production values to what ultimately 'makes or breaks' a film.
