[{"date":"17 February 2000","score":"","review":"  Alec Baldwin's touching performance is the heart of this sharp and moving film about growing up on the wrong side of the tracks. Shawn Hatosy plays a high-schooler from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, whose lifestyle of hanging around, smoking up and joyriding is cut short by a car accident, prompting his exasperated father (Baldwin) to send him to prep school. There he encounters the elitism of the high class students who attend the school, makes friends with his fellow misfits and falls in love with the golden girl (Amy Smart) who eventually falls in love back. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Feels like this kind of movie has been done a million times, but Michael Corrente's sensitive direction and a script by Corrente and the Farrelly brothers (of There's Something About Mary fame) easily avoid most cliches and go straight for the heart. These guys sure know how to tap into the blue-collar American subconscious, and for the most part they get it right.
