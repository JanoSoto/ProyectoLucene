Directed by Alan Parker and released in 1988, this film is without a doubt great at not only being a well acted drama concerning racism, but something of a thriller as well. Watching this movie is watching one of the most ingenious and emotional crime dramas to be made in the past twenty years, and perhaps even longer than that. All though it was overshadowed by Rain Man when it was released in 1988, that does not dampen just how impactive Mississippi Burning truly is.Based on the true account of three civil rights workers (two white and one black) being murdered by the Ku Klux Klan, the story follows fictional FBI agents Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe) as they try to prove the culpability of Klan members in the murder. Do not expect this movie to closely follow exact history records, however, as you will end up being disappointed. Instead, the movie bases itself loosely in historical accuracy and shows the evils of racism in its own way. Still, many instances depicted in this movie really did happen, such as the KKK bombing the houses and churches of black people, but actual names, places, and dates are not adhered by. Actually, though, I think it was wise for the movie not to adhere itself so close to history, as it gives the film more to work with.A popular criticism of Mississippi Burning is that it makes the federal agents look more like heroes to Civil Rights workers than they actually were. I can agree with that point to an extent in the film, but with the great performances the movie gives, you should not be wasting time on noticing that issue. Gene Hackman gives off another superb performance in this movie as federal agent Rupert Anderson, who I feel should go down as one of cinema's greatest law enforcement individuals. In the movie Anderson is actually from Mississippi himself, where he worked as a town sheriff. Due to this, Anderson knows how things work in the South concerning crimes against Civil Rights Workers and black people, and is not afraid to get his hands dirty to see a crime get solved. Anderson often clashes with his by-the-book boss, Ward, because of this. As for Willem Dafoe's portrayal of federal agent Ward, it is solid, but sometimes it is overdone with good guy themes. Even though I am sure that there were FBI agents that wanted to help with the Civil Rights cause, would any FBI agent in that time period really be allowed to bring down over a hundred federal agents and men from the naval reserves (as he does) into Mississippi in order to help solve a murder case? Unlikely, but as I said, to quibble on such a menial matter is to lose sight of the grand scope of the film.Another stand-out performance in the movie is given off by Frances McDormand as the quiet, subdued, and seeming battered wife of town deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), and the owner of a beauty parlor. Clinton Pell is a member of the KKK himself, and even participated in the shootings of the three Civil Rights workers. Playing this man's wife, McDormand shows how her character truly disapproves of everything her husband stands for, but is simply too scared or perhaps does not think enough of herself to break free of his violent domination. She plays a very important part in the movie with one Anderson, but I should not spoil anymore of the plot for those that have never seen the film. Many will argue that characters like Clinton Pell are over-exaggerated for the time, but that is not true, as even today I can find men and woman who share many of his same thoughts.Along with the tremendous acting comes excellent cinematography. Every shot wonderfully captures the look and feel of a small Mississippi town in that age, with dusty streets, small diners, general stores, farms, and houses (some ramshackle, some nice). Camera work in this film makes you feel that you are in Mississippi yourself.My review of this movie simply does not do the film any justice. One must watch the movie to feel all of the strong emotions within it. Upon my initial viewing of this film, I was shaken and disturbed by the racism that is presented. It was smart for this movie to not preach how racism is evil, but to simply show racism in its purest form and allow the viewer to be the judge.Like I have said throughout this review, some minor issues plague Mississippi Burning. Those minor issues are what made me give this movie nine stars instead of ten. Still, I recommend this movie very highly, and even with some of its minor flaws, if you have any sense of what a good movie is it will surely capture you with assets that definitely outweigh the flaws.

Therefore, whatever how many years passed by .. when you watch a certain movie you recall all of your happy (or unhappy) memories which are connected with the first watching' time, with all of its thoughts and feelings.As for (Shoot to Kill) I was 21 year old at the time when I first watch it. At the time I've just ended my fourth and final year in faculty of arts, waiting for the result of my exams, so my friend (he was my neighbor too) who was waiting for his as well but at the faculty of law. Both of us were movies' freak and maybe you'll understand how crazy we were when I tell you that we raced once to finish watching all the movies in one video store near our homes !!, I remember that he saw more horror movies than I did, but I surpassed at watching the action and the musical ones. Anyway it was the glorious glory's days, we were watching movies at our national TV like (Hot To Trot), (Romancing The Stone), (Other People Money) there were all good, so at the theaters too like (X Files The Film) ; although we were disappointed with it but we're having each other and ready to watch more movies, better or worse. Through the video we've enjoyed a lot of nice ones and how we got our own dictionary out of the movies' dialogue.. to hang a phone call saying (I'll Be Back !) from (Terminator), or to end a hot conversation peacefully (opinions are like asses, everybody got one !) from (The Dead Pool), or to be naughty sometimes (Hubba Hubba !) from (Payback) and so on..In 14\/7\/1999 I saw (Contact) by (Robert Zemeckis) and my friend just finished (Shoot To Kill), so we recommended every one's movie to each other to discuss it later as usual in our discussion zone  The Gym !.I went to read its cover to discover that it's an action thriller that got (Sidney Poitier) as the lead and (Roger Spottiswoode) as a director, so I rented it enthusiastically. And when I watched it, I just fell in love with it. (Shoot to Kill) was sharp, so solid and more beautiful than most of the above. It's the good old school at its best and that's ladies and gentlemen my favorite kind of action, not the awful grisly comic books graphic novels video games kind of rhythm, violent and idiocy (YES, Sin City, Sin Movies !). I see that this good movie got it all. Firstly the fine screenplay, especially when it cared not only about making good action thriller time with no flaws at all, but also when it showed the comparison of two clever men and how everyone, in his own world and by his environment's rules, is a real hero. Actually it said that the work of any police officer in the city is as hard as the mountain climber's work in the woods ! Or that the world is one giant jungle therefore you must know how to survive but everyone by their special talents. Look at the great (Poitier) so clumsy in the jungle with many wicked details and witty expressions while (Berenger) was the MAN. But then in the city, it's totally the opposite, where (Poitier) was the master of his civilized yet the same brutal wood, and (Berenger) turned into the naive one who discovered finally the truth about (Poitier) to tell him during the car chase You're a MAD MAN!.Furthermore, that strong music, that wonderful cinematography, and that perfect editing; remember the armlet's scene at the beginning .. That was unforgettable piece of work as a lesson in how to build a thrill in one short scene. And naturally the proficient direction. This movie delivers greatly particularly at the last 15 minutes; I simply adore this climatic sequence.I loved it to the extent that I watched it for a second time right after the first one immediately ! You can find it in my list for the best 100 non-Egyptian movies ever. And still a fine enjoyment to watch that one from the 1980s, thanks mainly to the iconic presence of (Poitier) as an action star here (try to believe that this graceful elegant was 61 years old at the time !!). I didn't find till now an explanation for his 11 years of absence as a movie star from 1977 to 1988 ?! But whatever, he came back to make (Little Nikita - 1988) and (Shoot To Kill &#x96; 1988) and really what a huge difference between them both as one is half good and one too good !.So after watching the movie, at the title's date, I remember so joyfully that in the next afternoon I've met my friend at the very zone of us, and when I asked him smiling You FBI guys Do This Kind Of S**t a Lot ? I had him and me answering in the same time imitating Poitier  Every Damn Day !. Although it's a line which maybe we've heard in other movies or even TV shows before, but when it has Poitier's performance.. It becomes CLASSIC.

At the time I've just ended my fourth and final year in faculty of arts, waiting for the result of my exams, so my friend (he was my neighbor too) who was waiting for his as well but at the faculty of law. Both of us were movies' freak and maybe you'll understand how crazy we were when I tell you that we raced once to finish watching all the movies in one video store near our homes !!, I remember that he saw more horror movies than I did, but I surpassed at watching the action and the musical ones. Anyway it was the glorious glory's days, we were watching movies at our national TV like (Hot To Trot), (Romancing The Stone), (Other People Money) there were all good, so at the theaters too like (X Files The Film) ; although we were disappointed with it but we're having each other and ready to watch more movies, better or worse. Through the video we've enjoyed a lot of nice ones and how we got our own dictionary out of the movies' dialogue.. to hang a phone call saying (I'll Be Back !) from (Terminator), or to end a hot conversation peacefully (opinions are like asses, everybody got one !) from (The Dead Pool), or to be naughty sometimes (Hubba Hubba !) from (Payback) and so on..In 14\/7\/1999 I saw (Contact) by (Robert Zemeckis) and my friend just finished (Shoot To Kill), so we recommended every one's movie to each other to discuss it later as usual in our discussion zone  The Gym !.I went to read its cover to discover that it's an action thriller that got (Sidney Poitier) as the lead and (Roger Spottiswoode) as a director, so I rented it enthusiastically. And when I watched it, I just fell in love with it. (Shoot to Kill) was sharp, so solid and more beautiful than most of the above. It's the good old school at its best and that's ladies and gentlemen my favorite kind of action, not the awful grisly comic books graphic novels video games kind of rhythm, violent and idiocy (YES, Sin City, Sin Movies !). I see that this good movie got it all. Firstly the fine screenplay, especially when it cared not only about making good action thriller time with no flaws at all, but also when it showed the comparison of two clever men and how everyone, in his own world and by his environment's rules, is a real hero. Actually it said that the work of any police officer in the city is as hard as the mountain climber's work in the woods ! Or that the world is one giant jungle therefore you must know how to survive but everyone by their special talents. Look at the great (Poitier) so clumsy in the jungle with many wicked details and witty expressions while (Berenger) was the MAN. But then in the city, it's totally the opposite, where (Poitier) was the master of his civilized yet the same brutal wood, and (Berenger) turned into the naive one who discovered finally the truth about (Poitier) to tell him during the car chase You're a MAD MAN!.Furthermore, that strong music, that wonderful cinematography, and that perfect editing; remember the armlet's scene at the beginning .. That was unforgettable piece of work as a lesson in how to build a thrill in one short scene. And naturally the proficient direction. This movie delivers greatly particularly at the last 15 minutes; I simply adore this climatic sequence.I loved it to the extent that I watched it for a second time right after the first one immediately ! You can find it in my list for the best 100 non-Egyptian movies ever. And still a fine enjoyment to watch that one from the 1980s, thanks mainly to the iconic presence of (Poitier) as an action star here (try to believe that this graceful elegant was 61 years old at the time !!). I didn't find till now an explanation for his 11 years of absence as a movie star from 1977 to 1988 ?! But whatever, he came back to make (Little Nikita - 1988) and (Shoot To Kill &#x96; 1988) and really what a huge difference between them both as one is half good and one too good !.So after watching the movie, at the title's date, I remember so joyfully that in the next afternoon I've met my friend at the very zone of us, and when I asked him smiling You FBI guys Do This Kind Of S**t a Lot ? I had him and me answering in the same time imitating Poitier  Every Damn Day !. Although it's a line which maybe we've heard in other movies or even TV shows before, but when it has Poitier's performance.. It becomes CLASSIC.

But here I give up. To me this adventure flick is certainly the best Indiana Jones movie and perhaps even the best action\/adventure\/thriller movie. It never lets a viewer doze off. A shoot-out in some China restaurant swiftly turns into a car-chase, the car-chase transforms into a psychotic aircraft catastrophe, the aircraft catastrophe gets right to a dinner-table with monkey brains, stuffed snakes, delicious insects and what-not, the dinner-table rapidly meets an assassination scene, the assassination scene ends in a secret passage swarmed with the crawling creatures and spiked ceiling that is getting lower and lower, then there is a macabre occult episode, child abuse, mass hysteria and escape, insane railway ride, grisly deaths of the baddies, alligators, ...phew - that's nearly all. That is a kind of content for a few adventure flicks, isn't it? But no, Mr Stephen Spielberg stuffs it all in one movie. The right choice. It looks great.Warning! If you are accustomed to usual TV serials (so beloved by housewives) and simple sexy down-to-earth talkative entertainment (like Anshlag), you will probably get a headache in no time when watching this movie. For a mouldy brain of a modern TV-buff the pace of this one is too speedy. It's not a kind of chewing-gum suspense fantasy adventure - it's a kind of run-while-you-still-can adventure.The choice of the actors could not be better. Actually, this film has greatly affected my evaluation of Star Wars and Blade Runner. I wished Mr Harrison Ford had not appeared in those productions because he made a perfect Indiana Jones. It happens now and then that one role has a destructive influence on some actor. This is a pure example. I see him in Blade Runner and cannot treat the project seriously (though I try really hard). I see him in Star Wars and cannot get rid of his image in a cowboy hat with a whip in his hand. And no thriller with him as the leading star can lure me into watching. No way. He is the sarcastic archaeologist, period.As to the other two Indiana Jones movies, I enjoy the first one (a good entrance of the hero) but dislike the third instalment (a weak diminuendo with pathetic father-and-son relations, in my humble opinion).What else to say? It's a wild ride. The critically-acclaimed E.T. is boring and unimpressive to me, there is often something wrong with his other movies too (too much sentimentality and self-importance, maybe), but this one is a must-have. Simply outstanding. At least now I know that Mr Steven Spielberg can direct a solid piece of entertainment and keep fortissimo from the opening shots till the very last ones.A definite 10 out of 10.

It wasn't until the trailer for the movie was released that people knew The truth. Fans would go to the theaters just to see the trailer. Batmania was everywhere.So, this is The dark batman we've been waiting for right? The be all and end all? No.WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.Although its light years ahead of The 60's TV show in a sense of darkness, it still has its campy moments. Most of this is due to the fact that the Joker is the main villain, although some seems out of place, and just downright silly.The Joker, who was played well by Jack Nicholsan, had his origin story changed for this Film. Which works well for the type of movie this was.Instead of being an 30 something crazy lunatic, with no definitive back story, he is now a 50 something lunatic, who once worked for the gang.The Joker also kills Bruce Waynes parents in this movie, although Originally It was Joe Chill who killed his parents, as seen in Batman Begins. Again, this was done to fit the story of the movie, along with the tone, and it works well.Despite the change of Origin, the joker is still a crazy maniac. He still uses his joker venom, he still uses the television to broadcast his terror, and he still laughs.The only thing wrong with the take is the Jokers flesh make-up, when he has it on, you wonder if your watching the joker or a very happy Jack Nicholsan.Batman, who is played By Micheal Keaton, is terrific. His voice is the best of all the other actors to don the suit. The suit itself is terrific, no bat nipples, and no silver. Just pure black, of course, with his trademark yellow bat-symbol on the chest.The Story is fast paced and fun, and it does very well to lead to the final confrontation of good vs evil.However, this film is definitely not without its flaws. Like I've said before, it can be very campy and sometimes downright silly, Such as the Joker dancing to prince twice.The real trouble lies within the dialog, mostly the Dialogue spoken By Vicki Vale, who is played By Kim Basinger.Since I don't want to get Into her dialog flaws (There is many) I will go into one of Jokers.Batman Im going to kill you.Joker You idiot! You made me, you dropped me into that vat of chemicals, that wasn't easy to get over, and don't think I didn't try.That line just seemed to straightforward for me, a simple You made me would have worked much better.Also, the MAIN problem of this movie is the amount of time we actually SEE batman. The film could have easily been called Joker.We even get a full origin of the Joker, while we get nothing, except for the parents thing, with Bruce Wayne.Despite some shortcomings, this is a movie in which the pros outweigh the cons.Whether you are in you are 10, or 30, you will enjoy his movie.

They make Sal Boca, a small-time operator, and tie him to an elusive Frenchman, Alain Charnier, who just may be a heroin smuggler from Marseille. Can they track down the haul and make the collar ?The two definitive cop movies of all time came out just weeks apart in late 1971; Dirty Harry and The French Connection. This film is one of those rarities where the timing seemed to be just magic - most of the cast and crew had little or no movie experience but turned out to be cinematic gold, particularly Friedkin, Hackman, Scheider, director of photography Owen Roizman and editor Jerry Greenberg. They all brought to the film an incredible confidence, wild energy, invisible artistry and tremendous authenticity. If this movie is anything, it's a gut-punch which leaves you winded and amazed; in my view there's been no other crime-thriller which is so down-and-dirty, so streetwise believable and yet exhilarating at the same time. Friedkin's genius is to depict the investigation with painstaking authenticity (he refers to it as induced documentary), but always with one eye on suspense, action and dramatic conflict. It's a style that's simply been copied ever since, especially on TV, and it puts you right into the world the movie creates. These are guys who think nothing of sleeping in a car for a week to get a lead on a suspect, and can spot a crooked deal a mile off. Hackman and Scheider are so good you forget they're reading a script - they simply are Popeye and Cloudy, and their rapport (sadly they've never worked again since) is just perfect. Every aspect of the production is first-rate - camera-work, editing, Ernest Tidyman's ruthlessly pared-down script, score, stuntwork - it's a model to aspire to. The memorable chase sequence with Hackman driving like a maniac beneath the elevated train is one of the best ever filmed, but is only one of the movie's many breathtaking scenes, like the brilliant contrast of the villains eating haute cuisine while the cops freeze outside, the long surveillance montages, the car-stripping sequence or the starkly enigmatic ending. Based on a real life 1962 bust by NYPD narcotics detectives Eddie Egan (who plays the precinct captain) and Sonny Grosso (who plays the fed who follows Sal to Washington), who acted as consultants on the film. Shot in terrific locations in Queens, Brooklyn (the chase is down 86th Street), Manhattan and the wonderfully bleak Randall's Island. This is about the only really great movie which was a big Oscar success, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Script and Best Editing - all richly deserved, but in a way if anything makes this movie then it's the photography and that's the one award it didn't win. Owen Roizman's work here is simply faultless, inspired brilliance - he had only made one obscure low-budget film before this, went on to produce an excellent body of work (The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three, The Addams Family, many others) and retired at the top of his game.

So, in the spirit of Shane, Goro decides (with the help of some friends) to help Tampopo make the perfect noodle soup.This is the main thread of the story, but weaved in amongst it are a succession of vignettes that show the role of food in Japanese society. Some are funny, some touching and some revel in the sensual pleasure that food and its eating can bring.Standout scenes include ordering lunch in a French restaurant for a group of salarymen; a teacher at a finishing school trying to show a group of young women how to eat spaghetti, Western style; a family eating the last meal made by their dying mother, not to mention the infamous scene with a gangster, his moll and a raw egg yolk (not to mention crayfish!).Each interlude is insightful in some way about the role of food in Japanese life. The role of women in this is touched upon too; each time something positive or good happens, somewhere along the line a woman is involved. In fact the film as a whole tells us a lot about the Japanese character, not just how it connects with food.The ending is probably predictable Tampopo's reinvigorated shop becomes a resounding success, but in all honesty, just like life itself, the journey to that point is the most important and interesting thing. And of course, Goro does what all good cowboy heroes do; ride off into the sunset before the end titles, where a mother gives her baby the most simple and pure food of all.I first saw this film nearly twenty years ago and I recalled it as one of my favourite films and time has, I'm glad to say, not been deceptive it's every bit as good as I remember.

This is another one of the classics by a great director that has 13 male votes for every female vote. Obviously, the film-school dropout dorks are out in force making sure it gets rated 8+. In the last week, I've seen both Sanjuro and this for the first time, and I now know why I had never seen them before, They're OK, but not in league with Kurosawa's great flicks. Contrary to the comment that this sometimes admittedly veers close to sappiness but never indulges, BOY does it INDULGE. It feels like they were getting paid for drama per minute. And at 3 hrs long, that is a lot of drama. In fact, there are so many tragic characters and subplots introduced that this actually veers into melodrama. How could it be worth 8+? Explain why Mifune is a minor character for the first 90 minutes. Better yet, lose most of the first hour, including the entire subplot of the mantis woman. Better yet, since she was a stimulating character and the scene where she stalks and attacks is great, put this entire subplot in a separate movie. It'd probably be a classic and Akahige would be improved.

However, after seeing this first movie I immediately came to love the series. Even though it's a PG\/PG-13 series, it's terrific. I have seen all the Harry Potter movies out so far, and The Sorceror's Stone is a terrific beginning to the series.The acting and the atmosphere here is amazing. The whole cast does a wonderful job, and it looks surprisingly realistic for a magic movie. Daniel Radcliffe does a good job as Harry Potter, changing his character as is appropriate throughout the movie. Rupert Grint is good, not to mention hilarious, as Potter's best friend, Ron Weasley. Personally I love Emma Watson's performance as the bossy, clever, book-loving Hermione Granger the best. She doesn't portray Hermione as a complete bossy jerk, but more of a insecure girl who loves to prove herself, and deep down has good intentions and a good heart. Other notable performances are Maggie Smith as professor McGonnagell and Alan Rickman as the somewhat scary, dark professor Snape.I really love how this movie starts off the series. Since it's about young kids learning magic at a school, I didn't know what to expect. The kids did not just sit and learn about philosophy, but they do not turn out to be automatic experts, either. Too often in series people just learning something quickly and suddenly know everything there is to know. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are like average first-year students, each showing particular strengths in different subjects. There is some good action in the movie trolls attacking the school, sports involving flying on a broomstick, and a few good spells.For those who don't know. Harry Potter is an average kid living with his mean, abusive aunt and uncle when he is enrolled in Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. His aunt and uncle disapprove of magic, so he is rescued by Hagrid, keeper of Hogwarts. At Hogwarts he befriends two other students, Ron and Hermione. Throughout the movie Harry discovers what really happened to his parents, what it's like to have friends, and what courage is. At the same time he develops a feud with a cocky first-year student, Malfoy, and tries to keep the school safe from an evil he feels only he, Ron, and Hermione understand. Harry and Ron are close friends from the start of the year at Hogwarts, because they talk on the train. Hermione does not immediately jump in. Overtime she is drawn to them more and wants to be with them more.Get this movie if you can, because it's awesome. I give it a 9\/10. I give it only a nine because it still has some of the rough spots natural to first installment Confusion, lot's of time spent explaining things, less action. However, it had quite a bit of action for a first-part of a series.

Just like probably every other animated Disney feature I saw in my childhood, other than Pocahontas, I enjoyed this one, and can recall seeing it several times. The last time I watched it was just last night, and watching it shortly after watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinoccio, I was mildly disappointed, but fairly satisfied in the end.One afternoon, a young girl named Alice is up on a tree branch, as she is read to from a history book. She is very bored by this book, and finds it hard to pay attention, so she begins to think of her fantasy world. Soon, she sees a talking White Rabbit, who is in a big hurry for some reason! She follows this rabbit into a burrow, and soon finds herself gradually falling down a hole! After she finally gets to the bottom, still following the White Rabbit, she comes to a small door with a living doorknob! After some struggle, she manages to get through, and enters Wonderland, where she sees many strange things that she has never seen before! After a while, she finds that this world is very confusing, and she no longer wishes to be there, but it appears that getting out and back home will be a challenge! Many Disney films have widely been considered masterpieces, and I can certainly give some of them that label myself! However, I personally can't do that with Alice in Wonderland, as I have definitely found some problems that bring it down. The songs in the movie generally aren't very memorable, and some parts are a bit dull, most notably the part with the talking flowers (which includes a very forgettable song). The Alice in this movie lacks a bit in her character and emotions. However, despite those shortcomings, this Alice in Wonderland adaptation does have some amusing characters (such as the White Rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter, etc.), humour, very interesting places that Alice finds herself in, and a fair amount of excitement, all of which it deserves some credit for.Like you would expect from Disney films, this one has a lot of entertain kids with (I know I enjoyed it way back), and has some things to entertain adults with, though maybe not as much as other Disney movies. Overall, Alice in Wonderland is far from a perfect family feature, but if you're a Disney fan, regardless of your age, I think you would PROBABLY find something to like about it.

This film is Frank Capra's best film ever... A statement of this nature tells you how remarkable this movie truly is!! Jimmy Stewart was voted by one magazine as the second best performer ever in the history of Hollywood!! Only second behind Katherine Hepburn, making him rated the best actor in the history of movie making!! While some people may question this assessment of Jimmy Stewart, due to Jimmy Stewart's innocuous Huckelberry Finn disposition, I can empathize with this verdict of Stewart's acting on account of his precisely executed latent tendencies which ultimately resonated into an articulated anger!! Jimmy Stewart's acting is very itemized, and thus, it establishes emotions which are genuine, these emotions relegate Stewart to a vulnerability which was pertinent to the fact that his feelings which could no longer be bottled up inside of him, would make him obtusely erupt!! Donna Reed is in this movie, and her performance is very believable as well!! Lionel Barrymore is extremely adept at playing the role of the ogre (Mr Potter) who is metaphorically writhing in his acquisition of the Baily Building and Loan!! This movie is the classic Christmas movie of all time!!, Miracle on 34th Street and Fantasia as well as any other Christmas movie, do not capture the spiritual camaraderie related to the yuletide association with caring and benevolence that It's A Wonderful Life exemplifies so flawlessly!!What the film It's A Wonderful Life accomplishes is the ideology behind the true meaning of what Christmas signifies... This phrase in of itself sounds very rhetorical, however, with a movie like It's A Wonderful Life such an accolade is the genuine article!! It's A Wonderful Life resembles the movie Best Years of Our Lives in the manner by which a happy ending is attained the hard way!! Often times, we look at our lives and become demoralized at the uneventful banalities which perpetually plague us!! We are depressed at how money dictates virtually everything, and, as was the case with George Bailey, we become trounced by failure and despondence!! Adversities are what make us cohesive, considering that this film was made right after World War II concluded, we as Americans were thoroughly aware of such a fate!! The fatal predicament which besieges George Bailey in this movie arouses occasion for all of the good citizens of Bedford Falls to bond together and realize the importance of caring for each other!! Such a homespun philosophy was anything but an artificial panacea, and with it, Americans immersed themselves into a nationally guarded perspective of good will and compassion!! This film is outstanding!! The talent and the ideological premise to this film, has out-shined virtually every other movie made!! A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned!!! Films which make people feel fortunate are not breaking any rules which compromise the quality of a film!! All of these carefully devised components to this film make It's A Wonderful Life an absolutely magnificent movie!!

Jimmy Stewart's acting is very itemized, and thus, it establishes emotions which are genuine, these emotions relegate Stewart to a vulnerability which was pertinent to the fact that his feelings which could no longer be bottled up inside of him, would make him obtusely erupt!! Donna Reed is in this movie, and her performance is very believable as well!! Lionel Barrymore is extremely adept at playing the role of the ogre (Mr Potter) who is metaphorically writhing in his acquisition of the Baily Building and Loan!! This movie is the classic Christmas movie of all time!!, Miracle on 34th Street and Fantasia as well as any other Christmas movie, do not capture the spiritual camaraderie related to the yuletide association with caring and benevolence that It's A Wonderful Life exemplifies so flawlessly!!What the film It's A Wonderful Life accomplishes is the ideology behind the true meaning of what Christmas signifies... This phrase in of itself sounds very rhetorical, however, with a movie like It's A Wonderful Life such an accolade is the genuine article!! It's A Wonderful Life resembles the movie Best Years of Our Lives in the manner by which a happy ending is attained the hard way!! Often times, we look at our lives and become demoralized at the uneventful banalities which perpetually plague us!! We are depressed at how money dictates virtually everything, and, as was the case with George Bailey, we become trounced by failure and despondence!! Adversities are what make us cohesive, considering that this film was made right after World War II concluded, we as Americans were thoroughly aware of such a fate!! The fatal predicament which besieges George Bailey in this movie arouses occasion for all of the good citizens of Bedford Falls to bond together and realize the importance of caring for each other!! Such a homespun philosophy was anything but an artificial panacea, and with it, Americans immersed themselves into a nationally guarded perspective of good will and compassion!! This film is outstanding!! The talent and the ideological premise to this film, has out-shined virtually every other movie made!! A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned!!! Films which make people feel fortunate are not breaking any rules which compromise the quality of a film!! All of these carefully devised components to this film make It's A Wonderful Life an absolutely magnificent movie!!
