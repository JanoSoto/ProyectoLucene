[{"date":"29 October 2003","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Searchers was one of those movies where at one moment it could have completely lost your attention and then it snatches it back up again with something funny or intense.  It has its good parts and it has its not so good parts.  For instance, the scene where Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) kicks Look (Beulah Archuletta), his Indian wife, down a sandy hill is definitely entertaining and a good part.  A not so good part could be any one of the parts that this reviewer doesn't even remember seeing!   The Searchers was definitely a western movie and it wasn't so bad that anyone should go around saying that it was one of the worst movies ever made. It had a good entertainment value and only put me to sleep a few times!The title of this John Wayne movie fits in with the movie's plot perfectly. The movie is about the struggle to find Debbie Edwards (Natalie Wood) after she had been kidnapped by Comanche Indians at the young age of 10.  The title, The Searchers is referring to two men in particular, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) and Ethan Edwards (John Wayne).  They spend 5 or 6 years searching for Debbie.  They never give up or start putting less effort into the search, even though that's exactly what it is, it's a search.  They don't know exactly where the Indians will be, they have to search for them. They do a pretty good job of it too.The acting in this movie was probably great for the time period it was filmed in.  But for our time it wasn't all that fantastic.  There were some parts where it was pretty convincing, but for the most part any fool could tell that it was just acting and nothing more.  The scene where Lucy Edwards (Pippa Scott) stares straight out the window and slowly lets out a horrific scream had to be the worst acting I have ever seen!  It was completely unbelievable!  It did provide for some entertainment though.John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, the Civil War veteran who comes home at the beginning of the movie, all alone, to his family.  Wayne's character has a very deep hatred towards Indians which doesn't allow him to get along with Martin Pawley (Hunter) very well since he is a half-breed.  He calls Martin a blanket head more than once throughout the movie and that right there is a racist remark.  This reviewer didn't like Wayne's character very much at all.John Wayne's acting job wasn't all that bad.  Most of the time he was either being serious, mean, or loving.  Wayne is excellent at being serious and mean!  There would be times throughout the movie when he would be talking completely calm and then all of a sudden scream at the top of his lungs at somebody.  It was kind of scary.The most memorable character in the film had to be Mose Harper played by Hank Worden.  He was a little loopy in the head and the only thing he really wanted out of life was to sit in a rocking chair by the fire.  He loved to say Thank you kindly.  If this reviewer could have met any one of the characters in the movie, it would have been Mose Harper.The Searchers was your typical Western with typical cowboy and Indian costumes, typical cowboy and Indian music, and the typical cowboy vs. Indian theme happening.  It had a great amount of entertainment and an excellent plot.  The only thing that could have been done better was the acting.If this reviewer had to pick between never seeing The Searchers again or having to watch it at least once a month, she would pick watching it at least once a month.  This movie definitely didn't suck and although it had it's boring parts here and there, it was a good movie.
