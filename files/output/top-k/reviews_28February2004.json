I for some reason do not believe in this, I think a human being will be doing what they do at any age good or bad because they were meant to be.

The actors delivered the best performance they could, but they had nothing with which to work. The two lead characters take turns doing and saying the most asinine things throughout the movie.  You will grow quite weary of them walking up on obviously dangerous situations saying Hello?.  If I see a guy who just almost ran over me on a deserted road throw a body into a sewer pipe, I am not going to convince my sister to go back there with me.  If a psychic accurately confirms incredible things I have witnessed, I am not going to waste time arguing with her.  These two had a number of chances to -- just as they often said -- get out of here but continued to hang around and let the creature find them.  The writer\/director never developed the characters enough for us to sympathize with either of them.  No significant bonding happened between the sister and brother in spite of all they experienced together.  Likewise, the Poho County police didn't lift a finger to help when they were needed most.  They didn't even help when one of their own was in the creeper's clutches.

Had the movie included two wacky cops from South Georgia who 'burned rubber' trying to catch the crazy radical teens on the way to their sex-filled romp at the beach, this movie would have been a hit. And don't forget the happy ending. We wouldn't want the audience to be sad or they may not buy an extra large popcorn.Those of us, North Americans included, who enjoy films with complexity obviously love this one.  What does it mean?  Well...think about it.  The answer is not obvious and fed to you on a silver spoon. It means many things and it may take a few days of thought to understand it. It means different things to you than it does to me.  I watched it last night and I am still learning from it.The title, I think, refers to the scene in the bar where the teen boys are confessing their lack of loyalty.  They are telling one another that they slept with their friend's girlfriends. One boy says 'y tu mama tambien', confessing he had sex with his friend's mom.That's the easy part.  From my perspective, the lady and the journey were trying to teach them about life. The boys were too young to understand it or pay attention, but it was likely they'll grow to understand it later and encounter these same elements as they age.  The lady was trying to teach them about sex and love and living.  The road was trying to show them their past (the boys family came from one part of the road they passed quickly), the militaristic police and opression (many cars stopped along the way with police roughing up the peasants) , the sharing of gifts (the old man giving the boy the hat), death (the small child that was killed on the road 2 years prior to their passing the spot), the passing of time (the long journey), the mystery of life (the mystical heavens mouth was real after all), the local traditions (the town queen festival), the poverty (all around), love and anger (between the 3 passengers), and much more.  Their youth kept them from appreciating it all and in the end of the journey they were overwhelmed and had to get back home in a hurry.Two years later, in the cafe, they seemed to understand a bit more about life and death and they learned that the lady they took on their journey was misunderstood also. The reason she took this journey was to both teach them, but also learn as much about herself before the end of her own journey.

Had the movie included two wacky cops from South Georgia who 'burned rubber' trying to catch the crazy radical teens on the way to their sex-filled romp at the beach, this movie would have been a hit. And don't forget the happy ending. We wouldn't want the audience to be sad or they may not buy an extra large popcorn.Those of us, North Americans included, who enjoy films with complexity obviously love this one.  What does it mean?  Well...think about it.  The answer is not obvious and fed to you on a silver spoon. It means many things and it may take a few days of thought to understand it. It means different things to you than it does to me.  I watched it last night and I am still learning from it.The title, I think, refers to the scene in the bar where the teen boys are confessing their lack of loyalty.  They are telling one another that they slept with their friend's girlfriends. One boy says 'y tu mama tambien', confessing he had sex with his friend's mom.That's the easy part.  From my perspective, the lady and the journey were trying to teach them about life. The boys were too young to understand it or pay attention, but it was likely they'll grow to understand it later and encounter these same elements as they age.  The lady was trying to teach them about sex and love and living.  The road was trying to show them their past (the boys family came from one part of the road they passed quickly), the militaristic police and opression (many cars stopped along the way with police roughing up the peasants) , the sharing of gifts (the old man giving the boy the hat), death (the small child that was killed on the road 2 years prior to their passing the spot), the passing of time (the long journey), the mystery of life (the mystical heavens mouth was real after all), the local traditions (the town queen festival), the poverty (all around), love and anger (between the 3 passengers), and much more.  Their youth kept them from appreciating it all and in the end of the journey they were overwhelmed and had to get back home in a hurry.Two years later, in the cafe, they seemed to understand a bit more about life and death and they learned that the lady they took on their journey was misunderstood also.

It might have been really awful actually, were it not for the pomposity-puncturing posturing of Snipes, off-set by the more serious high-school cool of Stephen Dorff. There are bits which could be further investigated to give the film a bit more inner tension - the continuously bargained co-existent relation between vampires and humans, for example. But really its all about the choreography and special effects - thank goodness someone had the wit to let Snipes inject some wit of his own, otherwise the DVD wouldn't even have got warm. Oh and, rather like a body count in this movie, I've just been told I have to write two more lines to get this comment green lit.

It is probably the best of contemporary Irish films. One of the great attractions is that there are so few recognised actors in it. Almost all of the main characters were chosen for their musical ability. It's also one of those films that makes you smile. For me its message is It's not just that you can achieve something even for a very short time but that you wanted to better yourself. Watch and enjoy! Put on the subtitles if you get stuck!

About three quarters of the way through, I lost interest and turned it off. Requiem for a Dream this is not. Requiem, though very painful to watch, was quite creatively put together, with gut wrenching performances, and characters we could hope for, even though we knew all too well just where they were going. Permanent Midnight is boring and flat, more from technique than material. Too bad. I really like Ben Stiller but a good performance on his part just wasn't enough.
