[{"date":"4 October 2013","score":"","review":" Review of The Perfect StormThe movie, The Perfect Storm by Wolfgang Patterson, had a different ending than what may have really happened. Facts prove that no one really knows what happened to the Andrea Gail because the search for the ship was called off. The Coast Guard called off their search after thousands of miles of searching with no sight of the boat according to the Gloucester Times web page. However, the movie needed to improvise and make closure with the audience. This movie succeeded in doing so as the image it created captivated audiences and it created a realistic ending to an event that no one knows the actual truth as to what happened. The book Perfect Storm also showed the ability to intrigue audiences. The book, written by Sebastian Junger, provided pictures of the actual fishermen that were on board, pictures of the harbor before, during and after the storm, and it provided pictures of the memorial service held for the fishermen who died. It also used an alternate ending to give the audience closure. The author and director both gain from creating an ending because they captured their audience and profited well from doing so. For example, in the movie, the boat Andrea Gail lost radio contact with another boat, from there, the crew of six men got caught up in the storm, and eventually a big wave came in and capsized the boat. This was the image the movie was able to put in viewers heads, instead of leaving the viewers with curiosity as to what really happened to the crew. Another factor that makes the movie intriguing to audiences is the choice of actors for the crew. The captain of the boat is George Clooney who is deemed to be a famous actor with prestigious roles and awards. Also Mark Walberg and John C. Riley were fishermen on the boat, and they also have a well known audience. This allowed the viewers to experience an historical event flipped into a drama containing well talented actors. I argue that the movie was a success financially and emotionally. The movie produced over $182,618,434 while in box office theatres and is still making money off of merchandise to this day. I've experienced movies that were based on true events, and they had rather subpar actors. This is where the director of The Perfect Storm, Wolfgang Petersen, profited due to having well known actors and creating a strong conclusion. Including the well known actors mentioned above, the movie also includes actors and actresses that are attractive figures for the audience. By doing this, the director profited because viewers watch movies to see great endings. The ending of the movie gave the audience different viewpoints to understand and relate to. It not only shows the struggles that the crew has to go through, but it shows the struggles that other characters had too. For example, it shows a family stuck within the storm, and it gives the audience a chance to understand their struggle. Also the Coast Guard and multiple weather stations were involved in experiencing drama of their own. Lastly, the viewpoint of the family and friends of the fisherman gave the audience a chance to experience the same sorrow and morose feelings that the family and friends had. By striking the relationship between the movie and the viewer the director succeeded. He was able to captivate emotional ties between the character's stories and the audience. The ability to do this has led this film to great awards and accomplishments. It won best visual effects in the BAFTA awards and was nominated for many other awards including the Academy Awards for visual effects and best sound. According to boxofficemojo.com, The Perfect Storm placed 43rd on the all time list of total gross income by movies.Overall, The Perfect Storm needed to show what may have truthfully happened to the crew. If the movie failed to create this image, then the audience would have been left curious and no closure would have taken place. The director, Wolfgang Petersen, did a great job in choosing the right actors, a believable conclusion, and developing a story that would leave the audience emotionally tied to the film. This led to an extremely profitable and successful film that actually did a good job of including drama.

In the movie, one of the main characters, Rose, is narrating and telling her point of view of what happened on the Titanic almost 80 years before. Rose was a young, upper class woman on the ship with her aristocratic family. On the ship, she soon meets a lower-class man named Jack Dawson. They met when Rose was considering jumping of the ship and he had no choice but to save her if she did. He ends up talking her down and that begins their relationship. They had many other encounters together where he was in her world, and she was in his. Throughout their many events together, they soon realize they are in love and they cannot spend the rest of their lives together without each other. This dream soon comes to a halt whenever the ship hits an unexpected iceberg. At first it just felt like a bump, but then slowly the ship started to fill up with water and begin the sink, and the chaos became greater as everyone tried to get off the ship or to safety. There were rescue boats on the ship, but the amount of extra boats compared to the amount of people was extremely different. The first people allowed on the safety boat were woman and children, but in reality it was the upper class people who got to get to safety first while the lower class passengers were still stuck in the lower deck of the boat. Rose refuses to leave Jack, so she stays on the ship with him, all the way until it plunges into the ice cold water. Rose finds a piece of wood to lie on while Jack swam beside her in the water. More rescue ships came, but it was already too late for Jack. Rose was on of the few survivors after the ship completely sunk and was able to tell her story to anyone who would listen. In the movie, special effects had to be used to make the ship sink. The quality of special effects used made the sinking ship in the movie look like what was described to happen in the actual historical event.For a movie made in 1997, I think the special effect had very good quality for that time. The movie showed very big details of how exactly the ship sank and how it even broke in half and started bobbing until it was completely submerged in water. The Titanic was said to be called the ship of dreams and the way the movie made the ship look, it really did look like the gorgeous boat it was described to be. The well-known and respected critic, Robert Ebert, talks about the special effects and the animation of the movie and says, You know intellectually that you're not looking at a real ocean liner--but the illusion is convincing and seamless. The special effects don't call inappropriate attention to themselves but get the job done (Ebert 1997). I completely agree with Ebert's evaluation. The special effects were not way too dramatic to draw away attention to the underlying story of Rose and Jack's love, but they were also done well enough that it actually looked like a sinking ship. If the special effect were not in the quality they were in, the movie would probably not have been as big as a hit if the sinking ship looked extremely fake and not believable. Last year, they turned one of the greatest movies into a 3D movie. Since the movie was not originally shot in 3D, it is much harder to turn a 2D film into 3D. Only certain scenes were actually 3D, opposed to the whole movie. Ebert does another review on the new version of the movie and goes on to say, I know why the film is in 3D. It's to justify the extra charge. That's a shabby way to treat a masterpiece (Ebert, 2012). The movie did earn a lot of revenue after it came back into theaters 15 years later and in 3D, which costs more than a 2D film. I agree with Ebert, making this timeless movie 3D almost ruined the entire quality of the movie. This movie was set in 1912, so keeping it in 2D gave it more of the vintage look. Making some scenes 3D really did take away from the overall story of the movie. This was a poor use of special effects, in my opinion, because the original movie already had so much character to begin with. I feel like one purpose of making this movie 3D was to make the audience feel like they were actually on the ship. Though it was interesting to see certain things pop, it really did draw attention away from the original special effects that were already done so beautifully. When looking at the originally movie, the special effects and animation used to make the Titanic look like it was actually sinking, really made the movie just so much better. The story line of two people from different worlds on the same boat falling in love alone was already a hit, but the way the movie reenacted actual events really dramatized the importance of the story line and how the characters had to fight to survive. Without the special effect the movie would not have been the same and it probably would not be as popular is it is. The movie was made in 1997, and it is still talked about and played on television today. Also, in 2012 in was remade in 3D and brought back into theaters making in popular all over again. Some critics may say that the 3D version was better, but most critics will have to agree that nothing is better than the original.

The set-up is intriguing and brilliantly executed.***PLOT SPOILER*** (Don't read the next paragraph unless you want to know the basic plot) A biological accident causes the supercomputer that runs an underground complex to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. This installation is called The Hive. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and a commando force is sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer -- the Red Queen -- to shut down the facility and kill the people. It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies, which may sound totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable, for a sci-fi movie anyway. Milla and the commandos slowly discover the truth. Can they get out alive? ***END SPOILER*** POSITIVES - As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.- The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.- Milla herself is stunning. The entire film she runs around in a red dress with a slit up the side. Her face and expressions are magnificent.- The story itself and the delivery (sets, etc.) ring of brilliance. This is sci-fi of the highest order.- The film features a cool eerie score highlighted by some rocking nu-metal acts.NEGATIVES - Although Resident Evil is original in many ways it's sometimes reminiscent of other films like Aliens and Dawn of the Dead. Hence, some things are predictable; for instance, you know anyone who gets bitten by a zombie is gonna eventually turn into one.- To be expected, the mystery build-up in the first hour is better than the last half hour, which is action-filled. Why? Mindless action with numerous quick edits somehow always becomes boring. Wouldn't it be great if a sci-fi-horror film like this ended in a truly unconventional blow-your-mind way (like the original Planet of the Apes)? But the final sequence makes up for it, sort of. Besides, since the film is based on a video game the slaughter comes with the territory.The film runs 95 minutes before the credits roll.PERSONAL GRADE A- ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"}]
