I wanted to watch one of my movies last night and I picked The Sword in the Stone and rediscovered how much I loved this movie when I was a kid and still love it today. I went on IMDb to see if I gave the appropriate rating, but I was surprised to see that I never did write about it, but I guess better late then never. Sword in the Stone is just a classic treasure that no family should be without but also the film lovers. A wonderful classic story told Disney style and filled with great songs and beautiful animation, how could anyone not fall in love with The Sword in the Stone.The Sword in the Stone appears in London, with an inscription proclaiming that Who so Pulleth Out This Sword of this Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King Born of England. None succeed in removing the sword, which is soon forgotten, leaving England in a Dark Age. Some years later, Arthur aka Wart, a 12-year-old orphan training to be a squire. While accompanying his older foster brother Kay on a hunting trip. He falls into Merlin's cottage, Merlin declares himself Wart's tutor and the two return to Wart's home, a castle run by Sir Ector, Arthur's foster father. There Merlin stays with Arthur to teach him the ways of the world and the magic as well as the intelligence and strength he will need for his true destiny.I think my favorite moment of this film is definitely the battle between Merlin and Mim, since this is one of the rare Disney movies that doesn't have a definitive villain, but I think Mim was a close as you could get. Their battle was epic and absolutely amazing to watch, plus I love the classic sound effects with good old slap stick humor. Also I loved the story when Merlin turned Arthur and himself into squirrels and they were attacked by the lady squirrels was just too cute for words. I know the animation isn't up to par with today's standards, but this is the exact animation that I loved growing up with because the animators seemed to have a love for the film they were making.The Sword in the Stone is a classic Disney film that should never be missed and I can't wait to show my children one day. Disney always had a way of taking classic stories that may not interest a small child and puts action, adventure, romance and wonderful animation into it and made it come to life. I can't believe I hadn't watched this movie since I was a kid, because no film lover should be without this treasure, it's just so excellent and magical, takes you back to a simpler time where we were destined for greatness and the world was at our fingertips.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2011","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I cannot believe I never wrote a comment on The Sword in the Stone, my friends always joke how I'm the ultimate Mickey Mouse since I'm such a fan and I own every Disney movie on DVD.

Well I'm pleased to announce that the Marx Brothers were definitely on the right track (IMO). I remember their old films being shown on TV when I was young and I also remember finding their mad-cap humour very entertaining. It was interesting to see them again quite a few years later to and still enjoy them just as much. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.Rufus T. Firefly has been appointed ruler of the cash-strapped state of Freedonia. This tiny country's benefactor, Mrs. Gloria Teasdale, believes passionately in Firefly's abilities. The ambassador of the neighbouring state of Sylvania, Trentino, wants Mrs. Teasdale's money and will go to any lengths to get it. He has one problem though, Mrs. Teasdale only has eyes for Firefly and to this end Trentino sends in his spies, Chicolini and Pinky. This only causes more mayhem and Trentino ends up insulting Firefly who challenges him and it all ends in a declaration of war! Mrs. Teasdale tries to calm things down but they are determined to fight. I'll leave it there so as not to enrage the Spoiler Police.Of course the stars of the show are the Marx brothers; Groucho Marx as Rufus T. Firefly, Harpo Marx as Pinky, Chico Marx as Chicolini and the lesser known Zeppo Marx as Lt Bob Roland - Firefly's aide-de-camp. They are ably supported by; Margaret Dumont who is excellent as Mrs. Gloria Teasdale, Raquel Torres as Vera Marcal and Louis Calhern as Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania.Now, as a coherent story with a narrative, it's all over the place, but I believe this is deliberately done to keep the story moving. Of course, the story is just a means to get to the next one-liner, or sight gag, but it kind of works. Looking deeper into it, the film has quite a satirical message about wealth and power.

Such a bold statement might require some explanation (which hopefully I will be able to give in this post) and certainly begs the question what makes a film perfect? I believe a perfect film is one that can be watched over and over again a film that you never grow tired of and that whenever is on TV and you stumble across it, you end up watching. A perfect film is one of those where you struggle to pick up one favourite scene, because they're all so good. A perfect film is one of those you really wouldn't change anything about it and where all its elements (story, direction, acting, music, cinematography, editing and so on) come together in a such a way that it's virtually impossible to choose one over the other. Raiders is 30 years, but still shines as if it were made yesterday&#x85; except that it wasn't because, as we all know they don't make them like this anymore. I still remember going to the movie theatre when it first got released (Yes, I'm giving away my age clearly I'm not a teenager!) and being absolutely blown away by it. At the time there was nothing like it (and arguably, that's probably still true today). Ever since then people have been trying to imitate its winning formula, and, needless to say, most of them failed miserably. Just to give you an idea of what I am talking about (and to prove my point), just think of Lara Croft, Prince of Persia, National treasure, The Mummy Trilogy and even those films inspired by the Dan Brown's books well, those are the most successful ones&#x85; Enough said. I won't even go into the list of endless B-movies. Right from the word go, from when the summit of the Paramount logo dissolves into a Peruvian mountain (a Visual device which will become the trademark of the entire series), you know you're in for something which is not only original but clever and handsomely made. What follows that logo is probably one of the best first sequences of any action movies ever made. The mysterious forest, the haunting music, the bloody statue, the group of explorers, the old map, the hidden cave, the pulsating tension, the crawling spiders, the giant web, the deadly traps, the decomposed body, the big scares, the golden idol, the sliding door, the traitor, the whip, the rolling boulder, the French baddie, the wild Hovitos, the arrows, the chase across the fields, the swinging vine, John Williams's raiders theme, the snake on the plane, the jokes breaking the tension and all this is just within the first 10 minutes!!! It is such an incredible edge-of-your-seat beginning that after that the film can afford to launch into a very long scene with some massive exposition And I haven't even mentioned the hero himself, Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford deserves a lot of credits for the success of this film. Who knows what would have happened if Tom Selleck had played the role he was the first choice, after all (I will be eternally grateful to Magnum PI). Harrison Ford manages to make Indiana Jones strong and frail at the same time, funny and sad, invincible and weak. Indy is a hero but he gets hurt, tired, dirty and sweaty. It doesn't matter how far-fetched and over-the-top the action might be, Ford makes it feel real.

Who knows what would have happened if Tom Selleck had played the role he was the first choice, after all (I will be eternally grateful to Magnum PI). Harrison Ford manages to make Indiana Jones strong and frail at the same time, funny and sad, invincible and weak. Indy is a hero but he gets hurt, tired, dirty and sweaty.

He'd be telling me about The Matrix being the real world but not The real world and going into it through phone boxes,and characters with unique sounding names like Morpheus and Trinity and the Agents who are trying to kill them etc. It was a frustrating puzzle trying to make sense of what he was trying to tell me but, By the time the bell had rung and the teacher had called us all in for a remaining afternoon of sitting on little chairs being bored, my imagination had been gripped. I could not stop thinking about it. The fact that The Matrix had a 15 age certificate certainly helped fuel the fascination of Primary school audiences, however as an adult who has now seen it many times it is still, without doubt one of the coolest films to ever emerge from America. It's value lies not merely in the ascetically stylistic characters, locations, weapons,fight scenes, vehicles, set pieces, bullet time (!!) but also in it's huge abstract, philosophical depth. The true meaning of almost every aspect of the film is constantly still debated in internet forums, books, and audience conversation. It is one of those films that turns audience members of all walks of life into philosophers, debating valuable concepts and ideas and enriching conversation. How can we be sure we are not living in a reality similar to The Matrix? is perhaps the most obvious question that springs to mind as a result of watching the film. Personally,as a nine year old boy with an overactive imagination and tenancy to take things a bit too literally, I lay in bed after seeing The Matrix for the first time, having real doubts about the nature of reality. It is very similar to the more recent, Inception in the respect that it can remind you, as a human being, how little you really know about the universe and your place in it. If everything we experience is dependant on our senses, how can we know that our senses are not deceived, missing something,or unable to detect certain phenomenon. If The Matrix was real we would not be able to tell. There is also the question of wherever we would want to leave the safety of the illusion for a harsher reality, or remain in the illusion to escape reality (like Cipher).Without doubt,if we were living in a Matrix like illusion, then the illusion is better for film stars, rock stars, and other social groups than the oppressed working class that Marx describes. Some people would want to exit or shut down the illusion more than others. Another very interesting part of the film is when Agent Smith mentions going to church as part of the experience of being inside The Matrix.If our world was an illusion and religion is a part of our world,does that imply that religion is an illusion. If we woke up, how can we be sure that we didn't wake up in a world where we still don't know whether God is real and we still don't know the true reality of the world we wake up in. Maybe when Morpheus frees people from The Matrix he is really only waking them up from one illusion into another. There are endless philosophical questions and considerations like this that can result from discussing this film. Films that inspire philosophical questioning enrich life with new perspectives to view the world. Films that do this with such uncompromising style, and excitement are quiet rare. It has to be pointed out that The Matrix is not merely a philosophical exercise but on the surface it is also makes hugely enjoyable viewing. In short,The Matrix has everything. The escapism into a science-fictional world with it's own history, Sharp characters, mind blowing stunts, philosophical, and even emotional depth that is displayed through the relationship between characters.

Of course, in the beginning we see that a man is already being indicted and then we make a transition to Fonda, so there goes it is already a mishmash of certainty and uncertainty. In prison, the camera deliberately shakes around a frame with Manny in a close-up; it's like we're agitated in the same sequence that he is in.The drawn out sequences in the interrogation actually keep you inquisitive as to how everybody else is getting on and of course that is the same stick with them - only this time it almost feels implausible not to think it was him, but you're forced to assume he's not, as he is so charitable and shows no signs of wrongdoing; this is where it grips you, even though you have such an inclination as to be forced to think it's not him even though it's largely subject to testifying in the movie, you keep wondering who it is. From that one part where Rose was rigid and was closed up on the camera I thought she exhibited the nerves of a guilty person - and there you go that's just one of Hitch's many tricks!There is a religious theme with a pendent that may be the macguffin to the story and how everything prevailed to justice - I don't know and considering this is the basis for a true story I may be mistaken, but I do know that this was his only way of thwarting his spectators during their accusations of him. Fonda does a terrific job and puts on a powerhouse performance which is largely down to the way he has a glimmer in his eye and a real suspicious side, always beating round the bush, under the spellbound nightmares of his trials. Hitchcock is very attentive to the inkling of his audience and still goes way out to surprise and then it comes to a point where you just traverse through it as it becomes futile even pinpointing - and it's quite clearly illustrated in the movie. The monochromatic color gives it a noir mystic and the music drives the story in with its buzzy and ghoulish theme.The children in this movie, like all Hitchcock movies, are perfunctory in their delivery but then again are scarcely in the movie; however, out of the foreground, they still come off to me as extras or supporting actors and they are all right. Even the one who was a disciple of Mozart and admired him!And even in Manny's attempt for truth, the tentative accounts all unfolds and it is all too tragic. They are conspicuously and indistinguishably alike funny enough; but it's not so akin that you wouldn't believe. Really the disguise is what keeps it very much on a wheel of suspense. About Rose being implicated into the case; I have to say I hoped and begged it wasn't her. And then it all came full circle and when you find out who it is, it's really endearing the way the two faces are edited in the frame from different places; the visages are coincided and morphed into the coalescing of one; it's all from the work of a master.So if you are a fan of Hitchcock this may quench your thirst... if you love true stories, this may peek an eye or if you just like Noir then pick this up.

One of the most iconic personal scenes for me of all cinematic history is Dr. Casares (played by the brilliant Federico Luppi I might add) waiting with a crazed look on his face sitting on a chair with a shotgun in his hands near the end of the film. Just classic. This film almost has a fantasy element to it and don't make the big mistake of judging it as a horror film. Without giving away any of the main plot The Devil's Backbone is one of those must-see films and it is also quite similar to Pan's Labyrinth ,which of course came out later (although I recommend seeing The Devil's Backbone first). This can never be a bad thing but I must say that Pan's Labyrinth is on a league on its own.In conclusion this is one of those films that will have a lasting impression on you.

And what better way to end a trilogy than with a threesome in the making? The three protagonists of this production are Jordan White, interpreted by James Duval who once again conveys all the confusion and insecurities of adolescence, Amy Blue, his sexy girlfriend and Xavier Red, a wild, aggressive and assertive guy they meet on the road.Together they will embark upon a journey that, without a clear destination, will bring forth certain aspects of their real 'selves'. At the beginning of the film, Jordan attempts to penetrate his girlfriend to no avail. But this is not a reference to impotence. It is rather a reaffirmation of what Lacan would denominate the nonexistence of sexual rapport. Amy tries to give directions to her insecure boyfriend about what to do with his penis. Obviously, sexual joy here is phallocentric. But let's not forget that the phallus is a signifier, and even the model of jouissance is bound to be seized in the idiocy of the practice that attests to it. A phallocentric perspective exemplifies the non-rapport in the Other.To declare that the jouissance is phallic is fundamentally to state it is solitary. That clearly explains why is it that Jordan and Amy are unable to consummate their passion, remaining as virgins. According to Lacan, the axiom There is no such thing as sexual rapport obeys to a basically solitary jouissance. When Jordan asks Amy Don't you think sex is totally strange? Just the whole idea of it he is essentially explaining how difficult it is to decode sex in the symbolic order, because sex can neither be translated into words nor discarded as simulacra (which happens very often in postmodern society). Amy then responds I think maybe it's more powerful than we'd like it to be. And she is absolutely right about it.As soon as Xavier enters into scene, sexual dynamics are fiercely disrupted. Xavier is sexually overwhelming, he invades the personal space of the boy and the girl, disregarding gender divisions. When Jordan and Amy are taking a shower together, Xavier looks at them and masturbates. Masturbation is very relevant in The Doom Generation, after all, what could best exemplify the solitary jouissance? Amy describes Xavier as a living support for the sexual organ, and Xavier has no problems in acting as a walking penis, so to speak. He is rendered as the phallus, and because he is the phallus he becomes desirable for Amy and Jordan.According to Freud, the man possesses the phallus, for Lacan, however, the woman can also have it (let's remember that phallus is not a synonym for penis). In both cases, as embarrassment, as lack, a substitute to be looked for, yet essentially, sexuality will be there conditioned, determined. To have the phallus is to be afraid of losing it; to not have it is to seek for it. All this is demonstrated when Amy engages in sexual intercourse with Xavier, thus creating a specular moment, an instance which reflects a previous one, in which Jordan masturbates while he sees his girlfriend and his new friend copulating (dynamics that bear some similitude to Cristopher Munch's Harry + Max, so it's not surprising to see this filmmaker credited at the end).Nonetheless, one of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the feeling of impending doom that permeates reality over and over again. Amy will summarize it in one phrase there is no place for us in this world; whereas Jordan will only inquire ever felt like reality is more twisted than dreams?. The Doom Generation is as surreal as other Araki's films, and it picks up on a certain leit motif present in his cinematographic work religious zealousness and all it entangles. From Amy's mother (a fervent scientologist) to billboards with messages such as The Rapture is Coming (a doomsday of sorts according to certain religious sects as explained in Nowhere) or Prepare for the Apocalypse. Of course, there is also the constant emphasis on 666, the number of the beast; every time the characters buy food or have to pay for something, the price is exactly the same 6 dollars with 66 cents. 6.66. The film is thoroughly filled with what Genet would call paratextual references, here the writing on the wall is very visible, in every wall, in every store and gas station they visit.Reality seems to be seeping down under their very noses, although as Xavier reminds them I saw it on TV so it's gotta be true, right?. But there is little or nothing they can grab a hold on. And this capricious dynamic is reinforced by the fact that Amy is an interchangeable object a (object of desire), as a fast food employee confuses her with an old flame and chases her down, something that also happens with an enraged lesbian, and a gay man. All forms of sexuality (heterosexuality, male and female homosexuality) enable the completion of yet another trio.When Jordan, Amy and Xavier are finally ready for a threesome, something of the order of the real irrupts and dramatically changes everything. A violent group of men captures the protagonists, and threaten Jordan very seriously with removing his genitals. But what could castration mean? A rapport should be posited and established, from a subject of one sex to the phallus, and would not get inscribed by a rapport to the partner sexed differently. This is the value Lacan bestows on the universal allotted to the castration complex. Thus the Old Testament conjectures that Sodom will suit the man and Gomorrah the woman. If castration was metaphorical at the beginning (Jordan's inability to maintain an erection) here it takes a more literal approach, which is only fitting if we consider that sexual rapport for the protagonists will forever be impossible.

According to Lacan, the axiom There is no such thing as sexual rapport obeys to a basically solitary jouissance. When Jordan asks Amy Don't you think sex is totally strange? Just the whole idea of it he is essentially explaining how difficult it is to decode sex in the symbolic order, because sex can neither be translated into words nor discarded as simulacra (which happens very often in postmodern society). Amy then responds I think maybe it's more powerful than we'd like it to be. And she is absolutely right about it.As soon as Xavier enters into scene, sexual dynamics are fiercely disrupted. Xavier is sexually overwhelming, he invades the personal space of the boy and the girl, disregarding gender divisions. When Jordan and Amy are taking a shower together, Xavier looks at them and masturbates. Masturbation is very relevant in The Doom Generation, after all, what could best exemplify the solitary jouissance? Amy describes Xavier as a living support for the sexual organ, and Xavier has no problems in acting as a walking penis, so to speak. He is rendered as the phallus, and because he is the phallus he becomes desirable for Amy and Jordan.According to Freud, the man possesses the phallus, for Lacan, however, the woman can also have it (let's remember that phallus is not a synonym for penis). In both cases, as embarrassment, as lack, a substitute to be looked for, yet essentially, sexuality will be there conditioned, determined. To have the phallus is to be afraid of losing it; to not have it is to seek for it. All this is demonstrated when Amy engages in sexual intercourse with Xavier, thus creating a specular moment, an instance which reflects a previous one, in which Jordan masturbates while he sees his girlfriend and his new friend copulating (dynamics that bear some similitude to Cristopher Munch's Harry + Max, so it's not surprising to see this filmmaker credited at the end).Nonetheless, one of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the feeling of impending doom that permeates reality over and over again. Amy will summarize it in one phrase there is no place for us in this world; whereas Jordan will only inquire ever felt like reality is more twisted than dreams?. The Doom Generation is as surreal as other Araki's films, and it picks up on a certain leit motif present in his cinematographic work religious zealousness and all it entangles. From Amy's mother (a fervent scientologist) to billboards with messages such as The Rapture is Coming (a doomsday of sorts according to certain religious sects as explained in Nowhere) or Prepare for the Apocalypse. Of course, there is also the constant emphasis on 666, the number of the beast; every time the characters buy food or have to pay for something, the price is exactly the same 6 dollars with 66 cents. 6.66. The film is thoroughly filled with what Genet would call paratextual references, here the writing on the wall is very visible, in every wall, in every store and gas station they visit.Reality seems to be seeping down under their very noses, although as Xavier reminds them I saw it on TV so it's gotta be true, right?. But there is little or nothing they can grab a hold on. And this capricious dynamic is reinforced by the fact that Amy is an interchangeable object a (object of desire), as a fast food employee confuses her with an old flame and chases her down, something that also happens with an enraged lesbian, and a gay man. All forms of sexuality (heterosexuality, male and female homosexuality) enable the completion of yet another trio.When Jordan, Amy and Xavier are finally ready for a threesome, something of the order of the real irrupts and dramatically changes everything. A violent group of men captures the protagonists, and threaten Jordan very seriously with removing his genitals. But what could castration mean? A rapport should be posited and established, from a subject of one sex to the phallus, and would not get inscribed by a rapport to the partner sexed differently. This is the value Lacan bestows on the universal allotted to the castration complex. Thus the Old Testament conjectures that Sodom will suit the man and Gomorrah the woman. If castration was metaphorical at the beginning (Jordan's inability to maintain an erection) here it takes a more literal approach, which is only fitting if we consider that sexual rapport for the protagonists will forever be impossible.

And what better way to end a trilogy than with a threesome in the making? The three protagonists of this production are Jordan White, interpreted by James Duval who once again conveys all the confusion and insecurities of adolescence, Amy Blue, his sexy girlfriend and Xavier Red, a wild, aggressive and assertive guy they meet on the road.Together they will embark upon a journey that, without a clear destination, will bring forth certain aspects of their real 'selves'. At the beginning of the film, Jordan attempts to penetrate his girlfriend to no avail. But this is not a reference to impotence. It is rather a reaffirmation of what Lacan would denominate the nonexistence of sexual rapport. Amy tries to give directions to her insecure boyfriend about what to do with his penis. Obviously, sexual joy here is phallocentric. But let's not forget that the phallus is a signifier, and even the model of jouissance is bound to be seized in the idiocy of the practice that attests to it.

Even though I enjoy Kevin Smith's brand of humour (which certainly isn't for everyone), 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' does not match up to their previous works like 'Chasing Amy', 'Mallrats' or even 'Dogma'. The best parts of 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' are the 'Hollywood' sequences and the scene where the spandex clad women steal diamonds. This movie spoofily spins off Smith's earlier works (except 'Dogma') and it brilliantly parodies numerous Hollywood flicks. There are plenty of cameos where the actors are spoofing themselves. The first hour or so, is loaded with toilet humour but much of it is quite boring mostly because of Jason Mewes's poor acting. Kevin Smith, Ben Affleck and Will Ferrell are brilliant. Shannon Elizabeth is quite a treat as the sexy nerdy jewel thief who is voluptuously supported by lesbian sidekicks played hilariously by Eliza Dushku and Ali Larter. Needless to say, while the humour is crude, vulgar and slapstick, there's also plenty of satire.
