It starts of with the Emperor Kuzco voiced by David Spade who invites a simple peasant named Pacha whose voiced by John Goodman into his empire. He then tells Pacha that he must soon move out of his house and make way for Kuzco's new water park. Devastated Pacha soon returns home. Later that night the antagonist of the story Yzma voiced by Earth Kitt, invites Kuzco to dinner as a gesture of no hard feelings for firing her. Their plan however is to poison him, but Kronk voiced by Patrick Warburton grabs the wrong potion changing Kuzco from a human to a llama, and so the adventure begins. This is a great leap from modern day family films in which it chooses a lesser known piece of history dealing with the Mayans and Aztec people. Its a humorous storyline mixed with bits and pieces of action. The cast of characters are great and you also get a feel for them as the plot progresses. Kuzco and Pacha then become the two protagonist as they must put aside their differences and work together to get back to the palace. This teaches children valuable lessons such a team work and friendship and how important they really are. The style and music is great to, The Emperors New Groove really delivers and is a must see for the younger audiences. I give this film a 90% simply because of the originality and the wonderful storyline that this film has.

But then something happens and some dinosaurs die and the world around them begins to change for the worst. Many soon become separated from one another and then must put aside their differences and work together to find their families once again in the Great Valley. This movie is a great treat for the kids because it has dinosaurs and is widely popular with younger audiences. It even has subtle and not so subtle values in it as well. It instills teamwork, determination, and bravery. And by using all of those things, there isn't anything standing in your way.

However, chances are that most video stores that aren't too ashamed to have a cult section would be smart enough to put it there. That's because this film is not scary by any means. It is disturbing,DISGUSTING, and funny, making it most deserving of the cult label.

There are very few movies that are 90% an experience for the senses that hasn't been witnessed before. You would have a hard time convincing me of another film that has used more fake blood than this production. Braindead has found every bodily way to be disgusting without displaying sexual organs and for that, we should probably thank the lord. The climax with all of its blood and prosthetics becomes a bit overkill - pun intended. If you check out this film let me give you some advise * It is going to be disgusting and you should keep in mind that this is in order to create shock value and it is funny simply because it is disturbing and vomit inducing. * Make sure you watch it with someone else who doesn't have a bad stomach and isn't Christian.

I hate people who review movies with such a negative and trashy attitude towards them, honing in solely on the negative. I avoid this as much as possible, always looking for the positive in a movie, but some movies just have no positive side to them, despite their acclaimed status. Every once in a while you just have no choice but to write a really cynical and really negative review. That said, I Am Sam is about Sam Dawson, a mentally retarded man who is fighting for custody of his seven year old daughter, Lucy, who has been taken away from him by what the movie shows us is the evil, cold-hearted, and oppressive Child Protective Services. Sam gets help from a lawyer named Rita, who learns the true meaning of family value from Sam in the most Hollywood formula way possible. This movie attempts to emotionally move you in the most obvious and intrusive ways possible. It is a truly horrible cramming of ideals down our throats.I Am Sam is a film that can go one of two ways. It can be a very human story brimming with emotional prowess, that moves its audience to the brink of tears with its sincerity and heart. Or it can end up being a pathetically formula film with motives so blatantly obvious it's not even funny. I Am Sam is a poster child for the latter and it had me frustrated and put off within thirty minutes. This movie makes it ridiculously easy to be on Sam's side of the court case for his child and it removes all realism the story could have had and replaces it with unrealistic archetypal heroes and villains. There's nothing human about this film and the majority of the characters don't feel like actual characters and are present to just serve one story development purpose. For example, the people who are against Sam are made out to be heartless evil people who have no contempt for love or positive emotion. They also seem to constantly forget the fact that Sam is mentally disabled, showing no empathy or compassion towards the situation he is in. Sam's relationship with everyone in this film feels either heavily exaggerated to force a point, or formulaic and predictable.That brings me to another point surrounding the character of Sam. Robert Downey Jr. put it perfectly in Tropic Thunder. You never go full retard. Sean Penn went full retard and came home empty handed, losing out to a much more deserving Denzel Washington for Training Day. I know the full retard thing is a joke, but it actually has a lot of truth to it. Penn plays the character of Sam to such an extent that he is completely detached from reality. He is unable to understand 95 percent of what is happening around him making him really seem like someone who can't properly function in society. I found myself actually questioning whether it was a good idea for Sam to keep his daughter with a higher mental capacity than him at the age of seven. I almost wanted to side with CPS, but the movie's over exaggerated idealistic ways made that impossible to do so without feeling as evil and anti-retard as the CPS are made out to be.Who knew that a potentially heart warming and moving film could produce results that not only don't meet expectations, but are the makings of a truly awful film. This movie had me emotionally invested for maybe twenty to thirty minutes. After I realized what a force fed bout of lies this film was, my interest deteriorated quickly. This is a prime example of Hollywood's lack of creative ability. Do not let these two hours go down the drain watching this movie.

This movie makes it ridiculously easy to be on Sam's side of the court case for his child and it removes all realism the story could have had and replaces it with unrealistic archetypal heroes and villains. There's nothing human about this film and the majority of the characters don't feel like actual characters and are present to just serve one story development purpose. For example, the people who are against Sam are made out to be heartless evil people who have no contempt for love or positive emotion. They also seem to constantly forget the fact that Sam is mentally disabled, showing no empathy or compassion towards the situation he is in. Sam's relationship with everyone in this film feels either heavily exaggerated to force a point, or formulaic and predictable.That brings me to another point surrounding the character of Sam. Robert Downey Jr. put it perfectly in Tropic Thunder. You never go full retard. Sean Penn went full retard and came home empty handed, losing out to a much more deserving Denzel Washington for Training Day. I know the full retard thing is a joke, but it actually has a lot of truth to it. Penn plays the character of Sam to such an extent that he is completely detached from reality. He is unable to understand 95 percent of what is happening around him making him really seem like someone who can't properly function in society. I found myself actually questioning whether it was a good idea for Sam to keep his daughter with a higher mental capacity than him at the age of seven. I almost wanted to side with CPS, but the movie's over exaggerated idealistic ways made that impossible to do so without feeling as evil and anti-retard as the CPS are made out to be.Who knew that a potentially heart warming and moving film could produce results that not only don't meet expectations, but are the makings of a truly awful film. This movie had me emotionally invested for maybe twenty to thirty minutes. After I realized what a force fed bout of lies this film was, my interest deteriorated quickly. This is a prime example of Hollywood's lack of creative ability. Do not let these two hours go down the drain watching this movie.

Taryn Manning has the best character here. She goes into darker territories with herself, and she did a convincing job. Dan Arkoyd appears in a few scenes, and felt out of place. Justin Long appears in a role i'm sure he likes to quickly forget.Bottom line. It's a decent movie, and dare I say rather fun? I will indeed. I have seen a lot worse then this, believe me.

In World War Two Hollywood got fully involved in the propaganda movement, and movies made after the war looked mainly at reliving the heroism involved. By the height of the Vietnam war, Hollywood was more independent and the war was widely criticised. During wartime this was manifested in numerous examples of veiled anti-militarist commentary, but very little actual reference to the conflict itself. And even when the war finished, it was a couple of years before pictures about it started to be made, but when they did, the Vietnam war movie soon became a prolific subgenre in its own right. Coming Home was one of the earliest, and yet it remains one of the most honest and heartfelt. Made the same year as Oscar-sweeper The Deer Hunter, it dispenses with that picture's before-during-after structure, to focus purely on the aftermath.Coming Home has as its director the very direct and compassionate Hal Ashby. I don't know how Ashby would have handled a Vietnam action movie &#x96; he never really did anything so ostentatious &#x96; but his total focus here on the humanity of the situation makes the lack of some contextualising violence superfluous. Ashby does not use many extreme close-ups, but he is a master of a kind of shot that nevertheless makes a character dominate the screen, with Spartan backgrounds and few camera movements. He doesn't draw our attention too much to the undignified position of the veterans, and their wheelchairs seem almost coincidental in the shot, although he has a great knack of dropping in a reminder so subtly it looks unintentional. For example, there's a shot where Jane Fonda is wheeling along a paraplegic who is complaining about the lack of information he's been given about his situation, and just as he comes fully into view, we see her stick a bowel and bed sign on the end. Zoom lenses were overused in the 70s and their use often looks corny today, but Ashby spares them for moments when you are so totally absorbed in the scene you are unlikely to notice. There are a lot of reaction shots in Coming Home, often while a character continues speaking offscreen, for example during the pool-playing veterans conversation in the first scene, and Ashby really helps to make this a picture about reactions and reflections.This straightforward focus on people pays off in the superb acting performances. What's great about Jon Voight and Jane Fonda, is that their performances are so uncomplicated, unlike much of what passed for good acting at the time. They don't have the obviously improvised look of Robert De Niro or the deliberate gestures and mannerisms of Meryl Streep. They simply believe in their characters and act out the script. The result is that they come across as totally believable. Voight brings through such an amiable personality, and Fonda has such honesty to her every action, that we forget the potential awkwardness or inequality of a relationship between a disabled person and an able-bodied one, and simply see two people falling in love. The only over-the-top performance in the picture is that of Bruce Dern, but it works very well to make this character slightly ridiculous, giving a quality to his rage that is pathetic rather than truly threatening.And after all it is Bruce Dern who is really the most tragic figure of this story. The screenplay by Nancy Dowd, Waldo Salt and Robert C. Jones is bookended by his leaving for Vietnam and his coming home. In the opening credits, the recording of The Rolling Stones' Out of Time seems to imply that he's the poor, deluded one. He may be a bit of a pompous fool, and the antagonist as far as Fonda and Voight's affair goes, and yet he becomes curiously sympathetic. While Voight's character makes his psychological recovery, Dern becomes a victim, not so much of the war but of military life.It's this kind of humanist insight that makes Coming Home what it is. In 1950 there was a movie with a similar plot called The Men, which looked very frankly at the harrowing circumstances of a man made paraplegic in World War Two. Coming Home however does not go into the gory details of disability or even particularly highlight the indignity of Voight's condition. The heart of the movie is in scenes like Voight crying to Robert Carradine's guitar playing, or getting some cheeky kids to help him with his shopping. Even the scenes of protest against the war are not nearly as polemical as in Born on the Fourth of July, but more a sombre reflection of the times. It is less like The Men, and more like Vietnam's version of The Best Years of Our Lives. It's a picture about social cohesion, and the healing of wounds after conflict has ended.

His sister wasn't being cared for, she was being forced to beg for money to fill the pockets of Ahmed, his gangster employer. He wasn't getting a new home built next to Ahmed, it was a lie to give him a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow to work towards. Possibly worst of all, once he finally forgives his wife, Azra and accepts that the child she is pregnant with is his, she dies in child birth. So he's left with no wife, a missing sister, and no new home to move his Grandmother into, basically it was all for naught. In the end of the film he exacts revenge on Ahmed by using his powers to do something good for once kill Ahmed at a party by telikenetically stabbing him with a fork. At the end of the film though he could have easily thrown Ahmed's new wife away from him or at least taken the gun taking himself out of harm's way, but instead he chooses to take what's coming to him as a form of atonement for the corruption and greed he'd undergone.

Possibly worst of all, once he finally forgives his wife, Azra and accepts that the child she is pregnant with is his, she dies in child birth. So he's left with no wife, a missing sister, and no new home to move his Grandmother into, basically it was all for naught. In the end of the film he exacts revenge on Ahmed by using his powers to do something good for once kill Ahmed at a party by telikenetically stabbing him with a fork. At the end of the film though he could have easily thrown Ahmed's new wife away from him or at least taken the gun taking himself out of harm's way, but instead he chooses to take what's coming to him as a form of atonement for the corruption and greed he'd undergone.

There are several times throughout the film where Perhan, a young Romany boy with telekinetic powers, displays his abilities to defy the laws of physics. At one point in the film Perhan lifts up an entire home. He also uses his powers to show off to the girl he loves. Sadly, the allure of wealth draws him into a world of crime and filth where he is surrounded with the dregs of society. The story is one of redemption. Slowly but surely Perhan becomes disillusioned to the world he had misunderstood, he begins to see it all for what it truly is, a facade. His sister wasn't being cared for, she was being forced to beg for money to fill the pockets of Ahmed, his gangster employer.

Just as intimidating, though, maybe more, are those features of Jurassic Park that determine it as the meteoric forerunner of a mint entertainment kingdom. Even while seizing the imagination of its enormous audience, this film sets the stage for the amusement park rides, sequels and souvenirs that assure the Jurassic Park event would continue for over a decade.The calculation of this cinematic marketing takeover didn't seem like it could be surpassed, because a whole age bracket had become infatuated with dinosaurs, turning the fossils of long ago into the monolithic props of the '90s. This at times almost unbearably intense thriller is still today a riveting, worthily scientific story of a classified theme park, branded for the age throughout which dinosaurs existed.

The coolest character in Crichton's story, wry chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, is among various scientists taken to Jurassic Park to examine it before its opening. Faced with the seeming foolproof environment of this mechanized paradise, Malcolm is incredulous. He repeatedly refers to applied mathematics as a means of indicating that supposedly faultless representations have a way of toppling once they contend with the real world.Theoretically, this plot is custom-made for the talents of the man who could buy everyone on Hollywood's Power List, merging the alarm of Jaws with the state-of-the-art parable of E.T. and Close Encounters, and sure enough including the trial of constructing the dinosaurs themselves. In a few key scenes equaling the fright rate of Jaws, the difference is that this film's dinosaurs tread on its humans both literally and metaphorically, however persuasively sympathetic and amusingly distinctive the cast is. They show just for concise interludes, yet the they rule Jurassic Park in every sense. Remarkably fluid and realistic, they set an exorbitant benchmark for the still budding CGI. However, thinking about how those effects were pulled off aren't prone to arise while the film's in progress. The key to the dinosaurs of this undeniable pleasure is that they form a conquering fantasy. We believe we've hung around in a dinosaur-filled realm.That realm, on an island nearby Costa Rica, is the innovation of John Hammond, a tiresomely cheery gray eccentric who enlists Drs. Grant and Sattler as members of a party presumed to give Jurassic Park its stamp of support. But a quaint thing occurs en route to the Tyrannosaurus pen. Thanks to an business saboteur attempting to appropriate dinosaur embryos, power within this programmed theme park is deactivated. Enormous, unpleasant, ravenous creatures begin to roam free.Helming the dinosaurs' exploits is Spielberg's forte, and the professional dreamer's excitement is unmistakable. He has an immense party with every single roar and shudder indicating the advanceing threat, as when Malcolm notices a mud puddle tremble. He also hurdles to the test of composing inspired duels, as in a tremendous sequence where brutal velociraptors hunt Hammond's two grandchildren through the outsized kitchen of the visitor's center. Anybody can show a battle, but it takes Steven Spielberg to portray just how the pots and pans might go soaring at the thump of a velociraptor's tail, or how the children might mislead their cunning assailants.

When it's dinosaur dinner time, Spielberg sidesteps obvious gore, getting a superior quiver out of showing farm animals that are left near the famished creatures and swiftly vanish. To give the velociraptors a fitting initiation, he starts the film with a character whose upper body stays seen while the rest of him is being accosted off screen, a la Jaws.

Watching this movie in 2011, it's clear why his career floundered after The Deer Hunter. Here is a movie with no sense of story or even character. We move from scene to scene and the film's ongoing motivation seems to be to stage something that looks neat.Thunderbolt never recovers from its opening sequence. Clint Eastwood is seen as the preacher of a small Idaho church. Jeff Bridges, at the same time, is a leather pants-wearing huckster that makes off with a used car. The character we later learn to be Dunlap enters Eastwood's church and shoots at him in the middle of a sermon. Clint runs off into the field behind the church and is picked up by Bridges in the stolen used car, who runs over Dunlap for good measure. And just like that, Bridges and Eastwood are a team.This may be good enough for some people, who are quick to label the merely absurd as poetic, but try another adjective nonsense. From the get-go Thunderbolt lets us know that it really has no interest in being coherent or grounded in some kind of reality where people behave with any reason. Let's just make a movie where neat stuff happens, irregardless of what's happened 10 minutes before or after.Case in point- later on, Clint and Jeff are hitchhiking. They are picked up by a guy who appears to be drunk and has a raccoon in his front seat. As soon as they are in the car he proceeds to drive all over the road until they nearly crash. Upon getting out of the car, and decking the driver, the duo finds the trunk of the car full of rabbits. The whole sequence stands apart from the movie, adding neither humor or insight. But I guess it seemed cool to Cimino and company.BTW, save the 70s filmmaking sensibility arguments. As if every complaint about incoherent storytelling (which this is) is coming from someone too programmed by super-obvious narratives like old TV shows to appreciate something that is diffent.

It is a testament to good story telling as it is over 2 hours in length yet you don't realize it. I'm always a fan of a movie where I don't have to say, I wish I had that time back. I also noticed how Kusturica reaffirmed that everything has a purpose in a movie. One possible example of this is that Perhan's uncle has an affinity for imitating Charlie Chapman. At first this seems like a method of character development &#x96; basically showing that the uncle, through all his faults has a softer compassionate side. As the movie progresses Perhan and his uncle sleep with a woman and she becomes pregnant. My original thought was that the child must be Perhan's and all the talk to the contrary is just plot buildup to spur our hero along his journey.

Since that remark, every single cheap horror for me is Coffins from Hell !(Dead Heat) has many original ideas that do impress. For instance it's a buddy-cop movie, the era's fashion, yet not wholly the usual type; it uses the lovely frame creating something unexpected with sci-fi horror. We have 2 different cops, one is a dead on a mission to know who killed him, limited by just 12 hours rest in this life (a D.O.A effect, with already dead lead !). Plus it's the only buddy-cop movie I know where the 2 leads are dead by the end ! There is so precious side in which we follow a dead lead that didn't succeed at having a wife, son, or love, and now the salvation he has is dying not before catching whoever killed him, and destroy his evil. I was about deeming it some reading for the contemporary age's human since he's materialistic, desperate and excessively degenerating (meeting the skeleton in the mirror was inspiring moment). The thing is all of these ideas do impress.. however separately.There is no production, or decent one at the least. The direction is shameful at times, delivering mostly a C movie. The somewhat diligent special effects were wronged between both the production and the direction. Casting (Treat Williams) was devastating, stripping the movie from its power; giving it such an emotionless mood. He looked, moved and talked like a REAL DEAD MAN. Thank god that he became less dead in his next works ! (Vincent Price) was painful, being a corpse in a suit. (Joe Piscopo) was in the wrong role; the man is a comedian, a hell of a good one, so what is he doing here in the first place ?! See how he must constantly show us his *sudden* arms' muscles even by taking his jacket off, for no reason, at the villa ! I laughed at the moment of Kill this guy, would you? at the end; (Piscopo) there performed the zombie whether unconvinced or mocking at himself ! I didn't catch exactly how this movie kills the already killed people (by electricity ?!). The script's third act was a hoax; the lead's friend, (Piscopo), disappeared suddenly, (Lindsay Frost) died hastily, the lead discovered the killer forcedly, and the killer just confessed everything easily ??? And guess what, the movie's title is terrible, it fits more a buddy-action parody ! Hence, with all of the above, this luxurious, so proud of itself, orchestrated music score represented a weird irony, deepening the movie's campiness ! The already realized seriousness fits comic strips. And compared to the story's potentials, it's woeful. Furthermore, while the movie mourns for its hero's dilemma at certain scenes (like in the library) or moments (seeing a meteor), the characterization exerted no effort to do it effectively. Think what if he was made as Mr. Do Right from the start who understood too late that he must be irrational insensitive and crazily violent to get justice done in this world, or leave it with a bang anyway?! Here's an entertaining movie that wants to be a bit serious but doesn't know the way how ! It tries to evoke some lovely points in its references; (Darren McGavin) from the TV milestone show, concerning supernaturalism, (Kolchak  The Night Stalker &#x96; 1974), and (Vincent Price) from endless B movies as an icon of horror.

It is said to many viewers and reviewers that he decides to stay aged three because of mankind's awfulness and madness, but at no moment before this story with the drum little Oskar watches this crazy world, everything bad happens later with the coming of the 2nd World War and other bad things that this character makes. To say that he's innocent is just silly. He's a diabolical creature that resembles Hitler in a way, immature figures who every time things doesn't happen in the way they want they scream higher and higher, and do bad things (Oskar will be responsible for many deaths through the film). And a creature coming out of the hell because he reminds of stories of angels who felt from the sky to become powerful among humans (Oskar fells from a ladder and after that he'll no longer grow, and someone needs to explain to me since when felling from stairs makes you no longer grow? I fell from a ladder when I was a child and that didn't changed a thing in me).For those who say that The Tin Drum used metaphors to show the horrors of war and Oskar represents so many things well, you're all wrong. These things wasn't presented this way. What does playing a drum means? What does the spitting change means? Why this boy is so special? He's not, he's annoying, inexpressive with a dangerous look in the eye (a look that reminds of Hannibal Lecter, Alex DeLarge and actor Bud Cort) and all I could think of was that I wanted to slap him in the face and say Grow Up!. It is a very boring film, that even with two hours and a few minutes of running time it seems to go forever, and I had to divide the film in so many parts to absorb the whole thing to find that it didn't had nothing so special except some original and shocking scenes like the eels stuck in a horse's head found at a beach (the most disgusting thing you're gonna see in a non horror film) and then Oskar's family ate those eels; the first part of the story which was a little bit interesting (the opening is fantastic telling Oskar's grandmother story). Volker Scholendorff's film disappointed me big time! I heard so many favorable things about it (but I confess that I was blindfolded in terms of knowing what the story was, I only knew few things away) including the awards this film earned. And here's a reminder, awards don't mean that much. To think that this mess won Palm D'Or at Cannes (in a tie with the amazing Apocalypse Now) and a Foreign Film Award at the Oscars (in a year that Germany's best film was The Marriage of Maria Braun recognized by German critics as one of the best of that period and to think that Rainer Werner Fassbinder never was nominated) is unthinkable! It is the worst film ever awarded at the Foreign Film category. Not just this film shows how awards are almost meaningless, jewels like E La Nave Va, Pixote, Vargtimmen and all Kieslowski films are all outstanding works of art that weren't nominated for an Oscar and those films had so much more to tell, to show, to stay in our memories, and if you haven't seen them skip The Tin Drum and go see them! Trust me, it's all good.There's so many wrong things with this film that I cannot say which was the worst but perhaps the concerns on under age sex scenes (which caused many problems with future releases in certain countries). Nowadays this film is totally incorrect with those moments, I dare to say that Schloendorff became a phedofiliac figure in filming those things (it's not graphic, but it certainly makes you feel bothered). I haven't read the book in which this was adapted and I don't think I will, it is such a pointless and bad story that I don't wanna see it twice.
