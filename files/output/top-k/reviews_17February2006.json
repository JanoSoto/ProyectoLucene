After the deal goes smoothly, Manni waits for his flame-haired statuesque girlfriend Lola to come and pick him up. However, for some reason Lola does not show and Manni is forced to take the subway. While on the subway, a vagrant bumps into Manni and almost simultaneously a couple of security officials board the car. Following his gut instinct, Manni quickly disembarks the subway, however, he soon realizes that he has forgotten the bag of money. Hurrying back to the subway car, Manni is prevented from entering the car and the vagrant claims the money as his own.A short time later, Manni calls Lola and demands to know where she was at the time she was supposed to pick him up. He then tells her that he is a dead man unless he or she can somehow come up with 100,000 Marks before noon when Manni's boss, Ronnie, comes to claim the money. Bursting with adrenaline and fear, Lola begins to run both to prevent Manni from doing something outrageous and to get the 100, 000 marks from her father. It is at this point that the film starts to become interesting. Cutting a beautiful figure as she races through the German cityscape, the viewer is able to witness the futures of several minor characters whom Lola encounters through a series of quick still frame images. To make this concept even more interesting, the twenty-minute segment is shown three different times with slight changes. However, these small changes make for drastic changes in the lives of people that Lola encounters. One person, a bike thief, is accosted in one scene only to meet the love of his life at a hospital while in another he becomes a vagrant.

It struck me then as a very entertaining film with an interesting concept. However, now after studying film and literature for a few years in graduate school, it has become apparent to me that while the film has become a must see for a number of hipster crowds it does hold a number of themes that are quite profound, especially the importance of chance in ones life.

When I saw the opening sequence of the movie, my thoughts were that this was going to be a great and inspirational movie. The reason for my thoughts was because of the actor Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman been in great movies and performed excellent acts, but in this movie his character is disappointing. He gets into his character very well, making you believe he was the tough principal, but the storyline and how his character is portrayed in the movie was terrible.Lean on Me begins with Joe Clark (played by Morgan Freeman) in a well run Eastside high, being transferred out. It continues many years later, with Clark in a good school, teaching. Then we get an updated look at Eastside High, which has become a troubled high school where violence and drug-dealing are facts of life and no learning take place. Joe Clark is brought back to Eastside to turn this situation around. He was made principal and decided to gather all the druggies and troublemakers on stage and expel each of them. He then orders every person in the school to learn the school song, and if they didn't, they would be suspended or expelled. He insulted teachers in front of his students and demanded instant obedience.The characters in the movie were played by good actors, such as the girl named Kanesha (played by Karen White) who showed the most emotions and acting skills of all the students. Sams (played by Jermaine Hopkins) was also a pretty good actor, the comedian of the movie. Many of the characters progressed changes, and as we waited for Joe Clark to under go a personality change, he never does so. Instead he stays as an arrogant bully.The director was trying to make the movie inspirational, about how a man defined as crazy can make changes to a terrible school. How children can be disciplined from being animals and changed into humans. How sometimes breaking the law can help keep people safe. And how you are responsible for your own actions. But I believe many of these themes were not shown or made believable. For example in a scene where Joe Clark was at a parent conference ranting and raving about how they were going to pass the test as if they were at a spiritual sermon. And I am not convinced that any kind of learning can be done under Clark. Discipline is not the same as intimidation.Joe Clark is a seriously troubled man. He never changes into a better person and always demanded obedience. He never seems to help his students study for their exam and he fires teachers who disagree with him on how he runs the school. Overall this movie is terrible and show no inspiration.

The 19th century romantic hero was always a doomed one. The romantic characters long for something larger than life. The frailness, lightness of things is unbearable to those sensitive beings. This is why romantic stories typically end with the death of their heroes. Romanticism is the opposite of Hollywood, as there is no happy end. The epitome of a romantic story is for example Romeo and Juliet, where death is preferred to an impossible love story.Because such intense feelings are a threat, some people try to escape them by taking nothing seriously. For example, Tomas (Daniel Day Lewis), a young surgeon living in Prague in the late sixties. He is a perfect womanizer, but he never sleeps together with any woman, because he instinctively refuses any attachment. Such is also sensuous Sabina (Lena Olin), his favorite mistress and best friend, whose utmost erotic weapon happens to be... a bowler hat.When Tomas is called for an operation at a small country spa, he seduces a young ingenuous waitress named Tereza (Juliette Binoche), but is not aware that she does not take things as lightly as he does. Bored to death with her provincial life, Tereza longs for something larger than life. She is vulnerable, sentimental, attaching. When she shows up by surprise at Tomas's apartment in Prague one evening, he lets her stay. He is trapped.Neither of them suspects that they are living an intense moment in a crucial place. This is Prague, Czechoslovakia, the Eastern Block. But the winds of change are blowing in general enthusiasm, and Czechs believe that they are about to create  socialism with a human face. Encouraged by Sabina, Tereza becomes a photographer, and captures on film all the small daily life scenes, the beauty and uniqueness of every moment. Tereza's caring love can't stop Tomas having affairs with other women, much to her disarray. As she finally can't take it anymore, she decides to leave. But as she steps out on the dark streets, it sounds like an earthquake is coming. The Soviet tanks are entering the city. The reconstitution of Prague's invasion in this movie is extraordinarily intense, even more so as clips of the real events are included in the footage. Those few moments alone are strong enough to make this long movie worth seeing. Tomas, Tereza and Sabina exile themselves to Geneva. Sabina has an affair with a married Swiss man, who doesn't like bowler hats. As he eventually decides to leave his wife for her, she is very shaken, but she disappears. No attachment. It's lonely to be free. As for Tomas, Switzerland can't stop him either playing Casanova. Tereza still can't stand it, and she suddenly goes back to the land of the weak. But I said it, Tomas is trapped. He can't live without her. He can't help following her back to Prague, although it's clear there is no future for them there anymore. The story is an adaptation of a novel by much praised Czech novelist Milan Kundera, and it is one of those cases when the movie is more intense than the book. Whereas the movie is highly emotional, the book's tone is dry, cold, almost clinical.Made by American director Philip Kaufman, this picture is European in every way. It captures perfectly well the old world nostalgic atmosphere of Czechoslovakia. The music score by Czech classical composers is gripping, sometimes melancholic, sometimes frantic. The lead actors are giving their all, and this film is certainly among their best performances for all three. The supporting cast also has some big European names in it (Erland Josephson, Daniel Olbrychski, Stellan Skarsgård). Cheerful performance by Czech actor Pavel Landovsky, who personally lived the Prague events. Here, he appears as a jolly and solid peasant with a pet pig called Mephisto, who follows him just everywhere, even at wedding parties!Tomas and Tereza's pet is a she-dog called Karenin. She is the symbol of their love. They adopt her at the beginning of their relationship, take her together to Geneva, but as she escapes, Tereza takes her along back to Prague. As Karenin gets ill in the end, they make her a lethal injection so that she doesn't suffer. Pretty much what will happen to them too.And well, I never knew bowler hats could be so erotic!

Laura is also really cautious around her overbearing and creepy father. She also seems to get weird visions and nightmares on top of things, so her life is pretty complicated and she is a pretty disturbed teenager.

Winner of The Saturn Award for Best Music at The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films; The Brit Award for Best soundtrack at The Brit Awards and The Independent Spirit Award for Best Original Score. Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and film editing. I have never seen the Twin Peaks television series before, but I really wanted to see this film because I figured I wouldn't have had to have seen the TV show seeing as this is a prequel and I also wanted to see the film because I love the films by the film's writer\/director David Lynch. The film is hard to describe in many ways because like so many of David Lynch's films it is very unusual and is sometimes hard to figure out. But I was intrigued by this movie and I liked the character's dialog and the eeriness of the town and the different people who live there. The film is very well crafted and put together and I like how David Lynch was able to put together such an atmospheric and stylish film. Also to write a movie this interesting and off the wall takes the genius of a great writer and director such as David Lynch. I was thoroughly captivated by the film and entertained. I was also fascinated by this wonderfully unique journey into this odd little town with odd little characters and settings. A truly unique film experience and another hit for David Lynch.

In fact I posit that the interview with Anthony Shaffer on the DVD is more entertaining than the whole film. Mankiewicz was a talented man and so was Shaffer, and so were the actors, but this is dated. It's talky, easy to figure out, and mostly something for fans of theater, Mank, and Olivier and Caine. The editing is particularly jarring, with quick cuts of inanimate objects inserted rapidly, something David Lynch does much more poetically in his work, most notably, Twin Peaks. This would never be filmed today, unless it was for Lifetime, with the leads changed for women and the script tightened, and reworked. It's a rambling old dinosaur of a play\/script - it thunders along kicking up dust and then heaves its last breath and lays there wheezing on the ground, leaving this viewer wondering if it ever should have been translated to film. I'm sure it worked quite well as a stage play but in the cinematic day and age of Fight Club, The Sixth Sense, and The Others, it's old and musty and easy to figure out, (does anyone not know that's Michael Caine as the Inspector Doppler in the second act???) and if it does fool you, it's only for a second and not to very great effect. Deathtrap, also with Caine is a subtle retelling of this tale, only tighter, and with a woman character added. And both Deathtrap and Sleuth borrow Heavily from Diabolique.

Director Richard Lester is to be commended for successfully capturing all of the excitement and joyful hysteria of these times for historical posterity. For anyone new to The Beatles who's looking to discover what they were all about, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the perfect place to start. It showcases the four at the height of their early powers, before the psychedelic experimental period began and the latter breakup took its toll.Screenwriter Alun Owen spent some time with the Fab Four in late 1963, when a phenomenon christened Beatlemania was descending all across Great Britain. He began to get a good idea of their individual personalities and what he wanted to write for a proposed film which would start production sometime in March, 1964. Even more appropriately, the Beatles' world-astounding popularity soared still further in the interim, after they set foot on American soil in February of '64 and became household names. The market was ripe for this film, which it was decided would show the rigors of a typical day in the life of the band at the peak of their stardom. The resulting motion picture was funny, clever, delightful and of course, musical. John Lennon and Paul McCartney penned several songs for inclusion in the film, all of them winners and two of which easily became #1 hits (Can't Buy Me Love as well as the title tune, which was actually made-to-order overnight after producer Walter Shenson asked for a song called A Hard Day's Night which could run along with the credits). The film is very British, and the decision to photograph in black and white nicely compliments the aura of England. The Beatles are shown traveling from gig to gig, performing music, doing interviews, trying to outsmart legions of adoring fans, and generally trying to have a good time amidst all the insanity. While the Beatles themselves were not professional actors, they hardly had to be as they were essentially just being themselves, albeit exaggerated caricatures John the sarcastic and witty one, Paul the professional lady's man, George the quiet cynic, and Ringo the lovable but mistreated clown. Elder British comedian Wilfrid Brambell was also cast as Paul's meddling very clean old grandfather, and is often humorous to watch, getting involved in all sorts of mischief, though perhaps the necessity of his character being added to the formula would be open to debate.A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a special account of a very wonderful, if fleeting, moment from our entertainment history.

Quite why this is I don't know as, like many films of its ilk, horror sequels, Blade 2 tries to give us everything we saw in the first movie multiplied by 10! It succeeds in this limited goal, but, in my opinion, fails to make a good, simple, coherent or fun action film.The original Blade was not without its faults and the sequel endeavours to address them. One dimensional characters, failures of plot and a rather weak ending are all details that made the first movie fun but not quite the finished article. Anyone who's seen the final fight in Blade will know exactly what I'm talking about. Unfortunately, in an effort to rev up an already fast paced, hardcore action flick, the director of Blade 2 has gone a bit far...Since the Matrix, wire work has been done to death so it is to Guillermo del Toro's credit that he tries to do something new. Unfortunately, as with the third Star Wars prequel, the blending together of CGI and real time action fails in two ways the fighters are neither balletic, nor do they appear human. Here, in Blade 2, we have fights that seem more like a computer game than a film, both in how they look and, equally jarringly, in how the stunt-men\/animations move.Added to this is an unexpected, new found compassion from Wesley Snipes' Blade. Whereas in the first film he'd draw his sword once his firearms were depleted of ammunition, this time he actually fights multiple adversaries with his pig-sticker firmly sheathed! Now maybe the resolution of his mother's death at the end of the first movie made him feel a little bit better about vampires in general, but he's still supposed to be hunting and destroying them for crying out loud... not touching them up.Similarly, his collection of toys, read weaponry, has suffered a great deal from sequelitis. Whereas before he had cool, retro guns and the occasional unusual tool, now he has silver coated pistols, bizarre ultraviolet grenades, spear guns that fire a bolt of silver at umpteen thousand metres a second and weird, spinning, bladed things which seem to be vampire seeking and capable of turning corners...Now I must admit to liking it when a film takes a moment to explain what weapons the protagonists are using. Lethal Weapon's comparison of hardware is a great explanation of the two cops characters. In Die Hard, when Karl pulls out his rifle, we get the indication that now he really means business... But in Blade 2 there's an almost fetishistic manner to the way various guns are talked about and the character who builds most of these weapons is both incredibly irksome and very poorly explained. Plus it begs the question why would someone as friendless as Blade hang out with someone as annoying as Scud? It also made me wonder what happened to the female doctor from the first movie. I don't know if I just missed it but I didn't hear a reason for her absence. Nor did I hear an adequate one for the presence of a guy who did not survive Blade 1...Other characters have also appeared in the interim and few of them are any good. The story behind this film is that some sort of super ugly vampire has sprung up (Luke Goss playing to type) and the normal vampires need our friend Blade to sort him out. This he goes about doing with the help of the Blood Pack, a bunch of what we're led to believe are the hardest of the hard in the vampire world.You could've fooled me. Not only are the Blood Pack less than intimidating, they're also incompetent, badly acted and more than a little unintentionally humorous. One also has to wonder why the producers forked out for Donnie Yen, one of Hong Kong's top action stars and a genuinely thrilling martial artist, to be part of the Blood Pack only to have him do absolutely NOTHING IN THE WHOLE FILM! I mean come on! This is the man who's three fights with Jet Li (across two films) are perhaps the greatest martial arts moments EVER! The thought of Yen, Snipes and a decent choreographer had me practically salivating from the off. When it became clear it wasn't coming I was more than a little miffed. I was also more than a little sickened. Blade 2 is not for the faint hearted and, unlike the original, is well worth its 18 rating (in the UK). The mutated, or re-mutated, vampires are not pretty in any way shape or form and they only get worse as the film progresses.So I hated this film from beginning to end, right...? Well, the answer to that is no! Although it has a great many flaws, which I've taken a somewhat unfairly savage delight in highlighting above, Blade 2 does some things well and some even better than the original. There are powerful fights, stronger dialogue, a few genuinely 3-dimensional characters and a twist or turn here and there which, although not exactly unexpected, are handled, in both the build up and the execution, with aplomb. Del Toro deserves credit for fashioning a solid, if occasionally unnecessarily extravagant, Friday night movie that ticks many of the boxes marked 'A Good Time.' Like the first the ending is a bit weak and there are far too many unintentionally humorous moments, but overall Blade 2 is a cracking film that, to my mind, is not bad at all. I still prefer the original but, while I can hardly offer unconditional praise, I would suggest that if you liked the first you'll probably enjoy the second.

Now maybe the resolution of his mother's death at the end of the first movie made him feel a little bit better about vampires in general, but he's still supposed to be hunting and destroying them for crying out loud... not touching them up.Similarly, his collection of toys, read weaponry, has suffered a great deal from sequelitis. Whereas before he had cool, retro guns and the occasional unusual tool, now he has silver coated pistols, bizarre ultraviolet grenades, spear guns that fire a bolt of silver at umpteen thousand metres a second and weird, spinning, bladed things which seem to be vampire seeking and capable of turning corners...Now I must admit to liking it when a film takes a moment to explain what weapons the protagonists are using. Lethal Weapon's comparison of hardware is a great explanation of the two cops characters. In Die Hard, when Karl pulls out his rifle, we get the indication that now he really means business... But in Blade 2 there's an almost fetishistic manner to the way various guns are talked about and the character who builds most of these weapons is both incredibly irksome and very poorly explained. Plus it begs the question why would someone as friendless as Blade hang out with someone as annoying as Scud? It also made me wonder what happened to the female doctor from the first movie. I don't know if I just missed it but I didn't hear a reason for her absence. Nor did I hear an adequate one for the presence of a guy who did not survive Blade 1...Other characters have also appeared in the interim and few of them are any good. The story behind this film is that some sort of super ugly vampire has sprung up (Luke Goss playing to type) and the normal vampires need our friend Blade to sort him out. This he goes about doing with the help of the Blood Pack, a bunch of what we're led to believe are the hardest of the hard in the vampire world.You could've fooled me. Not only are the Blood Pack less than intimidating, they're also incompetent, badly acted and more than a little unintentionally humorous. One also has to wonder why the producers forked out for Donnie Yen, one of Hong Kong's top action stars and a genuinely thrilling martial artist, to be part of the Blood Pack only to have him do absolutely NOTHING IN THE WHOLE FILM! I mean come on! This is the man who's three fights with Jet Li (across two films) are perhaps the greatest martial arts moments EVER! The thought of Yen, Snipes and a decent choreographer had me practically salivating from the off. When it became clear it wasn't coming I was more than a little miffed. I was also more than a little sickened. Blade 2 is not for the faint hearted and, unlike the original, is well worth its 18 rating (in the UK). The mutated, or re-mutated, vampires are not pretty in any way shape or form and they only get worse as the film progresses.So I hated this film from beginning to end, right...? Well, the answer to that is no! Although it has a great many flaws, which I've taken a somewhat unfairly savage delight in highlighting above, Blade 2 does some things well and some even better than the original. There are powerful fights, stronger dialogue, a few genuinely 3-dimensional characters and a twist or turn here and there which, although not exactly unexpected, are handled, in both the build up and the execution, with aplomb. Del Toro deserves credit for fashioning a solid, if occasionally unnecessarily extravagant, Friday night movie that ticks many of the boxes marked 'A Good Time.' Like the first the ending is a bit weak and there are far too many unintentionally humorous moments, but overall Blade 2 is a cracking film that, to my mind, is not bad at all. I still prefer the original but, while I can hardly offer unconditional praise, I would suggest that if you liked the first you'll probably enjoy the second. Just don't show it to anyone who doesn't like seeing the details of a person's internal anatomy...

Hitchcock is at his best building up the positive and elegant side of the character by enhancing the details--the expensive jewelry, the lady ensuring her hair is in place before receiving visitors, the humanist care taken to inform the valet that she would not be having her dinner, etc., etc. The build-up of the character within a few minutes of reel time for the viewer is considerably intelligent right up to the loud slamming of the cell door and the effect it has on the inmate (Hitchcock's own phobia?).The second sequence that is unforgettable for me is the camera zooming in on Ann Todd's naked shoulder followed by the lecherous Charles Laughton caressing Todd's hand hidden away from her husband's vision, leading up ultimately to Todd's rejection of Laughton's advances. What is of consequence is not the performance of Todd or Laughton, but Hitchcock's sequence of visuals deftly edited to enhance the effect.A third unusual image of the film is the introductory shot of Louis Jordan. This is the only film in my memory where a character is introduced without the least shred of light falling upon his\/her face--his legs and hands are quite visible, but not his face.Finally, the meetings in the jail between Valli and Peck smolders without a kiss or a physical touch. In my view, the performance of Valli is outstanding.

I would recommend this movie to anyone, and do quite often, and hope that more people take the time to sit down and take in this masterpiece. ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport"},{"date":"17 February 2006","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Tootsie is that rarity, an extremely funny movie that doesn't drop down to the lowest common denominator. This is a story, that while somewhat off the wall is believable. The characters' motivations are plain as day, from Michael\/Dorothy taking on a feminine persona to work in the soap, to Julie and Sandy's relationship to Michael\/Dorothy. Dustin Hoffman is at his peak in the dual role, Jessica Lange is beautiful as Julie, Terri Garr is sweet and loyal as Sandy, and Charles Durning as fantastic as Les, Julie's Dad and Dorothy's suitor. The supporting cast is also top notch, featuring Dabney Coleman as the smarmy soap director, George Gaynes as a hammy soap doctor, Geena Davis in her big screen debut as a soap opera ingenue, and Sidney Pollack as Michael's agent among others. Bill Murray is hilarious as Michael's roommate, who helps with his deceptions and disguises, even though Bill didn't want a top billing. There are several hilarious scenes, my favorite is the one where Dorothy forces John Van Horn (George Gaynes) to look at her instead of the teleprompter. If you're looking for a real comedy that won't insult your intelligence, this is one for you.

I gave it a chance and actually laughed in a few places because the exaggeration and over-the-top political incorrectness appealed to me.Tim Curry and James Woods do a pretty good job in their scenes. But their performances indicate that the director was looking for clichés and slightly stilted delivery as part of the humor. Having said that, this movie may offer one of Tori Spelling's best career performances.These kinds of movies seem to be a hit with teenagers and college kids, and I always try to rekindle my youth by watching them. I admit I laughed, but then I wondered why I had. Still, I give the Wayans brothers credit for getting a laugh out of me in the first place.

This is a stunning film debut for the writer\/director. The dialogue is convincing. The pacing is superb. My personal favourite scene is that of the restaurant, where Gary (Winston) tries to maintain a cool exterior but simply emphasises how utterly devastating the impending arrival of Kingsley is. Ian McShane is also surprising as the all powerful, twisted crime lord. There are some surreal sequences here which are not to everyone's taste, but I think it actually adds to the realism of the rest of the film.
