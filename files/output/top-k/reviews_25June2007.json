It sounded like the perfect springboard for a biting comedy, and since it was directed by Harold Ramis and starred Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in the respective roles, I thought it couldn't go wrong.But when I finally did sit down to see it, I must admit I was somewhat disappointed. It never quite fulfils the potential of its very intriguing premise. Its ironic that Analyze This came out the same year as The Sopranos, an equally like-minded TV show. I'm not sure which one premiered first, but The Sopranos is everything AT isn't. There is more psychological insight and edgy, scathing material in a single episode of The Sopranos than there is in the whole 100 minute running time of Analyze This.Its not an unlikable film. Its pleasantly diverting and quite engaging, but this type of storyline really needed a much sharper touch. And I'm afraid Harold Ramis is not up to the task. Not to criticise the man. He can be a fine filmmaker when the need arises. He did after all direct the supremely entertaining Groundhog Day, which is my personal favourite comedy of the 90s. But with his follow-up Multiplicity, he took the idea of a cloning comedy and it only worked for about three quarters of the way through. Analyze This is an even lesser film.De Niro plays Mafia boss Paul Vitti. When a close friend of his is gunned down by a rival family, the shooting stirs up a few ghosts from his past. Now he's suffering anxiety attacks, and he's having trouble performing (and I don't just mean killing people!). If his rivals find out that the Godfather's gone soft, it could mean the end of him. He needs help.Crystal plays Dr Ben Sobel, a psychiatrist bored with his patients' same old problems. He's about to get married to Laura (Lisa Kudrow), a pretty TV anchor. But when he accidentally crashes into the back of another car driven by a couple of Vitti's lackeys, its an encounter that will change his life forever. Because Ben is the unfortunate chosen to be Vitti's shrink.Now Ben has the unenviable task of getting to the bottom of Vitti's deep seated neuroses. Which includes dredging up his troubled childhood, sifting through emotional barriers, and having to put up with a Mafia Don as your best friend.Its a shame that Analyze This only goes for the obvious stereotypical route. Because there's quite a subversive idea at the heart of it. While I was watching the film, I was thinking of alternatives not taken. Ideas not followed through. Promise only skirted around.There are occasions where you can see the potential to this comedy coming to the surface. But it never boils over. Billy Crystal gets dragged into the world of organised crime, but the comic material is only gently amusing when it could have been blackly satiric. Like the scene at the end when Ben has to pretend to be an organised crime figure. And its hardly the funniest thing in the world to watch. Despite Billy Crystal's best efforts.And as for Robert De Niro, he doesn't do too badly in the part. Actually that's a little cruel. He is fairly amusing in the part. De Niro's talents as a comic performer have always been unappreciated. And a lot of his counselling sessions with Crystal are the high point of the entire film. I love the scene when he chucks Ben into a pool filled with sharks because he steps out of line!But Analyze This is still not everything it could have been. It makes a lot of obvious references to gangster films, and it even parodies a famous scene from The Godfather, but even that's not as amusing as it should have been. Although the scene when Vitti confronts his demons in the middle of a bloody shootout completely oblivious to the carnage around him works quite well.And one major point in the film's favour is the late Joe Viterelli's character, Jelly. Vitti's right hand man, he makes sure things run smoothly for his boss, he knows his moods and his needs, and he's a sympathetic ear for anyone who's willing to listen. His very presence in the film is enough to warrant an additional star. He is the heart and soul of the whole endeavour.But I still came away from the film wanting more. I was expecting more, and it just wasn't delivering. Instead we get things like an annoying subplot with Lisa Kudrow whose marriage to Ben is constantly interrupted by Vitti's problems. She adds nothing to the film. What the film really needed was a director like Martin Scorsese to inject some real anarchy into the setup. In fact I can't think of a filmmaker more suited to this type of material than him. When he makes comedies, he has a real knack for drawing out black, gallows humour from the most ordinary situations.Analyze This is OK every now and again, but it hardly sets the world on fire. An oddity for a director of Harold Ramis' talents. Its better than the utterly pointless sequel Analyze That, but really you'd be a lot better off buying a season of The Sopranos on DVD. That way you can see how that series gets right what Analyze This gets so wrong.

The first ten or fifteen minutes are a great example. Few words are needed yet volumes of emotion are communicated through those scenes. Another - later - example is where Jack and his father are in the park when it's snowing. The weather seems to exaggerate the raw, emotional pain Jack is going through but no words are needed because the viewer knows exactly what he is feeling.The scene where the grief hits Jack is very poignant - he has been almost in a trance until then, trying to carry on as normal and yet what finally gets him in touch with his grief for Sarah is the almost ordinary combination of her lipstick on the wine glass and her voice on the answerphone. He tried to be so prepared, so involved in his wife's pregnancy but never came close to being prepared for the real outcome.I hate to say it, but there are points during Jack's early mourning period where the character comes across as what I believe non-English people think of the stereotypical Englishman - blocking out any emotion. Perhaps this is a disadvantage of the story starting when it does - we don't get any idea of what he was like before his wife Sarah was pregnant. The baby next to the sleeping Jack is an interesting metaphor. At that point, both are helpless in their own way, both only in tune with their own feelings, but baby Sarah at least has the excuse of not knowing any better. Jack's selfishness is entirely self-induced.There are some interesting attempts to explode stereotypes, which I think should be applauded. The characterisation of Jack's boss Anna is interesting - the assumption that just because she is female, she will be more sympathetic would be natural but she comes across as so work-driven that she almost becomes heartless. I think Jack is a bit overwhelmed by Anna, perhaps too much so - there are moments when she is quite cutting and when Jack would be right to correct her. There is a curious comparison with Amy, who - although superficially like other females in that she cooes over Sarah - is sufficiently vague at first that she doesn't even notice which sex baby Sarah is. Jack also tackles another himself over the issue of whether he can use the nursing mothers' room to change Sarah's nappy.In keeping with the theme of stereotypes, it is interesting how the opinions of the other characters try to influence the main ones. Jack's mum thinks Anna is outwardly great for him when she is really a selfish character, while Amy - who is a far kinder person - is written off as a dreadful American girl. The baby alarm worked rather well as a plot device - it's an overlooked but very useful piece of equipment. There are quite a lot of twists and turns in this plot - I think most are an intricate combination of clever writing and artful camera angles - but a lot of the plot development hinges on the budding relationship between Jack and Amy and when and how he treats her as a nanny or as a friend. It is obviously a grey area for them.On the surface, this film looks to be just your typical British romantic comedy but this one has some features that make it satisfyingly substantial. In terms of basic romantic plot it is broadly like Four Weddings and a Funeral, but unlike that film it is deeper and the characters are better written and investigated.

Withdrawn to the interior of the continents, the human race keeps advancing, reaching to the point of creating realistic robots (called mechas) to serve him. One of the mecha-producing companies builds David, an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings, especially a never-ending love for his mother, Monica. Monica is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who remains in cryo-stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. David is living happily with Monica and her husband, but when their real son returns home after a cure is discovered, his life changes dramatically. A futuristic adaptation of the tale of Pinocchio, with David being the fake boy who desperately wants to become real.This has a good story but the execution of it was more of a mess than anything really brilliant in most Steven Spielberg's films.

Still being new to Silent Films, I wondered if this would hurt the overall experience. But to my heart's relief, I found myself mesmerized immediately by Metropolis, and then I yearned to return to Nosferatu and Cabinet of Dr. Caligeri (and break out my Hector Berlioz CD, but that's another story.) There's something fascinating about the surrealism of the film &#150; it places plot and logic on a secondary tier, and gets away with it by packing the frame with its energetic dreamlike sights that generations of films would mimic. It gripped me right away with its strangely distorted images of clearly artificial cityscapes, machinery grinding away at impossible angles, the laboratory that clearly inspired Frankenstein, and imagery of an endless flow of workers marching in a steady unenthusiastic rhythm through a gate to start their shift while another equally lengthy line of workers all but crawls out of the bowels of Metropolis.Later workers are shown operating perfectly symmetrical machinery in a choreographed sequence where they throw their bodies against the different walls of their control consoles. Later still, we see a man moving clock-like hands to match the blinking lights with an intense expression on his face as though the fate of the city depends on this bizarre procedure. What possible purpose could this job (or any of the jobs we've seen) serve? To fill the frame with an abstract, rhythmic, and visually interesting action. Nonsensical like a dream, but equally as enchanting.Speaking of enchanting, Brigitte Helm provides the central focal point around which the entire plot revolves, playing both Maria who will unlock the city's salvation and also the faux-Maria (created by the villains) who will inspire its destruction. Both Marias are identical in everything except in body language. And I loved the exaggerated visuals cues Helm gives to clearly define the two separate characters so there's no question of whom we're observing &#150; Maria's angelic gentleness contrasted with the sharp distorted movements and unnatural postures of her mechanical impersonator.My two favorite images of the film feature each of the Marias. The first comes when the true Maria is imprisoned while Rotwang schemes to give the machine-man her face. The scene opens with a close up of Maria in frame-right, and she's staring up at a window where her freedom lies. The window, itself, is out of frame; however, the light from outside is cast against the far wall in frame-left. The light just traces the far side of her face, leaving most of her visible features in shadow, and within the eyes of this poor caged creature lay both tragedy and, strangely enough, peace. It's a remarkably simple image, but powerful in its paradoxical serenity.The second features Helm as the faux-Maria when she's introduced as the new exotic dancer. The floor of a raised platform opens up, and she ominously ascends, clothed like some exotic queen with a half-moon headdress and flowing robe &#150; clearly dressed up like a doll for the pleasure of male viewing &#150; and photographed through halo. Strangely, the image could almost be heavenly. Almost. But this Maria contrasts so sharply with the true Maria, the pure Maria, that it resonates with the sinister intentions of the Joh Fredersen and the additional layer of scheming provided by Rotwang.Rotwang. The mad scientist who would ascend to such an iconic status that he would single handedly (no pun) create a cliché that would influence mad scientists from Strangelove to Emmett Brown (Back to the Future) to Dr Wiley (the MegaMan video games.)

I had to keep repeating scenes and repeating scenes. At one point, Trevor Howard is leaning against a cross-shaped tombstone. Howard is wearing a black leather trench coat, a fedora, a thin mustache, and a facial expression cooler than a gin and tonic.Howard is asked, Can you tell me, uh, who's uh... And Howard says, Fella called Lime. And the zither score jumps in.It's a moment that in any other movie would just be a throw away, but in this movie it is so intensely well played, so cool, so stylish, I had to keep repeating it and repeating it to savor its brilliance.Okay, there is a plot here. Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has been doing naughty things in Vienna after World War Two, when the city is divided between American, French, British, and Russian powers.His friend Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) shows up to work with Lime, and gets tangled up in shady doings, mysterious characters, and international intrigue, including British officer Calloway (Trevor Howard) and Lime's moll Anna (Alida Valli), who is Czech, but trying to pass as Austrian, to avoid being handed over to the Russians.But the plot and characters are secondary here. The Third Man is really all about style, and its style is awesome, untouchable.Yes, it does get a bit precious -- the lights, the shadows, in each scene are as carefully crafted as if each scene were a painting. And yet it still has power. The Third Man has the wide-open and yet claustrophobic, urban and yet utterly remote and isolated look of a nightmare. There are shots that, in and of themselves, just make your hair stand on end, make you want to scream.And yet there are moments of laugh out loud comic relief.And then there is the zither score. If you know nothing else about The Third Man, you probably know about that score.The zither mocks scenes and audience. The music at a burial is jaunty; it's a dance tune. That brilliant creepiness, with the weirdness of an aural clown with a painted on smile -- but the clown is strangling a puppy -- just underlines the movie's themes of criminality, treachery, and betrayal.There are scenes here that no one who loves movies should miss. You have to see the very first appearance of the man in the shadows -- that man with the cat on his feet. The cuckoo clock speech on the ferris wheel. It is beyond brilliant, and genuinely deep and profound, if horrifying.I have long thought that the classic scene in Lawrence of Arabia where Omar Sharif takes forever to enter the shot is the best ever scene of a character entering a shot from a great distance, but in The Third Man there is a scene where Valli is far from the camera, and walks toward it, slowly, through an avenue of trees, as leaves fall on her -- stunning.Film students will tell you all about the impact of German expressionism and Dutch angles ... but I can mostly just say how much this film knocked my socks off.Why not give it a ten ... I wish that some of the characters had been more fully realized. Joseph Cotton never stopped being a cypher; I wished he had had a bit more substance.This is not the case with Harry Lime.

And here she is dancing, singing, acting, talking, smiling and moving and that is more than enough for me.Cinema is the greatest watchable art, because with it you can see all of that incredible beauty. And really it's forever. I have read about this movie for a long time before I finally got to watch it in 2006 (my friend download it from the net with Singin' in the Rain - 1952..God bless him). So you've got to imagine how craving I was and for years to watch this movie. And to tell you the truth anything by MM is worthy, yet in this one SHE, more than the movie itself, was ultra-worthy ! Simply Marilyn was at her best shape at it, being the best of it as well. Nothing in this movie was as high as Miss Monroe's fantastic voluptuous body and fiery sexuality. As for me I'm totally crazy nuts about the MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY number.. OOHHHHH.. The music and lyrics of Cole Porter, the moves of my Marilyn, her voice, her hair, her lips, her blue sweater and her black pantyhose..All of that and more is pure sexy sexy sexy. Listen to her French Moi? mon coeur est à papa or You know, le propriétaire ..This makes me feel the heat indeed ! and as for Marilyn's dancing it can strike and blow your mind utterly. Although her Booty is not a main point as it was in Some Like It Hot - 1959 but it is so active in here ! So as her legs which are an outstanding entertainment apart, she was perfectly curvy (the perfect curvy woman is the word). And when it comes, at the number's end, to her kiss to one of the dancers so it is something over the top (any top), extremely sexy and ahead of its time (I discovered in the movie's original trailer that there is another unused kiss for the same situation; watch it, IT IS a treasure). In fact the movie, even if partly, oozes sexual boldness; just remember the outrageous dancing of the showgirls, some of Marilyn's obvious sexual moves at MHBTD and the movie's title; I bet it annoyed a lot of conservative people back then. The jazz mode of the number moved me highly, yet nothing was like its big finish where MM gave the sudden kiss, winked to us, went back, held the pole and opened her legs with the light off...At that point I've got all the magic of Marilyn Monroe's hot sex. I know that she never made a sex scene in her movies (simply it was the 1950s and 1960s or The Age of Innocence) but even if she did...It would've never ever been as sultry as this. Though all of this fuss is nothing when you watch her at the Heat Wave number of (There's No Business Like Show Business) six years earlier, which is the hottest sexy dance in the history of cinema.. But that's another story!!All in all, when the MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY is over the movie itself for me is over also. You may watch the movie for one time, but you'd watch and re-watch that number for countless times, I can tell you that ; being exclusively Marilyn's ultimate show in color. To end my review I just search for any words to put right my true feeling for that shot in the beginning of the dance when Marilyn opened her legs then downed to the camera whispering in shivery low voice BOYS! ..OHHHH!!..I find no words at all!! P.S I hope that one day the ex-spice girl (Geri Halliwell) makes a remake for this song, she is the best to do a job like this.

There really wasn't anything that they really needed to add to make the Ghostbusters II fresh and original. So there was no bothering with new material, they just kinda stuck with what worked in the first movie.The other thing is that the first movie was geared towards adults, but in the time between the first and second movie there was the Saturday morning cartoon series The Real Ghostbusters. So in light of that success, there had to be a taming down of the naughtiness that fueled bits of the first movie. Basically they had to make a PG sequel out of a PG13 movie. They also had to, at least to a degree, put the characters of the movie version in line with the characters from the cartoon. I think that if it weren't for the animated series, this movie might never had been made and certainly would not have had much success at all.But if you can deal with both those setbacks, the movie isn't completely terrible by any means. Just mediocre. Bill Murray looks bored throughout, but in an odd sort of way that actually kinda works for Peter Venkmann. Everyone else has fun with the movie, and the foursome are a much more balanced ensemble than the last time (I like that they give Ernie Hudson a little more to work with than the first movie). The whole evil painting scenario is a little ridiculous and as a villain isn't too bothersome, but Peter MacNichol makes a fun and memorable not-quite-so-evil lackey sidekick. For the most part the gags work and baby Oscar is adorable. I loved this movie as a kid and it has those late 80s nuances - like the Bobby Brown theme song - that make it kitsch-y enough to take me back.

There really wasn't anything that they really needed to add to make the Ghostbusters II fresh and original. So there was no bothering with new material, they just kinda stuck with what worked in the first movie.The other thing is that the first movie was geared towards adults, but in the time between the first and second movie there was the Saturday morning cartoon series The Real Ghostbusters.

The reasons for this are many, but one of the most important has been the ambiguous way James uses his ghosts to explore the psychological issues of his characters. This ambiguity has led to countless debates about the nature of the plot, as the way James wrote the story has allowed many different interpretations about it over the years. Obviously, this has resulted in the fact that most of the many adaptations to other media that have been done about the novel presents a different way to see the story. Fortunately, the 1961 movie, The Innocents, is somewhat an exception, as this masterpiece of 60s Gothic horror manages to keep the seductive ambiguity of the novel.In The Innocents, Deborah Kerr plays Miss Giddens, a young and unexperienced governess hired by a wealthy man (Michael Redgrave) to work at his country home and take care of his nice and nephew, as he is unable (and has no interest in) to take care of the two orphaned children. After her arrival, she meets Mrs. Grose (Megs Jenkins), the housekeeper, and Flora (Pamela Franklin), the young child now under her care. Everything seems to be working perfectly until she receives the notice that the other kid, Miles (Martin Stephens), has been expelled from his school. After Miles returns from school, Miss Giddens will begin to experience strange events around the house, hearing and seeing eerie apparitions that make her suspect that the house is haunted. The strange behavior of the two children will only increase her suspicion that someone or something wants to take control of the innocents.Following Henry James' short story in a very faithful way, the screenplay by William Archibald and Truman Capote manages to capture the exact same atmosphere of ambiguity and paranoia that impregnates the pages of James' classic novella. In fact, one could say that the writers take the story's ambiguity one step beyond as they joyfully play with every element the story has to offer supernatural horror, psychological drama, and even a subtle yet strong nod to the voluptuous sensuality of Victorian sexual repression. The plot twists and turns as the story unfolds, toying with every possible explanation for the strange events that are taking place, but never giving too many clues, wisely keeping all the mystery and suspense till the very last moment. Finally, the superb development of the characters is another element that makes this movie one of the most powerful tales of horror ever put on film.Two years after directing the internationally acclaimed Room at the Top, director Jack Clayton once again shows off his talents to transform literary works into classy films that remain faithful to the essence of their sources. Focusing entirely on Miss Giddens and the two children, Clayton stays in line with the ambiguous tone of the script, creating a claustrophobic character-driven horror based almost entirely on suggestion, leaving to the audience's imagination the nature of the haunting and the source of the those unspeakable horrors that seem to take place in the house. And of course, the star of Clayton's masterpiece is without a doubt the impressive work done by cinematographer Freddie Francis, who using black-and-white photography creates an ominous atmosphere of dread that's frightening in all its beauty.While Francis's cinematography is definitely a highlight of the film, The Innocents wouldn't be the same without the remarkable performances done by its cast. Deborah Kerr's acting as Miss Giddens is a powerful dramatic Tour De Force as she literally becomes her character, transmitting that subtle mix of naiveté and repressed sensuality that fits perfectly her character, and one can truly sympathize with her as she descends into a spiral of fear and paranoia. As the innocents of the title, Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin are perfect in their performances, and one wonders how they could achieve the maturity to play their roles. Stephens is specially a joy to watch, as he can go from playful child to sinister figure in a frighteningly natural way. Finally, Megs Jenkins adds her talents as Mrs. Grose, making an excellent performance in a role that easily could had become a caricature.As Robert Wise's The Haunting would do a couple of years later, The Innocents is a movie that bases its impact in the power of its ominous dark atmosphere and in the ambiguity of its script, and it is probably this last element what may also be its main flaw. Well, not exactly a flaw, but certainly something that won't be everyone's cup of tea. What I mean is that since the movie takes on many different interpretations to what is going on with the children, modern audiences may feel that the movie doesn't give enough answers to the questions it poses. However, that's precisely where the magic of The Innocents is, as like Henry James' novella does, this allows a wide range of possible interpretations to its ambiguous plot. Wheter this is a flaw or a virtue depends entirely on the viewer, and personally I think that this is one of the film's strongest points.The fact that some consider the film too vague while others think of it as too biased towards a single explanation, is simply a testament of how intriguing and fascinating the movie still is more than 40 years after its release. Creepy and atmospheric, The Innocents is also a powerful display of the best talents the British film industry had to offer in the 60s. With its excellent cinematography and wonderful acting, The Innocents is simply a masterpiece of Gothic horror that easily ranks among the best horror movies ever made. Fans of ghost stories, this is a definitive must-see. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 June 2007","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Among the many works of Gothic fiction that came up during the revival of the genre in the 1880s, Henry James' classic ghost story, The Turn of the Screw, is certainly one of the most intriguing and fascinating of all.

I will skip the plot, since it has been said here so many times already.What struck me the most about the film when watching it as a jaded adult were a few things.First of all, the whole sexual innuendo between Howard and Beverly happens incredibly fast. So quickly, in fact, that its already built-in silliness treads on incredulity. Funny how I found that a perfectly reasonable progression as a kid. But hey, what did I know about women back then!

Then, out of nowhere, the film switches to a painfully long chase scene. If you thought the wisecracks in the first half were silly, wait till you see the second half.Speaking of wisecracks, the entire diner scene really tests ones nerves.

That doesn't make it any worse than a host of other ridiculous films from the 80s the unbearable idiocy of Weekend at Bernie's, the mindlessness of Armageddon (which should really be used as an IQ test - the more you laugh, the stupider you are), or anything where Will Smith tries to act cool. Every Will Smith film, in other words. And let's not mention the slew of typically perverted Hollywood spewage concerning teens, parties with teens, and teens on trips through Europe. Throw in the deviancy and face-in-the-mud scum-filled comedy of the majority of Adam Sandler movies, and you'd be hard pressed to vilify a film as lovely and harmless as Howard the Duck. Of course, stooping so low as ridiculing Howard the Duck is pathetic enough, but what is even more amusing is those who attempt a scornful laugh at it.

Still, it does what its supposed to do.I do not understand why every know-it-all wannabe Hollywood lackey wants to blast this endearing film as if it were Armageddon. I saw significance in Howard's resemblance to us. The scene in the diner in particular took on a very new light for me with this latest viewing, one that showed humans as brutal, unthinking animals. Of course, that is not to say a film this silly hides some kind of earth-shattering reflection on the human condition. It's just fun! In conclusion, then, we have a funny, corny 80s movie about a duck who comes to save us, with the second half's chase scene becoming slightly tedious, and a great ending. It's endearing, it is heart-warming, and it's also dumb. That doesn't make it any worse than a host of other ridiculous films from the 80s the unbearable idiocy of Weekend at Bernie's, the mindlessness of Armageddon (which should really be used as an IQ test - the more you laugh, the stupider you are), or anything where Will Smith tries to act cool. Every Will Smith film, in other words. And let's not mention the slew of typically perverted Hollywood spewage concerning teens, parties with teens, and teens on trips through Europe. Throw in the deviancy and face-in-the-mud scum-filled comedy of the majority of Adam Sandler movies, and you'd be hard pressed to vilify a film as lovely and harmless as Howard the Duck. Of course, stooping so low as ridiculing Howard the Duck is pathetic enough, but what is even more amusing is those who attempt a scornful laugh at it. I guess some people are desperate for self-elevation.Howard the Duck is a great film to watch with family or friends, when you are in the mood for something lighthearted and fun.Recommended!

This guy was so annoying, he ruined the story for me. They even had him (the same actor, too) playing his son Griff in the future. Thanks to him, this BTTF Part 2 had a mean edge to it. I wanted an adventure-comedy, not a nasty movie. There was too much emphasis on this villain instead of the lighthearted fantasy that made the first movie such a hit. The writers much have realized this dark formula didn't work as they went back to form for the third in this series, making it a lot funnier and fun to watch. This one was a bummer.

I liked the way Jamal told him You're a feminine Jerry Maguire Vivica Fox was so hot and perfect as Michele Langsford who at the end did accept Jamal as well as Juwanna.
