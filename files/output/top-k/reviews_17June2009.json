This is a modern comedy without the unnecessary vulgar and obscene language or crude jokes. It is people talking as fast as they can trying to get their opinion in.

Understandably, their concern is with the movie's noirish subtext and not with the film itself. Still and all, much of noir's appeal lies in its dark forebodings about the basic nature of things. Thus, the subtext here may be worth ferreting out, but that hardly compensates, in my book at least, for the movie's overall failure to live up to standards of either a noir classic or even a movie classic, despite the fabled Bogart-Bacall-Hawks collaboration. Now, there's no need to dwell on the notoriously convoluted plot, except to insist that it really does undermine the end result. Most importantly, the general incoherence drains viewer interest because of mounting difficulty in maintaining the many threads. As a result, interest in a subtext, for example, is abandoned to hardy professionals not so concerned with whether the movie succeeds as a movie. Thus, it's the characters that must sustain audience interest. However, an unusually large, and at times confusing, supporting cast is required by the screenplay meanderings. That would be okay if the characters and their actors were consistently interesting. But they're not. The trouble is that except for the two leads no one else gets much screen time. Thus, genuinely interesting characters or actors such as the general (Waldron), Carmen (Vickers), Canino (Steele), and (Agnes) Darrin, get shuttled around by the pallid likes of Mars (a badly miscast Ridgely), Ohls (Toomey), and Brody (Heydt). In short, the screenplay is not only confusing, but over-crowded, as well. True, many of the one-liners are memorable, but no one seems in charge of what they add up to.Also, I think many folks are too much in thrall to the Bogart-Bacall-Hawks mystique to notice that this is not a triumph for any of the three. Bogart's Marlowe is basically a one-note character, who spouts snappy one-liners, sees through most every ploy, and proves irresistible to anything with long hair. To me, it gets quickly tiresome, Bogie or no Bogie. At the same time, nothing shows the movie's basic flaw better than the ruinously unnecessary afternoon dalliance between Marlowe and Acme girl Malone. Not only is it awkwardly handled (Hawks), but undercuts the credibility of the Marlowe character early on. Whatever Bogart's appeal, it's not that of a matinée idol. Then there's Bacall. To her credit, she never claimed to be much of an actress. Instead, she's a presence. The trouble is that Vivian's devious nature calls for more nuance than Bacall can manage. Thus, her performance is reduced to dialogue without behavior, and an object lesson in what proves good for a career does not necessarily prove good for a movie, basic attractions or no basic attractions. Then too, I don't see much of trademark Hawks anywhere on screen. No overlapping dialogue or real snap. Looks to me like he was shackled by the screenplay and Warner's desire to employ a bevy of contract players. Then too, there's the question of final edit, which wouldn't be the first time a studio had botched a director's cut.I'm also puzzled by some of the sub-standard sets, especially the outdoor night scenes. The occasional fog serves not only as atmosphere but also masks the shabbily done backdrops. Given the name cast and director, it's surprising to me that these detractions would pass studio muster (or Hawks'). Now, none of this is to deny that the movie does have its moments. The first 15 minutes or so amounts to a gem of an opening act. The interplay between Marlowe and the mansion's assorted characters is cleverly conceived and executed. Also, there's enough boldness in the production to hint at such forbidden adult themes as drug addiction and nymphomania. As a result, Carmen Sternwood amounts to one of the most unusual characters of the Production Code 1940's, daringly brought to life by the under-rated and star-crossed Martha Vickers.

This is not just Kubrick's best work, but also the greatest film ever made. This film works and does well on so many levels. Upon my first viewing, I said to myself 'this is all-right' not too good and not too bad. My next viewing I had seen many things that I had not noticed before. The day after the second viewing, I went out and bought it and it was worth every penny.The primary goal of the film, I believe, was to show futile our efforts are to change people because of the way they tick. I learned from this films that people don't really change. The films embraces these thoughts with dark humor and disturbing actions. In one word the film is SATIRICAL. On another level, the words to describe the film are THE TIMES ARE A-CHANGIN. These wise words of Bob Dylan apply to this film as well as others and are every bit true in real life, like No Country for Old Men. For example, as a slight spoiler, Alex, towards the beginning of the film; Alex is shown to not wanting things to change like his droogie Georgie had briefly mentioned. This and the poorly-sought ambition to change certain characters in the film WITHOUT any side effects are both inevitable and the central ideas in the film. A few characters had mentioned how they wished things were still the same in terms of anything, like in terms of Alex's punishments for his crimes. When Alex changes his ways, the others become hypocrites and oppose to what they once believed. For example, the people wanting to change Alex in a non-violent way find that at the end of the film, this is utterly impossible. Certain conversations between characters symbolize a world's readiness to change from one belief to the next and then back again, hence the title which also applies to Alex himself. In the film, half of the characters started as being the ultra-violent and wanting a change in their ways or vice-versa (good people becoming violent).

Despite the sexual subject, there's actually very little sex and nudity going on and none of it is particularly arousing or exciting. In this movie, the porn industry is seen as a mix between business and family. This is a ensemble drama with some comedic elements or an ensemble comedy with some dramatic elements. For me it worked more as a comedy with the best moments coming in where the the porn industry is seen by some artisans as an artistic endeavor (cue bad acting or cheesy concepts in the porn films). It's idealistic, rather misguided and a bit touching but mostly amusing. The dramatic elements come mostly from their real family ties, adapting to society in the real world and drugs.I thought some scenes were overlong but in retrospect, I see the genius in making the audience cringing or unnerved and without the proper setup it would not have been as effective. There's a very good ensemble cast with the highlight being Julianne Moore who plays the anchoring mother to the rest while being rather fragile herself. Roller Girl played by Heather Graham in her break-out role was certainly pretty to look at but was a bit over-hyped as she only shows real acting chops near the end (the bedroom with Moore and the car). Mark Wahlberg in the lead was solid and Burt Reynolds as the director\/producer was a nice surprise in a dramatic role. What I particularly enjoyed in this film is that it does not focus on just one character and it shows us a particular inside look at something most of us know very little about and that doesn't exist like that anymore. Keep in mind that several people from the real porn industry of that time have come forward to criticize the accuracy. Be that as it may, it's probably one of the only fiction films made on the subject by an A-list director and that's special in itself. The movie does elicit a gamut of emotions though the comedic elements work better than the dramatic elements.Rating 7.5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 June 2009","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Boogie nights is not about dancing, it's about the American porn industry in the late seventies\/early eighties and the people involved in it.

Also a problem is that Payne is watching, so should any passengers attempt to leave the bus, he will detonate the bomb himself.Speed is implausible, daft, mindless and borderline cretinous. It's also gripping, inflammable and delightful in premise, which in the process turned it into one of the finest action movies in the modern era. Taking up directing duties for the first time is Jan de Bont, better known at the time as cinematographer for luminaries like McTiernan, Schumacher, Verhoeeven and R Scott, de Bont literally throws everything at it in case nobody lets him direct again. Cars, helicopters, buses, bikes and lifts, all are either hurtling around or exploding with visual and aural excitement. It's nonsense alright, but it's thrilling high octane nonsense, action\/adventure escapism in its purest form.Depending on what sources you trust or believe, Speed was apparently born out of an unproduced idea from one Akira Kurosawa eventually made as Runaway Train in 1985. Screenwriter Graham Yost, who having just watched Runaway Train, felt that a bomb was badly missing from the premise, thus Speed as we now know it was born. 20th Century Fox green-lit the project with major reservations about premise and cast and the rest as they say, is history. The public lapped it up, stars Keanu Reeves Traven and Sandra Bullock wonderful chemistry became household names, and the 90s finally had an action movie to rival the 80s genre high that was Die Hard. Reeves, due in part to not being asked to do much outside of flex muscle and deliver cocky exuberance, firmly established a marker as an action hero. He of course would go on to deliver the magnificent Matrix and it's less than popular sequels. Bullock comes out with much credit, women in action films back then rarely did much more than scream and go doe eyed at the male lead.

I fall into the former category. I saw Halloween II before I saw the original Halloween and I guess it kind of ruined the first movie for me, because so much more happens in the sequel. The first movie takes a long time to get going, characters have to be set up and a lot of stalking happens before Michael Myers strikes for the first time. The sequel doesn't have to do any of that and takes off right from the ending of Halloween. John Carpenter turned down the chance to direct this sequel, but he co-wrote it, produced it and did the excellent synthesized score with Alan Howarth (the start of a long and successful collaboration between them.) Rick Rosenthal was chosen to helm the sequel, but Carpenter came back later to direct some additional scenes that added more gore to the movie. (Carpenter was criticized for this but slasher films had become gorier in the three years since the first film and he was responding to the market. Also, Michael Myers can't spend a long time stalking his victims anymore. Doctor Loomis and the police know he's on the loose in Haddonfield when this film starts and he's wounded and, like a wounded animal, at his most dangerous. That's why his kill count quadruples here. So it is a logical progression.)Dean Cundey, the great cinematographer whose atmospheric, prowling camera-work added so much to the first movie, thankfully also came back for this movie. Without him, there would not have been the same feeling of menace throughout.In the first Halloween movie, we find out that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has a crush on a boy called Ben Tramer and wants to go to the Prom with him. Well, as if having all her friends murdered by The Shape and barely surviving herself isn't bad enough, she also has the added trauma of Ben Tramer being flattened by a police car in this movie and bursting into flames against a van! As Laurie is drugged up and in shock in the hospital, she would have only discovered what had happened to Ben after she'd recovered from it all. Another kick in the guts for poor Laurie.People have always wondered why the hospital that Laurie is taken to, Haddonfield Memorial, is so deserted. That could easily have been addressed by Carpenter when he wrote the script. I've always figured that the hospital in Halloween II was a lot like the police station in Assault on Precinct 13 in that it was closing down and about to be re-located somewhere else. Laurie just happened to arrive on its last night in operation with a skeleton crew.It's easy to see what movies John Carpenter was watching when he was writing Halloween II; 1. ALIEN (1979) In 1974. John Carpenter co-wrote Dark Star with Dan O'Bannon. It was a comedy about how an alien gets on board a spaceship and creates havoc. O'Bannon subsequently recycled that plot as a horror movie in the screenplay for Alien. It clearly had a big impact on Carpenter. Halloween II is essentially a re-working of Alien with a hospital replacing the spaceship, The Shape standing in for the Xenomorph and nurses and paramedics substituted for the blue-collar space crew. In Halloween II one of the female characters berates a male colleague for swearing, just as in Alien. Alien influenced Carpenter so much that his next movie was a remake of The Thing in 1982.2. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) The big twist in the sequel to Star Wars was the shocking revelation that Darth Vader is actually Luke Skywalker's father. Carpenter tries the same trick with Halloween II, by making Laurie Strode the sister of Michael Myers. Again, Carpenter was criticized for this plot twist, but, again, it's quite logical. If Myers stalked his victims in the first film at random, why would he go to all the trouble of coming after Laurie again at the hospital? The sister twist is the reason.3. Dracula (1979) Dracula concludes with Van Helsing (Laurence Olivier) being impaled by Dracula (Frank Langella) with one of his own stakes, but, as he dies, he makes sure that he defeats the vampire by sticking a hook in his back and having him hoisted into the sunlight where he disintegrates. Halloween II ends in a similar way with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) being stabbed in the stomach by Michael Myers with a scalpel, but, as he dies (or so we thought at the time), he turns on the gas in the operating theater of the hospital and blows himself and his patient Michael Myers to smithereens. Even though nobody could have survived such an enormous explosion, box office demanded that both Loomis and Myers lived and they returned for Halloween 4 in 1988 (just as well, as it was a pretty good film that wouldn't have been the same without the great Donald Pleasence.) I like Halloween II. It was made during that golden period in John Carpenter's career between 1976 with Assault on Precinct 13 and ending in 1982 with the critically-mauled but now-loved The Thing. After that, Carpenter's heart didn't seem to be in it. There were flashes of the old master in They Live in 1988 and Vampires in 1997, but he was never the same director after the critics tore him apart for making The Thing. The great thing is, we still have his movies from that golden period to watch and enjoy. Halloween II is a regular in my DVD player around October 31st and always will be. If Rob Zombie's Halloween II is even half as good, I'll be happy.

It's another failed attempt at horror into mainstream film. The premise of this film is laughable, and only people who are afraid of spiders and likely subsequently don't know enough about them (which is down right stupid since they're beneficial) probably find this film scary. Now, I personally have no problem with spiders, except for when I see one on me without knowing about it. It's a natural gut reaction. But seeing one crawl around the house, especially one big enough to feast on some of the nastier insects that we have to deal with in the house on rare occasions (namely cockroaches), I leave it alone. Haven't you ever heard it's bad luck to kill a spider? Anyway, this film is so horrible at being a scary film that it should have a sequel that is released as a comedy. I can't believe Jeff Daniels, a very talented actor, would sign on for a film like this. Well, in any event, all good actors have their closet films that they'd rather not talk about. Michael Caine in Jaws 4, Robin Williams in License to Wed, Flubber and RV among a few others, Dennis Hopper in Meet the Deedles (ok, so I like that film just a little since I was a kid when that came out and I found it funny)...the list goes on. But I can see where the idea of spiders coming after people came from with the Sydney funnel-web spider. It is a very dangerous spider to humans and pretty much anything, and, if you come to damn close to it, it'll come after you. But, in general, spiders would much rather just sit in their webs or pursue prey than come after people. As a matter of fact, they're probably more afraid of us than we are of them. We see all sorts of silly stuff in this film, from cooky one-liners from Jeff Daniels, to spiders actually living socially and working as a unit. Why not make a film about giant ants or termites or wasps arthropods (a term stemming from the word arthropoda, which is the phylum to which insects and arachnids belong) that actually live socially and work together as a nest. But I am insulted when AMC or some channel features this among other scary films around Halloween, trying to pass this sham off as a scary movie. It's pathetic.

Other examples of neo-noir include Polanski's Chinatown from the seventies, Lawrence Kasdan's Body Heat from the early eighties, or the more recent L.A. Confidential. A 17-year-old girl named Kay Connell is found murdered in a small Alaska fishing town and two Los Angeles detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are sent to assist the local police with their investigation.Dormer, the older of the two, is regarded as a star of the LAPD, responsible for putting a number of major criminals behind bars. He is so famous that his investigations are studied as textbook cases at police academies. Yet he and his partner Eckhart are now themselves under investigation, as the LAPD's Internal Affairs department suspect that they may have been guilty of planting false evidence against suspects.The key moment in the film comes during a stakeout which Dormer has arranged to lure the killer into the open. The operation goes wrong, and the suspect escapes into the fog. In the ensuing confusion, Dormer shoots and kills Eckhart by mistake. As none of the other officers witnessed the shooting, they assume that Eckhart was shot by the fleeing murder suspect, and Dormer does not enlighten them. He knows that Eckhart had been offered an immunity deal in exchange for his testimony in the Internal Affairs investigation. As Dormer was indeed guilty of planting evidence against one man, a murder suspect named Dobbs, Eckhart's testimony could have put him in jail. Given that he had an obvious motive to kill his partner, Dormer fears that no-one will believe that Eckhart's shooting was accidental.Ellie Burr, a young female police officer with the local force, is assigned to investigate Eckhart's shooting. She was once a great admirer of Dormer, whose methods she studied at police college, but now starts to suspect that her idol may have feet of clay and that Eckhart's death may not have been an accident. To make matters worse for Dormer, he is blackmailed by Kay's killer, a local crime novelist named Walter Finch, who knows the truth about Eckhart's shooting. Finch offers to remain silent about this matter on condition that Dormer directs suspicion away from him by planting false evidence implicating Kay's abusive boyfriend Randy.A complex plot of this nature was one of the hallmarks of film noir. Another hallmark was an atmosphere of moral ambiguity, often involving corruption on the part of the police or others with a responsibility for enforcing the law. Dormer is a morally ambiguous character, not altogether unsympathetic despite his wrongdoing. He was led astray not by financial corruption but by his passion to bring criminals to justice; he believed firmly that Dobbs was guilty and deserved to be punished, and that tampering with the evidence was a lesser evil than letting such a man go free. The title is a reference to Dormer's inability to sleep; he blames this on the perpetual daylight of the Alaskan summer but there is a strong implication that his feelings of guilt and anxiety are also to blame. Ironically, his surname is derived from the Latin dormire, meaning to sleep.Watching Al Pacino in this movie is like watching a masterclass in acting. Every expression, every gesture, even the slightest inclination of his head is full of meaning as his character is slowly driven mad by his predicament. Dormer is a haunted, guilt-ridden figure, torn between his desire to do the right thing and his desire to preserve himself and his reputation. Rather surprisingly Pacino did not receive an Oscar nomination for this film. The Academy seem to have lost interest in him in recent years; he has not had a single nomination since his long-overdue Best Actor award for Scent of a Woman (which is far from being his best film). He receives excellent support from Hilary Swank as Ellie and from Robin Williams as Finch. It came as something of a surprise to me to see Williams, normally the hero, as a villain. He had played a terrorist in The Secret Agent, but that was a relatively minor role.A third hallmark of film noir was its distinctive visual style, generally marked by expressionistic, moody black-and-white photography. The spiritual blackness which gives these films their name is often matched by a literal darkness. It would probably be impossible to recreate this look in a modern film, but the challenge for neo-noir directors is to create an equivalent visual style for their productions. Kasdan manages this well in Body Heat, a film whose a colour scheme is dominated by blacks, reds and oranges, emphasising the feelings of heat and passion. (That film, which deals with an adulterous affair, is set against the backdrop of a Florida heatwave).Whereas the atmosphere of Body Heat is sultry and tropical, that of Insomnia is cool and Northern. Even though it is midsummer we are always aware that we are in the Arctic. Nevertheless, Christopher Nolan is also able to bring a distinctive look to his film. In some ways this look is the opposite of film noir; while that genre was dominated by night and shadows, Insomnia is dominated by grey skies, mists and a perpetual pale, milky sunlight. The fog in which Dormer shoots Eckhart can be seen as symbolic of the moral fog of confusion and ambiguity in which the story takes place.

He was too slow and got progressively slower.I mean this in three senses.Firstly, I cannot help noting that it took him just 8 years to make his first 5 features and another 35 years to make his next 5.These later pictures all spent years in development. I doubt if this long gestation period was a good thing. If you spend too long thinking about a picture it is easy to lose track of why you wanted to make it in the first place (A.I.?) and there is always a danger that you will end up squeezing the life out of it.Secondly, when Kubrick finally got a project into production he would take months and months to shoot it (14 months for Eyes Wide Shut). Notoriously he shot dozens of takes of every scene, constantly trying out new things. He got away with this because he used a very small crew and was very economical. His pictures may have taken an age to complete but they never went over budget.But again, I suspect this obsessive concern with the minutiae of every shot was counter-productive. Sometimes, Kubrick couldn't see the wood for the trees. He was so focused on how each individual scene should play that he lost sight of how the picture as a whole would work with an audience. You cannot force a movie to be great just by sheer hard work and painstaking attention to detail.Thirdly, the movies themselves are often too slow and none more so than Eyes Wide Shut.For one thing, no movie in recent years has spent so much time just getting characters from one scene to another. When they cross a room we see every step. For example, Tom Cruise is called to the bedside of one of his patients. We see him in a taxi, tortured by thoughts of his wife with another man. Then Kubrick cuts to an empty lobby just as the elevator arrives. The door opens and Cruise walks slowly across the lobby and through another doorway. As he does so, the camera dollies to the left so we can see him pass through that door and across another room. He rings the bell of an apartment. We cut to the interior of the apartment. A maid enters from the right and walks all the way across the hall to open the door and let Cruise in. She takes his coat and they exchange a couple of words before Cruise walks across the hall and over to the bedroom door. He knocks. Next, we cut to an interior of the bedroom. The door is opened and Cruise walks in. Finally the scene begins. And this is from the man who once spanned 5 million years with a single jump cut!This scene is not an exception. The whole movie is like that.This is compounded by the highly stylised acting that Kubrick came to love. In this movie, people often talk in slow motion. Nicole Kidman, in particular, is often required to break each sentence down into disconnected fragments, with agonising pauses between them. This is not her normal style and must have been specifically dictated by Kubrick.Fine - except that much of the dialogue is achingly banal and unconvincing. Tom Cruise's flirtation with the two girls at the party is feeble enough, but those lines sound like Oscar Wilde in comparison to the ones exchanged by Sky Dumont and Nicole Kidman. What was Kubrick thinking of?This is a valid question, because he probably knew exactly what he was doing. If the dialogue is banal it was because he wanted it that way. If the pacing is funereal it is because it was part of his design for the picture. I suspect that he wanted it to play like a lucid dream. Lucid dreams seem very normal when they are happening it is only on reflection that you realise how strange they actually were. In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick was probably aiming at an apparently realistic surface, but with subtly surrealistic undertones.For me it didn't work. The surface is just too prosaic to hold the interest and the undertones are too studied and too calculated to be unsettling. As a result, the movie is cold and clinical when it needs to be passionate and engaged.Ultimately, there is too much thought and too little feeling too much technique and too little instinct.I would draw a somewhat artificial distinction between movie artists and movie entertainers. It has nothing to do with quality there are lousy artists and great entertainers. The difference is that artists make the movies they feel they have to make. Entertainers make the movies they feel their audiences want to see. Unquestionably, Kubrick was an artist. He always followed his own Muse. For a long time I was happy to go along for the ride, but eventually his Muse took him to places where I couldn't follow.From my perspective, his career after 2001 A Space Odyssey was mostly a story of decline and fall.

His pictures may have taken an age to complete but they never went over budget.But again, I suspect this obsessive concern with the minutiae of every shot was counter-productive. Sometimes, Kubrick couldn't see the wood for the trees. He was so focused on how each individual scene should play that he lost sight of how the picture as a whole would work with an audience. You cannot force a movie to be great just by sheer hard work and painstaking attention to detail.Thirdly, the movies themselves are often too slow and none more so than Eyes Wide Shut.For one thing, no movie in recent years has spent so much time just getting characters from one scene to another. When they cross a room we see every step. For example, Tom Cruise is called to the bedside of one of his patients. We see him in a taxi, tortured by thoughts of his wife with another man. Then Kubrick cuts to an empty lobby just as the elevator arrives. The door opens and Cruise walks slowly across the lobby and through another doorway. As he does so, the camera dollies to the left so we can see him pass through that door and across another room. He rings the bell of an apartment. We cut to the interior of the apartment. A maid enters from the right and walks all the way across the hall to open the door and let Cruise in. She takes his coat and they exchange a couple of words before Cruise walks across the hall and over to the bedroom door. He knocks. Next, we cut to an interior of the bedroom. The door is opened and Cruise walks in. Finally the scene begins. And this is from the man who once spanned 5 million years with a single jump cut!This scene is not an exception. The whole movie is like that.This is compounded by the highly stylised acting that Kubrick came to love. In this movie, people often talk in slow motion. Nicole Kidman, in particular, is often required to break each sentence down into disconnected fragments, with agonising pauses between them. This is not her normal style and must have been specifically dictated by Kubrick.Fine - except that much of the dialogue is achingly banal and unconvincing. Tom Cruise's flirtation with the two girls at the party is feeble enough, but those lines sound like Oscar Wilde in comparison to the ones exchanged by Sky Dumont and Nicole Kidman. What was Kubrick thinking of?This is a valid question, because he probably knew exactly what he was doing. If the dialogue is banal it was because he wanted it that way. If the pacing is funereal it is because it was part of his design for the picture. I suspect that he wanted it to play like a lucid dream. Lucid dreams seem very normal when they are happening it is only on reflection that you realise how strange they actually were. In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick was probably aiming at an apparently realistic surface, but with subtly surrealistic undertones.For me it didn't work. The surface is just too prosaic to hold the interest and the undertones are too studied and too calculated to be unsettling. As a result, the movie is cold and clinical when it needs to be passionate and engaged.Ultimately, there is too much thought and too little feeling too much technique and too little instinct.I would draw a somewhat artificial distinction between movie artists and movie entertainers. It has nothing to do with quality there are lousy artists and great entertainers. The difference is that artists make the movies they feel they have to make. Entertainers make the movies they feel their audiences want to see. Unquestionably, Kubrick was an artist. He always followed his own Muse. For a long time I was happy to go along for the ride, but eventually his Muse took him to places where I couldn't follow.From my perspective, his career after 2001 A Space Odyssey was mostly a story of decline and fall.

He was too slow and got progressively slower.I mean this in three senses.Firstly, I cannot help noting that it took him just 8 years to make his first 5 features and another 35 years to make his next 5.These later pictures all spent years in development. I doubt if this long gestation period was a good thing.

Naaah, no way! They're all made by aliens! And if anyone is wondering why aliens might want to spend time making crop circles, the answer is simple. They're a sort of extraterrestrial sat-nav, designed to guide alien spaceships into safe landing sites.That, at least, is the theory put forward in Signs. Most Hollywood films about alien invasions (Independence Day, War of the Worlds) deal with their subject matter from an American perspective. I mean, who in America wants to see a film about aliens invading Russia, or China, or Paraguay? Signs is even more insular in its perspective, showing us not the effect of the alien invasion on mankind in general, or even its effect on America in general, but rather its effect on one particular family living on a farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.The Hess family weren't always farmers. The paterfamilias Graham Hess was originally a clergyman who lost his faith after his wife Colleen was killed in a traffic accident and now cares for his son Morgan and daughter Bo with the help of his younger brother Merrill, a former minor league baseball player who, although talented, never made it into the major leagues because of his reckless style of play. (Bo? I thought clergymen were supposed to name their children after saints of the Christian Church, not eighties film stars).The film tells the story of how Graham and Merrill manage to beat off the nasty green-skinned invaders. In the process Graham recovers his faith in God after Morgan's life is saved by what seems like a series of coincidences; Graham then resumes his clerical career. The title Signs refers not only to the crop circles but also to these coincidences, which Graham interprets as signs of divine providence.If anyone is wondering how to kill a hostile alien, Signs offers some sound advice. Hitting them over the head with a baseball bat is apparently a good move, but the best method is to empty a jug of water over them, water being a substance which is intensely toxic to aliens. This raises a whole series of questions which the film never answers. We are told that the aliens are short of food and have come to Earth to harvest humans to eat, but what we are never told is why they have chosen to come to a planet the greater part of which is covered in water and which contains significant amounts of water vapour in its atmosphere. Why do they intend to feast upon creatures whose flesh is mainly composed of water (and therefore presumably poisonous to them)? And what do they do when it rains? They don't even seem to carry an umbrella. The normal answer to questions like these is to say Ah, well, they're an alien species, so their thought processes are quite different to ours, but this does not really serve as an explanation. It is unlikely that any species could have evolved unless its thought processes tend towards self-preservation rather than self-destruction.A more fundamental flaw than plot-holes of this nature is the fact that Signs evades some of the most fundamental questions raised by its basic premise. Although the film purports to deal with a religious topic, and its central character is a former clergyman, it never asks How might our view of God, and our religious beliefs, be changed by contact with intelligent alien life-forms? Graham recovers his faith because he believes that God intervened to save Morgan's life, but never asks himself why He did not intervene to save Colleen. (Or, for that matter, why He did not intervene to save the aliens, who are presumably also His creations, from having glasses of water chucked over them).The role of Graham was, apparently, offered to Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood, both of whom wisely turned it down. Mel Gibson, unfortunately, was not so discerning, as Signs is a very disappointing film. This was only the second of M. Night Shyamalan's films that I have seen, the first being The Village, which I enjoyed a lot more. That film worked well both as a thriller and as a parable about the dangers of nostalgia for some imagined past, and Shyamalan managed the difficult feat of providing it with a twist ending which is both original and satisfying.

Walter Matthau plays a lead Police Lieutenant assigned to stop a group of four men who have hijacked a New York City Subway train. Four hijackers, with characteristics that inspired Quentin Tarentino's Reservoir Dogs, demand a one million dollar ransom within a near impossible to reach time limit, threatening to kill one hostage on the train for each minute that the money is late.An amazing music score captivates the viewer immediately. We are drawn into a character study of people representing diverse New York populations. However the real drama and tension of the movie is watching Walter Matthau and the hijacking leader Robert Shaw communicate and compromise about the hostages and the money in a race against time. Viewers of this film will actually feel as if they are part of this terrible and dramatic experience.The one small spoiler that brings the movie down a bit is in negotiating with the hostages and trying to get the mayor's approval, he says, This city doesn't have a million dollars. This is one statement that hurts the credibility of this fine film. Even in 1974, when this film was released, New York City had far more than a million dollars if these types of situations were to take place. Having the producers place a higher number for the ransom amount may have helped here.There are other elements of the film that are very real. Authentic subway cars were used during filming, and many of the scenes have very dramatic shootouts in tunnels where you can't be sure who's dead and who has survived after the gunfire has stopped. It are little surprises around every corner that will keep you riveted to this movie till the end.Speaking of the climax, the end of this picture may be one of the most brilliantly written scenes in cinema!

The story of Eve's diabolical ascent is simply so compelling and perfectly done that it's one of those rare perfect stories of fiction, the kind writers will be ripping off and using as inspiration for centuries. On top of a delightful story, the dialogue is crisp, intelligent, and in combination with the acting, almost realistic (of course, no one really talks like these people, but it would be a lot of fun if they did).All About Eve is essential viewing. The opening narration is a bit boring and dated, and much of the ending is all too predictable from about halfway through, but other than that, anyone who likes an intelligent movie should be on the edge of their seat.

You know before the credits run that you're in for a ride--a woman in only a trenchcoat is running frantically down a highway at night, and she is desperate for good reasons, which we gradually learn. You also know that mise-en-scene accuracy isn't the point--the white stripe in the road jumps around from cut to cut. But once we are in the car, and the credits roll backwards, top to bottom, and we hear her panting (which would be orgasmic in some other situation) and panting and panting, you will either be enthralled or exhausted.By the time she and Mike Hammer, played with psychotic heartlessness by Ralph Meeker, go through a police roadblock, get assaulted by some thugs and tortured, and then get pushed off a cliff in his sports car, we are about eleven minutes into the movie. It's fast without polish, and yet it holds together, it's smart, it actually shows Hammer to be a thinking, reasonable detective, even if a mercenary one (it's all about money to him). There are bad bad guys and bad good guys, and a bad bad suitcase. Even the sweet tongued and ever helpful secretary\/lover Velda, played by Maxine Cooper, uses sex for purely commercial reasons--to trap husbands and give their wives reason to hire Hammer, or so it seems.And who was director Robert Aldrich at the time? A man from privilege who was working his way up in Hollywood, and who might be the last you'd expect to dip into these steamy seamy depths. Or reach these heights, in fact. I'd hate to be laughed at but despite all its would-be flaws and obvious low budget devices, this is his best film overall, surely his best for sheer chutzpah and flair. And it brandishes the quirks that will resurface in some of his later films (notably Whatever Happened to Baby Jane), as well as his Hollywood smarts (the masterful The Dirty Dozen).So, yes, this movie clunks in many parts. But you forgive it, like you might (sometimes) forgive a Corman film its huge gaps and bad acting. The force of Meeker's portrayal is key. This was the movie role of his life, resorting largely to television for a career afterwards (Aldrich used him again in The Dirty Dozen, and leave it to Kubrick to see Meeker's ability for Paths of Glory). The cinematographer is the admired Ernest Laszlo, who makes a lot out of very little throughout. The twists Aldrich (and\/or his screenwriter, A. I. Besserides) made to the plot from the original Mickey Spillane novel (which isn't exactly tame) give transcendent brilliance of Kiss Me Deadly--the radiant, blinding contents of the suitcase (it roars when opened, too!) make the plot a terrible fantasy, and make all the other improbable events fair game.And so the movie presents, intentionally or not, a comment of some confusing kind about nuclear power, atom bombs, the cold war, government secrecy, the lone dissident, and maybe, if we believe the ending, the futility of keeping nukes out of the hands of crooks. Let's hope this all stays a fantasy.
