Flash forward seven years when the psychopath (Tony Beckley) escapes from a mental hospital so a detective (Charles Durning) tries to track him down before he can harm anyone else.WHEN A STRANGER CALLS has become somewhat legendary in the thriller\/horror genre due in large part to a nearly perfectly executed opening 20-minute sequence where Kane is terrorized by the mysterious man on the phone. There's no question that this sequence has gone down in horror history as a major highlight but I don't think the rest of the film gets nearly enough credit as it deserves. The middle portion of the film is pretty much a character study as we focus in on the psycho who is out in the streets and pretty much walking about trying to find friends. Even though we know the monster he is, the film at times paints him in a sympathetic light.The middle portion of the film has several thriller aspects that work extremely well including one where a bar woman pretty much gives a cold shoulder to the psycho. Of course, she doesn't know who he is and this helps with the suspense because the viewer very well knows what he's capable of. Even the detective is someone we get to learn about as the movie goes along because we can tell that this is a case that haunts him and you have to think that he dropped off the force and went into a private business in hopes of one day getting his chance to kill this guy.Director Fred Walton does a very good job at managing to build up the suspense during the opening sequence and the problem with a lot of thrillers is that they can contain one great suspense scene and then things just go flat or can never recapture that same tension. Even though the middle portion of this film is more laid back, the director still manages to build up a creepy atmosphere and the viewer is always on the edge knowing that this guy could flip at any moment. The cat and mouse game being played works out extremely well. The film also benefits from a very effective score by Dana Kaproff, which helps add to the tension and atmosphere. Add in some nice cinematography and you've really got everything working right.The performances are also another major plus as Durning is an actor that fits that every man's approach. He looks like a real detective. He acts like a real detective. You can look in his eyes and see years of experience and this here just helps the film. Kane is also very effective playing the scared female part and there's no question that she helps sell the opening sequence. The film, however, belongs to Beckley who is simply terrific in the role of the psycho. The character actually has quite a bit to do here and the actor perfectly captures not only the evilness that lurks below the surface but as I said earlier, there are scenes where he's mistreated and the actor manages to get some sympathy even when you hate the guy. This certainly reminds one of the performance of Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN.WHEN A STRANGER CALLS is a very intense little gem but there are still some flaws to be found in it. This includes the movie running about five minutes too long and there's also another sequence inside a restaurant where you just want to scream at the Kane character to get up and do something rather than sitting around and crying on a floor. Still, this film deserves its reputation as a real gem.

Although Chinatown isn't technically film noir, it's most definitely neo noir. It possesses the same sort of qualities as a great 40's film noir just with color and updated issues. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway star as a private investigator and a recent widow respectively. Of course, the two cross paths and form an unlikely bond over a recent tragedy. But as always with noir films, there's so much more to the plot that unravels.I will say for the most of the film I felt like I needed more of a back-story with Nicholson's character Jake Gittes, but after watching the film as a whole, I definitely think it worked. The point is you don't need to know exactly what went down in Chinatown years before. You just need to know there's a history there. Nicholson brings an incredible amount of experience but also relatability to Jake. He's the kind of guy that you don't necessarily agree with the things he does but you end up rooting for him anyway. Dunaway on the other hand plays Evelyn much more guarded. There was a point in the film where she said lets just drop the whole thing where I knew there was much more to her character. Isn't there always with female characters in noir's? The film deals with plenty of controversial subjects that are still prevalent now. Adultery, rape, and even a little bit of abuse.

I also usually love Buddy movies that's why I was terribly disappointed by this one. First of all, the plot starts really late, around 25 minutes of the film, when we learn that the body in the street was a cop's one. Before that, we just knew who will be the bad guy, not really how and why. So the first part, even with funny moments, is kind of plot less and a bit boring. Then, we are finally interested in the plot, the heroes scr*w it on the boat with two other undercover cops (who aim like sh*t)and then we lost another 10 minutes of the movie with a plot less 80's montage + scene about heroes forced holidays just to learn they decide to quit (maybe it was still original at this date) and to buy a bar (that will never be a real dilemma for them, we Spectator already know they won't really quit and it doesn't seem to be really important to them either). So, back to the action now, many script problems will occurs - Bad guy or antagonistic forces are not enough dangerous or are well portrayed. we never really care about them, we never feel danger for the Buddy cops so we never really empathized. - Love story is totally cliché except the one with Hines that is funny. - Investigation and cocaine story is poor. - Action scenes are really poor and danger or dilemmas never really present so we're not really involved in the movie as the way they succeed in danger is not really rewarding most of the time (what was the rope scene at the end by the way???!!! Why did he climb just for that??!!) - Lot of strange things like fake snow or the way they throw bullets in the car, clearly aiming for the head, while smiling. Of course, there are nice jokes here and there, the movie is full of good will and it is a real positive movie but it doesn't make a good movie.

You could say that it is basically an extended video clip of the entire Pink Floyd album The Wall, however it is much more than that (but if you do like the music then why not &#x96; watch it as an extended video clip). The film itself is very dark, and actually quite disturbing &#x96; especially if you are in the music industry, but then again Pink Floyd never shied away from attacking the music industry in their songs.

The Wall is certainly a very confronting and challenging movie, and certainly deserves the accolades that it received (including the number 3 box office spot behind ET and An Officer and a Gentleman &#x96; but they were going to be really hard to beat &#x96; still, it is now a cult classic where as the two the beat it are quaint movies from the Eighties).

Killer's Kiss is an exceptionally well movie, while it definitely is not a masterpiece (like many of Kubrick's later movies would turn out to be), it is still a good movie. Unlike Fear And Desire, this movie actually has a plot, (Fear And Desire did have one, but it didn't seem like much of one), and the acting is good, as well as the writing. Even more interesting, the film's budget was rather low. But that didn't mean much as far this this movie was concerned, as even with only $75000, Kubrick was still able to make a good movie that shows that he was now really starting to get somewhere as far as his movie talents went. Interestingly, much like Fear And Desire, Kubrick also hated this movie, but I actually liked it, and apparently other people do, and at least it's better than Fear And Desire. I guess it only goes to show that you can only keep doing better the more you go on in show business.Although the movie only takes place during the course of three days, we get a good view of what's going on. It's the story of some people who try to go about their lives normally, but some trouble happens along the way. The cinematography gives the movie a very dark and dramatic appearance to it. In addition, the actors in the movie, particularly Frank Silvera, Irene Kane, and Jamie Smith. There's also some tense action in this movie, like a chase across some rooftops, but Kubrick manages to keep all of it relevant to the plot, and he doesn't try to glamorize things, he keeps it all realistic. Well, being the perfectionist that he was, you'd probably expect something like that to come from a Kubrick movie.In short, it's safe to say that Kubrick definitely made an improvement over Fear And Desire, as this movie was a good movie. If you are really into Kubrick's movies, then you should give this movie a viewing just to see where he really got going before he made movies like A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Barry Lyndon. So all in all, while Killer's Kiss does not rank alongside Kubrick's best works, it is still a good movie that's worth a viewing or two.

Sally Field, Kiefer Sutherland, Ed Harris, Joe Montegna. All wasted on a script that can be found any evening on Lifetime Movie Network, or done better somewhere in the archives of Law&Order. It's a terrible piece of commercial stuff. The opening scene shows us one of those extraordinarily happy families going about their breakfasts and anticipating a party later that day in their sunny California home. Harris and Field have two lovely daughters, one about five and the other seventeen. They laugh and kiss one another. A tour down Memory Lane that takes us to place like Father Knows Best. The older daughter is at home alone in mid morning, chatting with Field, who is on her way to work and is stuck in a traffic jam. Suddenly, Field hears crashing and screaming at the other end. She leaps out of her car in this highway parking lot, begins screaming gibberish, and runs between the lines of cars, waving her hands and begging somebody to call the police. She remains hysterical for what seemed like a very long time. Eons came and went while she rushed headlong down the street, knocking uncaringly into pedestrians.It's easy to skip most of the plot because it's been seen before in one or another of its isomorphs. The daughter is raped and murdered brutally. The funeral follows. Field is inconsolable; she wants the murderer caught and constantly hectors the cops. Well, he IS promptly caught by the detectives, led by Joe Montegna., Alas, the culprit, Sutherland, is gotten off by a small legal point and is free to walk the Los Angeles streets. A determined Field begins to follow him around.You ought to see Sutherland and his milieu. He himself, the first good look we get at him, is a serviceable villain, pure e-vil. He smokes. He pours ice water on a friendly dog. His hair is long and greasy. He wears tight T shirts, long black trousers, and swings a foot-long silver key chain as he walks through the seedy Latino district, sneering arrogantly at everything around him. He lives in an apartment above a pool hall. The air is filled with vicious curses, raucous music, and the odor of things frying in lard. The inside of his apartment is appalling -- unmade bed, dirty dishes, empty wine bottles, girlie magazines scattered around the floor, a general sense of clutter almost the equal of my own digs. Disgusting.Field acquires a .38 and trains herself in martial arts. Then, for a while, the movie slides into the empowerment of women. When a man in dark clothing follows her into one of those empty underground garages with eerie lighting along the walls, she ambushes him and kicks him roundly in the family jewels. But the poor cripple was just an ordinary fellow trying to get to his car. Big joke. When she has sex with Harris, she gets on top. She also has a loud argument with Montegna which ends with her climactic curse F*** YOU! and she storms out to great applause.Sutherland is aware of these goings on and taunts her by making friends with Field's sole remaining daughter at the playground. Sutherland also pillages another house and rapes and murders a delicious Latina. But again there's nothing the cops can do because it's all circumstantial as Montegna puts it.It's not so circumstantial at the end, when Field lures him into her home and then perforates him with half a dozen .38 slugs. Montegna, with a smile, takes her away from the milling crowd of police officers and tells her he's been at this a long time and he knows what she did. But they're both satisfied. She's only human, after all, with human reflexes. If you tickle us do we not laugh? If you poison us do we not die? And if you wrong us shall we not revenge? The person I felt sorriest for was poor Ed Harris. He's stuck in the hapless role of the father, trying to finish his own grief work, the good-natured, caring guy, who just isn't THERE for her.I never did understand how Field did anything illegal at the climax. Montegna says he knows what she did, okay, but what did she DO that was against the law? She ransacked Sutherland's dumpy apartment and left her hat behind, so he would know who was responsible. But she didn't leave him a note saying that she had the hots for him and wanted him to come to her nicely furnished home, strap a red rubber ball in her mouth, and ravish her brutally before killing her. It sounds as if Field has outwitted the law and gotten away with something -- but what, other than trespass? But that's just one of several unexplained properties of the film. I mean, a member of Fields' share-the-grief support group reveals herself as an FBI agent doing undercover work, looking for vigilantes. Really? My HARD-EARNED-TAX-DOLLARS are paying this babe to sit around and listen to crime victims tell their sad tales? Why aren't the FBI out looking for the malefactor who stole my 24-inch bicycle when I was twelve years old, hey? It also turns out that the FBI agent, who is a black woman, is in a lesbian marriage. None of this has anything to do with the story except to demonstrate how tolerant Field is. Recently, it's become chic for a heroine to have a gay friend in the movies. Oh, also, the little daughter is named Megan. I don't want to see any more women named Megan. And let us knock off naming girls Dakota while we're at it.

All wasted on a script that can be found any evening on Lifetime Movie Network, or done better somewhere in the archives of Law&Order. It's a terrible piece of commercial stuff. The opening scene shows us one of those extraordinarily happy families going about their breakfasts and anticipating a party later that day in their sunny California home. Harris and Field have two lovely daughters, one about five and the other seventeen. They laugh and kiss one another. A tour down Memory Lane that takes us to place like Father Knows Best. The older daughter is at home alone in mid morning, chatting with Field, who is on her way to work and is stuck in a traffic jam. Suddenly, Field hears crashing and screaming at the other end. She leaps out of her car in this highway parking lot, begins screaming gibberish, and runs between the lines of cars, waving her hands and begging somebody to call the police. She remains hysterical for what seemed like a very long time. Eons came and went while she rushed headlong down the street, knocking uncaringly into pedestrians.It's easy to skip most of the plot because it's been seen before in one or another of its isomorphs. The daughter is raped and murdered brutally. The funeral follows. Field is inconsolable; she wants the murderer caught and constantly hectors the cops. Well, he IS promptly caught by the detectives, led by Joe Montegna., Alas, the culprit, Sutherland, is gotten off by a small legal point and is free to walk the Los Angeles streets. A determined Field begins to follow him around.You ought to see Sutherland and his milieu. He himself, the first good look we get at him, is a serviceable villain, pure e-vil. He smokes. He pours ice water on a friendly dog. His hair is long and greasy. He wears tight T shirts, long black trousers, and swings a foot-long silver key chain as he walks through the seedy Latino district, sneering arrogantly at everything around him. He lives in an apartment above a pool hall. The air is filled with vicious curses, raucous music, and the odor of things frying in lard. The inside of his apartment is appalling -- unmade bed, dirty dishes, empty wine bottles, girlie magazines scattered around the floor, a general sense of clutter almost the equal of my own digs. Disgusting.Field acquires a .38 and trains herself in martial arts. Then, for a while, the movie slides into the empowerment of women. When a man in dark clothing follows her into one of those empty underground garages with eerie lighting along the walls, she ambushes him and kicks him roundly in the family jewels. But the poor cripple was just an ordinary fellow trying to get to his car. Big joke. When she has sex with Harris, she gets on top. She also has a loud argument with Montegna which ends with her climactic curse F*** YOU! and she storms out to great applause.Sutherland is aware of these goings on and taunts her by making friends with Field's sole remaining daughter at the playground.

Some of the legends of early film were notorious over-actors, and in my opinion, it made a lot of these early films unwatchable. In the case of Inherit The Wind, an over-actor meets one of Hollywood's all-time greats, head to head in the courtroom, and the result is pure gold. Based on the famous 1925 Scopes trial, and the 1955 novel, Inherit The Wind follows a courtroom trial, in a small town, that gripped the nation. The accused, Bertram Cates, has done the unthinkable, taught the theory of evolution to a high school class in the deep south. The trial is not the issue, neither is the slap on the wrist punishment, what's at stake here is the right to teach information that contradicts the bible. With the case gaining national attention, two world renown lawyers come to argue the case. In real life, those were Clarence Darrow and former Presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan. The legendary, Spencer Tracy portrays Darrow, in one of his best known performances. As Darrow, Tracy is witty, but at the same time, whole-heatedly behind his belief in the U.S. Constitution, and he argues with a passion that is rarely seen in the films of today. Tracy is paired with notorious over-actor, Fredric March, who plays his opposing counsel. March was so over the top to the point of being ridiculous, but when paired with the fervent defense presented by Tracy, it's the perfect dynamic. The film is simply about a trial, that doesn't even result in life or death, it's a fairly boring concept, but what makes the film the classic that it is, was the chemistry between Tracy and March. Seldom, if ever, have I seen two actors with completely different styles, play so well off one another. In the rarest of cases, Inherit The Wind was not entertaining for the story, theme, or elements, the fun lies in watching Tracy and March go at it in a way that you may never see again, and that's why I highly recommend this classic.

Many of Wenders's scenes here remind me of Edward Hopper paintings and despite the limitations of the film's narrative, it's well worth watching simply for the visual feast.The film's plot proceeds quite slowly. Walt Henderson is alerted that his brother, Travis, has been found dehydrated after walking in the South Texas desert. Walt drives from Los Angeles and picks Travis up, intending to return home to L.A., with his brother in tow. It's been four years since Travis disappeared and left his son Hunter to be raised by Walt and his wife, Anne.

When Travis finally talks, all he can virtually talk about is a parcel of land he bought in Paris, Texas, where their parents allegedly met and conceived him.The second act&#x97;perhaps the most interesting part of the film&#x97;chronicles Travis's awkward attempts to bond with his son, Hunter, once he and Walt arrive back in L.A.

It should be noted that Hunter Carson did a fantastic job of playing his fictional counterpart, a role that required a great deal of nuance and sensitivity.If the two bonding stories (one between the two brothers and the other between father and son) prove to be fairly interesting, the film's resolution, unfortunately does not. A.A. Dowd writing in the A.V. Club, cogently notes what's wrong with the narrative There's just something weirdly banal and unsatisfying about the explanation Wenders and Shepard belatedly supply. What drove Travis to abandon his family and flee for the freedom of Mexico? I'm afraid it's nothing more complicated than a case of run-of-the-mill relationship troubles, revealed during a very long monologue that places Travis on one side of a two-way mirror and his ex, Jane (Nastassja Kinski)&#x97;now dancing at a seedy Houston strip club to make ends meet&#x97;on the other.Run-of-the-mill explanations also apply to the film's title&#x97;none of the characters actually end up going to Paris, Texas and the Travis's story of his origins in that particular town, is hardly the stuff of high drama.Travis finally figures out that he's not cut out to be a father and abandons Hunter and Jane to fend for themselves.

It is also a sense of spectator-ship - in Sugarland Express we look at a car chase from the point of view of the media, we see the shark attacks in Jaws from the point of view of the town as a community, now we see UFOs through the eyes of those drawn to them, either by enthusiasm or by a mysterious controlling urge.Sadly, this idea of spectator-ship throughout the script is sort of a fill-in for its lack of narrative. Yes, we like Roy, and we want him to find the answers he is looking for, but this obsession turns him into a bad husband and father, which the film ignores for reasons that are never explained. He tries to convince his family at times of what he has seen - this seems rational - but what is not rational is when he is trying to form Devil's Tower subconsciously with a bunch of dirt, and he is in such a trance that he barely tries to stop his family leaving him.This is a great adventure, but there is almost too much of act 2 since this film has a giant build to its conclusion. That is really the main point of this film, and the struggles Roy is supposed to experience seem feeble to him even though he is an average American. In the scene where he attempts to confront the top man behind the operation, he demands answers, but it is more of an outburst than an argument as to why he needs answers. When they try to send him away, he is able to prove the air is not toxic and run off to the area around Devil's Tower because it is convenient for the plot that nobody is guarding him that well.The best motivation in this film comes from the lead lady who desperately wants to be reunited with her son who has experienced the aliens on a few occasions. This gives power to the image of the single mother, and perhaps it suggests that women are better parents since Roy forgets about his family rather quickly?This film is highly intriguing, but it falls short of Spielberg's best films, even for the era before Schindler's List.

It is also a sense of spectator-ship - in Sugarland Express we look at a car chase from the point of view of the media, we see the shark attacks in Jaws from the point of view of the town as a community, now we see UFOs through the eyes of those drawn to them, either by enthusiasm or by a mysterious controlling urge.Sadly, this idea of spectator-ship throughout the script is sort of a fill-in for its lack of narrative. Yes, we like Roy, and we want him to find the answers he is looking for, but this obsession turns him into a bad husband and father, which the film ignores for reasons that are never explained. He tries to convince his family at times of what he has seen - this seems rational - but what is not rational is when he is trying to form Devil's Tower subconsciously with a bunch of dirt, and he is in such a trance that he barely tries to stop his family leaving him.This is a great adventure, but there is almost too much of act 2 since this film has a giant build to its conclusion.

A film that has gone on to inspire the work of artist Sheppard Fairey amongst an endless list of eternally grateful filmmakers. Its director, the legendary and criminally understated John Carpenter, absolutely hated it, seeing as it was the movie that burned him out, labelled him a commercial failure and saw him retreat prematurely into semi-retirement! One of the few original movies of the 20th Century that is highly coveted as a bible of hidden truths in a world of elitism, conspiracy and the fate of man's freedom where capitalism and corporate rule are destroying the world, I don't think it was ever meant to be so clever, so deep or foreboding, but what would otherwise be an average '80s action movie is instead a shout against the alienation and segregation of the middle and lower classes, thanks to the ignorance of the super wealthy.Starring WWE superstar Rowdy Roddy Piper in a fascinating and often intense lead role as drifter John Nada, our relenting and reluctant hero stumbles upon a Los Angeles where the unemployed and homeless are being driven out as alien beings in disguise sit at the top of the economic hierarchy, acclimatising the globe to their own preference.Upon witnessing the carnage first hand, and then discovering a way he can separate the aliens from humans, Nada goes on the rampage, catching the attention of the underground resistance who've been planning a way to expose the alien threat for some time. Nada and his new friends have one chance to make it right or die as the armies of the enemy close in to exterminate them all.As usual with any '80s Carpenter movie, you might not know his family of go-to character actors (Peter Jason, Keith David, George Buck Flower etc.), but they are all naturals and they really add to the atmosphere. Keith David had always been a great co-star and put even more into his work alongside Rowdy than even with Kurt Russell in 'The Thing.' The fight they have in the alleyway is painful to watch. You'll never see a street fight like it ever again.In terms of cinematography, it's the staple Carpenter look widescreen film format, always perfectly shot and a pleasure to watch. In terms of soundtrack, it's Carpenter's least effective, but with that slow-beating western style every time Nada's on screen and counting his woes, it serves the character and the story, so it's not distracting.As for action, Arnie and Stallone must have blushed for sure and Carpenter always having been ahead of his time gave a kind of arcade game first person shooter feel to some of the shootouts, which is really interesting considering he's retired from the business to sit and play X-Box all day every day.Other cons; it has some boring quiet moments that don't work as well as they could have, and the strain on Carpenter's creative muscle does show at times through some clunky scenes and empty dialogue. There lacks a little chemistry between Rowdy and leading lady Meg Foster, though I think we're supposed to notice that for a reason.On a whole, it's like the sci-fi action movie Walter Hill never made. Imagine that Hill and Schwarzenegger made this instead of 'Red Heat' because you could watch them back to back on a Saturday night and have the time of your life without a doubt.Not perfect but so horribly underrated. I hope Carpenter now realises how 'They Live' had to wait a couple decades to be really appreciated. Because for those of us who understand the message, it's really true They Live, We Sleep!

And while this film was released in 1997, at pretty much the exact same time Volcano was getting booted out as well. Out of the two though, this is by far the better movie, largely because it's a much more believable situation with believable characters and scenarios (for the most part, but I'll get to the jarring one's later).So what's the cabbage? Harry Dolton is a Volcanologist working for the US Geological Survey, and is sent to the small town of Dante's Peak in the Cascade Mountains after reports of strange anomalies regarding its local namesake mountain. Upon arrival, he meets with the town's Mayor and moonlighting coffee shop owner Rachel Wando. Although Harry is convinced that the dormant volcano is starting to reawaken, no one else believes him, and he has to try and convince the town and his superiors at the USGS that this mountain is big, bad and ready to blow!Now, the bad parts? This film really is too predictable for words. You know the mountain is going to blow at some point, and you know that the peaceful little town they try to show off as being all beautiful and lovely in the beginning is going to be wiped out. You know Pierce Brosnan is right and everyone else is wrong.Also there are a few very silly scenes that will make you scratch your head in confusion. Firstly, why did the three choose to drive their boat right across the middle of the acid lake rather than sticking to the shore? Why didn't Dreyfus get out of his car on the bridge rather than attempting the impossible? And, most obviously, you can't drive a pickup truck across molten lava and expect to come out okay! Nor can a pickup truck outrun a Pyroclastic Cloud travelling at 200mph! As someone who graduated in Geography, I may have a bit of an advantage, but I'm sure anyone will know that these things really don't happen! Also as a Geography student I was quick to point out the numerous flaws in the geographical accuracy of this eruption, but I won't bore you to death with that!As well as that, there's a few scenes which are simply played for action's sake. One example being in the wood cabin and the Lava bursts through the wall at our heroes. You can't seriously tell me that they didn't notice the fact that things were getting a little hot in there, especially since 1,000 degree lava is literally on the other side of a thin log wall!But there are many good points to this film as well. The story, although predictable, is still quite gripping. The buildup to the volcanic eruption is played quite well and suspenseful, even though you find the other characters stupid for not taking Harry up on his advice even though every single bit of evidence points to him being right!The CGI is also very impressive in places, though perhaps a little choppy in others. The practical effects are good though, especially with the destruction of the town and buildings crumbling. The acting is fairly robust, although many characters have confusing motivations and you wonder why they're thinking what they're thinking, none of the performances are awful per say.Overall, the film is quite gripping though predictable, and even a touch suspenseful in the first half, but doesn't really go down hill in the second half, so much as becomes the standard action movie of running away from the horrible danger with a crescendo of CGI and explosions to top it all off. Not the greatest film ever made and does indeed have many silly moments that do take you out of it somewhat, but it's fairly solid. For a rainy Saturday afternoon movie you can turn your brain off to, this is definitely a contender.

I never got around to it at the time and I'd forgotten about it until I saw that it was available on Netflix a couple of days ago. My wife was away so I gave it a go, thinking it was a bit of a lads' shoot 'em up adventure, which on one level it is, but it's so much more than that and it's gone straight into my all-time top 5 films. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it again the next day when my wife had returned as I thought she'd also love it, which she did (though not quite as much as me). I've never watched a film twice in two days before but I could watch it again right now as there are details that I missed each time (e.g. Armstrong & Miller's characters, Winterburn and Dixon, being named after two of Arsenal's defenders in the 1980s\/90s). The attention to detail in the film added so much for me, such as in the scene where Gibson (Michael Gambon) has a chat with Mr Chance (Ken Stott) in a circular, domed room. The dialogue is wonderful, with Gibson witheringly cutting Chance down to size by reminding him of his rise to power from a lowly start in life - What's it feel like to look down on your humble origins from the dizzy heights? Does it make you giddy? The location, music, lighting and camera angles make the scene highly atmospheric but what struck me in particular was the sight of the three dogs that ran through the room and then back again during the conversation. There was no apparent reason for them to be in the scene but it was a lovely addition to it. The big set pieces, such as the ball and the wedding party, again beautifully shot and lit, were sumptuous visual extravaganzas that also contained wonderful witty dialogue. The use of the contemporary techno music during the Baroque dance scene worked fabulously well, as did the stylised dancing itself. Craig Armstrong's score in general was superb and the Tiger Lillies' falsetto-voiced music hall songs suited the era perfectly. The film is also a celebration of British acting talent, with character actors, both dramatic and comic, from the main leads to the briefest, blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo role, reveling in the opportunity to camp it up and mug the camera. Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller play off each other to hilarious and touching effect in the title roles. Liv Tyler plays the sparky love interest nicely and, unlike some reviewers, I didn't have any problem with her British accent. Michael Gambon is peerless as always - that man could make a Tesco shopping list seem profound - and Ken Stott creates one of cinema's most memorable villains. Of the lesser roles, Terence Rigby's humane gaoler is a lovely touch and Claire Rushbrook is great as the pox- ridden Lady Estelle. The comedy pairings of Armstrong & Miller and Lucas & Walliams (in a precursor of his 'I'm a lady' Little Britain shtick) bring short but welcome bursts of pantomime to the proceedings. Have I forgotten anyone? Ah yes, Alan Cumming. Rochester is the role of a lifetime for him and, as many other reviewers have pointed out, he steals the film from the moment he appears in his purple hat. All of the other actors are also excellent but a special mention must go to Nichola McAuliffe as Lady Crombie. I'm amazed that no-one else has mentioned her as what she delivers in the three or four lines that she's given is pure perfection - When a brave new gentleman comes upon the scene&#x85;we ladies are quite aflutter. She hardly moves a facial muscle and her voice is almost a monotone but the effect is extraordinary. Her brief appearance really jumped out at me and I had to replay her scene a few times just to wallow in her skill. So, all in all, a fun, dark, atmospheric, anachronistic historical romp in which the bad guys get their comeuppance and the 'good' guys live to fight another day. Terrific and highly recommended.

The film is also a celebration of British acting talent, with character actors, both dramatic and comic, from the main leads to the briefest, blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo role, reveling in the opportunity to camp it up and mug the camera. Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller play off each other to hilarious and touching effect in the title roles. Liv Tyler plays the sparky love interest nicely and, unlike some reviewers, I didn't have any problem with her British accent. Michael Gambon is peerless as always - that man could make a Tesco shopping list seem profound - and Ken Stott creates one of cinema's most memorable villains. Of the lesser roles, Terence Rigby's humane gaoler is a lovely touch and Claire Rushbrook is great as the pox- ridden Lady Estelle. The comedy pairings of Armstrong & Miller and Lucas & Walliams (in a precursor of his 'I'm a lady' Little Britain shtick) bring short but welcome bursts of pantomime to the proceedings. Have I forgotten anyone? Ah yes, Alan Cumming. Rochester is the role of a lifetime for him and, as many other reviewers have pointed out, he steals the film from the moment he appears in his purple hat. All of the other actors are also excellent but a special mention must go to Nichola McAuliffe as Lady Crombie. I'm amazed that no-one else has mentioned her as what she delivers in the three or four lines that she's given is pure perfection - When a brave new gentleman comes upon the scene&#x85;we ladies are quite aflutter. She hardly moves a facial muscle and her voice is almost a monotone but the effect is extraordinary. Her brief appearance really jumped out at me and I had to replay her scene a few times just to wallow in her skill. So, all in all, a fun, dark, atmospheric, anachronistic historical romp in which the bad guys get their comeuppance and the 'good' guys live to fight another day. Terrific and highly recommended.

I never got around to it at the time and I'd forgotten about it until I saw that it was available on Netflix a couple of days ago. My wife was away so I gave it a go, thinking it was a bit of a lads' shoot 'em up adventure, which on one level it is, but it's so much more than that and it's gone straight into my all-time top 5 films. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it again the next day when my wife had returned as I thought she'd also love it, which she did (though not quite as much as me). I've never watched a film twice in two days before but I could watch it again right now as there are details that I missed each time (e.g. Armstrong & Miller's characters, Winterburn and Dixon, being named after two of Arsenal's defenders in the 1980s\/90s). The attention to detail in the film added so much for me, such as in the scene where Gibson (Michael Gambon) has a chat with Mr Chance (Ken Stott) in a circular, domed room. The dialogue is wonderful, with Gibson witheringly cutting Chance down to size by reminding him of his rise to power from a lowly start in life - What's it feel like to look down on your humble origins from the dizzy heights? Does it make you giddy? The location, music, lighting and camera angles make the scene highly atmospheric but what struck me in particular was the sight of the three dogs that ran through the room and then back again during the conversation. There was no apparent reason for them to be in the scene but it was a lovely addition to it. The big set pieces, such as the ball and the wedding party, again beautifully shot and lit, were sumptuous visual extravaganzas that also contained wonderful witty dialogue.

It blows me away every time I watch it. Filled with awesome shots and angles, and the special effects are just outstanding. So many facets of this film shocked me just because I did not expect them to be in a film from this time. The techniques and styles that I thought were more modern, results of decades of filmmaking, are actually born from this time. The models of the city, the machines, everything, was spectacular. The sets were so grand and stylized, absolutely stunning. The style of this film is breathtaking. This is my favorite film of the Expressionist era. Characteristics of other Expressionist films that I felt were too dramatic were just right in Metropolis. The acting was just right, not too over-dramatic. There were still moments of arms flailing, eyes bulging, and random, intimate, somewhat forceful embraces, but generally the performances were perfect. I love the way the underground workers performed so uniformly in their exhaustion, despair, and hope, waning hope. Maria's performance was particularly stellar to me. The make-up, the hair, use of lights and shadows, and the set design indicative of Expressionism were all excellent.A stellar story! Noticed a couple impossibly fast jumps in plot but that's something I'm seeing in every film I watch from this era. Definitely a movie with a message. Don't 100% agree with the overall moral of the film, but I was pleased by a lot of the films bits of wisdom and poetry. I think this is an incredibly important film on class differences and separation, and the exploitation of the lower class by CEOs with fat wallets and cold hearts- still applicable and hugely important in 2015. The conclusion was more tame and dreamy than it should have been, in my opinion. Nonetheless, it was an incredibly innovative and creative way to show a cultural issue. The first true science fiction epic, made in a medium that was relatively new- wow, this was an enormous endeavor and it was handled like a real visionary. Imagine taking a relatively new art form and doing things so innovative that they're still used and still impressive one hundred years later! The imagination of this filmmaker is absolutely astonishing. I am so impressed with the artistry of this film. The metaphorical sequences were a huge treat, oh man, I love that stuff. The scene with the statue of the seven sins is definitely going on my list of favorite film scenes ever. No doubt. The score is so exciting and ominous, powerful and epic, very good at conveying at setting the mood and conveying the feelings of the characters\/moment.Such an important story, told in such an amazing way- allegorical, but universally applicable, a voice for the people against injustice, a portrait of greed and corruption, the seemingly subjective value of human life, and the price some must pay, sacrificing their lives and dissolving into sweat and dirt for the benefit of the undeserving, unappreciative upper class. Truly an amazing cinematic feat.9\/10 Bye love you ","genre":null},{"date":"30 March 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" First of all, I just love this movie.
