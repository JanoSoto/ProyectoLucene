They are usually extremely disappointing, so after I had finished reading Mansfield Park and moved on to the 1999 film I wasn't expecting much. What I was expecting was for the film to follow the basic ideas that Jane Austen was trying to convey. This was not the case. From the first five minutes I felt like I must have turned on the wrong movie.William's place was taken by 'Susie', Edmund's role as Fanny's adviser and helper has become a cheesy schoolyard crush, Sir Thomas is some sort of vulgar criminal, and even Fanny herself isn't the modest and shy persona that she is in the novel.Besides not following the basic elements of the story, the actual film is confusing. I am unsure whether the part where Fanny is seen accepting Henry Crawford's proposal was reality or merely a dream sequence. Also, the focus on black slavery seems to me, so out of place as to distract from the actual story at hand.We must remember that, although Fanny Price may seem dull to some, it is what she wasn't and what Austen doesn't make her that makes Mansfield Park so interesting.The worst part of this film, that I saw, was the completely ludicrous sex scene involving Crawford and Mrs Rushworth. At this point, I stopped watching. I find it quite ridiculous that we are encouraged to believe that this would have happened under Sir Thomas' roof. It is believable that these sinful occurrences would be able to be screened by the circumstances in London, however it is evident that Sir Thomas wouldn't have allowed these two to be in the same room together alone in his own home. This completely cheapened the film.As I didn't watch further than this point, I cannot comment on the remainder of the film. I sincerely hope that it did not get any worse, if it is possible that it could get worse.I wonder why so many have decided to take a Jane Austen novel to the big screen with little to no regard for the actual story. It seems more appropriate to make your own films, based on your own inferior story lines, and leave the name of Jane Austen out of it.I feel as though the creators of this film have completely ruined my enjoyment of Mansfield Park (the book) as I am forever doomed to think of this hideous film instead of one of Austen's most entertaining novels.If you have not yet watched Mansfield Park, I urge you not to. Find a better version, if there is one, but do not waste your time with this movie. If you have not yet read Mansfield Park, please take the time to read it as Jane Austen meant it to be and don't let the movie ruin your enjoyment of it.

My Own Private Idaho falls under the same category, except, its the overwhelming sadness which engulfs us as the movie ends which makes us feel that way.Calling Gus Van Sant's My own private Idaho, a bold and imaginative film, would be an understatement. The only other film of Gus Vant Sant's that I had watched was Good will hunting and Psycho, the latter of which was more of a travesty than a remake. But I had always liked Good Will Hunting and thought it reflected his ingenuity as a director. But after watching My own private Idaho, Good Will Hunting seems to pale in comparison.My own private Idaho cannot be described in one review. It cannot even be fully appreciated in one viewing. Van Sant explores a plethora of motifs and manages to mold them together to show us the universal meaning of 'home' and how it differs with respect to each character.To Mike, home is where his mother is. As a result he spends the entire film searching for her, for which he is even willing to travel all the way to Italy. But sadly, Mike has a highly sublime image of his mother and his childhood, which are both nothing but a faux fantasy that he holds onto . To Scott however, home is just another word in the dictionary. He's the truant son of a rich Mayor and thus feels compelled to rebel. This takes him to the streets of Portland where he takes up the vocation of a gay prostitute, which is where he meets Mike, a fellow hustler. Scott is loosely based on Prince Hal, the son of the king in Shakespeare's Henry IV.Mike is also narcoleptic, a condition of the brain which causes the person to suddenly fall into brief intervals of sleep. This makes Mike's story even more sad as he has no means to support himself and thus finds himself getting picked up by strangers and waking up in different parts of the country.However, Scott is the only one who seems to take care of Mike when he needs him the most, something which gives way for a strong friendship which develops between the two and as the movie progresses, a romantic affection on Mikes part. Together they embark on a journey to find Mike's mother, which takes them from the grimy streets of Portland to the magniloquent structures of Rome.There are lots of things that strike you as odd when watching this movie, Van Sant goes as far as he can in breaking the traditional norms of movie making. The best example being how the dialogues between the hustlers are in Shakespearian prose. I am not sure whether it works well for the movie though. But it does provide for some interesting viewing, especially if you're bored with the clichéd mainstream presentation of plot points and dialogues.The movie is without doubt a visual treat. Its cinematography brightens up the film with its astounding imagery of the long sky engulfing roads and clever shots of the clouds looming above, each time Mike falls asleep. His thoughts while sleeping being described by scenes of salmons jumping upstream.This would have been just another film, with the audiences admiring the picture for its novelty and brilliance and leaving the theater not wasting another second thinking over what they had seen - if it wasn't for one person. River Phoenix, who plays Mike, literally owns My own private Idaho and this movie wouldn't have been the same without him, no offense to Van Sant .River doesn't just portray Mike, he is Mike Waters. River plays Mike to perfection. There is a certain rawness to his performance which makes his plight, his sad existence, his unrequited love for Scott and his drug addiction - all the more tragic. Ang lee might have spend millions of dollars in making a gay romance flick like Brokeback mountain, but the five minute conversation that Mike and Scott have during the campfire scene is more touching than the two hour movie could ever hope to be. Mike doesn't have a lot of dialogues but his mere presence touches your soul, as his face wears that constant grief and sadness and with one look at his face you can tell that he is wounded deep down.It was hard to believe River wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance. He did however win numerous accolades, including the best actor at the Venice film festival. Its so hard to accept the fact that he's gone and one wonders, how far he would have gone and how many brilliant performances he could have delivered.Overall, if you want a movie that makes you think, takes you beyond the usual grasps of reality into transcendentalisms and is quirky and unconventional. But mostly, if you need to watch some great performances, and in River's case, sheer excellence, then this is the movie for you. My own private Idaho can either be loved dearly to the point of obsession or thought of as trite and chucked down the dustbin. Either way, you'll remember the story of Mike Waters and reminisce about him with pain, long after you've seen it.The movie has its flaws, but at the end of the day when put together, the salmons and clouds do help us in understanding what and how different the term 'home' can be, which is what this movie is essentially about. So my review-o-meter points to a nine out of ten for this bold and piquant masterpiece, that thoroughly deserves its cult status, to which it has been elevated.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"8 February 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Deliverance (1972)**** (out of 4)Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox plays friends from the city who decide to go to the country so that they can white water before the river is turned into a lake. The trip starts off fine but soon the four are working against the odds to get off the river with their lives after they encounter a couple rednecks. To me this is one of the greatest films of the decade but I think it's also one of the most chilling ever made and still packs a wonderful punch after all these years. To me the movie is about nature and trying to survive in it no matter what gets thrown at you. Out of the four characters only one, Reynolds, claims to know what he's doing yet as the men get closer into darkness the other find themselves trying to fight through their own fears. The movie has one great sequence after another and so many memorable moments including the terrific Dueling Banjos sequence, which of course eventually leads to the nightmarish sequence in the woods that everyone knows about now. The pig sequence has become someone of a joke now due to everything that's been on television but to me this scene still packs one hell of a punch because of how terrifying it is. The performances by Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are downright chilling and really add to the terrifying situation these men are faced with. The nightmarish tone, almost like a horror film, doesn't end here because the rest of their trip down the river will have the viewer holding their breath because of the unknown, which is going to follow. I always thought the river played a big part in the film because it seems when the water is calm so are the men. It gives them a chance to breathe but when the rapids pick up so does the dangerous situations going through them. The calmness before the rape leads to the men leaving in a rush, confused and not knowing exactly what's to follow and then they run into the faster rapids again. The calmness then brings them to the next situation of the mountain, which is a brilliantly executed sequence. Another major plus is some wonderful cinematography, which to me is among the best ever in a film. The way the camera makes the river and locations a part of the story also adds a chilling effect. Even the performances are rather remarkable with all four leads bringing so much personality and development to their characters. I'm really not sure Reynolds was ever better and Voight gives another terrific performance during this hot part of his career, which started a few years earlier with Midnight Cowboy. While the banjo and rape sequences have become the best known I still think the greatest moment in the movie is right after the rape when the men have to discuss what to do. The performances and dialogue really makes this sequence one of the most memorable from the decade, which was full of great movies.

The trip starts off fine but soon the four are working against the odds to get off the river with their lives after they encounter a couple rednecks. To me this is one of the greatest films of the decade but I think it's also one of the most chilling ever made and still packs a wonderful punch after all these years. To me the movie is about nature and trying to survive in it no matter what gets thrown at you. Out of the four characters only one, Reynolds, claims to know what he's doing yet as the men get closer into darkness the other find themselves trying to fight through their own fears. The movie has one great sequence after another and so many memorable moments including the terrific Dueling Banjos sequence, which of course eventually leads to the nightmarish sequence in the woods that everyone knows about now. The pig sequence has become someone of a joke now due to everything that's been on television but to me this scene still packs one hell of a punch because of how terrifying it is. The performances by Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are downright chilling and really add to the terrifying situation these men are faced with. The nightmarish tone, almost like a horror film, doesn't end here because the rest of their trip down the river will have the viewer holding their breath because of the unknown, which is going to follow. I always thought the river played a big part in the film because it seems when the water is calm so are the men. It gives them a chance to breathe but when the rapids pick up so does the dangerous situations going through them. The calmness before the rape leads to the men leaving in a rush, confused and not knowing exactly what's to follow and then they run into the faster rapids again. The calmness then brings them to the next situation of the mountain, which is a brilliantly executed sequence. Another major plus is some wonderful cinematography, which to me is among the best ever in a film. The way the camera makes the river and locations a part of the story also adds a chilling effect. Even the performances are rather remarkable with all four leads bringing so much personality and development to their characters. I'm really not sure Reynolds was ever better and Voight gives another terrific performance during this hot part of his career, which started a few years earlier with Midnight Cowboy. While the banjo and rape sequences have become the best known I still think the greatest moment in the movie is right after the rape when the men have to discuss what to do. The performances and dialogue really makes this sequence one of the most memorable from the decade, which was full of great movies.

While I agree that Jurassic Park is the better film, The Lost World is a very good film as well.Ian Malcolm and three others travel to Isla Sorna. While they are there to just observe the dinosaurs and how they have adapted. A group of hunters\/entrepeaneurs travel to the island as well intent on capturing various dinosaurs and putting them into a zoo back in the United States.The story is pretty easy to follow. I like how they expanded the story from the first film and make references to Jurassic Park as well.Acting was very good for the most part. Jeff Goldblum is awesome as always and though many people miss Grant in this film, I think that Malciolm is cool to see as the lead character. I did not really like Julianne Moore as the female lead in this film. NOt anywhere near as good as Laura Dern in Jurassic Park.THe dinosaurs made this film. The velociraptors return and are as scary and terrifying as always. Computer graphics are used a lot for the dinosaurs in this film and for the most part it all looks pretty good and realistic.The Tyrannosaurus returns. For me the Tyrannosaurus made the film and is the main reason it is such a good film. Tyrannosaurus gets in a lot of action going after the hunting party, pushing trailers off cliffs, and going on a rampage through the city. I love how they pay respect to the original Lost World film by bringing the Tyrannosaurus back to the city the same way in the original Lost World they bring back a Brontosaurus. Tyrannosaurus going on a rampage through the city works so well and is the best part of the film. In fact the rampage Tyrannosaurus goes on is better than what the 1997 Godzilla did.The Tyrannosaurus is not just a rampaging monster in this film. Also it is portrayed as being a very loving and caring parent in how it takes care of its baby. Tyrannosaurus takes very good care of its baby in this film and I like how they added these parenting scenes.There also are a few new dinosaurs that appear in this film including Pachysaphalasaurus, Parasaurolophus, and Compsognathus. New dinosaurs are always good to see.I love this film. Jeff Goldblum is great, there is lots of action, but the Tyrannosaurus for me made the film. Highly recommended.

This film is so unusual that it could have only come from a dream, which is exactly where the director got the idea. Sometimes that's where the best ideas come from. This film has a few things going for it, which I'll mention before I harp on it.Angus Scrimm created a horror icon in the Tall Man. I prefer his character in Phantasm II to this film, but he still does a creepy fine job. Reggie Bannister as, well, Reggie, was lame in this movie, but he seemed much improved for the sequel. Still, I liked the character of Reggie in the movie, even if most of his lines were bad and weren't delivered well at all. The sweeping runs through the mortuary corridors were great, reminding me of One Dark Night(though Phantasm makes that film look like a school film class project). The silver ball had limited screen time, and one wishes the red POV would have gotten a little more presence in the film. I think the best thing about the movie is the plot. It's so different from anything else up to that point, you can't help but have some admiration for it and also wonder how the director sold the idea of this picture to get the funds. A possibly indestructible alien(?) and a league of undead dwarfs run a funeral home with a secret gateway inside that leads to another planet and possibly another dimension. The music was great. I think it owed a lot to some Italian horror soundtracks of the time, and is just as creepy as any tracks John Carpenter ever wrote. A very memorable theme.The ending of the film is the worst. It is slipshod and feels like it was tacked on. I know the original idea for the film had a runtime of close to 3 hours, but certainly more could have been done with the ending. Jody's fate seemed like an afterthought, and how much of the film was supposed to be real up until the ending? And, ewww, did both Tommy and Jody make out with the Tall Man and did Tommy have sex with him in the guise of that nasty beast of a girl with the horrid robin's-egg-blue eye shadow? Now, that is scary. Also, I hated the repeated shots of the funeral home exterior from the exact same angle in several shots. I'm not sure if they just kept recycling the footage of that shot or what, but it was annoying.The DVD includes a few deleted scenes, the best of which should have been left in the film. Within the mortuary, Mike and Jody encountered the Tall Man, with Jody unloading his pump shotgun into the weirdo, but having no effect, Jody and Mike get slapped around a bit. Mike remembered the Tall Man's aversion to cold and sprays him with the fire extinguisher with gooey results. That could have been left in the movie and still used the same ending to maintain the Tall Man's indestructible nature.I'm not a huge fan of the Phantasm series as a whole, I think III and IV are not that great. I love part II, which was actually the first of the series I ever saw(I can still remember seeing the great trailers on TV). The original is still pretty good, if you can overlook the bad editing, the often rancid acting and dialogue, and the insipid finale. You'll be hard-pressed to find much more original fare in terms of old horror. Maybe a remake would be better than a part V.

This presents an interesting dichotomy in her desires does she want to reclaim him strictly for financial rewards, or, is there a part of her that really cares for his well-being and wants him back in the fold with the other children?

It appears to be populated entirely by robots but, on investigation they find that it is commanded by the scientist Dr Hans Reinhardt. His plan is to guide it directly into a black hole, through it and out into whatever lies beyond. Durant and his crew do not believe this is possible and attempt to leave, only to find that they are not free to do so.I had vague memories of this film from childhood &#150; specifically the robots &#150; but not really enough of an impression to state an opinion on it. As a result (well, more of my anally retentive viewing habits) I decided to watch it again the other day and see how it played. For the vast majority of the film the answer is not well because the very simple plot mostly involves running, lasers-firing or comedy robots failing to be entertaining or endearing. This is how it goes but I do acknowledge that part of this is me watching a 30 year old Disney film as a man in my 30's as opposed to a child. I was tempted to switch it off but I stuck with it and found myself surprised by some of the content.For a Disney film it is remarkably dark with some very creepy images and ideas making their way into it. The ending is of course the best example of this and, although narratively unsatisfying, it is really very weird and unnerving &#150; even as an adult. It feels like these parts are a different film though and the failing is that they are not woven into the film so much as feeling stuck on. Had this darkness been expanded and perhaps the many scenes of lasers been reduced then this could have been a much better film. The script is where this needed to happen but sadly the limited dialogue is mostly poor and there are no dialogue scenes that match or support the visually darker moments. Speaking of matters visual, the film has a mix of special effects. Some are impressive and imposing but then on the flip side we also have these kiddie-friendly robots (Disney's attempt at C3PO and R2D2) that look cheap and don't appeal as characters.Unsurprisingly given what I have said, the cast don't make much of an impression. Perkins, Forster, Mimieux and Borgnine all run around but the only one that sticks in the memory is Schell. Well, perhaps I should say that the only person that sticks in the mind is Schell since the robot Maximillian also makes an impression and is a pretty good creation even if his body is a bit too clunky and his weapons look a little like comical egg-whisks.The Black Hole is not a classic Disney film and it feels very much like what it is &#150; a rather opportunistic attempt to get in on the back of Star Wars' success. Mostly it is a bit too basic and childish to offer anything of interest to older or even modern viewers &#150; but I do say mostly. It is mostly because the film has dark ideas and visuals that cry out to be fleshed out and spread across the film and it is frustrating to see really engaging and creepy ideas and images tacked on in the way they are.

For those old enough to talk a girl to a movie to see this film, it is a great comedy and satire. To the younger generations, with different moral codes, many of the scenes probably don't make sense. For example, who knows about the magazine called U.S. Camera? It was one of the few magazines that showed completely nude women. This got by the censures because it was considered art, and was before Playboy. You could buy girlie mags, but they were not considered proper in a married middle class home. The other other decent magazine that had naturally nude women was when the Geographic was doing a piece on the South Seas, or life in Africa.Middle class married men were not any different than those today, except the trysts were usually more circumspect. And that is what makes this flick funnier to we grey hairs. Traveling salesman jokes were so popular at the time because they had respectable jobs, and had more opportunities to play around and not get caught by their wives. Married men with routine jobs had to be more inventive.Comedy that plays on universal subjects such as human nature and sex. Some films become dated because you must be alive to understand the subtle references. Unles you have a degree in some period of time.This film will be a classic forever, despite some of humor lost on younger generations. There is enough timeless comedy to keep this film alive for generations. If someone can not see something special in Marilyn Monroe, they must not be a normal male, of any generation.Tom Ewell is perfect in his roll. Like most men, he is not very handsome or sexy, but sees himself attractive to ALL females, even a Marilyn Monroe. The seven year itch is a reference to that time that comes in every marriage when romance gives way to routine. A man wants to return to his youth. (Which explains why so many older men are married to trophy wives-if they can afford them).I have not discussed how women might view this. Knowing what women think becomes more difficult as one grows older. I suspect that they may found humor in how men see themselves as young and viral, and begin to delude themselves. This phenomenon is similar to the non-combatants in any war, who begin to think and tell others of their heroic deeds of their youth.The first scenes, showing the original inhabitants of Manhatten are intended to show that as far a sex is concerned, nothing has changed.

Being a decade for teen movies there were quite a few that had them seeing a monster yet not having anyone believe them so on that level this film isn't too original but on an entertainment level I think this is one of the best out there. The film has an ultra low-budget but that doesn't hamper the film at all as it looks very good and professional. The special effects of the blob are pretty good for their time even though some of the longer shots are obviously fake. What makes the film so much fun is that no one will believe us mentality that the kids must battle along with the parents not believing them and the fact that they have to figure out a way to kill the monster. Added fun comes from seeing McQueen doing a movie like this. I've read he wasn't too thrilled with doing a movie like this but he certainly gives it his all and manages to turn in a good, if somewhat over the top, performance. He was 28 at the time of filming so having him play a teenager is a bit of a stretch but again, it doesn't take away from any of the fun. Another plus is that the film is in color, which was a rather rare thing for this type of movie, which were usually in B&W. Yet another strong aspect is the ending, which is just downright classic as the blob goes after people in a movie theater, which just happens to be showing a horror double feature.

They're together, but always apart....she a lady by night and hawk by day, he man by day and wolf at night. This is a beautiful film, wonderfully written, hauntingly filmed, and great performances all around by the cast. I know the score is a popular debate, you either love it or hate it. I loved it, it's a blend unlike any other i've ever heard and stands out rather than blend in like so many others.Rutger Hauer gives a powerful and convincing performance as the handsome, brooding, captain of the guards who is cursed, outlawed and hunted, his only crime falling in love with a beautiful woman.And she is beautiful too, the luminous Michelle Pfeiffer absolutely lights up the screen every scene she appears in. Not only is she beautiful, but also smart, kind and compassionate. Thankfully she's not the typical damsel in distress who stands by and does nothing. I was completely sold as to why Hauer would give his very life to protect her. This was the movie that made me a lifelong fan of Pfeiffer.Matthew Broderick was perfect in the part of Phillipe, it was nice to be able to see him stretch himself in range and play a different kind of role than i'd become accustomed to watching him in. John Wood was excellent as the sadistic Bishop who cursed the couple in his desire for Pfeiffer. I was really convinced of his downright evilness. And last but not least, I really enjoyed Leo McKern, the drunken priest who betrayed the couple to the Bishop. He finds redemption in helping to break the curse and defeat the Bishop. For those who haven't seen it, I don't dare think of giving it away.Also, an evil little cameo by Alfred Molina, years before most people knew who he was. As mystical as this movie is it doesn't rely on a whole lot of special effects overwhelming it. (Of course this was before CGI was around.) But still it wisely decides to rely on the emotions and ability of the actors, director and scenery to convey the story.A really beautiful, soulful, mystical film.

This one here manages to have a very good screenplay by director Russell and Frank Darabont who not only know what to borrow from the original film but what to add it to make it better for the times. Both men are also smart enough to keep the action going at a rapid pace but also to throw some nice humor in as well. One of the funniest sequences in the film deals with the buying of condoms but I won't ruin the pay off to this joke. The movie also manages to use the movie theater, a set piece from the original, to good charm with the man constantly talking and giving away important notes to a horror movie being shown. This works good as a homage to the original as well as a note on the trend of slashers that were out during this period. The screenplay manages to throw in all sorts of great stuff from the rebel kid to the jerk cop but it also manages to be a fairly good device at letting the rebel and cheerleader's characters actually grow throughout the film. Some of the scientist things get a bit overblown but this doesn't take away any of the film's charm. Dillon makes for a great leading man and really delivers a wonderful performance just because of how fun he is to watch. He brings the perfect attitude to this punk and his smartass one-liners are priceless. Smith, one who many had a crush on when this was originally released, makes for a strong female character, although you can't help but think many of her actions were influenced by Aliens. The special effects were among some of the greatest for their era and they still hold up very well and have the ability to impress those who are just familiar with CGI. The creature looks incredibly good and the way it kills is very memorable as are many of the death scenes including an infamous one dealing with a sink. In the end this is an incredibly fun popcorn movies that has plenty of great action, some nice suspense, great characters and a smart screenplay to bring everything home. Well worth viewing.

Cates is arrested for teaching Darwin's theory on evolution in his classroom. Famous lawyer Henry Drummond is brought in to defend his right to teach such a theory. In opposition on the prosecution side is preaching fundamentalist\/ politician Matthew Brady, whom the town dearly loves.Inherit The Wind is based on the real life farcical case in 1925 Tennessee, where John T Scopes stood trial for violating state laws appertaining to material taught to children in class. It became known as The Monkey Trial, and here we get the film version of that trial, cobbling together bits from the transcript of the trial and using dialogue taken from the play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E Lee. Inherit The Wind perfectly captures the stupidity of that court case, excellently photographed by Ernest Laszlo, and directed with aplomb by Stanley Kramer to me a career high, it ultimately climbs thru the roof of greatness on account of two blunderbuss performances from Spencer Tracy & Fredric March as Drummond and Brady respectively. Anyone proclaiming these two performances as overacting should quite frankly be punched repeatedly in the face, for it's a lesson in emotional driven acting of the highest order. Bolstering the show is Gene Kelly offering slimy comic relief out in the wings, Harry Morgan as the judge caught between the two balls of fury, and a smashing little turn from Fredric March's real life wife Florence Eldridge, as ironically, Brady's erstwhile spouse.Inherit The Wind was nominated for four Academy Awards, not winning any in what was a great year for cinema, but really it doesn't matter because the film stands up even today as a monument of great acting and a lesson in just how skew whiff things can get in the name of tired old beliefs and religion gone berserker. Watching it now, i still find myself pondering just how far forward the world has got in its pursuit of adequate teachings, but hey, that's just me, hopefully you will watch this film and not only be entertained royally, but also be forced to think a little more about its subject matter. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 February 2009","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" B.T.
