[{"date":"30 July 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Please.  This was a sometimes funny, mostly tedious movie that went NOWHERE. I fully expected this to be a dark comedy from the setup, where the characters introduce themselves by saying things like I don't know exactly what happened, things just got out of control.  As the movie developed, I waited for the payoff, but there was none!  Things NEVER got out of control!  The acting was the one saving grace in this movie.  Reese Witherspoon was delightful, Chris Klein made a solid debut, and Matthew Broderick was convincingly neurotic.  Despite the performances by the cast, I was highly disappointed.  After a decent first half-hour, the film began to meander, hitting the same jokes over and over again (Tracy's overbearing mother, Tammy's back-stabbing friend, etc.).  I know this sounds callous, but I think that for this movie to really work it would have had to have somebody get killed.  The ingredients are all there a girl driven to succeed at all costs and a teacher consumed by a need to stop her... it was just asking for a murder.  I really thought that Tammy's comment about the power lines at the beginning of the movie was foreshadowing a death, too. Alas, the movie just wound down to a point where it seems like the filmmakers said ok, it's been 90 minutes, that's enough, let's go home. Oh well.

But even this can't console the empty feeling that remains after seeing this disaster of a movie.The gags are so old that I could easily imagine Kenneth Williams or Charles Hawtrey singing half of the catch phrases (oh behave? Oh brother!).  There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen before.  OK - so maybe I laughed once or twice at the beginning, but a film that relies on so few (weak) jokes, over and over, is an insult to those watching it.It's supposed to be a parody of the bond films - but this is perhaps the vital error.  Bond films, by their very nature, never take themselves seriously - parodying a parody just doesn't work!I don't mind admitting that if it wasn't for Heather Graham's 'breathtaking performance' I could have comfortably slept through the whole thing.  Please Mike Myers, change the record.

It was very distracting to have to put up with traditional horror movie fans' rude behavior during the showing I attended. Please, if you don't like documentary style films, or if you have to be bombarded with special effects and gore to have a good time at the movies; do everyone a favor and stay home! This is a nice little intimate film that will crawl up your spine and into your head if you let it. In between the times I was yelling at people to shut up, I was genuinely spooked by this movie. I think all of the hype about the film has drawn in a lot of viewers who are expecting something else. This movie doesn't force itself upon you, it will only scare you if a allow it to. This apparently takes more concentration than general audiences have. Rent this when it comes out on tape and enjoy.
