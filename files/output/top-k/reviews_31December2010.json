[{"date":"31 December 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is an exquisite film about villainy that pushes heroism off the stage and gives Matt Damon the space to demonstrate why he's had a much more successful acting career than Ben Affleck. Damon creates a character who then recreates himself as another person and infuses it all with an emotional directness from which you can't look away.Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a strange young man living a strange life in late 1950s New York City. Tom is full of great ability and possesses tremendous discipline, enough to be a professional-level pianist. Yet, he's nothing more than a men's room attendant at an opera house and lives in a rundown basement apartment. There's a void inside Tom that he tries to cover up with lies and mimicry but he always knows it's there and it fills him with a crippling self-loathing that renders Tom Ripley a timid bystander to his own life.By chance, Tom meets and impresses the wealthy Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn), who hires Tom as an emissary to his spoiled and irresolute son. Tom, who's passed himself off as a Princeton classmate of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), is supposed to go to Italy and talk Dickie into returning to New York. When Tom meets Dickie and his beautiful fiancée Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), he settles on a very different agenda. He ingratiates himself into Dickie and Marge's expatriate lives, becoming the poor country mouse that only wants to be near the more feline Dickie. Dickie Greenleaf is everything that Tom Ripley has ever wanted to be. For a while, Dickie enjoys having a sidekick who's so out of place in his world of the idle rich. While Tom looks like an accountant for the FBI and acts like a needy and nervous waiter who's standing at your table, listening to your conversation, Dickie shines like the Sun. And like the Sun, the warmth of his attention can be glorious and then terribly cold when it's gone. But when Dickie decides he's had enough of his country mouse, that violently launches Tom on a voyage of shared identities that seems to give him everything he's ever wanted&#x85;only to have it all slip away.The Talented Mr. Ripley focuses on a variety of human evil that you don't see much in stories. Tom isn't crazy or malevolent or anything that you'd consider all that bad. He's just broken inside and tries to fix that by grafting himself onto other people. It's not emotionally healthy, but it's not something that would necessarily lead to evil. What sets Tom down a dark road is actually the darker nature of Dickie. Without Dickie pushing him in the wrong direction, Tom might never have been more than a clingy non-entity who drifts through a life of unacknowledged desperation. This movie treats evil not as a singular drive, but as the unfortunate product of the wrong people coming together at the wrong time. Tom ends up doing many awful things. However, he likely wouldn't have done any of it if Dickie hadn't provoked him into that first wrong step.Damon's performance is almost spellbinding and Jude Law isn't far behind. These are two young actors letting their talent expand out into every nook and cranny of their roles. Gwyneth Paltrow's character is less active. Marge functions in the story as a reflection of the audience's view of Tom and Dickie and how it changes throughout the story. When Marge finally recognizes Tom's true nature, Paltrow fills her with the sort of overwhelming terror that a thousand crappy slasher flicks have tried and failed to ignite.Binding those performances together is a smartly written script that strings a thread of realism throughout The Talented Mr. Ripley and prevents it from spinning into melodrama. Plans are hatched and then come undone, not because of one-in-a-million coincidences but because of the sort of mistakes people can't help making.If you haven't already seen it, make an effort to watch this movie. It'll only disappoint you if you want it to be dumber than what it is.

He gets a posting to Fort Hays where the commander, clearly insane, posts him on to a far-flung outpost, which he finds deserted. Finding himself alone, he is befriended by a lone wolf he calls Two-Socks. Eventually he attracts the attention of a tribe of Sioux Indians. After a rather faltering start the two sides slowly learn to trust one another. Dunbar makes friends, including, Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair who show him the ways of the Plains people. There is also a white woman among the tribe, Stands With a Fist; she was taken in when she lost her family at a very young age. She acts as interpreter and, eventually, she becomes very close to the young Lieutenant. There is a cloud on the horizon, however, Dunbar knows that the white men are coming and this cannot be good for the tribe.This is an epic film with some tremendous vistas; I would love to have seen it on the big screen.

Like Michael Dorsey, the character played by Dustin Hoffman in that film, the hero Daniel Hillard is an out-of-work actor who spends much of the movie pretending to be a woman. Their motives for female impersonation, however, are different. Michael, unable to find work as an actor, thinks that he will have more success if he becomes an actress. Daniel has recently been though a harrowing divorce from his wife Miranda, who has been awarded custody of their three children. Although Daniel loves his children deeply, he only has limited visitation rights, so in order to spend more time with them he uses his acting skills to disguise himself as a 60-year-old British nanny, whom he names Euphegenia Doubtfire. In his new persona he applies for, and obtains, a job as Miranda's housekeeper.(Mrs Doubtfire is referred to in the script as English, but her accent is definitely Scottish. Her surname, in the context of the film, was taken from a newspaper headline reading Police doubt fire was accidental, but it does appear to be a genuine one. The name Euphegenia, probably a portmanteau of Euphemia and Iphigenia, seems to be Daniel's own invention).Tootsie was (among other things) a satire on sexist attitudes in the workplace. Mrs Doubtfire is (among other things) an analysis of gender roles in late twentieth-century society and a critique of American divorce law. Most contested child-custody cases end with custody being given to the mother, largely because of the assumption that women are the caring, nurturing sex and that the father's role is to act as the family breadwinner, a role which, it is assumed, can be performed just as well by an absent father as by a present one. Feminists have been strangely reluctant to criticise this assumption, even though it rests upon woman's place is in the home stereotypes which, in other contexts, they would be the first to denounce as outdated.There is a good deal of satire in the film at the expense of the American court system and the way in which it handles matrimonial cases. The social worker appointed by the Court to report on the child custody issue is a particular figure of fun. In Britain, social workers are often caricatured as right-on politically correct liberals. In America, to judge from the film, it would seem that they are ultra-conservative old ladies who still think that they are living in the 1950s.Mrs Doubtfire also questions some of our basic assumptions about the sexes. Daniel is not very successful in his career, although he clearly has talent as an actor. It is Miranda, a successful businesswoman, who is the family's main breadwinner. Yet it is Daniel who comes across as the more caring and empathetic in his relationship with the children. Although Miranda means well she is too distant and preoccupied with her business to have much time for them. After her divorce much she is forced to delegate much of their care to the supposed Mrs Doubtfire- care which before the divorce would have been undertaken by their father. Daniel's main fault as a father was that he has been too indulgent with his children and has failed to discipline them. Paradoxically, it is only when he adopts a feminine personality that he is able to become a firm father-figure.The obvious temptation would have been to have turned the film into a sentimental comedy of remarriage by making Miranda's new boyfriend Stuart (played by a pre-Bond Pierce Brosnan) an obvious villain and by having Daniel and Miranda living together again by the end of the film, much to the delight of their children. This temptation was, however, resisted, and I think that was the right decision. The film bravely acknowledges that love does not always conquer all and that not all marriages are made in heaven; it ends, however, with a plea to parents to put the interests of their children first, even when their won relationship is breaking down.It would, however, be wrong to analyse this film solely in terms of social issues. It is, first and foremost, a comedy, and a very successful one. Daniel and his alter ego Mrs Doubtfire are both played by Robin Williams, probably the ideal actor for the role because of his talent as a mimic and his ability to do all sorts of comic voices. Largely because of Williams's talents, the film is one of the funniest American movies of the nineties, with some brilliantly conceived and acted scenes, including his voice-overs for the Pudgy the Parrot cartoons, the anarchic birthday party he throws for his son and just about everything he does in his Doubtfire persona. Along with Good Morning, Vietnam, Dead Poets Society and One Hour Photo this is one of Williams's greatest films. It is certainly his funniest performance. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 December 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Mrs. Doubtfire has a lot in common with Tootsie, another cross-dressing comedy from around a decade earlier.

Feminists have been strangely reluctant to criticise this assumption, even though it rests upon woman's place is in the home stereotypes which, in other contexts, they would be the first to denounce as outdated.There is a good deal of satire in the film at the expense of the American court system and the way in which it handles matrimonial cases. The social worker appointed by the Court to report on the child custody issue is a particular figure of fun. In Britain, social workers are often caricatured as right-on politically correct liberals. In America, to judge from the film, it would seem that they are ultra-conservative old ladies who still think that they are living in the 1950s.Mrs Doubtfire also questions some of our basic assumptions about the sexes. Daniel is not very successful in his career, although he clearly has talent as an actor. It is Miranda, a successful businesswoman, who is the family's main breadwinner. Yet it is Daniel who comes across as the more caring and empathetic in his relationship with the children. Although Miranda means well she is too distant and preoccupied with her business to have much time for them. After her divorce much she is forced to delegate much of their care to the supposed Mrs Doubtfire- care which before the divorce would have been undertaken by their father. Daniel's main fault as a father was that he has been too indulgent with his children and has failed to discipline them. Paradoxically, it is only when he adopts a feminine personality that he is able to become a firm father-figure.The obvious temptation would have been to have turned the film into a sentimental comedy of remarriage by making Miranda's new boyfriend Stuart (played by a pre-Bond Pierce Brosnan) an obvious villain and by having Daniel and Miranda living together again by the end of the film, much to the delight of their children. This temptation was, however, resisted, and I think that was the right decision. The film bravely acknowledges that love does not always conquer all and that not all marriages are made in heaven; it ends, however, with a plea to parents to put the interests of their children first, even when their won relationship is breaking down.It would, however, be wrong to analyse this film solely in terms of social issues. It is, first and foremost, a comedy, and a very successful one. Daniel and his alter ego Mrs Doubtfire are both played by Robin Williams, probably the ideal actor for the role because of his talent as a mimic and his ability to do all sorts of comic voices. Largely because of Williams's talents, the film is one of the funniest American movies of the nineties, with some brilliantly conceived and acted scenes, including his voice-overs for the Pudgy the Parrot cartoons, the anarchic birthday party he throws for his son and just about everything he does in his Doubtfire persona. Along with Good Morning, Vietnam, Dead Poets Society and One Hour Photo this is one of Williams's greatest films. It is certainly his funniest performance. 9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family"},{"date":"31 December 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched this film with preconceived expectations that it would be a masterpiece seeing as how it derived from the masterpiece that is Anne Rice's novel and due to the cast that's brimming with talent.

It should have starred Tom Cruise and Angelina Jolie. But you know CASTING in Hollywood SUCKS BIG TIME.Stone looks like an OLD B*TCH in the film and Douglas and OLD F*RT.The story could have been even better but no, after the opening and the mediocre sex scene between Douglas and Stone it gets worse and worse. I think even Lolita (old and new) is better than Basic Instinct and even The Realm Of The Senses, an erotic Japanese film based on a true story. If you have nothing better to do, go out for a meal or a walk than waste time on this.The film is handicapped by the censorship. Anyways who wants to see Douglas and Stone in uncensored positions. Cruise and Jolie would have been more tasty......Plot a wealthy former rock star, Johnny Boz (Bill Cable), is brutally stabbed to death with an ice pick during sexual intercourse, homicide detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) is sent to investigate. The only suspect is Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), a crime novelist who was the last person to be seen with Boz on the night he died. During questioning at police headquarters,Catherine engages in provocative behavior, refusing to extinguish her cigarette and uncrossing her legs under her short skirt, revealing she isn't wearing underwear.Because he accidentally shot a pair of tourists in an earlier case (while high on cocaine), Nick also attends counseling sessions with police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner.Nick learns that Catherine's parents were killed when she was an adolescent, leaving her a fortune, that when she was majoring in psychology, her counselor at college was also murdered with an ice pick, and that Catherine's fiancé, a boxer, was killed in the ring. He also discovers that Catherine makes a habit of befriending murderers, including a woman who stabbed her husband and children for no apparent reason.During a visit to her house, Catherine taunts Nick with information that should be confidential. As police psychologist, Beth is the only person with access to that information. When Nick confronts Beth, she admits that she handed his file to Nilsen, who threatened to discharge Nick if he couldn't evaluate Nick directly. An enraged Nick storms into Nilsen's office, assaults him, and accuses him of having sold Nick's file to Catherine. Nilsen then suspends Nick, who goes home, spending the evening drinking. Beth visits him, but after a heated argument, he throws her out. Later that night, Nilsen is found in his car, dead from a single gunshot to the head. Because of their recent altercation, Nick is the prime suspect.A torrid affair between Nick and Catherine begins with the air of a cat-and-mouse game. Catherine explains that she will base her next novel's character - a cop falling for the wrong woman only to be killed by her - on Nick, while at the same time he declares his love for her and his unchanged intention to nail her for Boz's murder. A jealous Roxy tries to run Nick over with Catherine's car, but after a car chase she is killed in a crash. Her death reveals that she too had a murderous past. After Roxy's death, Catherine seems genuinely shocked, which makes Nick doubt her guilt. Catherine also reveals that a previous lesbian encounter at college went amiss, when the girl became obsessed with her. Nick, trying to learn more about the events, identifies the girl as Beth Garner, who acknowledges the encounter, but claims it was Catherine that became obsessed. When checking on Beth's background, he learns that her husband was shot several years earlier under unsolved circumstances, that Beth had another lesbian affair, and that Nilsen had investigated these connections the year before.When visiting Catherine, she explains that she has finished her book, and coldly ends the affair. Upset, Nick meets Gus, who has arranged to meet with Catherine's college roommate at a hotel. As the suspended Nick waits in the car, Gus enters the hotel and is stabbed in the elevator by a hooded figure, in the way described in Catherine's new book. Nick figures out there is trouble brewing and runs into the building, but he arrives too late to save Gus from bleeding to death. Hearing the floor creak, Nick grabs Gus's gun and turns to find Beth standing in the hallway, explaining she received a message to meet Gus there. However, Nick suspects that she murdered Gus, and as Beth moves her hand in her pocket, he shoots her. With her final breath, Beth tells Nick that she loves him. A dejected Nick checks her pocket, only to find her keys. The police arrive, and in a staircase discover a blond wig, a SFPD raincoat, and an ice pick, the weapon used to murder Gus, concluding that Beth ditched the items when she heard Nick coming up. A search of Beth's apartment turns up the evidence needed to brand her as the killer of Boz, Gus, Nilsen, and presumably her own husband - the matching revolver, Catherine's novels, and photos chronicling the writer's life.Nick returns to his apartment, where he is visited by Catherine. She explains her reluctance to commit to him, but then the two make love. Afterward, the conversation turns toward their possible future as a couple. While talking, Nick turns his back on Catherine as she slowly reaches for something underneath the bed. Catherine stops when Nick senses her stillness; he looks around with distrust in his eyes, and she throws her arms around him and the two resume making love as the camera slowly pans down to show what she was reaching for under the bed an ice pick.

","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"31 December 2010","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" 2001 A Space Odyssey is a 1968 science fiction film by Stanley Kubrick (who happens to be my favourite director as well). Being my favorite film, I have recommended this it to almost everyone I know. This review is more like an answer to those who found this film slow-paced, and for those yet to watch it, you may continue to read this as a disclaimer to the film- I'll give you a word- Beauty Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinema-goers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.'2001\u2032 requires you to watch it, in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different kinds of film (this being the best of all), and to enjoy '2001\u2032 you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.'2001\u2032 is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minute details because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes including an amazing jump cut sequence). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief &#x96; I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth. Man has indeed evolved As a spectacle 2001\u2033 assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions. We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment.The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the Starchild returning home to charm the orb. 2001\u2033 is filled with poetic imagery the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet. 2001\u2033 is also a work of great visual acuity. It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man. Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery. They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question. Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film. But for those who can accept mysticism, the climax is deeply moving.2001\u2033 is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, or Van Gogh's The Starry Night. It is actually more than that!

Was this a case of unfinished business, or sticking with a popular trend? A bit of both, in all likelihood. Yojinbo had been number one at the box office in Japan, and there was pressure from the studio to resurrect its hero. Nevertheless Kurosawa, who was known to have despaired at the new trend of violent no-brainers that Yojinbo inevitably spawned, as well as the gangsterism that was rife in Japanese society at the time, also works in a typically eloquent anti-violence message.However perhaps the main thing that Sanjuro really has going for it is that, rather than just making it Yojinbo 2, Kurosawa decided to add a new gimmick &#x96; comedy. In line with the director's visual style, most of the humour originates from movement, visual arrangements, symmetry and so forth, for example the line of men trailing behind Toshiro Mifune as they spy on the chamberlain's house, a gag very much in the style of Ernst Lubitsch's silent comedies. None of this is really laugh-out-loud funny, with the exception of the quiet victory dance towards the end, but it keeps up a general light-hearted tone which is fun to watch. It seems that there are also a handful of jokes in amongst the dialogue too, although verbal humour is notoriously difficult to translate. At one point there is a rather awkward pun about someone born in the year of the cow trying to horn in, which for all I know might be hilarious in the original Japanese.Kurosawa's direction is precise and beautifully stylised as ever. He has a very distinctive use of the widescreen format, placing groups of eight or ten characters in more or less equal focus at any one time. He keeps order in these potentially chaotic shots by carefully controlling the movement. Actors tend to stay stock still when they are not speaking, but then become very animated when they say a line, allowing our eyes to easily dart from one part of the screen to the next, without the need for any jarring cuts. This is crucial in Sanjuro, which has many scenes of debate and discussion. His handling of action scenes is as balletic and graceful as it was in Yojinbo. However he does not appear to have worked as hard at making each example unique and distinctive as he did in the earlier picture, and the half-dozen sword fights in this one start to become a bit tedious.One of the biggest draws in Sanjuro's predecessor was the presence of its star Toshiro Mifune, who won several awards for his performance as the grudgingly moral ronin. He is just as good this time round, if anything giving the character a slightly more natural, lived-in look. He is constantly busy, bringing out the intelligence of the character in the way he trudges around as he speaks, rarely making eye-contact, as if planning another move while outlining the next one. He also shows some good comic timing, bringing out the ronin's curmudgeonly streak. As in Yojinbo, the other stand-out performance is Tatsuya Nakadai as Mifune's adversary. With his compelling presence and hypnotic stare, the young Nakadai makes a fantastic villain. Unfortunately his part is small here and his character is underdeveloped, another shortcoming of this picture.Sanjuro does not belong among Kurosawa's masterpieces, not by quite a long shot, but it is a gentle, easygoing piece, not too long and a fairly easy watch. By taking the comedy tack, it avoids all the usual sequel traps of being repetitive or trying to outdo its predecessor. Funnily enough Kurosawa's most high-profile fans in Hollywood &#x96; George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg &#x96; would all be pioneers of the successful sequel in the 70s and 80s.

Starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alexander Godunov, William Atherton & Paul Gleason, McTiernan's movie went on to make over $100 million in profit at the box office alone. Spawning three equally successful sequels (at the time of writing), it began a franchise that showed that if done well, the action movie could be a dominant force in the world of cinema. The set up is relatively simple, Willis plays New York cop John McLane who during the Christmas holidays is in L.A. to visit his estranged wife Holly (Bedelia). She works for the Japanese Corporation of Nakatomi, and currently she's attending the company Christmas party up on the 30th floor of the humongous Nakatomi Plaza tower block. Bad day at the office because a group of apparent German terrorists, led by the charismatic Hans Gruber (Rickman), take the whole building hostage with one exception; McLane, who evades capture and launches a one man war against the terrorists. What follows is just over two hours of high octane action, smart dialogue and technical smarts. McTiernan had already endeared himself to the action movie fan with the ball busting beef stew that was Predator in 87, a fact not lost on Die Hard's co producer Joel Silver, who clearly knew that McTiernan could smoothly shift the action from the Val Verde jungle to the urban jungle of L.A. And he did. Next was to get the right man for McLane. Richard Gere was first choice but passed, so the makers took a gamble on Willis, whose career was at a standstill after his leap from TV show Moonlighting on to the big screen with the likes of Blind Date & Sunset barely making a ripple in Hollywood. The rest for Willis, as they say, is history. McLane is an everyman hero, streetwise, even slobbish, but identifiable to many with his work ethics, desperate heroics and emotional vulnerability. Willis attacks the role with a hunger rarely seen from the big male earners in filmdom. During the two hours and ten minute running time of Die Hard, Willis as McLane changed the face of the action hero for ever; even making a dirty white vest iconic in the process; the latter of which couples nicely with the hero being bare footed throughout for a nifty bit of writing. Across the board the casting is flawless, Bedelia is spunky and driven, a woman worth fighting for. Veljohnson as beat copper Al Powell-McLane's walkie-talkie buddy and only link to the outside world-is memorable because it feels real, he has his own issue gnawing away at him, but his exchanges with Willis keeps the humanity grounded as the carnage unfolds. Gleason & Atherton are wonderfully anal as Deputy Police Chief and TV Reporter respectively, while Hart Bochner as Ellis dishes out one of the best weasel turns to have ever graced a movie featuring corporate suit types. But as Die Hard resembles the great Westerns of yesteryear, much like the great Oaters, Die Hard could only be as good as its chief villain. As Willis' McLane ushered in a new action hero to copy, Rickman's uber intelligent villain set a new benchmark. Snappily dressed, well versed and as charming as they come, Gruber in Rickman's hands is a villain you could quite easily root for! That's further testament to Willis' turn that Rickman doesn't walk away with the movie, both men are from different sides of the fence, good and evil, yet both are characters you can hang your hat on. Quite a trick from McTiernan that. Rickman is ably supported by the scary Godunov as right hand man Karl and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as the cold hearted Theo. Elsewhere the impact of Robert Davi & Grand L. Bush as the two cocksure FBI agents Johnson & Johnson (no relation) should not be underestimated. All the actors, of course, are indebted to the sizzling script by Steven E. de Souza & Jeb Stuart. So to is praise due to photographer Jan de Bont, who in collaboration with McTiernan, produces a camera work lesson for action movies, as the camera swoops in and around the tower, down elevator shafts and up tilt to roofs; with the fight scenes afforded a spatial sheen not expected in the confines of a tower block setting (the film was actually shot at 20th Century Fox's own 2121 Fox Plaza). Even the scoring from Michael Kamen and the sound tracking are of a high standard; check out the various mood uses of Beethoven's Ode to Joy from Symphony No.9 and Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 In G Major Brilliant. The 80s was well served by action movies with the likes of Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop proving massively popular. But just as Raiders Of The Lost Ark changed the game for action\/adventure, so too did Die Hard. It's now the benchmark movie for action, a film that unlike Hills Cop & Lethal Weapon remarkably shows no signs of ageing either. It's no monkey in the wrench or a fly in the ointment, it's the daddy, and the one that all other action movies have to answer to. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 December 2010","score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Based on ex cop Roderick Thorpe's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan, changed the face of the action movie.

I honestly don't like much the original Godzilla movies, because the creature is presented as apparently unreal. My view of Godzilla is, that it's real animal. Some people maybe wanted to have laser eyes and other robot like stuff. Personally I don't understand that. This creature is amazing animal with personality, spirit and intention. I like big animals and this is my favorite one. I like how Godzillas creation is scientifically explained. Another thing I like about this film is, that it doesn't have just one main plot but there's three of them. One interesting thing shown in this movie is approach of the humans. It's basically We want to control everything or if not, than destroy it. Which is shame. The special effects are amazing Godzilla really behaves and look like real creature. I like what is happening in the whole film, but the end feels sad to me. As I mentioned before Godzilla had intention which was never bad. It never killed anyone intentionally unless it was in self defence. So I can rate it only with 10 stars. I thing that director achieved perfectly what he wanted and what I wanted to see. It's strongly underrated (firstly when I went to IMDb i thought that it would be among best 200) so don't let the rating avert you from this film. Just look at the rating of other people here. It's mostly from 8 to 10 stars or look at the awards it have. Only first 2 from Razzie Awards was bad, but there are many more which are positive. Godzilla is one of my heart movies.

I like big animals and this is my favorite one. I like how Godzillas creation is scientifically explained. Another thing I like about this film is, that it doesn't have just one main plot but there's three of them. One interesting thing shown in this movie is approach of the humans. It's basically We want to control everything or if not, than destroy it. Which is shame. The special effects are amazing Godzilla really behaves and look like real creature. I like what is happening in the whole film, but the end feels sad to me. As I mentioned before Godzilla had intention which was never bad. It never killed anyone intentionally unless it was in self defence. So I can rate it only with 10 stars. I thing that director achieved perfectly what he wanted and what I wanted to see. It's strongly underrated (firstly when I went to IMDb i thought that it would be among best 200) so don't let the rating avert you from this film. Just look at the rating of other people here. It's mostly from 8 to 10 stars or look at the awards it have. Only first 2 from Razzie Awards was bad, but there are many more which are positive. Godzilla is one of my heart movies.

As a child, STAR TREK IV had been my favorite of the original films but my tastes have since changed and I would have to say VI has it beat. In my opinion, it was the most well-done of all the original feature films. It had everything I could want an excellent story, improved special effects, and the best villain since Khan in II. The film begins as the crew of the Enterprise-A are preparing to go their separate ways with the ship being decommissioned in three months. The Klingon moon of Praxis has exploded and left the Klingon Empire without it's primary source of power. Without assistance, the Empire faces extinction, spurring peace negotiations with the Federation. Captain Kirk (Shatner) is nominated to escort the Klingon High Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) to Earth for peace talks but problems arise when the Enterprise-A appears to fire on the Klingon vessel, beaming two Starfleet assassins on board to kill the Chancellor. Kirk and Dr. McCoy (Kelley) are arrested and sentenced to imprisonment on the asteroid penal colony Rura Penthe. Now it's up to Spock (Nimoy) and the crew of the Enterprise locate the conspirators in their midst, clear Kirk and McCoy's names, and stop an assassination plot from preventing peace between the Federation and the Klingons.I was too young to understand when I first saw the film, but I can now see the similarities between the events in the film and the Cold War politics occurring at the time of the film's release. It does add an extra element to see how closely the filmmakers tried to parallel real life events with their story to give audiences food for thought as the US sought to end the hostilities with the Soviets. Even without the political subtext, the film is massively entertaining. The story takes a mystery turn as Spock and his crew must seek out the conspirators and piece together clues to prove the ship's innocence. We are also given a more in-depth glimpse into the world of the Klingons and how their race function, as Kirk and McCoy are taken to the Klingon homeworld to stand trial for their supposed assassination.What really grabbed my attention were the film's visual effects. There's a certain level of effects I've come to expect from the original TREK films and it exceeds my expectations from the start. I'd forgotten that, by the time this film was produced, The Next Generation was into their third or fourth season and the effects had become pretty solid. From the moment we see Praxis explode and it's shockwave rock the USS Excelsior, I was impressed at how far they've come in the twelve years they'd been making movies. The same can't be said for all of the effects in the movie, as some things were apparently still beyond their capabilities. The Klingon blood floating in zero gravity wasn't done well and screams CG (it seemed too bright and reflective and stood out horribly). There is also a scene later in the film where Kirk is fighting a doppelganger of himself. It's not so much that the fight look unrealistic (they actually did a good job pitting Shatner against Shatner) but apparently Shatner has no clue how to act against himself and his dialogue was incredibly corny. Plus it was funny when he motions to point at his doppelganger and, apparently having no frame of reference, points over his head.The production design in the film is the best in any TREK film yet. It's a shame it took so long for them to finally nail down the best style for their starships. The film also boats a terrific villain in the form of renowned actor Christopher Plummer as the Klingon General Chang. He's theatrical and over-the-top, and he's a blast to watch as he spouts Shakespeare and taunts Kirk and his crew from the safety of his modified Bird-of-Prey. With each member of the crew getting ample screen time (even Sulu, who's gone on to command his own starship), this is the perfect send-off for the crew that started it all. By the time the credits roll with signatures from each major crew member, that sense of finality has settled in and you realize that the crew of the Enterprise-A has gone out on a high note.

But now that Stone has helped placate our collective guilt over the war in Vietnam it seems he can do no wrong, an unfortunate twist of logic since the earlier film may in fact be better than anything he's done since, and is certainly less reverent, less pretentious, and filled with livelier, more natural characters than most of his subsequent features. It doesn't even pretend to be good journalism. From the gaudy, strobe-light opening credits Stone is in (for him) classic form, presenting a wildly overstated pop-fiction account of Third-World turmoil, as seen through the slightly wired perspective of pill-popping ex-photo correspondent and gonzo sleaze-ball Richard Boyle, played by James Woods in a no-holds-barred performance. Subtlety never has been Oliver Stone's strongest asset, but his sensational approach to the subject (particularly in the hyper-dramatic music score, and during the more violent action sequences) can at least be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure.

But now that Stone has helped placate our collective guilt over the war in Vietnam it seems he can do no wrong, an unfortunate twist of logic since the earlier film may in fact be better than anything he's done since, and is certainly less reverent, less pretentious, and filled with livelier, more natural characters than most of his subsequent features. It doesn't even pretend to be good journalism. From the gaudy, strobe-light opening credits Stone is in (for him) classic form, presenting a wildly overstated pop-fiction account of Third-World turmoil, as seen through the slightly wired perspective of pill-popping ex-photo correspondent and gonzo sleaze-ball Richard Boyle, played by James Woods in a no-holds-barred performance.

It does not contain such expected western archetypes as chases, violence, action, and picture postcard scenery. Rather, it presented emotional and moralistic dialogue throughout most of the film. Only in the last few minutes were there action scenes, which were very well done, supported by some great soundtrack. The main thing here is the story itself, the idea of a man being betrayed by all of the town's loyal people - all of them support him, but none of them wants to put his neck on the line and help him. The script is brilliant and Gary Cooper's acting really stands out. It's not emotional, yet it's his signature strong yet somehow magically restrained. All the supporting actors did a very good job as well, although I felt Grace Kelly's character lacked depth (well at least she was deadly beautiful..). This isn't your usual western as I previously stated - it's a standout film in cinema history, and it's one of the first films which starred the lone hero against everyone else theme. I'd say it was tremendously done, and it's a true classic.

I'm normally not the biggest fan of vampire movies, and this one is a lot of fun to watch. It's a goofy, entertaining film that doesn't really offer more than disposable viewing. The plot moves along at fast enough pace where something is always going on and it keeps the interest level very high. The film is also pretty gory, and it has a lot of blood spilled. Decapitations, staking, hearts ripped out, and bodies set on fire that it's just an over-the-top gore display. There's something here for every type of gore-fan, and nothing is left uncovered. It's a great film for gore-hounds. The Tales from the Crypt tag gives it a comedic tag, and for the most part, it's also very funny. The jokes fly nonstop, have a nice sharp turn to them, and actually get more than just a chuckle from them. It's a def mix of the two, and is even more remarkable in that it pulls it off so well. The action is also pretty fast and furious. The ending assault in the bordello is a great example, keeping it from being overly gruesome while also maintaining the sharp collection of explosions, guts and gore that the rest of the film has. Most important, though, is it's cheese appeal. It's not a very strong story, and more than a few moments are there just for a cheesy feel to them, and it makes the film that much better. http\/\/matcao.comThe Bad News There really wasn't a while lot not to like about this one. It's basically just a fan-friendly film that features enough to entertain without requiring extensive over-analyzing. It's the type of film that will appeal to those who like it and will be criticized because of it.The Final Verdict Sure, this is a cheesy B-movie, but it's chock full of what makes those kinds of films fun. It's violent, funny, and more, and is just supposed to be a fun time. Take it as that, and it becomes a much more fun time.

If this title is told many people think about the coolest film on earth, the greatest cars and the greatest drivers. I don't know yet why though. I am personally into cars. I'm also interested in mechanics and electronics in general and I do know about that topic so don't tell me I have no clue what I'm going to talk about. The film is made for 6-year-olds. There are cool (in my point of view pretty stupid) paint jobs, roaring engines and of course NO2! And then there is Vin Diesel who plays cocky Torreto. So they race illegally and the young cop is sent out to investigate the racing. The racing is nothing spectacular. 400 meters straight line, the best built car wins or whose engine can manage the most turbo pressure or nitrous in other words. In total there are only few races throughout the whole film and it's rather boring to watch them. The cars the characters are racing could not be as powerful as real drag racing cars so the handling should be relatively easy as well. That fact already doesn't make the racers heroes in front of my eyes.But racing is acceptable. The worst part of the movie is Torreto's gang truck robbing. It is so unrealistic and stupid that I don't have words for it. Every thinking person can understand how lame it looks. You can't hold on the truck with nothing to worry about when a truck is traveling about 100 km\/h. And just how it looks. Truck drivers don't really do anything to get rid of them except the last one who starts shooting the gang. And finally the whole story limps. It's very stereotypical and overall boring. I'm not gonna spoil too much but basically the undercover working cop merges into Torreto's gang and eventually starts defending Torreto. In the end he still founds out that Torreto is involved to truck robbing and tries to put the end to that. He also flirts with Torreto's sister. Some gang members speculate he's a cop but Torreto doesn't take that seriously etc. In other words quite boring story.All in all I'd say that Fast and furious is a weak movie, unrealistic and quite boring. I don't know how this movie is so highly respected because for me it really doesn't look anything special.2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 December 2010","score":"3 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" SOME SPOILERS CONTAINED!The fast and the furious....
