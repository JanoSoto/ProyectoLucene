The original casted an enormous shadow as a consummate action situation film and while Die Hard 2 seems to fit that mold on premise, some key elements that made the first film so good manage to slip out of this one.Like the first film, Die Hard 2 takes place in one night as a group of terrorists take over Dulles airport's communications system in order to help a drug lord flee the country. As a result, it keeps inbound planes in a holding pattern that if held too long, will result in disaster. What the terrorists don't know, is that Holly McClane is on one of the planes, the wife of Lieutennant John I'll take matters into my own hands thank you McClane (Bruce Willis).McClane is in the wrong place at the wrong time yet again, but he handles it remarkably better this time, seeing as he's done this kind of thing before. While he still talks to himself in the movie, one of his character's signatures, and he's motivated by love for his wife once again, there's something different about this mishap. Last time, McClane was trapped; his fear was fully realized by the audience. He had no one to communicate with and had to rely entirely on himself. He spends way too much time in this film bickering with D.C. airport police (led by Dennis Franz) and befriending odd airport employees. There's a lot more negotiating and planning--not doing. Even when things are blowing up and guns are being fired, director Renny Harlin, who takes the reigns from a hard to replace John McTiernan, doesn't do much with it. The action is not particularly exciting.Die Hard 2 also fails in its antagonist. The group of terrorists have no strong leader, no Alan Rickman from the first film to pose any formidable threat. They give you very little reason to believe that McClane won't succeed. While we know the good guys will win out in these kinds of films, the better movies will always test your assurance to some extent and this movie doesn't. The suspense is just not the same. Lastly, the concept is just not as impressive. While airports and terrorists generally work well together, in this movie the plot has no real magnitude. Considering the film was put right into production after the success of the first film, it would seem that they weren't too picky or worried about the concept behind the sequel they just wanted to churn it out. Sure, fans of the original will enjoy watching John McClane's latest exercise in terrorist-shooting, curse-shouting fun, but connoisseurs of great action movies will be largely unstirred by it.

I cannot say for certain either way.If you've ever been a member of a message board and you've read the thread about the last movie you watched, you'll know that 99% of the replies have one word or less beside the official score. For a long time, I wondered how that could be. I used to think, Don't these people have any more of an opinion other than 'good' or 'bad' or 'average'? They just wasted their lives watching a movie; couldn't they say more than just a score? It took me a few months to figure the entire situation out, but when I did, it made perfect sense. Most movies&#151;even good movies&#151;are so predictable and unoriginal&#151;even if they're enjoyable&#151;people still lack any real, definitive feelings about them. They see a movie on a Friday night and by Saturday night they forgot they even watched it. As a writer myself, I know first-hand there is nothing worse than an indifferent audience, but it seems that sums up most of the American population. Why? Because of films like Apocalypse Now.Apocalypse Now opens up with a semi-interesting beginning. It misleads the viewer into thinking that it actually has some physiological depth, then completely drops all depth into the gutter by the 10-minute mark and never picks it up again. Despite what you were lead to believe, there is no plot here. Or let me rephrase that there is a plot, but it drops it after the 20-minute mark and never picks it up again until the final 30 minutes. Everything between those two points is exactly what you expect for a clichéd war drama . . .Talking. It almost amuses me that an epic movie can have the flattest characters in cinema history, but the screenwriters always have them talk and talk as if they're actually interesting to listen to. In Apocalypse Now's case, the characters are ALL walking stereotypical war clichés with legs and&#151;unfortunately&#151; tongues. They're all simply nothing but dumb animals created to carry the pointless dialogue out. They talk so much it's downright nauseating. What are they talking about? I forgot, and I just finished the film 10 minutes ago. Their dialogue is all predictable copy\/paste war dialogue; I do remember that much. Naked girls, guns, cliché monologues about life\/death&#151;all the stuff you've heard thousands of times. I was never a soldier in the Vietnam War, but I can pretty much assure you the real soldiers talked about more than these unimaginative movies give them credit for.Besides talking, what do you get in Apocalypse Now? Well, there are only two main action scenes in the entire movie, so you can cross balls-to-the-wall war action off your list of expectations. No, this nearly 4-hour long film focuses on shots of boats going down the river with soldiers talking, and not much else. There is no emotional experience here. There is no horror, as the tagline proclaims. The most horror you get is a bunch of PG-rated war scenes and some eerie music as the soldiers move through fog. If the director had focused on the true horror of realistic war, I wouldn't have to be sarcastic when I say How terrifying! Instead, however, the director focuses things we've seen before. Hundreds of times. He focuses on the copy\/paste Hollywood-style war, not the truly gritty, dirty war. He doesn't rub your nose in the true horror of war; he pats you on the back and gives you generic conversation scenes.My point here Apocalypse Now is one of the most boring movies even filmed. It's also safe and predictable, adding nothing whatsoever to the overdone war genre. It doesn't leave you thinking, My God, this is terrible! It leaves you thinking, My God, I could have done the laundry with that wasted time . . . And that's all. That's all there is to say about this nearly 4-hour long movie. The entire synopsis of every major event from open to close could literally be told in two sentences of text. Sometimes you have to sit back and realize that most award-winning, critically acclaimed, classic films are nothing but hollow shells. They boast great acting and cinematography, but they have no story. No soul. No moral. No thrill. No point . . .This is why I blame films like Apocalypse Now for the indifference people have toward movies. These films are supposedly the best of the best, but at the same time they're completely forgettable to anyone who doesn't try their hardest to find pleasure in boredom in hopes of becoming an all-powerful FILM BUFF on some cheesy website. There is nothing wrong with being intellectual. There is something wrong with being pretentious and internally forcing yourself to love a film just because the critics do. And those are the only people who could give Apocalypse Now a perfect score.

With her stiff, over-enunciated dialogue, she has never been a good actor and is not qualified for top billing in anything but (maybe) a direct-to-DVD romp, but she is at least *somewhat* stable here. Marisa Tomei is truly awful in her usual, annoying, ill-gotten-Oscar overacting, and Ellen Barkin gets the job done as always but plays an irritating character. The real starpower comes from the skillful Hugh Jackman, who was a newcomer at this time but provides the first of many lovable and convincing performances, the first of many bad boy\/good guy roles that we love, and fodder for the first of many questions like, Why is he forever surrounded by so much inferior talent? Certainly, we would love to see him in more roles like this, and probably will, as he was recently sentenced to Sexiest Man Alive.As for Greg Kinear, never was Fry's comment more true I feel myself disappearing. Like... Greg Kinear !This film's premise is based on the broken heart of Jane Goodall, who becomes involved with Ray (Kinear) and is promptly dumped, but Ray has no depth or personality, and their attraction is never grounded in anything real or interesting, so it makes no sense for her to be in love in the first place, let alone be devastated by the loss or driven to analyze it for New Cow Theory. However, this film is worth a viewing for Jackman, and has some funny and great moments (most of which belong to him).

The whole thing feels like a good idea executed with insufficient writing and script to cover the plot, which could have been great.Overall, definitely worth it as eye candy and a good laugh for chicks. Otherwise, a decent flick if you keep the FF Button close at hand to survive some of Tomei's more dreadful scenes. I have it at home and watch it whenever I need a light, pick-me-up type of film.

However, right about the time it becomes sexist and offensive, the animal theory is proved wrong, mankind is vindicated, and our heroes obey the romantic comedy cliché of getting together even though they don't seem compatible. The whole thing feels like a good idea executed with insufficient writing and script to cover the plot, which could have been great.Overall, definitely worth it as eye candy and a good laugh for chicks. Otherwise, a decent flick if you keep the FF Button close at hand to survive some of Tomei's more dreadful scenes. I have it at home and watch it whenever I need a light, pick-me-up type of film.

It is just cinematically perfect! The way in which it is edited to look like one continuous take is very clever, and almost seamless. Hitchcock manages to build tension almost effortlessly, at one point just by focusing on a wooden chest for over a minuet has viewers on the edge of their seat! The acting is incredible, I love films that are set in a single location (Resevoir Dogs springs to mind, being shot mostly in a warehouse, as well as Japanese film 2DLK which is all set in an apartment) because it feels so personal. Within Rope you can see the characters develop in front of you, as you really feel like you have been stuck in a room with these people for just over an hour. The quality of the acting really comes through without the distraction of changing backdrops.I think the script is just brilliant, it is very clever, there are lots of little off-hand comments made throughout that on a first viewing can be easily missed but, on a second or more viewings it is easy to notice that often Brandan directly refers to what he has done in a way that we (the audience) can understand but the other characters do not - very smart.I find the relationship between Brandan and Phillip very interesting, they are obviously very close, even though Brandan eventually pushes Phillip over the edge. They have certainly shared a long past together. It wasn't until I found out the two murderers this film is loosely based on, Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, were gay - linked with the fact that Hitchcock often commented on homosexuality within his work, that I came to the conclusion that they are probably lovers. This gives a whole new spin, and depth to their relationship, and makes their interaction with each other all the more interesting - See if on a second viewing you can interpret a homo-erotic reading between them, I certainly could. This movie is full of sinister suspense, and will keep anyone on the edge of their seat throughout. A brilliant way of showing just what Hitchcock can do! It highlights many of his Directorial trademarks, such as misogyny, in the form of the nagging old house keeper, comment on homosexuality as previously mentioned, and the presence of an academic. Also contains two Hitchcock cameos - if you look really hard!! In my opinion one of his very best works.

I liked it a lot, and there were parts which I laughed out loud at. It had a very original premise, unlikeable but intriguing characters, and the timing was pitch perfect in many areas.This movie could be considered Bad Santa before there was Bad Santa. Admittedly, however, Bad Santa was a film with a much darker sense of humor, and there are elements of movies like National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation in this film. Regardless, this movie is just funny, and is far better than many of the facetious holiday movies that have come out in recent years, including Deck The Halls and Christmas With The Kranks. I don't think it ever intended to be considered a Christmas movie anyway. The point of the movie seemed to parody both expectations during the holiday season that can't be met, and marriage counseling in general. The movie achieved both major points very well.For starters, this movie is probably Denis Leary's only starring role to date. He doesn't really play a character here, or at least he plays his famous comic persona again a sarcastic, pessimistic, chain-smoking, loud-mouthed, short-tempered, altogether angry dude. He's a professional thief, and spends the entire movie not only trying to get away with a botched robbery, but also to try to get everyone around him in control. Amazingly, in this movie, he's the most sane character, and that unusual scenario is what makes the movie so good.Kevin Spacey was not an unknown actor per se when this movie came out, but he was not as well known as he is now, nor was he a household name. Anyone who watches this movie after 1999 will notice that Spacey plays an almost mirror image of Lester Burnham, his Oscar-winning role in American Beauty. It's difficult to say which role was funnier, but in a movie that preceded American Beauty by over five years, Spacey plays his deadpan sarcasm humor very well. He also has some very funny lines in a role that probably didn't initially require his character to be funny.This movie had so many comic elements and various subplots that seemed to pile onto one another. In a lot of ways, it was good how an unusual scenario (being held hostage on Christmas Eve) weaved so well into usual ones (annoying in-laws visiting). That said, there were a few subplots which didn't quite fit. There was the drunk Santa that seemed a bit out of place, and was probably borrowed from a much worse movie. Other than his Santa costume which came in handy near the end of the film, that character didn't really seem to contribute much to the movie, and seemed a little bit like a cheap plot device. Including his character in the movie was like adding a Smiley sticker to Van Gogh's Starry Night painting.Also, the movie ended a little too quickly, and a bit more inconclusively than it probably should have. There were so many loose ends in regards to the supporting characters at the end that really needed to be tied up. Watching this movie, the characters really grew on you, so for the movie to end like it did felt disappointing at the least.Still, despite these relative weaknesses, the movie was very good and worthy of being considered a cult classic. The DVD of this movie was released in 1999, and has absolutely no special features of any kind. Really, though, the movie didn't need it. Of course, a commentary track by Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey would have been nice, but the movie itself is fun to watch.

I must admit her acting wasn't so convincing, it's very hard to believe her character is a prostitute (but not because of her charming performance).There are few explicit scenes but directors mostly rely on formula things you don't see makes you even more scared when left to your imagination, although I wouldn't recommend this film to children or those with really weak stomach. Without those scenes, I think, film would loose some of its creepiness, and does not leave you with feeling directors put it there just so the film would be described as horror.For all those who fancy mysteries and don't mind few harsh scenes, go ahead, From Hell is more than decent film.

Everything from Shrek to Disney's latest Bolt owes its existence to this movie and there are very good reasons why this is the case. Not only was the look of Toy Story radically different from anything else that went before it, it was also a superb family film in its own right. Not only is it bright, colourful and hugely entertaining but it also strikes the right chord with adults as well as kids, something which Pixar have rarely got wrong since.In case this landmark picture somehow passed you by, Toy Story introduces us to a young boy called Andy and the collection of toys in his room. Coming to life when no-one is around, the toys are led by Andy's favourite cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks). But his position as top toy is threatened by the arrival of a new toy - space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). But to Woody's amusement, Buzz doesn't realise what he is and as the pair squabble, they soon realise that they need to work together before they both lose Andy's attention altogether.Once the technical achievement of Toy Story has been absorbed, it is impossible to resist the charms of this movie. Hanks and Allen are a great double act but each cast member is fantastic, making their characters truly come alive. Naturally, it looks much more simplistic compared to newer Pixar films like Wall-E or Cars - much more angular than I remember. But this is still one of the best family films of the last twenty years and considerably better than other CG animated movies since. People still remember Toy Story and can quote the catchphrases - try doing the same for Open Season or Shark Tale. It's hard to imagine what would have happened if Toy Story bombed. But it didn't - Pixar set the standard from the start and are still the only ones consistently matching or exceeding that standard.The biggest problem Toy Story has is the company it finds itself in now. The inevitable sequel is slightly better as is The Incredibles and the wonderful Wall-E while each Pixar film looks much better than the one that went before it, making Toy Story look clinical and basic compared to later films. But that shouldn't detract from what is a true landmark picture, one that continues to be a yardstick for others to match.

James Cameron really managed to bring the old ship back to life on the big screen, but at the same time he painted a negative and inaccurate picture of the crew and passengers.I'm not referring to the fictitious love story between the two fictitious characters Kate and Jack. This addition is clearly pure invention, a device to involve ones emotions in the tragedy in a way that a documentary style film doesn't. That's fine. What's not it's not fine to twist the historical facts about real people, which Cameron clearly does in this film. Many of the portrayals of the crew members are fictionalized. I suppose it's forgivable to make ordinary people into heroes, but to make heroes into villains, as this film does, is I think, unethical. It's damaging to the memory of those people, and I'm sure it's offensive to their surviving descendants.The biggest lie is 2nd officer Lightoller, who is portrayed as losing his mind and shooting himself in the middle of all the passengers, during the evacuation. In reality Lightoller did not shoot himself. He did not even have a gun. Lightoller was swept of the ship as it sank, and nearly drowned. When he saved himself by climbing on to a capsized lifeboat, he helped many other people, doing his duty to the end, keeping the lifeboat from sinking for four hours until rescue arrived. Many years later, in 1945, Lightoller risked his life to use his own yacht to rescue British soldiers from Dunkerque. Captain Smith is portrayed as a weak, ineffectual human being incapable of making decisions. For me, Bernard Hill was wrongly cast in this role - he does not have the charisma and presence of Smith. According to most studies and records, Smith was also active until the very end. A one point he was calling back boats on his megaphone when he saw that they weren't full &#x96; a scene that was edited out of the movie for the final release.I've always had mixed feelings about this film. The effects, sets, costumes and technical accuracy are astounding; and some of the characters (like the chief engineer, and Murdoch) are great. I don't mind the fictionalised addition of Jack and Rose, and the narrative framework this is put it in the form of Rose returning to the site on a expedition and telling her story. But there are aforementioned inaccuracies, and also many unnecessarily silly bits, for example the scene with Cal chasing Jack and Kate down the grand staircase with a gun, firing shots as he went, which cheapen the film.I think that, when you make a film like this, dealing with such a monumental tragedy, with characters representing real people in recent history, it's very shameful to invent bad things about them.But all in all this was an epic film and was one of the most impressive films I'd ever seen at the cinema back in 1997.

I dig it! Paul Verhoeven's high-tech Sci-fi masterpiece 'Robocop' truly stands the test of time, and I don't see it falling from its pedestal anytime soon. Exceptional film-making, and the pride shows in the finished product. Verhoeven' slick and sleek tailoring blends superbly with Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner's furiously lethal, but smartly witty material. You got to have memorable villains, and 'Robocop is no exception. Ronny Cox (corrupt corporate power) and Kurtwood Smith (maniac criminal) are brilliant in their roles, and they're matched up by Peter Weller's perfectly humane performance as Robocop. He emotionally engages. Miguel Ferrer's turn has a lively sting as the man behind the creation and Ray Wise is good. However Nancy Allen is rather ho-hum, acceptable but nothing that stands out&#133; really she's bland. The characters are very well-drawn up.Now the special effects. Outstanding and inspired! This is what I miss, and the execution is barnstorming. The stop-motion ED209 design looks great and the metallic creation RoboCop himself is magnetically achieved with the clash between the two being heart-racing experience. As for the action, it comes in spades. Verhoeven drills in the scorching suspense and punishing violence with ease, and this heavy-handed style works due to its gusty premise. Basil Poledouris' score pounds away, but manages a majestic vibe that simply soars.Satire, violence and profanity done in an unapologetic manner by being swirled in to a wicked sense of dark humour and unstoppable energy. Imaginative, powerful and evocative entertainment.
