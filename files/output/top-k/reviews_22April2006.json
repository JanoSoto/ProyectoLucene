The marvelous action scenes are replaced by traditional Hollywood fights where you have no clue of what's going on and several times the director feels the need to use unrealistic CGI just to replace his actors. You can easily tell the difference between actors and the CGI versions of them, especially in this film. Trust me. Especially dumb is the scene in the beginning where Blade fights against another vampire, and it is shown from the side as if it was some kind of Mortal Kombat video game. You'll have to look hard for a dumber action scene, actually.The Blade series is here turned into something much less mature and adult and into something that is even more dumbed down than the original (which was no Casablanca, but still good). Action at exactly every corner, lots of shooting and fighting and screaming. But no character. You don't really care for anyone in this film, not even Blade. Why is that? Because Blade is no longer the animal he was in the first film, he's much more refined here. He takes time to meditate, he actually lets a wounded vampire go and he does a lot of unnecessary sword moves for no other purpose than to get the audience to watch Wesley Snipes make his moves. In several scenes, Blade flashes his sword around despite being completely alone. Instead of cutting of a tube, he raises his sword and slashes in the air for five seconds before actually turning to cut the tube off. Why? It just looks dumb. Let's not forget the dumbed down rap music and hip characters they threw in. Compare the young and cool Scud to the old and weathered Whistler. Whistler kicks ass, whereas Scuds constant hip remarks are just annoying. Why didn't he die in scene one?The visuals are very colorful. The colors are Red and blue. That's it, you won't find any other colors here. It gets very tiresome after awhile, and the visuals are further damaged by the constant use of CGI even when it's not necessary! A lot of times CGI blood is added, or cgi characters. It just looks bad. Period.Also, vampire lore is changed. The vampires no longer put up a fight at all, instead they die just by a single gunshot wound. In the original, Blade actually had some trouble beating a few vampires and was taken down by a few of them in some scenes! Here, they go down dime-a-dozen and one wonders why we have to go through two hours of Blade just kicking immense ass in action scenes that are rehashed over and over and over again. Let's not forget the obvious plot holes and character mistakes. In one scene Whistler, an old vampire hunter, knocks out a vampire villain, grabs a sword and then... Takes off? Why the hell didn't he just turn that sword on the already knocked out vampire and save Blade some trouble? What kind of vampire hunter does NOT kill an evil vampire when he has him under his blade? Stuff like this is abundant all the way through, and makes you sit uneasy in your seat.Also, the villain is nowhere near as characteristic or colorful as Deacon Frost in the original. It's just a bald headed, pale super vampire who can take out anyone except for Blade. We don't give a crap about the stupid sub plot they threw in about him, or any of the other stupid subplots.Gah, it hurts my head just thinking about this mess. Avoid.

I've seen this movie plenty of times, but for the first time, I noticed just how well this line resonates in this movie. In fact, this line is the basis for the movie, and could stand in for the whole movie in a pinch- except that we would be missing out on one of the most moving and inspirational films to come out of Hollywood in the past few years.Mr. Holland's Opus is the story of a man who loves music, who practically lives and breathes music. We see at the beginning of the film, and throughout the rest of it, a man who is most passionate when he is within music. When his wife informs him that she is pregnant, he likens the feeling to falling in love with John Coltrane's music. When a student complains to him that he knows everything there is to know about music, Mr. Holland responds by reminding him that the name of his class is Music Appreciation and explaining forcefully that it doesn't matter how much you know about music if you don't appreciate it.The movie takes Mr. Holland through three decades- from the '60s to the mid-'90s. In the spirit of nostalgia films like Forrest Gump, we are guided through the decades by vignettes of archive footage depicting scenes such as Nixon announcing his resignation, Gerald Ford tripping down the stairs, and even good old Frankenfurter representing the sexual revolution. As a piece of nostalgia for those times and the days of high school, Mr. Holland's Opus works great. As a chronicle of a man's life and the impact he has on others, it works even better.This film could have turned into cheap schmaltz, but through its cast and a story that reaches wonderful poignancy and honesty at times, it manages to represent something so much more than that. Richard Dreyfuss, always a natural actor, is perfectly real and moving as Glenn Holland. I can't describe his performance in words, simply because it deserves to be seen more than just written about. And even though this is basically Dreyfuss's movie, the supporting cast makes an impression as well. Glenne Headly, as Mr. Holland's wife, shows tremendous resilience and emotion as the mother of a disabled child. When she explodes at her husband because of his lack of understanding, you explode with her, because we believe every word she is saying.I don't know if movies can change lives. I think some have the potential to. I know there are movies that can inspire their audiences to be better people- It's a Wonderful Life is one; Casablanca is another. While Mr. Holland's Opus does not reach the quality that those two do (and who can blame it?), it has a similar and near equal impact, and that is definitely a compliment. And how perfect- a movie about a man who changes lives that can also change lives.

In fact, this line is the basis for the movie, and could stand in for the whole movie in a pinch- except that we would be missing out on one of the most moving and inspirational films to come out of Hollywood in the past few years.Mr. Holland's Opus is the story of a man who loves music, who practically lives and breathes music. We see at the beginning of the film, and throughout the rest of it, a man who is most passionate when he is within music. When his wife informs him that she is pregnant, he likens the feeling to falling in love with John Coltrane's music. When a student complains to him that he knows everything there is to know about music, Mr. Holland responds by reminding him that the name of his class is Music Appreciation and explaining forcefully that it doesn't matter how much you know about music if you don't appreciate it.The movie takes Mr. Holland through three decades- from the '60s to the mid-'90s. In the spirit of nostalgia films like Forrest Gump, we are guided through the decades by vignettes of archive footage depicting scenes such as Nixon announcing his resignation, Gerald Ford tripping down the stairs, and even good old Frankenfurter representing the sexual revolution. As a piece of nostalgia for those times and the days of high school, Mr. Holland's Opus works great. As a chronicle of a man's life and the impact he has on others, it works even better.This film could have turned into cheap schmaltz, but through its cast and a story that reaches wonderful poignancy and honesty at times, it manages to represent something so much more than that. Richard Dreyfuss, always a natural actor, is perfectly real and moving as Glenn Holland. I can't describe his performance in words, simply because it deserves to be seen more than just written about. And even though this is basically Dreyfuss's movie, the supporting cast makes an impression as well. Glenne Headly, as Mr. Holland's wife, shows tremendous resilience and emotion as the mother of a disabled child. When she explodes at her husband because of his lack of understanding, you explode with her, because we believe every word she is saying.I don't know if movies can change lives. I think some have the potential to. I know there are movies that can inspire their audiences to be better people- It's a Wonderful Life is one; Casablanca is another. While Mr. Holland's Opus does not reach the quality that those two do (and who can blame it?), it has a similar and near equal impact, and that is definitely a compliment. And how perfect- a movie about a man who changes lives that can also change lives.

But if George Lucas decided to follow Henry Ford rather than John Ford, he built a Shelby Cobra & left Pinto-making to his many, many imitators. Ironically, he himself remade one of the finest works of film master Akira Kurosawa, the Western-themed Hidden Fortress, with one scene (the fight in the bar) lifted from Yojimbo. As a result, Star Wars has a bit of the jittery discomfort of characters trying to fit into a story that wasn't quite made for them, like people with past life experiences that intrude into the present. Kurosawa's hero is split not into two but THREE heroes in Star Wars (four if you include the princess, who has a more prominent role in Star Wars). Hamill's Luke is often overshadowed by Kenobi (Guinness, whose skill had aged better than any fine wine) and Solo (Ford, in the role that deservedly made him a star), though he often holds his own as the clueless but determined farmboy-turned-hero. In less than five minutes, Star Wars sets the standard of outer-space audiovisual special effects that the industry was bound to follow from then on, forever sweeping away the earnest, toylike realism that Gerry Anderson was then giving us in Space 1999 in favor of exhausting but beautiful orgies of fast, violent, sweeping movement culminating in explosions of bright color & blaring sound. No wonder there's never any sex. Star Wars is science fiction only because it's set in outer space, by which standard Dirty Harry is a detective story & Last Tango in Paris a romance. Little attempt is made to explain the technological wonders depicted (we never find out why light sabers never have to be recharged or get even a cursory explanation of the Death Star). What little science there is can't be counted on, as when Solo extols the drag-racing abilities of the Millennium Falcon in parsecs, which are units of distance, not elapsed time. But Lucas never means to educate, only to entertain. Solo is a smuggler, not a science officer, while the others are not doctors or engineers but warriors, royalty or villains. Lucas's hammerhanded excess works because it never lets up & never goes for the cheap & easy. Though the heroes are unconvincing, Star Wars creates an array of badguys in the Galactic Empire that remain unsurpassed in cinema, headed by Darth Vader, who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. In another irony, the most memorable scene in Star Wars is the motionless roundtable conference chaired by Tarkin (Cushing, in the greatest role of his long career) which yielded phrases long & gleefully repeated by a delighted America (This station is now the ultimate power in the universe! This bickering is pointless! I find your lack of faith disturbing). Perhaps, with the space program petering out & the hard realities of nuclear energy coming home to us, our fascination with scientific exploration was wearing thin. In the 1960s it enabled the cast of Star Trek to bring the writings of sci-fi geniuses to life with cardboard & aluminum foil. Never again. What better honor, or infamy if you like, could there be to Star Wars than that the Star Trek movies of the 1980s followed the simple themes, cuteness & spectacular effects of Star Wars, turning their backs on their own heritage of awed exploration? Perhaps that first detractors and then supporters of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative nicknamed it Star Wars so convincingly that the original name was quickly forgotten. The film might be a bit dated with its holistic, New Age mysticism (feel the force FLOWING through you!) which likely owes more to Jack Kerouac than Musashi Miyamoto & which became more difficult to depict with a straight face the farther the sequels & prequels went. Nevertheless, it was a worthy successor to the Code of the West, especially in contrasting Darth Vader with Luke & Kenobi. Star Wars can't really be judged by the standards of other films, partly because it reset the standards & partly because it became, most unusually, the fourth in a series of six! But there's no doubt that it's a heroic sensory extravaganza that will leave the viewer at once exhausted & exhilarated--and will do it over & over again, without offending, condescending or making one think too hard.

Oh sure, there will always be those few dunderheads who will complain about the killing of Indians and Mexican soldiers. However, as much as they would like to change it, history is history regardless of results. There have always been, and will always be, clashes and wars between various peoples throughout the world. Both the white man and the black man fought and killed Indians and all manner of nationalities all the way from the East and throughout the history of the American West. Then there will also be those who will complain about early day special effects and stunts. Well hey, that's why they were early day and that is how show business people learned to improve movies and technology over the years. So get over it and just enjoy the movie. I'm not going to go through the story line, most of us are familiar with following Davy Crockett and his pal Georgie Russel as they tamed the Indian uprisings, through Congress and on to the Alamo in Texas. I just bought and watched the movie on a DVD which also includes Davy Crockett and the River Pirates and a Chip & Dale cartoon. The picture on this DVD is absolutely beautiful, it looks like it was made yesterday instead of 1954. My nine year old grandson came in when it was just starting. He began watching and sat all the way through and loved it. So it stands the test of time. I haven't seen it for quite some years and it took me back to the days when we knew who the good guys were and who the bad guys were. Not like many movies today where the distinction is a blur and bad guys are made to look like good guys. No wonder so many kids are confused, but that's another subject. I actually picked up on a couple of bloopers I hadn't noticed in younger years. In the scene where Davy is about to fight Red Stick and an Indian offers him the choice of a sharp hatchet or a blunt stone ax, the weapons magically switch hands from when the Indian is seen from the front and from the back. Also, at the Alamo when Davy shoots the two Mexican soldiers working the cannon using Betsy his single shot musket, he does it quickly as if he had two barrels or a breach-loader. So quick there was no time to reload. Allow me to focus on some of the actors in the movie. Fess Parker is the only Davy Crockett to me. In fact, so much so, that when I saw John Wayne playing him in the first Alamo, it was hard to believe he could be Davy. As good as John Wayne was he was no Davy Crockett compared to Fess Parker. Although Fess Parker certainly did some great film work other than Davy Crockett, he didn't stay with it and at one point seems to have dropped out of the movie\/TV scene and went into business. Maybe he figured it was hard to top his fame as Davy or maybe he just figured to go out on top. What is noteworthy is that Buddy Ebsen, who played the second part as the side kick, actually did much more in film. He was one heck of a dancer in his younger days if you've seen him in Shirley Temple's Captain January and others. He gained fame also as Jed Clampett on the Beverly Hillbillies and Barnaby Jones on TV. He was to be Davy Crockett until Walt Disney saw Fess Parker in Them and he was also to be the scarecrow in The Wizard of OZ until he became ill from the metallic makeup. Regardless, he did well for himself. Fess also did well in business and has owned a winery for some years in California. A big thanks to Fess and Buddy for a job well done! Other actors in the movie were Mike Mazurki as Bigfoot who was a wrestler before movies and usually played a tough guy, even back in an early Dick Tracy. Hans Conried was Thimblerig and a familiar face in many TV and movies including Uncle Tonoose in TVs Make Room for Daddy and the voice of Captain Hook in Disney's Peter Pan. Jim Bowie was played by Kenneth Tobey whom I remember in his own TV show in the 50's show titled Whirlybirds. Most of the other actors did not appear to go on to bigger and better film work.

Both the white man and the black man fought and killed Indians and all manner of nationalities all the way from the East and throughout the history of the American West. Then there will also be those who will complain about early day special effects and stunts. Well hey, that's why they were early day and that is how show business people learned to improve movies and technology over the years. So get over it and just enjoy the movie. I'm not going to go through the story line, most of us are familiar with following Davy Crockett and his pal Georgie Russel as they tamed the Indian uprisings, through Congress and on to the Alamo in Texas. I just bought and watched the movie on a DVD which also includes Davy Crockett and the River Pirates and a Chip & Dale cartoon. The picture on this DVD is absolutely beautiful, it looks like it was made yesterday instead of 1954. My nine year old grandson came in when it was just starting. He began watching and sat all the way through and loved it. So it stands the test of time. I haven't seen it for quite some years and it took me back to the days when we knew who the good guys were and who the bad guys were. Not like many movies today where the distinction is a blur and bad guys are made to look like good guys. No wonder so many kids are confused, but that's another subject. I actually picked up on a couple of bloopers I hadn't noticed in younger years. In the scene where Davy is about to fight Red Stick and an Indian offers him the choice of a sharp hatchet or a blunt stone ax, the weapons magically switch hands from when the Indian is seen from the front and from the back. Also, at the Alamo when Davy shoots the two Mexican soldiers working the cannon using Betsy his single shot musket, he does it quickly as if he had two barrels or a breach-loader. So quick there was no time to reload. Allow me to focus on some of the actors in the movie. Fess Parker is the only Davy Crockett to me. In fact, so much so, that when I saw John Wayne playing him in the first Alamo, it was hard to believe he could be Davy. As good as John Wayne was he was no Davy Crockett compared to Fess Parker. Although Fess Parker certainly did some great film work other than Davy Crockett, he didn't stay with it and at one point seems to have dropped out of the movie\/TV scene and went into business. Maybe he figured it was hard to top his fame as Davy or maybe he just figured to go out on top. What is noteworthy is that Buddy Ebsen, who played the second part as the side kick, actually did much more in film. He was one heck of a dancer in his younger days if you've seen him in Shirley Temple's Captain January and others. He gained fame also as Jed Clampett on the Beverly Hillbillies and Barnaby Jones on TV. He was to be Davy Crockett until Walt Disney saw Fess Parker in Them and he was also to be the scarecrow in The Wizard of OZ until he became ill from the metallic makeup. Regardless, he did well for himself. Fess also did well in business and has owned a winery for some years in California. A big thanks to Fess and Buddy for a job well done! Other actors in the movie were Mike Mazurki as Bigfoot who was a wrestler before movies and usually played a tough guy, even back in an early Dick Tracy. Hans Conried was Thimblerig and a familiar face in many TV and movies including Uncle Tonoose in TVs Make Room for Daddy and the voice of Captain Hook in Disney's Peter Pan. Jim Bowie was played by Kenneth Tobey whom I remember in his own TV show in the 50's show titled Whirlybirds. Most of the other actors did not appear to go on to bigger and better film work. One can watch this over and over and never tire of it. So grab your musket and coon-skin cap and enjoy!

That said, the original Child's Play is a terrific film from which the sequels take their basis - a doll possessed by the spirit of a serial killer trying to get back to life by transferring his soul into a new body, and in this case, the body of a young boy, Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent). The troubles begin after Andy has been given the doll, and his babysitter, Maggie seemingly falls to her doom from the high-level apartment window. Of course, no one believes Andy when he tells them that it was Chucky, and it is only when it is mentioned Chucky is really Charles Lee Ray, that Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) begins to believe what is going on. Of course Andy's mother, Karen Barclay (played by the fabulous Catherine Hicks) doesn't believe her son at first, until she discovers that Chucky is moving without batteries.However, while the film is very fun, it is also lacking. While the interaction between Sarandon and Hicks is terrific, it would have been nice to see more of a romantic twist to their relationship. There is also a serious lack of supporting characters - the only one of real note is Maggie, but she is killed off in the first half hour, which is a shame, because she is played by Dinah Manoff - a.k.a. Marty from Grease. Dinah was spectacular, it is a shame her film career never really went anywhere. Of course, Brad Douriff appears as Charles Lee Ray, and then does the voice of Chucky.While a great film overall, it is easy to see why the franchise has gained so much popularity from the sequels.

Despite the fastidious cleverness of their creation, those who develop these films and stories silently and self-destructively want their works to be decoded and subsequently discarded. Their influence is therefore transitory, since they singularly prioritize the initially impregnable and overwhelmingly meticulous content of their pieces. This is dangerous because, when something is enigmatic but in an inevitably understandable way, it means that its audience will not only decipher its puzzles, but think that those puzzles represented the only substantial elements of the film. Once they are recognized and understood, a collective dismissal takes place, and everything else which accompanied those cryptograms is also disregarded.The primary developers of this film, author and screenwriter Jonathan Nolan and director Christopher Nolan, knew that this response was ineluctable, and therefore probably take responsibility for the potential transience of their movie. Or, at least, I personally hope that they would have been this responsible, since it would be unfortunate if they did not realize that the complementary beauties of the film, (e.g. Guy Pearce's acting, the clarity of its presentation, the sleekness of the black and white scenes and the historical depth of the characters), would all be neglected once the general enigma of the film was understood. Personally, I think that being a director like David Lynch would be much more individually profitable and endlessly rewarding, since Lynch is a director who provides no enigmas, and immediately informs us that there is nothing mathematical or puzzling about his film other than its incessantly apparent and omnipresent artistry. In this sense, one can always respect the originality of his form, while original content, like the kind which appears in Memento, is less devoted to its creator than to its audience. Lynch's magnificence lies in his uninhibited dedication to his intuition; it is something which he never departs from, which is why he annoys and frustrates a large number of audiences. When I claimed that he solipsistically refuses to part with himself, that also includes the departure from oneself which is an essential part of a director's empathy toward his audience. Lynch repudiates this departure and therefore only trusts himself, and yet this wonderful obduracy only allows us to trust in its endless exactitude and consistency, especially since it depends upon one director and therefore one vision, which is easier to preserve in an unchanging state than a variety of people who are all trying to wholly and consensually agree on the same principles. The Nolan brothers will not have this consistency because Memento is not about them. It is a film that could have been created by anybody. While these filmmakers are positively unusual in that they are interested in making a film selflessly isolated from their own lives, they must understand the unfortunate Machiavellian idea that such empathy goes unrewarded, and people will fail to recognize the anomalous sympathy that has been given them and will nonetheless discard the film after they have understood it. But, overall, as I solidified in the first sentence of this comment, the film asks for it. If it comprehended its own situation a bit more, it would have known that it should not just prioritize its own content, because, once that content is understood, the entire film will be disposed of. The creators also could have realized that, if they placed more importance upon elements that were timelessly important to themselves, the audience's dismissal would not matter because a few of the film's qualities would perpetually exist solely in their own minds. Nevertheless, they do not take advantage of these opportunities, and everything in the film is servile to the content rather than to their own independent vision. For instance, the black and white shots of the film have a refreshing beauty to them, (if only for their extreme contrast with the film's color scenes), but, because the movie is generally subservient to its clever structure and story, these aesthetical elements will be neglected and forgotten because the viewer will correctly know that they were secondary to the enigma of the movie.This consideration is the result of just one form of viewer-response criticism that can be applied to Memento.

I have seen a lot of them on the History Channel and they all suck! But as I watched the movie further and further I realized it was more emotional than I first perceived. The movie gave you true to life scenes of what it is to be a modern white Skinhead. All the parts were played perfectly, Edward Nortons' acting is superb. He plays the role so strongly that sometimes you believe that he REALLY is a Nazi (althought he is not). The drama in this movie is so realistic and very violent too. For example there is a scene is this movie where Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is in prison and gets raped by his fellow Skinheads because Derek believed they did not convey the views of the Aryan (Neo-Nazi) brotherhood like they were supposed to. Furthermore, after he is raped, one of his old history teacher in high school talks to him about his brother Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong T2 actor). Daniel is Derek's older brother and he is killed at the end of the movie because he was a skinhead. Overall this movie is so true to life that it seems like a documentary but it is a movie.

From the gitgo it's made abundantly clear that these are four nasty dudes who the town ought to deal with expeditiously. But the good elements of the town have grown fat and lazy and content to throw the responsibility of law and order on Cooper's shoulders. And he's quitting anyway, going on his honeymoon with his Quaker bride. A new marshal is going to arrive the next day. Why get involved. They want Cooper to just take his problem elsewhere. That view is probably best expressed by Thomas Mitchell in the scene at the church.Speaking of the scene in the church my favorite business in High Noon is when preacher Morgan Farley tells Cooper how dare he come into the church because a few hours earlier he didn't see fit to get married in that church. What a set of priorities.Grace Kelly had her breakthrough role in High Noon. She's a Quaker with deeply held pacifist principles. She's marrying a lawman, but one who's quitting that life. Her best scene in the film is with Katy Jurado who is Cooper's former gal pal. Katy explains the facts of life to Grace about marriage and the duty of standing by your man, long before Tammy Wynette ever sung about it. When the time comes, Grace does the right thing.Like his rival in western films, John Wayne, Gary Cooper had one of the great faces for movie closeups. Back in the day it used to be a running joke about how Cooper's dialog used to be just yep and nope. It was a good deal more than that. But High Noon's plot is carried quite a bit by the many closeup shots of Cooper. His face tells more than ten pages of speech and it keeps the tension of the film going. Man did not win two Academy Awards for nothing. Of course the theme of High Noon is also expressed in Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington's Academy Award winning song, sung at times during the film by Tex Ritter. However the big hit record of the film was from Frankie Laine. I doubt there has ever been a movie theme song that expressed everything you needed to know about the motivation of the central character in the film. I don't think High Noon would have attained the classic status it has without that song.Another great performance in the film is Lon Chaney, Jr. as the former town marshal, old and cynical, who'd like to help Cooper out, but at his age and health realizes he'd be more of a hindrance. He's the only one that Cooper understands and forgives.The final gun battle is choreographed like a ballet, it's that good. Maybe the best ever filmed. Can't describe it, you got to see it.The interaction of the town's responsibilities for maintaining law and order and Cooper's personal pride and integrity have been dealt with in various ways in other films. I'd check out Rio Bravo, Warlock, Death of a Gunfighter, Welcome to Hard Times, all of these take a different slant on the same themes.But personally I've always liked what the townspeople did in a Frank Sinatra film, Johnny Concho.

Director Robert Zemeckis, Screenplay Martin Donovan and David Koepp, Music by Alan Silvestri.Released in 1992, director Rob Zemeckis' Death Becomes Her (a joke on the phrase that dress becomes her, that hat becomes her) is an enjoyable dark comedy out of the early 90's. Far better written than most comedies of the time, this film relied on the chemistry of the principal actors- Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis- and a tale of biting satire and social commentary enhanced through eye-popping visual effects. Meryl Streep hams it up as Madeline Ashton, a washed-up, aging film and stage actress who hits rock bottom when her latest Broadway performance meets with harsh criticism. Her long-time rival Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn) attends the performance and introduces Madeline to her successful surgeon\/mortician husband Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis). Madeline and Helen have long fought not over him, but over which of them would become the greater success. Madeline steals Ernest from Helen. Now that Madeline has the upper hand, Helen sinks into depression, grows fat and is institutionalized in a mental hospital. She is bent on getting revenge. Years later, Helen writes a book for women on keeping beautiful and Madeline, who is now aging herself, attends the book signing. Helen has become a beautiful thin and youthful looking woman. Madeline and Ernest are stuck in an unhappy marriage, Madeline feels unattractive and becomes bitchier and bitchier. She resolves her crisis through a visit to the eccentric and reclusive Madame Lisle Von Rhoman (Isabella Rosselini in a great performance) who offers her an elixir that not only stops the aging process dead in its track, but grants her immortality. Later we discover that Helen had also taken the potion. Helen orders Ernest to kill Madeline, which he does by pushing down a long flight of stairs. She comes back from the dead, however. The visual effects, which feature such unrealistic touches as Madeline's twisted neck and torso, and later, after Helen is killed, Helen's pale walking cadaver (those eyes are also computer graphics) are what most people remember fondly about this film. They are Tim Burton effects and one wonders why he didn't call dibs on this film. The music by Alan Silvestri is dark, brooding and haunting but could probably use a touch of comedic flair like the music of Danny Elfman (who wrote music for Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas and the recent Corpse Bride and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). This film is highly entertaining and well-written. The theme of women's obscessions with looks (Hollywood actress and their fans I'm talking about you!) as a huge detriment to one's humanity has never been more satirically captured. Because Madeline and Helen prioritize their youth and looks, they miss out on the true meaning of life and living forever- simply living for love, family, children, good deeds. Ultimately, they end up stuck for eternity with each other and they fall to pieces literally. There is much to admire in this film. Visually and cinematographically it's a feast for the eyes. It resembles a modern Gothic romance without any real romance (neither Madeline or Helen loved Ernest). Its a real blow to women's egos and sense of vanity. I especially love the surreal scenes such as the Nuns who seem to be floating down a hospital corridor as Ernest arrives at the morgue. At Madame Lisle's Spring Ball, held in her enormous castle in the Hollywood Hills, we see dead famous sex icons and actors looking young and alive including Elvis, Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monrie and Jim Morrisson!

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"22 April 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" A Clockwork Orange is without any doubt the most politically incorrect movie that I could have seen in my short life. Full of sex, violence and shocking and degrading images so much that it could make the screen blowing off, it appears necessary to wonder why many people (including myself) dare to talk about this Kubrick picture as a masterpiece.A Clockwork Orange tells the story of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a young delinquent who patrols the streets of a futuristic and dystopic London accompanied by his Droogies and their only goal is to get a bit of the old ultra-violence. We can quickly discover Alex's only three interests savage violence, raping and Ludwig van Beethoven. Why does he love Beethoven so much? Judging by the images that are shown, it's simply that Beethoven's music inspires violence in Alex's soul.However, Alex's life takes a different turn when he is betrayed by his Droogies and then arrested and jailed for fourteen years for the murder of a lady in her residence. After two years of incarceration, Alex is offered to be liberated after two weeks if he agrees to give himself up to an experimental treatment which is supposed to free him from any desire for violence and brutal sexual acts.Even if there isn't any doubt that the main theme for this film is the origins of good and evil in the human being, it could be totally normal that some people ask questions about the utility of including so many scenes of violence and sex in order for the story to make the point about the conclusions it attends to draw.It's probably because A Clockwork Orange seems more to be an exercise of style and a test of tolerance rather than a simple and ordinary allegory about a dystopia that doesn't really differ from many other portrayals that we've already seen before.Stanley Kubrick doesn't content himself by putting degrading scenes in their most natural character. He brings each time his own personal touch and transforms the vice into art.Kubrick's favorite weapon remains the ironic use of music, just like in 2001. Rossini's services are particularly used. The brawling scene between Alex's own gang and a rival gang is particularly brutal, not to say almost humorous, and that on the strains of Rossini's The Thieving Magpie.The scene where Alex rapes two young girls in his room is very particular and is probably the best one in the whole movie. In fact, the scene is shot in fast-motion on the strains of the famous piece William Tell Overture (also played in fast-motion).And obviously, how could we forget the famous raping scene of Mr. Alexander's (Patrick Magee) wife? How could we forget those images where Alex, wearing a Pinocchio-like mask, ill-treats his victims while singing Singin' in the Rain and dancing just like Gene Kelly? In fact, Kubrick's cinematography stays simple except at the moments where offending images appear. So Kubrick's goal is to prove that it is possible to treat violence as an art. It's nothing but morally unacceptable, so why doing it? Kubrick rather seems to ask why not doing it? It's rather obvious that Kubrick doesn't give a damn about the commercial side of cinema. After all, his film originally received a X from MPAA and was inevitably condemned by religious authorities. It must be admitted Kubrick didn't draw a very flattering portrait of religion in his movie. We can see four plaster Christs wearing rather prominent crotches and Alex, in his fantasies, imagines himself taking pleasure to whip Jesus carrying his cross and we can see him taking part to bloody death fights and orgies.The society presented in A Clockwork Orange really is a totally absurd society where totalitarian and repressive governments can emerge anywhere, even in traditionally democratic states like England. Several characters are so much bizarre that we cannot even consider them as living caricatures. It's the case of Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris) with his totally ridiculous smile who drinks water from a glass containing a denture. There also are the prison guards which look more like soldiers than civil servants. Their chief (Michael Bates) furiously look like Adolf Hitler.The film succeeds in giving the impression of a futuristic world without ever showing any futuristic technology. Everything is based upon peculiarity. We can see Alex and his Droogies wearing totally white suits as well as bowler hats, top hats and flat caps. As for women, they dye their hair in fluorescent green, blue and pink. The architecture and design are also odd, without counting upon the fact that it's often garish and ugly.But Malcolm McDowell's performance is all but undesirable. His character shows so much charisma that he almost hides his sadism and his own darkness. He is violent, not because of a mental disorder, nor because of an unstable family or social order, but because he chose to act that way. He also made the choice of subjecting himself to the Ludovico treatment and he made the choice of throwing himself out of the window when he's unable to bear with his new situation. But the treatment looks like an antidote to freedom. So it's a formidable battle that Alex does against society itself. And when he's searching for forgiveness, he can't find anyone ready to offer him.It's therefore a cold, hopeless and pessimistic look that Kubrick offers here. In his case, it's just normal. He simply combined his ideas with an exercise of style that acts at the same time as some kind of test to check out what an audience is ready to bear to watch a movie. Even thirty-five years later, A Clockwork Orange have lost nothing of its ability to shock and cause controversy. For me, it's a shocking film but there's nothing to blame.

Full of sex, violence and shocking and degrading images so much that it could make the screen blowing off, it appears necessary to wonder why many people (including myself) dare to talk about this Kubrick picture as a masterpiece.A Clockwork Orange tells the story of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a young delinquent who patrols the streets of a futuristic and dystopic London accompanied by his Droogies and their only goal is to get a bit of the old ultra-violence. We can quickly discover Alex's only three interests savage violence, raping and Ludwig van Beethoven. Why does he love Beethoven so much? Judging by the images that are shown, it's simply that Beethoven's music inspires violence in Alex's soul.However, Alex's life takes a different turn when he is betrayed by his Droogies and then arrested and jailed for fourteen years for the murder of a lady in her residence. After two years of incarceration, Alex is offered to be liberated after two weeks if he agrees to give himself up to an experimental treatment which is supposed to free him from any desire for violence and brutal sexual acts.Even if there isn't any doubt that the main theme for this film is the origins of good and evil in the human being, it could be totally normal that some people ask questions about the utility of including so many scenes of violence and sex in order for the story to make the point about the conclusions it attends to draw.It's probably because A Clockwork Orange seems more to be an exercise of style and a test of tolerance rather than a simple and ordinary allegory about a dystopia that doesn't really differ from many other portrayals that we've already seen before.Stanley Kubrick doesn't content himself by putting degrading scenes in their most natural character. He brings each time his own personal touch and transforms the vice into art.Kubrick's favorite weapon remains the ironic use of music, just like in 2001. Rossini's services are particularly used. The brawling scene between Alex's own gang and a rival gang is particularly brutal, not to say almost humorous, and that on the strains of Rossini's The Thieving Magpie.The scene where Alex rapes two young girls in his room is very particular and is probably the best one in the whole movie.

It doesn't have to rely on smut or toilet humour to satisfy the audience, just a classic battle of the sexes we can all relate to. It's witty, the dialogue is snappy and fast-paced and the acting is near perfect. So let's have a closer look at the plot of this gem Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Colbert) has just defied her father by marrying society aviator King Westley. Her angry father wishes to keep Ellie away from her unsuitable husband and whisks her away on his private yacht. Daddy hasn't counted on Ellie's tenacity and will- fed up with the fact her childish hunger-strike is going nowhere she literally jumps overboard. When back on dry land she tries to make her way back to her husband by bus trip. A series of unfortunate events bring out of work newspaper reporter Peter Warne into her life.

Colbert beats the cocky Gable at his own game by proving that SHE doesn't have to use her thumb to pull a ride. Instead she shows a bit of leg and stops a vehicle, much to the horror of Gable. Great stuff!This film almost single-handedly established the great screwball comedy. Colbert's Ellie is the ultimate screwy dame,paving the way for Lombard and Hepburn in the genre, with Gable's Peter a direct forerunner to the Fredrich March character in the screwball classic 'Nothing Sacred' (1937).

It was going to be so dark, so scary and so downright evil that youngsters nationwide were going to soil themselves in unison. Hell, the BBFC even came up with a 12 rating to keep the little blighters out of cinemas. But when you look at it now, and when you compare it to Batman Begins with characters tripping their tits off, it seems rather tame.One of the offending scenes was when we see the scarring on the Jerry Hall's face. According to newspaper reports and playground rumour, the sight was going to be so terrifying that your heart was going to spontaneously explode in your chest. But in reality it just looks like she's been lying on a pillow for forty-eight hours and her face has got marked from excessive snoozing. The other scene that was supposedly going to leave skidmarks was when the Joker fries a man with an electric buzzer. This was going to be so hardcore that you'd run from the cinema and seek out that lovely Gary Glitter chap for protection and support. But instead it's just very funny. I imagine that kids, little bastards that they are, loved it. Man gets burnt to a crisp? Wicked! And anyway, as far scaring the bejesus out of children, Batman can't really compare to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Melting faces and snakes crawling out of the mouths of skeletons? Mummy, I need a change of underwear! (And that got a PG rating. Go figure!) But how does the film hold up seventeen years on? Pretty well, actually. Although I do have to say that it pales in comparison to Batman Begins. This Batman lacks any real depth and none of the characters have more than two dimensions. This Batman is all about surfaces. But what surfaces they are. Burton's Gotham is a weird and wonderful place. It's like an unholy ménage-a-trois between the 40s, the 80s and German Expressionism. You've got to love that.The best piece of production design in the film has to be the cathedral. Architecturally it makes no sense whatsoever &#150; it looks more like a skyscraper than a place of worship &#150; but who cares? It looks absolutely stunning. And I also love the Axis Chemical Factory. It's as beautifully ugly as a factory should be.I also love the atmosphere of the film. The woods, in particular, when Batman is taking Vicki Vale to the Bat Cave, look great. They look genuinely creepy. And I love the way that Batman is introduced. Two criminals mug a family and then as they're counting their spoils you see Batman descend in the distance. It's a wonderful visual. And Keaton's I'm Batman moment is even better than Bale's. Sure Bale's got that cool growl, but Keaton gets to dangle a criminal off the edge of a building while staring with those manic eyes of his. He really does look psychotic.But unfortunately the film never really delves into Wayne's character. You get brief flashes of his madness, his social unease and you get a flashback explaining his parents' death, but it's rather tokenistic. I mean, Jack Napier is made his parents killer just so that the final confrontation can be made personal. And Wayne's relationship with Vicki Vale is also rather uninteresting. They get drunk, have sex and fall out. Plus she screams a lot. However, her character is redeemed in one act. Near the end, in a cunning ruse, she distracts the Joker by kissing him. Then she slowly goes downstairs. Of course Batman pops up before anything happens, but you've got to like a woman with a mind like that.But of course it's the Joker that makes the film so much fun. With his arched eyebrows and manic grin, Nicholson was born to play the part. One of my favourite bits has to be when he invades the art gallery and swats a bronze statue away with his hand. The joy on his face is priceless and I love that it doesn't cause him serious pain. And the Joker commercial, the hand buzzer killing and the Grissom murder are wonderful too. But he's also great as Jack Napier. I love the little scene with Jerry Hall You look fine. I didn't ask. And he looks utterly deranged in his scenes with Eckhardt. If anything, Nicholson is more threatening as Napier.But what also makes the film is the music. It's a fantastic score. I especially like the title march and the cues in the woods and just before Napier shoots Eckhardt. It's just a bit of a shame then that you also have Prince music in the film. But it's not too objectionable, I guess. And it's appropriately used.A few more observations about the film Michael Gough is great as Alfred (although it causes me physical pain to remember him in Batman & Robin), the Mayor bears an uncanny resemblance to Ken Livingstone, I can remember the script almost word for word because I've seen it so many times (He hung up!&#133;Bob, gun.&#133;This is Renee on the newsfloor.&#133;Never rub another man's rhubarb!), I fancied the pants off Kim Basinger as a kid, gun-wielding mimes are genius and apparently flimsy pieces of tin can stop bullets. But here's something else I noticed. The Joker is poisoning products, so people stop using anything that might have been contaminated &#150; cosmetics, health and hygiene products etc. As a result everyone looks like crap &#150; especially the news reporters. However, in the next scene you cut to Harvey Dent. Billy Dee Williams looks like a million bucks. He's groomed within an inch of his life. No damn Joker is going to stop Lando Calrissian from looking fine.

But what surfaces they are. Burton's Gotham is a weird and wonderful place. It's like an unholy ménage-a-trois between the 40s, the 80s and German Expressionism. You've got to love that.The best piece of production design in the film has to be the cathedral. Architecturally it makes no sense whatsoever &#150; it looks more like a skyscraper than a place of worship &#150; but who cares? It looks absolutely stunning. And I also love the Axis Chemical Factory. It's as beautifully ugly as a factory should be.I also love the atmosphere of the film. The woods, in particular, when Batman is taking Vicki Vale to the Bat Cave, look great. They look genuinely creepy. And I love the way that Batman is introduced. Two criminals mug a family and then as they're counting their spoils you see Batman descend in the distance. It's a wonderful visual. And Keaton's I'm Batman moment is even better than Bale's. Sure Bale's got that cool growl, but Keaton gets to dangle a criminal off the edge of a building while staring with those manic eyes of his. He really does look psychotic.But unfortunately the film never really delves into Wayne's character. You get brief flashes of his madness, his social unease and you get a flashback explaining his parents' death, but it's rather tokenistic. I mean, Jack Napier is made his parents killer just so that the final confrontation can be made personal. And Wayne's relationship with Vicki Vale is also rather uninteresting. They get drunk, have sex and fall out. Plus she screams a lot. However, her character is redeemed in one act. Near the end, in a cunning ruse, she distracts the Joker by kissing him. Then she slowly goes downstairs. Of course Batman pops up before anything happens, but you've got to like a woman with a mind like that.But of course it's the Joker that makes the film so much fun. With his arched eyebrows and manic grin, Nicholson was born to play the part. One of my favourite bits has to be when he invades the art gallery and swats a bronze statue away with his hand. The joy on his face is priceless and I love that it doesn't cause him serious pain. And the Joker commercial, the hand buzzer killing and the Grissom murder are wonderful too. But he's also great as Jack Napier. I love the little scene with Jerry Hall You look fine. I didn't ask. And he looks utterly deranged in his scenes with Eckhardt. If anything, Nicholson is more threatening as Napier.But what also makes the film is the music. It's a fantastic score. I especially like the title march and the cues in the woods and just before Napier shoots Eckhardt. It's just a bit of a shame then that you also have Prince music in the film. But it's not too objectionable, I guess. And it's appropriately used.A few more observations about the film Michael Gough is great as Alfred (although it causes me physical pain to remember him in Batman & Robin), the Mayor bears an uncanny resemblance to Ken Livingstone, I can remember the script almost word for word because I've seen it so many times (He hung up!&#133;Bob, gun.&#133;This is Renee on the newsfloor.&#133;Never rub another man's rhubarb!), I fancied the pants off Kim Basinger as a kid, gun-wielding mimes are genius and apparently flimsy pieces of tin can stop bullets. But here's something else I noticed. The Joker is poisoning products, so people stop using anything that might have been contaminated &#150; cosmetics, health and hygiene products etc. As a result everyone looks like crap &#150; especially the news reporters. However, in the next scene you cut to Harvey Dent. Billy Dee Williams looks like a million bucks. He's groomed within an inch of his life. No damn Joker is going to stop Lando Calrissian from looking fine.

It was going to be so dark, so scary and so downright evil that youngsters nationwide were going to soil themselves in unison. Hell, the BBFC even came up with a 12 rating to keep the little blighters out of cinemas. But when you look at it now, and when you compare it to Batman Begins with characters tripping their tits off, it seems rather tame.One of the offending scenes was when we see the scarring on the Jerry Hall's face. According to newspaper reports and playground rumour, the sight was going to be so terrifying that your heart was going to spontaneously explode in your chest. But in reality it just looks like she's been lying on a pillow for forty-eight hours and her face has got marked from excessive snoozing. The other scene that was supposedly going to leave skidmarks was when the Joker fries a man with an electric buzzer. This was going to be so hardcore that you'd run from the cinema and seek out that lovely Gary Glitter chap for protection and support. But instead it's just very funny. I imagine that kids, little bastards that they are, loved it. Man gets burnt to a crisp? Wicked! And anyway, as far scaring the bejesus out of children, Batman can't really compare to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Melting faces and snakes crawling out of the mouths of skeletons?

Among the cast, there are 7 Academy awards between them. The greatest of American actresses, Katharine Hepburn won 4 including one for this film. Henry Fonda won his only academy award even though he was one of America's greatest living actors. You can't imagine any other actor or actress playing Norman and Ethel Thayer. Jane Fonda has always been a great actress of her own. Even though winning 2 Oscars was never as thrilling as accepting on the behalf of her dying father.

I can't forget Dabney Coleman playing their daughter's boyfriend and Doug McKeon as the grandson that Henry's character, Norman Thayer, never had. I bet Katharine Hepburn performed her own dive in the water. It's still one of the best films of the last century which did not get in the top 100 films of all time. I can't imagine why. The cast is excellent. Believe it or not! Jane Fonda fought to get this produced because she knew her father was dying and the studios didn't want to take a chance on Henry Fonda. There are several great moments in the film. Sometimes the film is heartbreaking like when Norman talks back to the teens on the dock. I love the way that Fonda and Hepburn really act and appear like an old couple. I thought they were together in real life. You can't imagine a finer couple on screen. I'm glad Jane did this film as well. Who else can play Henry Fonda's daughter? You have to believe that they weren't acting between father and daughter.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"22 April 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I have mixed feelings about Bakshi and Krantz's 1972 film adaptation of the Fritz the Cat books. Robert Crumb is one of my favourite underground cartoonists and satirists, and it's more than a little frustrating to see the liberties the director and producer take with his priceless characters. When the screenplay sticks closely to Crumb's original comic strips, it's fine, but every time it deviates from the source material, it falls as flat as a pancake. Bakshi, who constructed the screenplay from various Fritz stories written and drawn by Crumb between 1964 and 1968, proves himself to be rather incompetent, piecing and patching together the diverse elements with tiresome experimental sequences, dull musical interludes and downright crude sex and violence - Crumb certainly never steered clear of putting down his darkest fears and fantasies on paper, but Bakshi's scenes of a horse-woman being whipped with a motorcycle chain and Fritz chasing after a buxom female crow are embarrassingly wide of the mark. For all his excesses, Crumb knew when to exercise restraint, and Bakshi's refusal to do so is what ultimately sinks this film. There are, however, some very good scenes and the animation is occasionally brilliant, which is why the chapter select button on your DVD remote control will certainly come in useful should you decide to check this one out. The film is also remarkably truthful in its depiction of the New York City of the late sixties as it really was, with bad vibes, segregation, drugs, rape, murder and squalor as far as the eye could see. Sharp-eyed Crumb enthusiasts will also spot Av 'n' Gar (or is it the Simp and the Gimp?) and Angelfood McSpade in a couple of scenes.
