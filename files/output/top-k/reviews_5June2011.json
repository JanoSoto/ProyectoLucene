A family of five is living the peaceful life when one night their youngest daughter Carol Anne starts talking to something inside the TV. With the iconic lines They're heeeere a series of paranormal events occur with the Carol Anne being sucked through the closet and into the spiritual world. Refusing to leave her cursed home Diane, the desperate mother played by Jobeth Williams, contacts scientists and spiritualists, doing everything in her power to get her daughter back. If the question is does Poltergeist scare then the answer seems to be a mixed yes and no. Unfortunately Poltergeist is a film that doesn't age well with time. The reason being is that Poltergeist relies heavily on its special effects and puppet techniques that simply seem ancient nowadays. With computer effects advancing at such a fast pace anything over 20 years will seem antiquated. At the time I'm sure the effects were miraculous but watching scenes from Poltergeist today is like going to a 50 year old ride at Disney land. Yes there's a bit of charm to it but the tricks are only going to work on toddlers. One example is the tree scene, where this tree made out of wire and molding is clearly not a tree at all and looks ridiculous obtuse in their suburban backyard. The scene I found the scariest actually occurred in the first five minutes and had no special effects. The scene is of a little girl with huge eyes and strobing lights. The vulnerability of the girl alone combined with the music is a powerful effect. Everyone knows this movie is going to be full of scares but not knowing what they're going to be is the terrifying part. Poltergeist is a little long; six minutes short of 2 hours is far too long to sit still being scared every 15 minutes. The story is a little uneven with very important characters introduced into the movie very late. The acting is not too bad. Williams' desperation comes from a true place most of time but many of the side characters aren't all that impressive. The film also starts to grow a little cancerous towards the last third. What I mean is that all of sudden the haunting expands in dramatic fashion but instead of being scarier Spielberg simply goes for bigger. The special effects are enlarged in scope stretching beyond the house. This choice almost takes it away from horror and turns Poltergeist into scifi, which we know Spielberg is great at. However in this case I don't think a clear cohesion between the two genres was achieved. At its release Poltergeist was probably break through for its time. There are some unique scares which you will notice from other films that copied it but the overall Poltergeist doesn't contain that 'timeless horror' feeling like that the Shinning or The Exorcist. Who this film is not for -People who don't like horror films -People who constantly obsess over the quality of the special effects.

Brando pushes away a drunk with too many earnest solicitations. They remind each other of the schooldays they shared. Saint drops her white -- her very white -- glove accidentally and while they chat Brando picks it up and fiddles with it, brushing off the dirt, trying it on.

They would occasionally appear in films and TV, but were often being played for laughs such as in 'The Munsters.' It was time for them to make a big comeback and terrify is again. With the Horror boom of the 1980s it was just a matter of time before someone took a shot at it. By then audiences were more sophisticated and so filmmakers really had a great challenge on their hands. 'The Howling' not only pays tribute to classic werewolf lore, but successfully updates and pokes fun at it as well.Pros Excellent work by the ensemble cast. Suspenseful story.

For the McMullen's, the family business is armed robbery. Jessie McMullen (Sean Connery) is an aging yet unabashed criminal who has been in the business for many years. When his grandson, Adam (Matthew Broderick), finds the opportunity to net a cool million dollars, Jessie organizes one last heist with himself, Adam, and Adam's father, Jessies son, Vito (Dustin Hoffman). Vito is reluctant at first, but eventually comes around to pull of the heist. The movie tells the story of some rocky family ties and how the relationship between these three generations waxes and wanes in a very unconventional method.The film is directed by the late and great Sydney Lumet. Lumet wasn't a consistent director and obviously put out some pretty terrible films, as well as some incredible films. Family Business falls right in between these two poles. It has its problems but it isn't a terrible film. Lumet directs the film very well with some great tracking shots of various New York locations we see in the film. The two funerals that take place in the film both include pans that lay out the characters very nicely in tightly constructed cinematography that isn't exactly flashy or incredible to look at, but adds a very subtle quality to the direction of the film. Lumet also directs his actors with a lot of precision and the performances from the three leads are excellent. All three characters are very different, not only in age but in personality and personal convictions. Each actor plays their character's nuances and attitudes very nicely, delivering dialogue that is at times cheesy and convoluted, yet also sharp when it isn't being silly.The nice thing about this film is that there aren't any glaring issues. There are a multitude of small problems along the way, but nothing that kills the film's momentum or ruins the story. The issues range from bad chunks of dialogue, to moments that just don't fit well with the story, like Sean Connery singing. There are some pretty ugly plot holes that stick out when present, but thankfully they aren't anything that carry over throughout the film, causing more and more unrealistic problems. Overall the story doesn't exactly tie up as nicely as it could have. It leaves some loose ends and it resolves a few points a little too easily. I can't buy into everything that happened in this film, but I can believe enough to say that this is a decent film.This is really just a film that sets out to entertain and tell an interesting story. It kept me interested from start to finish, and there were enough good things about this film to allow me to thoroughly enjoy it. The high points would be Lumet's direction and the great performances from the three leads. The low points would be the kinks in the story and some of the forced dialogue.

I just don't see that it is any better than any other good and fun sci fi films that really aren't much more than a thrill ride.But one thing it does have going for it that's great is that it shows how ridiculous the notion of time travel really is. For those who think such must be possible, you probably slept through or didn't take a class in physics. Since time is nothing more than an arbitrary measurement of relative motion of objects in relation to one another, it does not truly have a forward or backward direction. Einstein knew this and that's why he related time to physical motion, hence the name, Theory of Relativity, and he saw the perception of time as variable dependent upon the relative speed of the subject, but it's doubtful that many sci-fi fans understand this. (As proof. watch how many NO's I get on this) They believe that one can fall into a black hole and pop out through a wormhole into another time or faraway location in the universe, when all that would happen is they'd be crushed into being part of the dense matter of the black hole.The abstract ideations called the past and the future are more a product of mental awareness of this motion which creates events that are kept in memory (known to us as the past) or events considered as possible through conjecture (known as the future). Time travel only can exist as a mental abstract ideation, and that's it.Such travel is shown as being physically impossible in Terminator due to this scenario Terminator is sent to the past by cyborg rulers to kill the birth mother of human John Conner, who threatens later cyborg rule. Human Reese is sent by humans to stop the terminator. He becomes the father of human John Conner who later threatens cyborg rule. Basically an impossible event, shown as such by what would have been the initial series of events, as envisioned this way...Mom Conner would not have had son John in the first place without Reese, who would not have been sent after all because the terminator would not have been sent since John did not exist. Or envision this...Had cyborg rulers not sent terminator, then Reese would not go and could not father John Conner....And there are many other variations on these scenarios as well...Pretty much an impossible conundrum, which just goes to show that the notions of past and future only exist in our mental awareness, and everything that actually exists in our reality and our universe really has just one time of existence, the now and present.Even our memories of the past, notions of the future, and awareness of current existence which is due to the relative motion of objects, all happen within the now and present, the only actual time that is based in reality.For those who would dismiss this because you really want to believe in time travel, well, you certainly aren't Einstein.

The jokes are gross, in-your-face, and top each other in terms of raunchiness, but they are tired, dead, and truly redundant. I'll use a quote from critic Michael Phillips. You won't hear crickets in the audience. You'll hear dead crickets.And lastly, this movie is just boring. While the original was not a good movie, it at least held my interest. This was just such a drag. All in all, Scary Movie 2 just doesn't miss the mark, it misses the target completely. They can throw all the gross-out gags and random penises at the screen, but I could care less. I need a fresh, hot script and some good performers to make the movie. If you fail on those accounts, your movie fails. What was once fresh and hip, is now just old, tired, and begs the question, why?. I think the filmmakers got the title right this time. This movie is scary, because it isn't funny and just terrible to watch.

However, the film is overlong and filled with pointless exposition that goes absolutely nowhere, while on the whole the entire Skull Island sequence is uneventful and devoid of tension, mystery and atmosphere. The script may be grittier and more cynical, but some of the dialogue is also so bad it makes you cringe, Charles Grodin and Jessica Lange get the worst of it. The story is poorly paced and dull, while I felt nothing for the characters and didn't believe at all in the contrived romance. Apart from Bridges the acting is very bland, Charles Grodin is more annoying than funny, Jessica Lange is very sexy but her performance is marred by insipid dialogue and a poorly written character and King Kong is little more than a man in a cheap giant ape suit and there were times when I found him creepy(in a bad way) rather than lovable and poignant.

They must determine if a young Spanish-American is guilty or not guilty of the first degree murder by stabbing of his father, and if they all unanimously agree to find him guilty he instantly gets sentenced to death. With a weak alibi of going out to the movies and not remembering what he saw, a knife he supposedly bought and lost, and a number of witnessed hearing screams, someone shouting the words I'm going to kill you and possible seeing it happen, it seems open and shut. All Jurors have immediately decided to vote guilty, one Juror however is voting not guilty until he clears up the facts, this is Mr. Davis, aka Juror #8 (BAFTA winning Henry Fonda, also producing). At first he is voting opposite to everyone else for the sake of conversation and discussion, deliberations however crop up and he slowly straightens things out and brings forward things that the defence, prosecution and ultimately witnesses may have missed. These include Juror #8 having the same knife as the boy and pondering the stabbing, the noises going on when the murder happened, the reason for the shouted words, the timing of the old man heading to answer the door, and most importantly, a key witness who chose not to wear glasses but marks on her nose prove she does. Slowly the Jurors, some wise, bright and empathetic, one or two arrogant, prejudiced and merciless, may be seeing that this lone Juror has some good points and brings forward some good ideas as to what may have happened.

The next scene sees a woman smoking on a wooden fence, a chance encounter with a travelling businessman seeing him muse to her on philosophical issues and whatnot and we wonder why it is a man, whom look as if he belongs in a Moscow high-rise on the telephone speaking of bearer bonds, is out in the middle of rural nowhere talking of the afterlife on a windy day. The woman works at a printing office, the thought of an error in a print sending chills down her spine as she rushes to the print room through corridors lit by some impressionistic lighting inferring, via film form, the horror of the situation; the whole thing a neat parallel for the disaster that is The Mirror going to print-come-production.As The Mirror rolled on, the subtitles on my screen might have read anything; they might have read the most nonsensical, bleary eyed piece of stoner scripted garbage one may have ever had heard, and it still would not have made a difference. At numerous point, Tarkovskiy peppers his film with these poems that it's stated in the opening credits either he or one of his family wrote - whatever, it's a film and not a recital and it's worth noting that a film's poetry needs to be in its imagery; a film's lyrical qualities require it to be put across as such through its images so as to induce a poetic experience, so placing everything on pause for sixty seconds, as something deemed artistically or thematically significant is read out, is not the way to go. Another of Tarkovskiy's tics here sees him place a person, whom does not speak, in a scene by themselves before having all forms of dialogue put across via the voice of somebody not even there; an aggravating idea that would be more bothersome had it not been for the instances in which Tarkovskiy inserts war newsreel footage amidst his own, a troublesome happening seeing him attempt to feed off of whatever emotional response audiences may have out of it the moment the man holds up both hands, realises the hole he's dug his way into and observes his imagery but this point does not stir anything. Long before the film has finished, we have used up all our energy in begging for a compelling narrative; an engaging character framework of some sort - anything at all. A consensus amongst most, label them with as anything you like, sees a reoccurring sentiment born out of the masses' inability to watch anything not in their original language that isn't a dubbed eighty minute long Manga cartoon or that cheap, nudey flick from Scandanavia which isn't dubbed but promises some full-on examples of skin.

The woman works at a printing office, the thought of an error in a print sending chills down her spine as she rushes to the print room through corridors lit by some impressionistic lighting inferring, via film form, the horror of the situation; the whole thing a neat parallel for the disaster that is The Mirror going to print-come-production.As The Mirror rolled on, the subtitles on my screen might have read anything; they might have read the most nonsensical, bleary eyed piece of stoner scripted garbage one may have ever had heard, and it still would not have made a difference. At numerous point, Tarkovskiy peppers his film with these poems that it's stated in the opening credits either he or one of his family wrote - whatever, it's a film and not a recital and it's worth noting that a film's poetry needs to be in its imagery; a film's lyrical qualities require it to be put across as such through its images so as to induce a poetic experience, so placing everything on pause for sixty seconds, as something deemed artistically or thematically significant is read out, is not the way to go. Another of Tarkovskiy's tics here sees him place a person, whom does not speak, in a scene by themselves before having all forms of dialogue put across via the voice of somebody not even there; an aggravating idea that would be more bothersome had it not been for the instances in which Tarkovskiy inserts war newsreel footage amidst his own, a troublesome happening seeing him attempt to feed off of whatever emotional response audiences may have out of it the moment the man holds up both hands, realises the hole he's dug his way into and observes his imagery but this point does not stir anything. Long before the film has finished, we have used up all our energy in begging for a compelling narrative; an engaging character framework of some sort - anything at all. A consensus amongst most, label them with as anything you like, sees a reoccurring sentiment born out of the masses' inability to watch anything not in their original language that isn't a dubbed eighty minute long Manga cartoon or that cheap, nudey flick from Scandanavia which isn't dubbed but promises some full-on examples of skin. Such films are seen as alienating, complicated or positively cryptic; such people are deemed to stay as far away from them as possible despite missing out on what are more often than not wholesome and resonating pieces that instill and inspire.The Mirror, and those like it, are these films; these few films making up a small percentage of foreign language pictures more inclined towards confusing and disorientating &#x96; call them avant garde pieces; instillations; outsider art experiments or whatever you like, films such as The Mirror, in all their banality, are the reasons the generality of the sorts of levels of ignorance apparent as we know it both now and before, exists. It may very well be that the consensus agrees that such a sentiment could exist for the likes of Ingmar Bergman nonsense, and if there is then those people that refuse to watch one of the man's work for the above reasons is a fool - Bergman being a director of whom went through a period in the 1950s whose work then consisted of these gloriously accessible; devilishly involving; humble and really rather brilliant pictures, mostly about young people wishing to rebel and fall in love and whatnot, telling stories generations can relate to and come across as much more than mere experimental vanity projects. Yes, it is mostly Tarkovskiy's fault.

This was the case at Paramount in particular, who imported many of their directors from the continent and deliberately cultivated that sophisticated European flavour. German maestro Ernst Lubitsch was the most treasured of their acquisitions, and during the early 1930s fulfilled the studio's expectations for urbane comedies set among the idle and relatively carefree rich of far-off Europe.Lubitsch is &#x96; and was &#x96; best known for his so-called touch, a subtle, tasteful and very intelligent manner of hinting at the various sexual shenanigans that his characters continually get up to. But it is doing the man rather a disservice to focus so much on this, as there was a lot more to his style and to his career. Besides, a lot of the credit for the touch should go to writer Samson Raphaelson, as it was in the Raphelson-penned works when this clever innuendo was at its sharpest. The humour in Trouble in Paradise is all of a by-the-way fashion, with bizarrely comical phrases slipped neatly into the dialogue. What Lubitsch really does is match up with Raphaelson's sauciness on the visual side of things, dissolving from Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins canoodling on a couch, to the same couch now empty, to a Do not disturb sign being hung on a door. But it's not all about sex. What's nice about Trouble in Paradise is that despite the protagonists being a pair of thieves, we never see anything stolen. The thefts are just implied with a nonchalant revelation after the event.Consistently, Lubitsch's visual style is throughout one of taste and elegance. Lubitsch's sound films up to now had mostly been musicals, and although Trouble in Paradise is not a musical it is almost operatic in its stylised pace, often alternating between slow and fast scenes like the movements of a work of classical music. Lubitsch doesn't use many elaborate techniques, but simply manages the pace through careful coaching of the actors' motion and vocal delivery. The camera rarely moves, but when he does it is generally a discreet flourish to maintain the necessary rhythm. An example is when we cut from Kay Francis nattering on the phone straight into Marshall and Hopkins arguing. The shot begins with the camera dollying in on the pair, keeping the snappy pace going across the two scenes. The opening scene is smooth as a gondola on the water, the camera languidly tracking from the rubbish of the city, to the aftermath of a robbery, over to an gorgeous shot of Herbert Marshall , gazing out from a balcony with a look of exquisite melancholy in his eyes.Which leads me onto the players themselves. It is always a joy to watch Herbert Marshall, one of the best lead men of the 30s who has become something of an obscurity today. He is utterly suited to the style and pace of Trouble in Paradise, his movements elegant as a violinist playing largo, and his voice quiet yet commanding of our attention. He is superbly matched, in an opposites-attract scenario, by a vivacious Miriam Hopkins. These days Hopkins is often dismissed as an amateurish ham, but as Trouble in Paradise demonstrates she did everything with a pinch of deliberate irony. I love the way she fires off angry tirades, her face almost rigid except for the occasional fiery flash of an eyebrow. Kay Francis, the third corner in the love triangle, is stunningly beautiful but otherwise rather bland and forgettable, although perhaps this is the point. As to the supporting players, Edward Everett Horton is always nice to see, although he is a bit underused here, and clearly hadn't quite worked out his brilliant comic persona yet. C. Aubrey Smith on the other hand, as familiar a face in thirties Hollywood as Ned Sparks, is at his very best. Being a pompous villain seems to suit him far better than the venerable patriarchs he usually portrayed.Movies like Trouble in Paradise were popular of course because they offered escapism at a time of domestic strife. Today it remains a smart, witty, and very beautifully made confection. It is of course not nearly as touching as the raw emotion and sincerity of Warner Brothers' and Columbia's depression-era offerings, but it is nevertheless utterly enjoyable, undemanding, and treats us to the same delicate atmosphere of continental wit that it did to audiences of the time.

Ripley (Weaver) waking from hyper-sleep and follows her as she defends her actions of blowing up the Nostromo all those years ago. Moving swiftly on, as this film often does, a half-hearted plot is simply a poor excuse for lumping Ripley with a bunch of extremely dumb-witted and frankly, quite boring Space Marines, as they embark on a mission to rid a local planet of the terrifying creatures that the lieutenant is all too familiar with.The story in this film clearly was not the primary focus of the crew involved as the audience is made to sit through one tired cliché after another. We have the cocky marines who we know are going to last five minutes. We've got the quiet marine who is destined to be sole survivor. We've got a space shuttle crash landing and in effect trapping the unfortunate party on this desolate planet with only the Aliens for company. So far, so obvious.The opening hour of this film is throw-away to say the least as this is a film which has one gear, fifth gear and when it's not speeding along it's certainly at a standstill. The real action begins as the marines infiltrate the planet and as expected, don't get the warmest of welcomes from the Xenomorphs. Cue lots of gunfire, lots of frantic camera work and lots of screaming. As the dead weight of the cast is dealt with, we are left with Ripley firmly back in charge as she leads the remaining Marines and a girl called Newt, who they discovered on the planet, to as much safety as possible.The introduction of Newt is one of the stronger points of this film. It is a clever turn by Cameron as it gives the chance for Ripley's character to grow and display a maternal side that otherwise would never be explored in such a film. The performance from Carrie Henn as Newt, is one of sweet charm and more charisma than 90% of the Marines that are dragged along for the ride.Other than the character of Newt, the other highlight for the film is the Aliens themselves. As typical with sequels, we get a whole lot more of them. They really are a truly terrifying creation. One set piece in particular that works beautifully is where Newt is alone in a flooded corridor as the Xenomorph is stalking her. It's a scene full of suspense as Ripley and Hicks - the quiet Marine portrayed by Michael Biehn - use a tracking device to find her only to see that she is on the floor level below them. As Hicks begins to cut through the iron railings to get through to Newt, the same tracking device begins to beep again as a vast amount of Aliens move in. This scene is head and shoulders above the rest of the film and as the Alien reveals itself behind Newt, it is done so in a way that would not have looked out of place in the sublime original.Unfortunately for this reviewer, those scenes are just too few and far between in this sequel to warrant praise parallel with the original. The ending is another poorly judged action sequence involving a Queen Alien - which moves almost as awkwardly as the skeletal Terminator at the end of that film - battling Ripley who straps on a sort of dumper-truck like suit. This, for many, is an iconic scene. For me, it's as ridiculous as it sounds.While this review is largely negative, that is due in no small part to the fact that it is the follow-up to one of the greatest sci-fi\/horror\/suspense movies ever made. If it was a stand-alone actioner, it would be praised for certain elements such as the aforementioned Ripley\/Newt bond, but if it wants to wear the Alien tag then it will be reviewed in that context.In conclusion The original Alien drew comparisons with Jaws for it's suspense and more importantly, the style in which both films were crafted. Aliens in many senses can be compared to Jaws 2. Everything's bigger and bolder, but certainly not better. However, as with Jaws 2, there is some strong material, just don't go looking for something on the level of the original as you'll be bitterly disappointed.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2011","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" While this sequel is an exciting action-fest, it is ultimately inferior to Ridley Scott's original masterpiece and Cameron's own earlier triumph, The Terminator.Set 57 years after the terrifying ordeal of Scott's Alien, the story begins with Lt.

Moving swiftly on, as this film often does, a half-hearted plot is simply a poor excuse for lumping Ripley with a bunch of extremely dumb-witted and frankly, quite boring Space Marines, as they embark on a mission to rid a local planet of the terrifying creatures that the lieutenant is all too familiar with.The story in this film clearly was not the primary focus of the crew involved as the audience is made to sit through one tired cliché after another. We have the cocky marines who we know are going to last five minutes. We've got the quiet marine who is destined to be sole survivor. We've got a space shuttle crash landing and in effect trapping the unfortunate party on this desolate planet with only the Aliens for company. So far, so obvious.The opening hour of this film is throw-away to say the least as this is a film which has one gear, fifth gear and when it's not speeding along it's certainly at a standstill. The real action begins as the marines infiltrate the planet and as expected, don't get the warmest of welcomes from the Xenomorphs. Cue lots of gunfire, lots of frantic camera work and lots of screaming. As the dead weight of the cast is dealt with, we are left with Ripley firmly back in charge as she leads the remaining Marines and a girl called Newt, who they discovered on the planet, to as much safety as possible.The introduction of Newt is one of the stronger points of this film. It is a clever turn by Cameron as it gives the chance for Ripley's character to grow and display a maternal side that otherwise would never be explored in such a film. The performance from Carrie Henn as Newt, is one of sweet charm and more charisma than 90% of the Marines that are dragged along for the ride.Other than the character of Newt, the other highlight for the film is the Aliens themselves. As typical with sequels, we get a whole lot more of them. They really are a truly terrifying creation. One set piece in particular that works beautifully is where Newt is alone in a flooded corridor as the Xenomorph is stalking her. It's a scene full of suspense as Ripley and Hicks - the quiet Marine portrayed by Michael Biehn - use a tracking device to find her only to see that she is on the floor level below them. As Hicks begins to cut through the iron railings to get through to Newt, the same tracking device begins to beep again as a vast amount of Aliens move in. This scene is head and shoulders above the rest of the film and as the Alien reveals itself behind Newt, it is done so in a way that would not have looked out of place in the sublime original.Unfortunately for this reviewer, those scenes are just too few and far between in this sequel to warrant praise parallel with the original. The ending is another poorly judged action sequence involving a Queen Alien - which moves almost as awkwardly as the skeletal Terminator at the end of that film - battling Ripley who straps on a sort of dumper-truck like suit. This, for many, is an iconic scene. For me, it's as ridiculous as it sounds.While this review is largely negative, that is due in no small part to the fact that it is the follow-up to one of the greatest sci-fi\/horror\/suspense movies ever made. If it was a stand-alone actioner, it would be praised for certain elements such as the aforementioned Ripley\/Newt bond, but if it wants to wear the Alien tag then it will be reviewed in that context.In conclusion The original Alien drew comparisons with Jaws for it's suspense and more importantly, the style in which both films were crafted. Aliens in many senses can be compared to Jaws 2. Everything's bigger and bolder, but certainly not better. However, as with Jaws 2, there is some strong material, just don't go looking for something on the level of the original as you'll be bitterly disappointed.6\/10 ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"}]
