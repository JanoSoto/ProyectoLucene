So again, you can't expect from me that I make a comparison between the two. But even if I had read the book I don't think I would have talked about it, because this doesn't honor the many work and inspiration that the director has put in it. It's not because he uses an existing story, that what he does with it, has to be completely the same...Even though the largest part of the story is situated during the Second World War, it doesn't start there. We first meet the novelist Maurice Bendrix and Henry Miles, the husband of his ex-mistress Sarah, on a rainy night in London in 1946. For a reason we don't know yet, the affair between Bendrix and Sarah was abruptly ended by her, two years before, and since then they hadn't seen each other. Now Bendrix's obsession with Sarah immediately gets a new spark and out of jealousy he arranges to have her followed. That's when we learn the reason for their separation. During a bombing raid, Sarah made a bargain with God. She would sacrifice their relationship in exchange for Bendrix's life. He survived and that's why she didn't want to see him anymore. But when he reappears, she soon realizes that it will be very difficult to keep her promise to God...When you hear in the trailer that Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore are magic together, you might believe that this is just some nice promo talk, only intended for making you buy the DVD. But for once they really didn't exaggerate. Together they lifted this movie to a higher level, although it must be said that Stephen Rea did a very fine job too. The fact that they had a very good and well-written script to work with, must have helped them too of course. Some were not pleased with what they called a couple of 'soft-porn scenes' but personally I didn't have a problem with that at all. In my opinion this only added to the rawness of the emotions.Some will also say that this is an incredibly boring movie. Well, if you don't like or are not used to watching a movie without big action scenes, than this is absolutely true. If you are such a person, than you better leave it alone and choose something else. But when you like to see a quality product (and no I'm not going to use the title 'art'-movie because I hate that name and this certainly isn't such a movie), with believable emotions, a great story and some excellent acting performances, than this might be a movie that you definitely should give a try.

That's also the reason why I saw The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc.When in 1412 a girl called Jeanne is born in a small village in France, the Hundred Years war with England makes life very difficult. She grows up as a very religious young woman who confesses several times a day and at the age of 13, she has her first vision when she finds a sword in a field. When she returns home with it, she finds the English looting and murdering her town. Many years later, she is convinced that it is her holy duty to be ridding France of the English. That's why in 1428 she meets Charles, the Dauphin of France, who is so desperate that he accepts all help, even when it comes from a 16 year old maiden with a divine mission. After she successfully liberated Orléans and Reims, the Dauphin is crowned traditionally in the cathedral of Reims. From that moment on he doesn't need her anymore, since his wishes are satisfied, and after he betrays Jeanne d'Arc, she is imprisoned by the Burgundians. They organize a trial against her under English law, but can't force her to confess about her divine visions which she has had continuously since childhood. Condemned of witchcraft and being considered as a relapsed heretic, she is sentenced to death and is burnt alive at only 19 years of age.The story is of course what it is. Because this is a movie that has been based on a biography, which already exists for a few hundred years, much can't go wrong. Only when the writers had added a lot of new elements to it, which I don't think they have done, this could have become a really awful movie. Now I had the feeling that they followed the original story pretty well and that's why this has become a more than decent movie. Sure, by today's standards this story isn't very believable, but that's not what you should keep in mind when watching it. If today someone would claim that she was sent by God to free us from evil, she would end up in a straitjacket and a mental hospital pretty soon, but all this happened in the 15th century, when people were much more religious and still believed such claims.When it comes to the battle scenes, you can expect a lot of brutal violence. A lot of dismemberment, people being hit by a large number of arrows or cut into pieces with a sword,... you will not be spared of anything of that. Personally I don't have any problem with it, because that's the way it was at the time, but I'm sure that not everybody will be able to look at it. But the entire movie isn't made up by such scenes of course. The most remarkable ones are probably those in which she has a vision. The way those were shot is really very nice and give it that extra mysterious feeling. Also worth noticing are the nice costumes and decors, which give a good impression of the time shown in the movie.The direction and the performances by the actors are the last thing that I want to tell you something about.

The movie begins with the graduation of two best friends from high school. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two rejects that just sort of drifted through school. They never got involved in anything and take a pessimistic attitude toward life. They are now stuck in limbo land between high school and the real world and haven't a clue as to where they are headed. Because they have nothing better to do, they choose to torment those around them. On day while sitting in a diner, they come across a personal add by a man looking for a women that he met eyes with. He thought their was chemistry between them and he writes the add hooping she will call. To torment this poor guy( played by Steve Buscemi as Seymour, a middle aged geek and social outcast), they call him pretending to be the women. They 'agree' to meet in a certain diner. The girls watch him sitting in the diner waiting for the women who of course never shows. He leaves the diner broken hearted. They follow him out of the dinner. Upon seeing what they had done to him, Enid starts to feel sorry for Seymour and takes to him to the point of even developing an attraction toward him probably because she sees him as an outcast much like herself. Seymour is the nerdy,self-conscience guy who never felt adequate around women. He is this intelligent artsy type guy with a huge collection of old jazz 78 rpm records. Enid befriends Seymour and is convinced she can find him a date. About a month later, the women that Seymour placed the add for actually calls and they start to date. She is a very pretty blond real estate agent closer to Seymour's age. She is sophisticated,confident and upbeat, totally the opposite of Enid. She helps bring Seymour out of his shell. Enid becomes very jealous of their friendship and tries to jeopardize it. Her obsession with Seymour puts a strain on her friendship with Rebecca.It also results in a series of unfortunate events in her own life The outcome of all this results in a rather downbeat ending to the film.Terry Zwigoff is a director known for making films about eccentric people. Daniel Clowes is a underground comic writer and Ghost World is based on one of his comics. I have heard that the film is quite different from the comic. In addition to Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi, the film also had a strong supporting cast. Bob Balaban was good as Thora's father. He seemed to have a hard time understanding his daughter and appeared awkward around her at times but he still cared about her. Stacey Travis did a fine job playing Dana, Seymour's love interest and if course Illeana Douglass as Roberta the art teacher. This film can be interpreted different ways by different people watching it. Many people still debate about the ending where Thora rides away on the bus that was out of service. Some people say this is a metaphor for suicide while others say that it represents her starting a new life elsewhere, her desire to start over. There is no right or wrong answer. The film does not give us all the answers in the end. One thing for certain is the course of events in this film will have a lasting effect on all the characters especially Thora, Seymore and Dana. When Seymore had to confront Dana about the future of their relationship, I knew right away that he made the wrong decision. Norman, the old man,(Charles C. Stevenson) adds an element of mysticism to the movie. Every time Enid and Rebecca walk past the bus stop on an abandoned bus line, this man is always there both day and night. One time Enid confronts the old man to tell him that the bus no longer comes through here, he says to her you don't know what your talking about. Well the bus does come and the bench at the bus stop is now empty. The next evening at the same time, Enid takes that same bus. I love the line where Seymour says I can't relate to 99% of humanity! to Enid. I often feel this way!

Daniel Clowes is a underground comic writer and Ghost World is based on one of his comics. I have heard that the film is quite different from the comic. In addition to Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi, the film also had a strong supporting cast. Bob Balaban was good as Thora's father. He seemed to have a hard time understanding his daughter and appeared awkward around her at times but he still cared about her. Stacey Travis did a fine job playing Dana, Seymour's love interest and if course Illeana Douglass as Roberta the art teacher. This film can be interpreted different ways by different people watching it. Many people still debate about the ending where Thora rides away on the bus that was out of service. Some people say this is a metaphor for suicide while others say that it represents her starting a new life elsewhere, her desire to start over. There is no right or wrong answer. The film does not give us all the answers in the end. One thing for certain is the course of events in this film will have a lasting effect on all the characters especially Thora, Seymore and Dana. When Seymore had to confront Dana about the future of their relationship, I knew right away that he made the wrong decision. Norman, the old man,(Charles C.

Stevenson Jr.Anyone who has ever felt alone, confused or disillusioned by society will probably relate to the main characters in this film. The movie begins with the graduation of two best friends from high school. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two rejects that just sort of drifted through school. They never got involved in anything and take a pessimistic attitude toward life. They are now stuck in limbo land between high school and the real world and haven't a clue as to where they are headed. Because they have nothing better to do, they choose to torment those around them. On day while sitting in a diner, they come across a personal add by a man looking for a women that he met eyes with. He thought their was chemistry between them and he writes the add hooping she will call. To torment this poor guy( played by Steve Buscemi as Seymour, a middle aged geek and social outcast), they call him pretending to be the women. They 'agree' to meet in a certain diner. The girls watch him sitting in the diner waiting for the women who of course never shows. He leaves the diner broken hearted. They follow him out of the dinner. Upon seeing what they had done to him, Enid starts to feel sorry for Seymour and takes to him to the point of even developing an attraction toward him probably because she sees him as an outcast much like herself.

The film showed how a illusionary reality could exist parallel to the real reality. Russell Crowe played excellent portrayal of Dr. John Nash an award winning scholar and mathematician genius The story was based on a real life and director Ron Howard did an excellent job in shooting the film. The movie was not about the life of Dr. John Nash but it was about his mind A Beautiful Mind is a must see I have not seen a movie like this one with so much passion in creating a sense of reality but at the same time making an illusion appear real The movie was very powerful in bringing its point across to the viewers. I would recommend A Beautiful Mind as a study guide for psychology majors because it is a good discussion piece. This movie reminds me of a powerful drama based on a real life story that came out in 1977. The name of the movie was Sybil, directed by Daniel Petrie. A Beautiful Mind is about the human mind and inner conflict, it makes you think and want to know more about the mysteries of the human mind... John refused to allow his delusions to take control as he gained back control over his life. The delusions became powerless, but they stayed with him, always lurking, waiting and watching, in the shadows of his mind. In conclusion my overall appreciation for the film and the theme's importance to the film is how the story was portrayed; giving the viewers a real sense of what mental illness must have been like for John Nash. The film was entirely based on the concept of the power of the mind and how John became a prisoner of his own mind.Looking out of the window of the mind and working in the confines of his mind John live in two worlds but one world only exists in his mind. The film gave me a better understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of mental illness and the devastating effect it can have on a person's life. The film showed that in the mind of the beholder in this case, John Nash; the physical as well as the illusionary world could exist parallel to one another. The film also showed how the illusionary world could take over and become precedent over the physical world. The film A Beautiful Mind was a story about mysteries the human mind.

Often slapstick based, he's a bit like a cartoon version of Ben Stiller. Whether playing a country boy with a skill for American football, a guy dating a girl for over and over again or as the son of the devil, Sandler manages to get some of the more obscure roles and make them fun. Big Daddy is yet another example of the Sandler mold where he gets a random character and adds an element of 'nice' to them. The film is an often very funny film, with many familiar faces, and by the end you are happily satisfied with this inoffensive comedy.Sonny Koufax (Sandler) is a lazy waste of space. Attempting to prove his love for dream girl Vanessa (Kristy Swanson), Koufax creates some major social security nightmares when he 'adopts' the long lost son of his flatmate Kevin (Jon Stewart). Spending huge amounts of time with the kid, Koufax, the worlds biggest layabout, slowly begins to bond with the boy and develop into the father figure we know he can be.Adam Sandler films are always great fun. Often with the same supporting cast as previous features, it is often a case of 'whos who'. Whether it's the cameo from Steve Buschemi, the regular appearance of Rob Schneider, or appearances from Peter Dante and others, the films always look like they were hilarious to film and undeniably great fun. Yes, the acting might not be award winning standard, but who cares when the group of actors all work so well together.Big Daddy is brilliantly written too. Often referring to 'Hooters' jokes, the film is not without cult references, but more often than not the funniest scenes are when slapstick is fully embraced. Scenes where Sandler teaches the boy to trip up roller blades for example are particularly funny, as are scenes where up tight members of society are given their comeuppance (including a cameo by director Dennis Dugan). The film is just a simple, uplifting comedy. It never tries to be anything special and it knows what it is.There's not much else to say really. Adam Sandler is one of those people that you either love or hate. Mostly inoffensive, his films thrive on slapstick and childlike humour. Big Daddy is no exception to this rule and as a result Sandler and supporting cast thrive. Often funny, always entertaining, this film is just the sort of thing you can relax to. Good family fun.

Basically it is is World War II, and Count Laszlo De Almásy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fienes) is found near a plane crash in the Sahara desert with a hideously burnt face, but he has no memory of who he is, where he comes from, or any past. Hana (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Juliette Binoche) is the nurse helping him, and as more and more of his possessions are shown to him, he begins to remember who he is, and the love he once had. This is when we go into flashbacks to see Laszlo living his life not as an English man, he is minor Hungarian, but anyway, we see his growing love affair with Katharine (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kristin Scott Thomas), wife of Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth). Back in the present, there are some subplot stories, for example, the growing friendship, or more, with Hana and bomb disposal expert Kip (Naveen Andrews), and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who knows Laszlo from past experience. Towards the end, Geoffrey discovered the affair, and purposely crashed his plane in the desert, with Katharine in the back, and Laszlo saw this, and takes her to a cave, finding out that she is going to die (broken ribs). He promised to being back help, but the English take him prisoner, so he surrenders to some Germans by giving them some maps, and he gets their plane, and of course, he was too late to save her. In the present day, he dies of natural causes. A very good story, with a lot of thought provoking moments of war, love and survival. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Gabriel Yared, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up\/Hair and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score and Best Screenplay.

Back in the present, there are some subplot stories, for example, the growing friendship, or more, with Hana and bomb disposal expert Kip (Naveen Andrews), and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who knows Laszlo from past experience. Towards the end, Geoffrey discovered the affair, and purposely crashed his plane in the desert, with Katharine in the back, and Laszlo saw this, and takes her to a cave, finding out that she is going to die (broken ribs). He promised to being back help, but the English take him prisoner, so he surrenders to some Germans by giving them some maps, and he gets their plane, and of course, he was too late to save her. In the present day, he dies of natural causes. A very good story, with a lot of thought provoking moments of war, love and survival.

Basically it is is World War II, and Count Laszlo De Almásy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fienes) is found near a plane crash in the Sahara desert with a hideously burnt face, but he has no memory of who he is, where he comes from, or any past. Hana (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Juliette Binoche) is the nurse helping him, and as more and more of his possessions are shown to him, he begins to remember who he is, and the love he once had.

Basically James Bond 007 (Sir Sean Connery) pursues formerly head of SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter- intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray, presumably (although never mentioned) to avenge the death of his wife, Bond finds him in a facility creating Blofeld lookalikes, he drowns the real Blofeld in a pool of superheated mud. Bond is told there is a worldwide plot where South African diamonds have been stolen from mines, several of those smuggling them are being killed one-by-one by homosexual assassins Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith). Bond travels to Amsterdam, Holland, posing as diamond smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, to meet his contact, Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), the real Peter Franks (Joe Robinson) shows up, but Bond intercepts and kills him, and switches his ID making it seem that Franks is in fact Bond. The diamonds are smuggled into Los Angeles in Franks' corpse, Bond is met by CIA agent Felix Leiter (Norman Burton) before travelling to Los Angeles, where the diamonds are passed on to Shady Tree (Leonard Barr). Bond escapes an assassination by Wint and Kidd, placing him in a coffin for cremation, Tree stops the process are finding the diamonds were fake, planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond finds that Tree is a stand-up comedian working at hotel-casino The Whyte House, owned by reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), Tree is murdered by Wint and Kidd, they did not realise the diamonds were fake, Bond meanwhile is there and meets opportunistic Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) while gambling. Gang members get rid of Plenty and leave the room, where Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany, he instructs her to retrieve the real diamonds at Circus Circus casino, but she goes back on this arrangement and flees. Tiffany finds Plenty O'Toole is dead in her swimming pool, the assassins mistook her for Tiffany, the real diamonds are passed on to Albert R. 'Bert' Saxby (Bruce Cabot), Bond follows him to a facility, where he finds a laser satellite being built by laser refraction specialist Professor Doctor Metz (Joseph Fürst), Bond escapes when his cover is blown in a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. After evading arrest from the police, Bond leaves Tiffany to scale The Whyte House to confront Willard Whyte, he instead greeted by two identical Blofelds, they are using an electronic device to sound like Whyte, Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but finds it is his lookalike, he is then knocked out and left for dead by Wint and Kidd in a pipeline. Bond escapes and calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device to sound like Saxby, to find out where the real Whyte is being held, Bond and the CIA infiltrate the location, find and rescue him, the real Saxby attempting an assassination is killed in the process. Bond and Whyte work out that a laser satellite has been built, the diamonds are being used to retract light and create a powerful blast, it is already in orbit, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, an international auction for global nuclear supremacy is proposed by Blofeld. Whyte identifies an oil platform off the coast of Baja California, not being part of his empire, as being Blofeld's base of operations, Bond fails in an attempt to change the cassette tape needed to control the satellite, with a mistake by Toiffany, but he does signal Leiter and the CIA to attack the rig. Blofeld attempts to escape in a midget submarine, but Bond uses it launch crane to crash it into the control room and destroy it, the end sees Bond and Tiffany on a cruise ship heading to Britain, Wint and Kidd pose as room service to attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb, but Bond kills them instead. Also starring Bernard Lee as M, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny, Margaret Lacey as Mrs. Whistler, Lola Larson as Bambi, Trina Parks as Thumper, Laurence Naismith as Sir Donald Munger, David Bauer as Mr. Slumber, Ed Bishop as Klaus Hergersheimer, Shane Rimmer as Tom and Captain Scarlet's David Healy as Vandenburg Launch Director. Connery does alright but is not highly convincing as he was before being the suave and cool super spy, Gray as the only Blofeld with hair is good, and the gay hit men couple get their witty moments, this film is let down by a dull script, there are some good chase sequences and fight scenes, but accompanied by pathetic special effects it has many weak points, overall it is a naff but reasonably watchable spy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Sir Sean Connery was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 2 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for the title song by Dame Shirley Bassey.

Watch It. Watch it, learn it, love it. Plot-wise, quite basic, a composer writing a musical based on Faust, ends up living Faust, to get his music heard while pursuing the girl of his dreams. This movie is a classic because it is so much more than this simple plot device. Brian De Palma, certainly one of the greatest directors in Americian cinema, peaked with this movie.

The film opens with a flashy scene seeing a (pregnant) woman being attacked by an elephant, before it moves to the main time of 19th Century, Victorian London, England. Dr. Frederick 'Freddie' Treves (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is exploring the urban carnival freak show, and he pays owner Bytes (Freddie Jones) for a private viewing of the most hideous of all of his creatures, known only as 'The Elephant Man'. He pays him also to allow him to examine him for the Pathological Society, and after returning back to Bytes, being beaten severely and suffering bronchitis, Treves takes him back to be treated in the hospital. Knwoing his true name, John Merrick (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated John Hurt), Treves finds out slowly that he does not need to learn to speak, he is already able to read, write and speak already, he was just afraid. Merrick's tragic condition of deformity is caused by 14 overgrown tumours on his body, face and hands, and he can only sleep sitting up or he will die suffocating from the weight of his head. Most of the hospital staff, including Governor Carr Gomm (Sir John Gielgud) and matron Mothershead (Wendy Hiller), accept him being a permanent patient, and slowly Treves introduces John to London society. The starts with a meeting with Mrs. Treves (Hannah Gordon), and the local newspaper report allows John to meet famous stage actress Madge Kendal (Anne Bancroft). Then one night, the greedy Night porter (Michael Elphick) has many drunk people paying him to see the freak, and amongst the people is Bytes who kidnaps John taking him to France. So once again, sick and neglected, John is put on show as The Elephant Man, but Bytes' son (a very young Snatch's Dexter Fletcher) and the other carnival performers release him. John is happy to return to the safety of the hospital with Treves, and they both know John doesn't have long to live, so they go to the theatre where Mrs. Kendal dedicates the performance to him. The final scene sees John's finished castle model, before he discards all the pillows to sleep lying down where he dies and his Mother (Phoebe Nicholls) welcomes him into Heaven. Also starring Helen Ryan as Princess Alex and Star Wars' Kenny Baker (R2-D2) as Plumed Dwarf. With reliable and magnificent British talent like Hopkins, Bancroft and Gielgud you can't go wrong, but this film obviously belongs to the superb and unrecognisable (apart from the voice and eyes) Hurt. Lynch makes sure that this biographical drama pulls at all your heart strings, with the great atmospheric music, great special effects make-up, and even the black and white colour adds something, it is one of the only films I know that makes you feel sympathy for a (real) character the whole way through, that's what makes it a masterpiece. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Morris, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Production Design\/Art Direction, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Sir Anthony Hopkins was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, John Hurt was number 27, and Hopkins number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Hopkins was also number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers.
