I felt like the character Enid back in the 70s in high school. I still have a circle of friends that collect old 78 records and antique telephones. However, I didn't go out of my way to be hurtful towards others. That's where I think this film went a bit overboard.I did feel for Enid as she was stuck in a nowhere of a town and just could not connect to the people and happenings around her. The film's ending was rather poignant and I actually got a bit teary-eyed over that moment. It's just that Enid's callous behaviour became increasingly annoying and tiresome by the end of the film, and it made it a bit difficult for me to relate to her and root for her.For example, she got louder and more obnoxious in the porn shop, completely ignoring Semour's pleas for her to just settle down. She also had this problem of being able to dish it out but not take any back in a manner best examplified by her constant ridiculing of others openly, yet throwing a complete fit when she was criticized for her green hair and punk outfit. I know wayyy too many teens who act like this, they feel they have a complete right to hurt others yet GOD FORBID you do it to them back. Then, there was her have her cake and eat it too problem where she was infatuated with Seymour yet continuously gave him grief. As for her father, I know he was not a strong personality, but he gave her everything she could want and she would just glare at him.The supporting characters helped this film for me, particularly Rebecca. I don't see her as conforming at all, but rather finding her meant direction. Most of her shared ridiculing of others was basically in support of Enid. We see that while others' lives might not be what we would want, but they've still found a degree of happiness Rebecca, Enid's father, and even Seymour.I don't think Enid was a bad person, she just couldn't connect. Thus, the wonderful ending in which you get the feeling she'll find her place somewhere and that actually made me happy for her.Unfortunately the younger folk I know that have said this film rocked were of the sort that find gloomy fashionable and go out of their way to just be the opposite of everyone. Sort of like the kids on a Jenny Jones show that are all decked out in punk and goth and say I'm just expressing myself and being an individual, yet actually if they looked at the other kids saying that, they all looked exactly the same. Sheep mentality on another level. There's a difference in being unique and different and TRYING to be unique and different on PURPOSE. Many have missed the point of this film in that manner. I think Enid truly was different, just a bit more on a negative level and frustrated that she couldn't get herself to try to look a little deeper to see what she might really want in life. Aw heck, at this writing I'm 39 years old and I still am searching, but at least I know common courtesy towards others.Despite its flaws, I still was left more satisfied than angry after viewing Ghost World. If it wasn't for that brilliant ending, I might not be as nice about the film.

That makes Fight Club rare, but not as unique as some of its more devout followers may claim.  But for a couple hours, I enjoyed being able to draw my own conclusions, comparing what I saw on the screen to my own existing opinions.  I can't say that my opinions have changed much since, but the fact that I was forced to examine them felt good.  And I didn't feel insulted at all by the filmmakers' take on the novel.  A less-talented director, such as David Lynch, might turn this project into a hateful, monotone soapbox movie that hammers you over the head with its cliched anti-establishment message (I know many of you may be Lynch fans. People, listen  David Lynch is not a genius.  He is a subpar director. He is the liberal version of Michael Bay -- an ego-driven jerk.  Don't encourage either of them).  David Fincher and Company know better, and they treat the viewer as a human being.  After all is said and done, this film really is about Humanity and the worth of a Person.  Don't trust me? Watch Tyler Durden's dehumanizing rhetoric get slowly dissected and exposed for what it is.  Follow the evolution of Marla, from unwanted whore to desired love interest.  Despite all the postmodern MTV-style direction, there's a credible warmth to this movie that Lynch (or Bay) could never muster.If we can step back from all the dust kicked up by Fight Club, we eventually notice, Hey!!!  This is a MODERATE film!!!  I know that many people don't WANT this to be a moderate film.  They want something to justify their anger and hatred.  Fight Club is about what happens when hatred and hostility overcome people at the extremes.  It's a Warning Against Extremism.We know from the beginning that Jack's life as a worker bee in a hostile Capitalist world is not something to be admired.  Extreme Capitalism is what happens when Love of Money replaces Love of Humanity.  The result is Enron and WorldCom  Evil men conspiring to rob decent people.  It's understandable that Jack hates his boss -- the guy's a hateful, condescending jerk.  We all know people like that, but some of the more ignorant viewers of Fight Club will use such examples as evidence that Capitalism has failed! while on their way to Capitalist Best Buy to purchase the Capitalist Special Edition DVD of this movie distributed by Capitalist (and Conservative) 20th Century Fox with their Capitalist money so they can watch it on their Capitalist home theatre system that their Capitalist Daddy bought for them.  Hypocrites, hypocrites, hypocrites. There's a special place in hell for you.  For such people, Fight Club will never be more than an escapist fantasy, where they can feel like rebels while being the exact opposite.  Do I think Capitalism is a 100% success?

Right-wing Nazis would gas you for it, and Left-wing Stalinists would make you disappear.

After sitting through 3 hours of this sludge, I failed to see what all the hype was about.  Sure the special effects and cinematography are above average, but that's where it ends.  The dialogue is weak, convoluted, and at times verges on hilarity.  For example, the last line of the film, SPOILER (and I use this term very loosely) `Sam, I'm glad you're with me.'  Give me a break!  I waited 3 hours for this ending? There is absolutely no payoff for the viewer; it's just a longwinded journey with a fizzle for an ending.I understand that this movie is based on a book and that it's the first part of a trilogy, but movies should be judged as single entities.  For a movie to be considered a classic, it should be able to stand on it's own two feet. Example `The Godfather II' is still a great film even if you've never seen `The Godfather' or know who Mario Puzo is.  `Lord of the Rings' fails to transcend without the help of a series of books, and the rest of a trilogy of movies (which haven't come out yet).  The plot just moves from one occurrence to another, there is little cohesion here.  Some events are just completely irrational.  SPOILER Why didn't anyone reach out a hand to Gandalf when he was hanging on the ledge?  He's just hanging there for a while, and no one even makes a minor attempt to help him up.  Why?The character development is also terrible.  Little time is spent in letting the audience get to know these individuals.  Maybe they should have cut a few of them out.  They tried to cram too much into 3 hours (a fourth of which was spent repeating the scene with the finger getting chopped off over and over and over.).  The acting is decent though Elijah Wood just has the same troubled, incredulous expression on his face the whole time.  Does this guy ever blink?  And also, why didn't Frodo just put the ring on, become invisible, and take the darn thing to the dumping point.  He could have skipped the whole way whistling Dixie.  Can I get a witness?  So anyway, I rate this movie a 6 out of 10.  It would have been more suitable as one of those 3-part TV mini-series, and doesn't deserve to be rated as high as the classics.  Don't believe the hype.

But, it's not supposed to have a good story, it's just supposed to be a fun movie about spiders taking over a city, is that so hard to accept? Anyhow, the story is SUPER simple and is pretty much what you can expect from the trailers. It's basically Arachnophobia on steroids!All the actors did a fine job. I've noticed that some people have complained about their acting. You have to remember that for most of the scenes in the film, the spiders weren't even there, they were put in with a computer some time after the scene was shot. So, I've got to give some props to all the actors in this film, they did a great job, and I commend them for it, David Arquette, Kari Wuhrer, Doug E. Doug, Scarlett Johansson and everyone else....And while I'm talking about the actors...this actress, Kari Wuhrer... Could they have got a more beautiful woman to play this part!? Good lord, that is one beautiful woman! And I've also got to mention Scarlett Johansson, another beautiful young woman!I haven't even mentioned the special effects yet! The special effects are worth watching the movie alone. The spiders actually look like their really running around munchin' on some people! It's really shocking how far they've come these days with computer effects! Whoever did the special effects for this film should pat themselves on the back, they did a fantastic job!As for the comedy aspect of the film There was some good comedy and a lot of really stupid comedy! Sadly, a lot of the best jokes were given away in the trailer for this film, so don't expect this movie to be a total laugh-fest! But, laughs aside, the film was fun and enjoyable.I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone, but if the idea of a movie about huge spiders taking over a city interests you, then you might want to take a peak at this film...or if you're just a fan of cool special effects.

Sure, more holes than swiss cheese, but it was a FANTASY, it's not suppossed to explain anything but FAITH.  Don't you think the director knew how cheesey it was to have non-opposable thumbed aliens (bordering on retarded, as one person's comments went) fly through space to earth without weapons or a raincoat or knowing how to open doors?  And then after flying through space to get here, they need crop circles to navigate or communicate? That's part of the point, even.  It wasn't the monsters that we had to fear, it was fear itself. And just because it's called FAITH doesn't necessarily make it RELIGIOUS. M. Night made Gibson's character a spiritual man by trade, but maybe it was only to hit us on the head with the point.  It's possible to have faith that there are mysteries in the universe without believing it was a god-like figure that put them there. It's the same dilemma as posed in Contact, and please forgive the director's if they were not able to provide you with a definitive answer to the universe's ultimate questions.  I give them kudo's for not boring us with, although entertaining when well done, made-up anomolies and technologies such as the Star Trek series are famous for.On a different note, one person here had a very interesting take on the movie that I thought was interesting - they thought that the whole movie was a dream of the little girl's, Bo.

It's possible to have faith that there are mysteries in the universe without believing it was a god-like figure that put them there. It's the same dilemma as posed in Contact, and please forgive the director's if they were not able to provide you with a definitive answer to the universe's ultimate questions.  I give them kudo's for not boring us with, although entertaining when well done, made-up anomolies and technologies such as the Star Trek series are famous for.On a different note, one person here had a very interesting take on the movie that I thought was interesting - they thought that the whole movie was a dream of the little girl's, Bo.  There was a scene in the very beginning that was never explained where she ask's her Dad, after just finding the crop circle What are you doing in my dream?.  At the time, I took it to mean that SHE thought she was dreaming still and not actually awake. But the case could be made that the whole movie was a child's nightmare after her mother's death, therefore explaining some of the immature aspects of the movie, like foil on their heads to keep aliens from reading minds, aliens that are threatening and creepy yet not fully realized, her father's child-like loss of faith despite his training, and a lack of information from the outside world about the goings on of military action etc.  This would truly be in the vein of M. Night's directorial style.  Maybe M. Night is having a royal laugh over all of us trying to figure it out.  Maybe that's the point.Either way, it was scary enough to keep me looking over my shoulder for a few days. I just can't get that scene out of me head when they are in the basement and the hand comes out of the grate to grab the kid.  Totally predictable, but flawlessly chilling!  I can't wait to see it again.

The story is not entertainment.  It is a lesson.  Last week I watched the movie again with a new understanding. Many of the published reviews seem to dislike the movie for various reasons. They are the ones that missed the point of the story.The story is, of course, fiction based on a novel by Michael Blake. Fortunately, Michael Blake also wrote the screenplay for the movie insuring fidelity with his vision.  To the credit of Kevin Costner, who was one of the producers and the director, he allowed the story to be what Michael Blake had originally created.  Costner showed great sensitivity in not only capturing the personalities of all the major characters, but making the land itself (in this case South Dakota) one of the major players.The land was not just a backdrop or playing field.  It was the main character and very much alive.  The cinematography was some of the best I've ever seen and in the tradition of the great movie director, John Ford. Ford had an ability to present the land in all its beauty, which also just happened to have a story occurring on it.In Dances With Wolves, the land of South Dakota might initially appear to be a bleak place, but as Lieutenant Dunbar (Costner) spends more time at his isolated fort, he somehow slowly merges his soul with the surrounding territory.  The life on the land eventually stumbles onto his location, including a wolf and a tribe of Sioux.  The Sioux and Dunbar mistrust each other initially but through curiosity learn how to communicate with each other, however painfully slow. The wolf too was curious about the soldier, but kept his distance for a while.  Finally, the wolf trusts Dunbar enough to play with him on the prairie.  The Sioux see them playing.  Here was a white man not killing the animals.  He had earned a new name Dances-With-Wolves.The main difference between this movie and a John Ford movie was the way Costner humanized the Sioux characters.  In a John Ford movie, most Indians were the enemy.  The only 'good' Indians were the cavalry scouts, but we never really met these scouts as people.  John Ford hired Navaho people to play the parts of Indians in his cavalry trilogy, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande, which were filmed in Monument Valley on the Navaho Reservation. Years later, Ford attempted to humanize the Native Americans in a movie called Cheyenne Autumn, but by then Ford was an old man and had lost most of his creative genius.  It is a hard movie for me to watch.Costner's movie takes great pains to allow us to know the Sioux characters. The story is about them as seen through the eyes of a perceptive white man, who had been given a new life by the gods when his attempt at suicide ended with his recognition as a war hero.What I see when I watch the movie I see ten thousand years of evolution and experience of a human tribe on the North American continent with the most recent characters at the leading edge of the current (1860) time. The character's lives are so well presented that I sense the history of their past  In other words, I understand why they do what they do.  What depresses me about the movie is that I know the ending but the characters don't.  I know that their natural way of life is coming to an end.  The characters don't know.  To me, the movie is a story of the 4 billion, six hundred million years of natural evolution which is about to meet technology. Technology will be as devastating to this tribe and the land as if an asteroid had hit the earth.The beauty of the Sioux life is so precisely shown in this movie.  Their everyday routine of just living off the land is seen the same way as a buffalo eating the grass.  The Sioux adapted to the land the way it was. You see the grass move in waves like the ocean does when the invisible winds touch the surfaces.   You see the effects of the same winds that blow across the face and hair of Stands-With-a-Fist.  You hear the same winds.  The same winds take the smoke from the lodges away from the village. The land and air and life merge in a poetic movement.The horses seem more natural and free in their herd next to the village. They are part of the tribe.  You can see the magnificence of the Sioux riders as they become one with the horse as they hunt the buffalo.  I suppose, in a way, the horse was a step in technology for the Sioux since they didn't have the horse until the Spanish Conquistadors brought them. But when they adapted their life to the horse, they became a great people. I look at it as a step in evolution, not a step in technology.We find that the holy man, Kicking-Bird, played by Graham Green, was a hen-pecked husband, something we can all identify with no matter what race or ethnic group.  His wife saw more than he did, especially the budding love between Lieutenant Dunbar and Stands-With-a-Fist, who was played by the heavy-duty stage actress Mary McDonnell.  She is important to our story because we understand the Sioux from her translations.  As an actress, she was so convincing in her struggle to remember long forgotten English words from her childhood, from the time before she came to live with the Sioux. Kicking-Bird on the other hand represented the soul of the Sioux People. He was patient and was the type of person you would want as a friend.We have Rodney Grant playing the part of Wind-in-His-Hair, the warrior who was quick to anger but was smart enough to listen to his elders and not kill the white soldier.  Rodney Grant represented the beauty and pride of the Sioux People.  He speaks the last relevant words in the story by proclaiming that he is the friend of Dances-With-Wolves.  Before Dunbar became Dances-With-Wolves, Wind-in-His-Hair would have been happy to kill him.`Red Crow' Westerman played the part of the chief, Ten-Bears.  We've seen him play the part of a shaman in other movies.  He represented the wisdom and of the Sioux People and was also their prophet.What movie about Native Americans could be told without Wes Studi?  In this movie he plays the enemy Pawnee so convincingly that you really hate him. Not only is he the enemy to the white man but the Sioux also.  Wes Studi can be very intense in his savagery, but in the eyes of the Pawnee, he was only protecting his tribal interests.So we see the Sioux and, to a lessor degree, the Pawnee in their soon-to-end natural states.  We immediately feel at home with the Sioux.  The Pawnee aren't quite as lovable, especially when we see Wes Studi scalping the muleskinner.  The first disturbing scene is when the Pawnee attack the Sioux village and we see that to save themselves, the Sioux need the technology (the rifles) of the white soldier.  The Pawnee were so fierce looking (again convincingly by Wes Studi) that we fear for the Sioux tribe but see that the rifles are out of place in this natural world.  It is another technological step in the same magnitude as the horse.  But for all their beauty and greatness, we know they cannot win the final battles with the white civilization because they are so grossly outnumbered.There is the core of the problem.  The over-population of the modern civilization overruns their own land so they come to the land of the Sioux and destroy without asking.  You could see it in the face of every tribal member as they walked past dead and skinned buffalo which were left to rot in the sun after the buffalo hunters had skinned them for their hides. They were absolutely stunned and sick at the sight.  Whoever did this had no soul.  I extend the message of this movie to today and see population running amuck, stripping the land of resources and changing the atmosphere. It is too painful to contemplate.To emphasize the loss and waste of the beautiful prairie life, near the end of the movie we see the soldiers shooting at the wolf for fun.  The wolf is confused and doesn't understand that bullets are hitting near him. Eventually a bullet strikes the wolf and we hear him cry out.  For me that was the most painful scene of all because I know that's what people do.  I see people kill a beast for the trophy.  They take it home and hang it on the wall.  The soul of that animal has been cast aside by a human, which has no soul.The beauty is not in the trophy.  The beauty is in the life.  The ending for the wolf represents the ending for the Sioux and all the other tribes that lost the natural way of life.  Therefore I am just as disturbed for the Sioux as I am about the wolf.  I am disturbed for the future of the Earth.

I don't know why it has taken me so long to watch these films, I guess it's because I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, and these film just didn't appeal to me.  Well, enough about my life story, let's get to the movie review.I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised with this film.  I expected a really cheesy movie with a horrible plot and a bunch of mindless killing.  Ok, well maybe the film IS just that, but it certainly wasn't as cheesy as I thought it would be and the plot was actually quite interesting and actually made sense.  Even now, 22 years after it's release, it's still a scary movie, I found myself jumping a few times throughout the film.The actors were pretty good I suppose, the only one that I recognized and knew by name was Kevin Bacon.  It was really cool to see him at such a young age and in one of his first films.  The rest of the cast was fine, pretty much what you would expect from a movie like this.SPOILER ALERT!!!One thing that really surprised me about this film was that Jason Vorhees wasn't even really in the movie!  He was very important to the story, but he wasn't a main character.  What shocked me even more is that there was no trace of a hockey mask throughout the film.  I thought that was a staple for all the films, like Freddy's glove in The Nightmare on Elm Street films.  Anyhow, I was shocked to learn this fact.  Maybe I'll see the hockey mask in the next film?END OF SPOILERSIf you like horror films, then you should definitely see this film!  This is a classic horror film, and so many other films reference Friday the 13th, so you really ought to know what they're talking about when they make a reference to it.  If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it.

Nor are you given musical cues to know how to feel in a particular instance. You have to work off your senses and intellect to perceive it, and to be patient if it takes you in a direction opposite to your wildest guesses.It can even get irritating - as you are about to blame the movie for having no spine - or in truth, for lacking, entirely, conventional twists and turns. It throws you off as you are figuring out whether to perceive it as a film of crime or suicide, romance or a freak house, comedy, mockery or living poetry. Like life, this film has it all.Yet in a sense, the movie is transparent in foreshadowing its three major themes and their resolution - coming from its very heartbeat, the lyrics co-written and performed mostly by Bono.  In the opening scene, a young man Tom Tom hurls himself from the roof of a dreary flophouse - The Million Dollar Hotel in downtown Los Angeles - committing suicide with a strange joyfulness. The mystery of his exuberance in this moment becomes the driving question of the film as we then review the last two weeks of his life. But in the moment itself, Bono's song which accompanies Tom Tom's rush to the brink contains three revealing verses`I have a lover... She shows me colors where there's none to see Gives me hope when I can't believe...'`I have a brother... I spend my whole time running He spends his running after me... But for the first time I feel love.'`My father is a rich man... He said I have many mansions And there are many rooms to see. But I left by the back door And I threw away the key.'Love, brotherhood and father-son relationships so outlined in the song are treated here entirely unconventionally. And the breakdown of formal conventions simply occurs with a `surprising' shift in accents, or values - when love is more important than mystery solving, and a cop treats his suspect as his brother...In the world of this movie, the love of a slightly odd boy towards a prostitute, awkward at first, ends up transcending death. And so does the brotherhood binding the colorful resident freaks of the Million Dollar Hotel; though verging on parody, it's rooted in that same longing of the heart, `a Sleeping Beauty` which `dreams to be awakened.`  And we forget the commentary on the bizarre events and characters are made by a dead `brother' telling us of the best two weeks in his life.As the movie rolls back in time, we learn of a similar fate, falling from the hotel roof, of Tom Tom's best friend - who had come `from money and power' yet rejected them to live `with bums and Indians.' The son of a Jewish multibillionaire media king whose `people decide truth in 60 countries every morning,' the Father who has many mansions, the God of Television, of the reality game which so charms the hotel residents and Tom Tom... until Tom Tom begins to have a life which is `much better than television.'And while you are still trying hard to follow the intrigue, all of a sudden your heart is being cut open... but then is mended together. Broken to be healed. To find a new meaning in death that brings the living together, and love that brings one to death, yet brings out even more love. The death after which `things finally hit you,' when you see it all that clearly that `life is perfect... full of magic, beauty and opportunity' but which we `only really feel when it's gone.'  It's not the same as television. `For the first time\/I feel...'One character talking, the other doing the action at a different place seem to convey the shared experience of living. One distinct voice, of a poet retelling us the story in his songs, is Bono's. He appears in a flash as a silent cameo mixed with the crowd of the Million Dollar Hotel residents. A powerful voice of Tom Tom's innermost self, the voice of his soul, Bono's singing exceeds anything I've ever heard before, reaching straight into your heart. `I come back above\/Where there is only love...' his voice is fading, as if calling from above, sensitizing you to the very tips of your fingers.  All the while the uplifting images from under the sky of downtown Los Angeles take you up to another dimension.Mel Gibson, whose `Icon Productions' co-produced the movie, waived his star fee. His contribution to the film as an unconventional cop, somewhat resonating with his directorial debut, `The Man Without a Face', has a unique flavor you should discover on your own.  The brilliant casting, starting with Jeremy Davis' finely tuned performance as the blessed fool Tom Tom, is topped by Wim Wenders' ever  masterful charting of unknown territories in filmmaking. The artful cinematography and editing are yet another reason for film adepts and students to see this one.Nevertheless, The Million Dollar Hotel played in U.S. theaters for only a week.  I recommend this movie to anyone who believes film is not just for escapist entertainment but for awaking our senses and stirring our minds. As with a good book, you can embark on a journey through The Million Dollar Hotel-DVD over and over again, as if reading it each time for the first time.

You have to work off your senses and intellect to perceive it, and to be patient if it takes you in a direction opposite to your wildest guesses.It can even get irritating - as you are about to blame the movie for having no spine - or in truth, for lacking, entirely, conventional twists and turns. It throws you off as you are figuring out whether to perceive it as a film of crime or suicide, romance or a freak house, comedy, mockery or living poetry. Like life, this film has it all.Yet in a sense, the movie is transparent in foreshadowing its three major themes and their resolution - coming from its very heartbeat, the lyrics co-written and performed mostly by Bono.  In the opening scene, a young man Tom Tom hurls himself from the roof of a dreary flophouse - The Million Dollar Hotel in downtown Los Angeles - committing suicide with a strange joyfulness. The mystery of his exuberance in this moment becomes the driving question of the film as we then review the last two weeks of his life. But in the moment itself, Bono's song which accompanies Tom Tom's rush to the brink contains three revealing verses`I have a lover... She shows me colors where there's none to see Gives me hope when I can't believe...'`I have a brother... I spend my whole time running He spends his running after me... But for the first time I feel love.'`My father is a rich man... He said I have many mansions And there are many rooms to see. But I left by the back door And I threw away the key.'Love, brotherhood and father-son relationships so outlined in the song are treated here entirely unconventionally. And the breakdown of formal conventions simply occurs with a `surprising' shift in accents, or values - when love is more important than mystery solving, and a cop treats his suspect as his brother...In the world of this movie, the love of a slightly odd boy towards a prostitute, awkward at first, ends up transcending death. And so does the brotherhood binding the colorful resident freaks of the Million Dollar Hotel; though verging on parody, it's rooted in that same longing of the heart, `a Sleeping Beauty` which `dreams to be awakened.`  And we forget the commentary on the bizarre events and characters are made by a dead `brother' telling us of the best two weeks in his life.As the movie rolls back in time, we learn of a similar fate, falling from the hotel roof, of Tom Tom's best friend - who had come `from money and power' yet rejected them to live `with bums and Indians.' The son of a Jewish multibillionaire media king whose `people decide truth in 60 countries every morning,' the Father who has many mansions, the God of Television, of the reality game which so charms the hotel residents and Tom Tom... until Tom Tom begins to have a life which is `much better than television.'And while you are still trying hard to follow the intrigue, all of a sudden your heart is being cut open... but then is mended together. Broken to be healed. To find a new meaning in death that brings the living together, and love that brings one to death, yet brings out even more love. The death after which `things finally hit you,' when you see it all that clearly that `life is perfect... full of magic, beauty and opportunity' but which we `only really feel when it's gone.'  It's not the same as television. `For the first time\/I feel...'One character talking, the other doing the action at a different place seem to convey the shared experience of living. One distinct voice, of a poet retelling us the story in his songs, is Bono's. He appears in a flash as a silent cameo mixed with the crowd of the Million Dollar Hotel residents. A powerful voice of Tom Tom's innermost self, the voice of his soul, Bono's singing exceeds anything I've ever heard before, reaching straight into your heart. `I come back above\/Where there is only love...' his voice is fading, as if calling from above, sensitizing you to the very tips of your fingers.  All the while the uplifting images from under the sky of downtown Los Angeles take you up to another dimension.Mel Gibson, whose `Icon Productions' co-produced the movie, waived his star fee. His contribution to the film as an unconventional cop, somewhat resonating with his directorial debut, `The Man Without a Face', has a unique flavor you should discover on your own.  The brilliant casting, starting with Jeremy Davis' finely tuned performance as the blessed fool Tom Tom, is topped by Wim Wenders' ever  masterful charting of unknown territories in filmmaking. The artful cinematography and editing are yet another reason for film adepts and students to see this one.Nevertheless, The Million Dollar Hotel played in U.S. theaters for only a week.  I recommend this movie to anyone who believes film is not just for escapist entertainment but for awaking our senses and stirring our minds. As with a good book, you can embark on a journey through The Million Dollar Hotel-DVD over and over again, as if reading it each time for the first time.

It is about a war veteran in the 1700s famous for leading an attack on the English. He regrets his actions because he sadistically cut the english soldiers to pieces. Now with the American Revolution on the rise, the veteran's life is starting to crumble as his sons are enlisting to fight and no matter how hard he tries he cannot stop them. To protect his sons' lives, he has to enlist himself and fight against the English again.The movie is 3 hours long, and it uses these 3 hours effectively to build the characters' personalities. Mel Gibson gives a terrific performance as the moody, humorless ex-killer who is always reluctant to fight, but will fight well when the need arises. Heath Ledger is the patriotic son who has his father's fighting blood in him. Jason Isaacs is the English dragoon leader, and his voice and appearance is suitable for the devoted, power hungry antigonist. They are the main characters, and the movie spends a good deal of time showing you their personalities and how the war affects them. The battles have fantastic cinematography, and they portray the way armies fought in the most realistic, gruesome truth.Another thing i liked about The Patriot is how masterfully done it is. If you like the movie like I did, i strongly recommend getting the DVD and listening to the audio commentary. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin provide very interesting facts on all the scenes, and as you listen you'll learn to appereciate the camera angles and various scenes which you might dismiss easily. My particular favorite was (SPOILER) how heath leadger takes out his knife after shooting Isaacs, and Emmerich says that Leadger is starting to follow in his father's footsteps as he is going to stab at Isaacs's body just like Gibson hacked the British soldier with his axe, and BOOM! Isaacs gets up stabs Ledger(END OF SPOILER).So anyway, grab the dvd if you like the movie. I can assure you that it will be worth every cent. After listening to the commentary, I like this movie a lot more.So overall, The Patriot combines great acting, great cast, a good story, and excellent movie making techniques to make it one of my top 10 favorite movies. The Patriot isn't your ordinary 'hero kills all the bad guys and he lives happily ever after'. It has lots of anti-cliches that makes it different. So there.

Along with 'The Usual Suspects' it can not only be enjoyed after multiple viewings, it actually improves after each one. It is much more than a mere plot gimmick, it is an excellent example of imaginative film making at its best.Tim Robbins, in his transition from actor in silly comedies (anyone remember 'Erik The Viking'?) to more credible movies like 'The Player' and 'Bob Roberts', is perfectly cast as a Vietnam vet caught in a nightmare he doesn't understand. This is one of his best performances to date. Elizabeth Pena ('Lone Star') also gets a chance to shine, and Danny Aiello ('Do The Right Thing') leads a strong supporting cast, many of whom are much better known now than they were when this movie was made - e.g. Jason Alexander ('Seinfeld'), Ving Rhames ('Pulp Fiction'), Pruitt Taylor Vince ('Heavy'), Eriq La Salle ('E.R.'), even Tenacious D's Kyle Gass.This is a spellbinding movie, superbly directed by Adrian Lyne (who would have thought he had it in him?!).
