I have finally made that decision. I base that on content and the sheer amount of times I could sit through it and it's as powerful each and every time. Although I also might say I am quite biased towards the film having been a Kennedy fanatic and researcher since my early teens. I love Kennedy and the whole mystery and intrigue surrounding his death on November 22nd, 1963. And no film captivates, captures and defines that assassination like Oliver Stone's brilliant film. While being fiction and dealing with a real life situation he makes such a controversial, detailed, full of depth film that it you could literally get something different from every single time you watch it and I have each time. The film should have swept the Oscar's and should be consider THE MOST controversial film because I believe it's the only thing that comes close to bringing out the truth behind the Assassination (that's not up for debate...I'm simply reviewing the film.) Kevin Costner...some love him, some hate him...I have heard people describe Costner as drab, boring, unemotional, but I have never agreed. I love Costner's films and performances. I think he is an incredible talent of embodying the characters he portrays. He makes them real, he makes the every day guy no matter what the character is. He can be powerful, emotional, subtle, weak, misunderstood, ambitious, evil...I think he's a very diverse actor with underrated ability. I think his performance in this film as Jim Garrison is brilliant. There isn't a time yet in watching this film that I am not so incredibly moved as tears well up in Costner's eyes as he's giving his closing speech to the jury (rumoredly this was not planned but Costner felt the impact of his speech.) Costner captures the era and the important of Garrison's investigation and perfectly shows how this case completely consumed Garrison to the very end. The cast in this film is extensive, impressive and incredible. To name any one person and not another in this film seems almost unfair besides Costner as he is the main focus. Tommy Lee Jones is usually second to be headlined being he was nominated for his performance as Clay Shaw\/Bertrand, the man accused of conspiracy in the President's murder and the only man ever to be brought to trial for such. Jones is brilliant, he's always brilliant, Tommy Lee Jones is one of the greatest actors of all time and this role is brilliant but it's a very, very small role. Cameo might even describe it but still he got his nominated as supporting actor and he is a big screen presence and him and Costner share some intense dialog. Gary Oldman is PHENOMENAL as Lee Harvey Oswald. The man is just brilliant in flash backs and recreations of actual news events. The voice, the look, everything about him is nailed and he has a very subtle brilliance and insanity to him and his look. Oldman should have gotten an Oscar hands down. Joe Pesci is also very good (although mostly typical Pesci as CIA contact David Ferrie.) He certainly nails the physical appearance and his performance is noteworthy and riveting. He definitely adds pizazz and excitement to the film with this high strung over the top personality. Kevin Bacon, Michael Rooker, Jack Lemmon, Laurie Metcalf, Sissy Spacek (in a notable role as Costner's estranged and upset wife,) John Candy, Jay O. Sanders, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Edward Asner, and Wayne Knight are the bulk of the really notable performances in this film. All of them give so, so incredibly much to this film and make it come alive. Some of them have brilliant, detailed absolutely riveting monologues of information that any other time would come across as boring drivel and yet you watch and listen in awe as they list out the evidence. Bravo to each and every one of these actors because they made the most brilliant film ever made.Oliver Stone is no stranger to controversy. He's a brilliant, no holds barred director who makes jarring and stirring films. I haven't liked all his films but I can't deny his directorial brilliance and this is chief proof of that. He took an age old debate, something that has been rehashed to death and created an intriguing study. The film has less of a story and more of laying out facts in front of you for three hours and he does it with absolute ease and makes it compelling and interesting to everyone...researchers, fanatics, and just the average movie goer. So many powerful speeches, and moments in this film will just leave you stunned and wanting to watch the whole thing again because there is just SO much to take in. Whether you believe the evidence or not it's just as compelling to watch Stone direct a brilliant cast into a controversial film. This is without a doubt one of the top ten films you absolutely cannot live without seeing. It's important both as a film and to real life. For me it's also my number 1 film of all time. Consider that the best of the best. As I stated I am biased given my love for the subject but the film is still BRILLIANT!! Capturing the sixties, the assassination, the trial, the witnesses, the cover up...it's all done with such impressive style. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2006","score":"5 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" I think JFK by Oliver Stone is my favorite film of all time...period.

The trailers should've said Starring John Wayne's son and Tyrone Powers' daughter!, I wasn't impressed by that casting. Personally, I thought Jane Seymour was one of the casting highlights in this flawed fantasy film. Eye of the Tiger not a bad film, but it is also not the great film that some people want to remember it as from their childhood.I saw these Sinbad films as a child and re-watched them this week. Let's face it; this was the weakest of the 3 Sinbad films and of the 5 films in that Harryhausen boxset. The IMDb voters even seem to agree with me on this. Luckily for us, Ray Harryhausen, special effects genius and one-man workforce, followed this film up with Clash of the Titans before retiring thereby leaving the film world on a high note instead of this uncharacteristic stumble. This might have had 7 times the budget of the first Sinbad film (7th Voyage), but it was a big letdown to me after watching much better, more entertaining Sinbad films. If I seem harsh in this review, it is because I have recently re-watched several of Ray Harryhausen's films and some interviews and documentaries in said box set about his work. I know the magic his genius is capable of and I am grading this film against his other films. Some people on IMDb are whining because it came out around the same time as Close Encounters and Star Wars. The real problem isn't that movie visual effects had moved forward, so much as that the work here isn't as impressive as it is in previous Harryhausen films.The plot was basically a weak mirror of the 7th Voyage plot (gotta help restore a friend to normal, go to some crazy island to obtain magical help and faceoff against a purveyor of the dark arts). Actually all 3 Sinbad films can be vaguely described that way. The script makes some weak\/lame turns to get to its destination. While a friend didn't like Sinbad 'having an afro', I didn't mind Patrick Wayne's look as much as his uninspired acting. He never sold us on the Dynamation effects like Kerwin Matthews or John Philip Law (of Danger Diabolik fame). THE CREATURES. I am 'grading on a curve' against Harryhause's capabilities from other films. His work here is good (and above what anyone else save possibly Willis O'Brien could do with similar tools), but definitely has been better in his previous efforts. -Golden Minotaur was very cool, but never properly utilized in this film. -bug-eyed demons were unimpressive creations. -sabretooth was fun, but looked more like a stuffed toy than past Harryhausen creations. -Trogolodyte was good. There were also a baboon, a giant walrus and an overgrown bee. There isn't anything here to compare to his greatest creations the Cyclops vs. Dragon, the Roc, 6-armed swordfighting Kali, 7 skeletons (in Argonauts), Griffon vs. Centaur, Pegasus, Medusa, etc. He doesn't top himself in this film, which was a letdown for me after seeing his better films.I also felt that some of the travelling matte work had footage that to my eye didn't quite match up and distracted from the usual wonder of 'Dynamation' I've come to expect. Viewing this in my childhood I probably overlooked this, as an adult I cannot.The film suffers from an abundance of what I call 'IDIOT PLOT MOMENTS', the likes of which one would expect from a slasher film. This happens too often in entertainment (especially in genre films and TV) when the writers need to get the plot from point A to point B and are either too lazy or lack creativity to get there properly or they are attempting something extremely unlikely for the characters and don't care about undermining the credibility or reality of the world they are creating. There were far too many moments where I wanted to scream at the screen while watching.**SPOILER WARNING** SUMMATION OF 'IDIOT PLOT POINTS'The Minotaur is a great mythology creature and could've been a great opponent for an exciting battle with Sinbad's crew, but was totally wasted here. What does he really do? He rows a boat, spears a drowning man and then proves his lack of sentience by pulling a large brick onto himself thereby crushing himself to death. Lame.Melanthius the supposedly wise sage acts cluelessly so the plot can proceed where the writers want. He captures the witch (already established as highly dangerous and has turned Sinbad's friend into a baboon) and promptly evacuates the room of all other people (who could possibly stop him from his forthcoming blundering). He then reveals the map and key to the enemy and (inadvertently?) tells her where they are headed. Then, after taunting her with a dangerous bee, he gives the bee some of her potentially 'enlarging' potion so that it can become a danger to the crew and the witch can be afforded an escape and further plague the party.After not running the treacherous witch through with a spear, the party inexplicably forgets to keep a close eye on Zenobia after the death of her worthless son while all watching starry-eyed as the Prince transforms back. Lo and behold Zenobia uses this oversight to possess the frozen sabretooth and attempt her vengeance. This begins the sabretooth vs. Trog battle. I am still annoyed by Sinbad's crew not taking the opportunity to slash the monsters legs thereby crippling its fighting abilities even if it wouldn't seem sporting in a G rated film (not that it stopped Koura from stabbing the Griffon's hindquarters to cripple it in Golden Voyage).

The real problem isn't that movie visual effects had moved forward, so much as that the work here isn't as impressive as it is in previous Harryhausen films.The plot was basically a weak mirror of the 7th Voyage plot (gotta help restore a friend to normal, go to some crazy island to obtain magical help and faceoff against a purveyor of the dark arts). Actually all 3 Sinbad films can be vaguely described that way. The script makes some weak\/lame turns to get to its destination. While a friend didn't like Sinbad 'having an afro', I didn't mind Patrick Wayne's look as much as his uninspired acting. He never sold us on the Dynamation effects like Kerwin Matthews or John Philip Law (of Danger Diabolik fame). THE CREATURES. I am 'grading on a curve' against Harryhause's capabilities from other films. His work here is good (and above what anyone else save possibly Willis O'Brien could do with similar tools), but definitely has been better in his previous efforts. -Golden Minotaur was very cool, but never properly utilized in this film. -bug-eyed demons were unimpressive creations. -sabretooth was fun, but looked more like a stuffed toy than past Harryhausen creations. -Trogolodyte was good. There were also a baboon, a giant walrus and an overgrown bee. There isn't anything here to compare to his greatest creations the Cyclops vs. Dragon, the Roc, 6-armed swordfighting Kali, 7 skeletons (in Argonauts), Griffon vs. Centaur, Pegasus, Medusa, etc. He doesn't top himself in this film, which was a letdown for me after seeing his better films.I also felt that some of the travelling matte work had footage that to my eye didn't quite match up and distracted from the usual wonder of 'Dynamation' I've come to expect. Viewing this in my childhood I probably overlooked this, as an adult I cannot.The film suffers from an abundance of what I call 'IDIOT PLOT MOMENTS', the likes of which one would expect from a slasher film. This happens too often in entertainment (especially in genre films and TV) when the writers need to get the plot from point A to point B and are either too lazy or lack creativity to get there properly or they are attempting something extremely unlikely for the characters and don't care about undermining the credibility or reality of the world they are creating. There were far too many moments where I wanted to scream at the screen while watching.**SPOILER WARNING** SUMMATION OF 'IDIOT PLOT POINTS'The Minotaur is a great mythology creature and could've been a great opponent for an exciting battle with Sinbad's crew, but was totally wasted here. What does he really do? He rows a boat, spears a drowning man and then proves his lack of sentience by pulling a large brick onto himself thereby crushing himself to death. Lame.Melanthius the supposedly wise sage acts cluelessly so the plot can proceed where the writers want. He captures the witch (already established as highly dangerous and has turned Sinbad's friend into a baboon) and promptly evacuates the room of all other people (who could possibly stop him from his forthcoming blundering). He then reveals the map and key to the enemy and (inadvertently?) tells her where they are headed. Then, after taunting her with a dangerous bee, he gives the bee some of her potentially 'enlarging' potion so that it can become a danger to the crew and the witch can be afforded an escape and further plague the party.After not running the treacherous witch through with a spear, the party inexplicably forgets to keep a close eye on Zenobia after the death of her worthless son while all watching starry-eyed as the Prince transforms back. Lo and behold Zenobia uses this oversight to possess the frozen sabretooth and attempt her vengeance. This begins the sabretooth vs. Trog battle. I am still annoyed by Sinbad's crew not taking the opportunity to slash the monsters legs thereby crippling its fighting abilities even if it wouldn't seem sporting in a G rated film (not that it stopped Koura from stabbing the Griffon's hindquarters to cripple it in Golden Voyage).

A year later I watched Cruel intentions, which is a kind of remake, though it is the same topic and basic plot, I must say, that the director did a great job of making this movie up-to-date and relevant for our generation. There is a big tendency to manipulate, use, and abuse others, not just sexually, but also mentally. However, after I saw these two movies, I read the book, which consists of letters between the main characters. One should think that a book written about two hundred years ago would be obsolete, but it isn't, which is why I think that both of the movies hit a sore spot in all of us. Though Liaisons Dangereuse are more subtle, refined, understated than Cruel Intentions simply because it is set in the 17th century France. And I love the fact that Sebastian dies in Cruel intentions, because it makes the move that more horrible. What I'm trying to say is that we can learn a lot from Cruel intentions. It is not just about snobbish high society children that are bored. It gives us an insight into what consequences manipulation, backstabbing, and betrayal can have. It shows us that words like loyalty, love, and honor should be valued if we want to go further in life. And that no matter how much you manipulate and lie it will always haunt you, and some day it will bite you in the a**. A last cool twist of the movie that no one seems to pick up, is the drugs. Catherine takes drugs, and it is finally discovered. The movies tells the parents that they should be more involved in their children's' lives, take responsibility or else it can and will go wrong, that children even if they are over 16 are still children, who need guidance. And it tell the youth respect, loyalty, and above all love. Thanks for reading this, this is just my opinion - you don't have to agree. But do yourself a favor and watch both Cruel Intentions and Liaisons Dangereuse, but also read the book.

Easily one of the grittiest, dirtiest, dingiest, most insane war movies I've ever encountered.In my experience, the really great war films have a tendency to be either cerebral and textural (Hell is for Heroes, Full Metal Jacket, Thin Red Line, All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory) or kinetic and adrenalized (Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, The Deer Hunter). Of course, most films kind of jump the barrier here and there, but usually you can make a distinction. Cross of Iron combines the two as well as any film I have seen. It also has the added (peculiar) distinction of being one of the only WWII war films with German protagonists.Coburn totally commands the screen as the brilliant Steiner, a platoon Sergeant who hates officers and war but feels a strong obligation to his men, who love him and trust his leadership.

This one is so wonderful because it is absolutely nothing like STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE (known to many of the fans as Star Trek I). While the movie is based on a TV episode, it manages to carry on from where the episode left off instead of rehashing the same old material.Although I loved so many movies by Robert Wise, he was no sci-fi director. Sure, he was wonderful with THE SOUND OF MUSIC, but under his control the first Star Trek movie could have been entitled THE SOUND OF BOREDOM! But, in this film, Nicholas Meyer very ably directs and seemed to have a real flare for drama and the characters. Plus, it really seems to have helped having the crew shed their prior monochrome polyester uniforms from the prior film and replace them with cool red uniforms. So, the uniforms AND the characters all were very colorful.The film concerns the only Hollywood actor who is a big enough ham to match Shatner's beloved histrionics--Ricardo Montalban. He and Shatner both emoted and fought and entertained the audience. Sure, it was a whole lot more low-brow than the earlier film, but that is why the original series was so beloved! People didn't expect John Gielgud or Laurence Olivier--they wanted to see Shatner scream KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!!!!! and they wanted explosions! And, while not necessary for the script, most people appreciated the evil buggers they shoved in Paul Winfield's and Walter Koenig's ears! The film was bigger than life, emotionally involving, entertaining, heart-stopping and a great improvement in the series.

In the book, he acted like a jerk to Benny when she was too busy taking care of her widowed mother. In the movie, though he did feel a little lonely and got a little impatient,he (up until he cheated on her) was a little more understanding. In the book, I thought they implied that Benny got together with her, but I think she left it up to the author to decide. Other users says they did not get back together. In the movie, they definitely did get back together. I liked the part where Benny hit the bag over that creep's head and the money spilled out! Nan and Eve were great for their part. Although I do not consider O'Donald gorgeous, he is talented. I read some users comments. I also noticed the flaw they made when they said they were making their confirmation, (as other users stated) which was really the communion. However, that was not important to me. A lot of users were critical about the movie being so centered around sex. I agree with them, that it did get too much after a while, but those are real problems that teens and young adults faced then, and now. But back then they did not have sex education. (just guilt, from the catholic church)Perhaps if people talked to them about the real consequences of having sex (rather that preaching about it being a mortal sin)they would not have so much of a desire to have it. I think if this were a real story, Benny would have made a big mistake by having sex(obviously unprotected) and it would be a shame for a talented smart writer like Benny to ruin her chance of having a career; however, the movie ended there. I do not think it was made to teach you that you should have premarital sex, (though realistically it happened, even then, though it was just not talked of) It was made to entertain. It was a romantic love story, not a life lesson. A lot of people were disappointed by the fact that Benny gave Jack and second chance, but at least in the movie, he was not a jerk like he was in the book, as I said. Somebody said that the parents looked old for parents back then, but it was not unusual for women to take years to get pregnet, or to have many miscarriages (sadly). Back then they did not have the prenatal care that they have now, or ways of getting pregnet.

He is worried about losing his older brother, so he follows him everywhere, including a funeral. While hiding in the bushes during the funeral, Mike sees The Tall Man (played by the creepy Angus Scrimm), the man who runs the funeral home, pick up a casket by himself. Mike begins spying on the man afterwards, fascinated with uncovering the strange events surrounding the funeral home. While investigating, Mike discovers a strange world within the walls of the mortuary, including flying metal spheres with sharp arrows that drain the blood from your head, and many other horrors. Turns out, the Tall Man is from another dimension, and is taking the bodies of the dead and reincarnating them in his world for slaves. Mike teams up with his older brother and the local ice cream man, Reggie, to stop the Tall Man's gruesome work.I remember my mother telling me about how much Phantasm scared her when she was a teenager, and she rented it one day and I watched it along with her (I was about nine or ten at the time), and it was genuinely one of the most bizarre movies I've ever viewed. Written (as well as directed) by Don Coscarelli, Phantasm has become something of a horror classic over the years, and deservedly so. Coscarelli's writing here is so unique that it hurts. Everything in this film is surreal and dreamlike, and the entire plot line is so out there that I can't think of another film that can quite compete in terms of strangeness. But, despite it's strangeness, this movie works, in it's own, weird little way. The script is solid and the characters are believable (there are some real-life situations thrown in as well, so there is some sort of viewer-character connections that can be made), even though about ninety-nine percent of this film is something of pure fantasy. But it's quite a scary fantasy, and that's for sure.There are many elements in this film that have become somewhat legendary, among them being the murderous silver spheres and The Tall Man's Boyyyyy! line. The thing is, among all of the randomness that is Phantasm, this is quite a terrifying movie. A dense feeling of helplessness and foreboding is hiding in every scene, and the cinematography and locations add to this quite a bit. The imagery is bizarre and often very spooky, and the settings are perfect (especially that creepy old funeral home). The viewers themselves are easily caught up in the engrossing story, and the atmosphere is very scary. Michael Baldwin plays our lead hero well, with Reggie Bannister as the ice cream man, and Bill Thornbury as Mike's older brother, Jody. And Angus Scrimm plays his signature role as The Tall Man, and his presence alone makes this film scarier than most of it's genre. And then there's the score to the film, which is equally as effective and just as chilling. The film concludes leaving many questions open-ended and unanswered, but honestly - can you really expect genuine, fulfilling answers when the movie itself is so strange? I think it's good that this film does leave some loose ends, because it goes along with the movie's overall feel.Bottom line - I don't think this movie is for everyone, and it might be just a little bit too weird for some. Honestly, one of the strangest, most out-there films I have ever seen, but in my opinion, that's a good thing. The story is strange but well crafted, and the bizarre imagery and atmosphere make this a painfully unique, scary experience. I can see why Phantasm has become such a classic of the genre. For me, this film remains a nice little piece of spooky and original nostalgia, and I'm glad my mom decided to scare the daylights out of me with it at such a young age, because I grew to love this movie later on. 10\/10.

Viewing Vertigo several times recently, and reading Dan Aulier's brilliant in-depth look at the making of this movie, I am at a loss to explain what I see as a vastly hyperbolic reaction to this movie by many people both in the realm of professional critics and posters on IMDb. This is not Hitchcock at his best, although I do believe it could have been. True, Hitchcock was at his peak in this period, but there are enough flaws in Vertigo to bring this potential masterwork down several notches.The first problem in Vertigo lies with the story's failure to establish Scottie Ferguson. We first meet Scottie as he fails to make the rooftop leap and is hanging by a gutter of a building several dozen feet from the ground. After this we see him making his decision to retire from police work. The audience is deprived of any referent to the type of person Scottie was before the incident on the rooftop. This failure to establish the character and set a benchmark to measure his return by in the closing minutes of the film deprives the audience of a vital connection to any character. But this problem could have easily been overcome had the third fatal flaw, which I will take up soon, been avoided.The second problem in Vertigo is a decision by Hitchcock and George Tomasini, the editor, to insert a scene shortly after Scottie meets Judy that reveals all of the secrets the story holds. This throws away the element of suspense that might have had audiences on the edge of their seats during the final part of the movie, unable to relax even at the moment of revelation for Scottie's character as the movie would sweep them up and hurl them through the roller-coaster ride that the climax of the movie should have been. But I think Hitchcock and company made the decision as a direct result of an even earlier and worse mistake.The third, and most glaring, mistake Hitchcock made with Vertigo was in the casting. Most of the cast does work ranging from passable to outstanding, with one notable exception Jimmy Stewart. In Aulier's account of the Vertigo project he details how Stewart came to star in this movie, which had a lot more to do with the desires of Lew Wasserman, agent to both Stewart and Hitchcock, than good judgment. Jimmy Stewart was the wrong man for this role, and Aulier recounts that Hitchcock himself blamed Stewart for Vertigo's dismal showing at the box office. Hitchcock concluded that Stewart was too old for the part and refused to cast him in North by Northwest because of this. But I don't think Stewart's age was the real hindrance here, I think Jimmy Stewart tried to step way beyond his range as an actor and falls flat in certain key scenes. Mr. Stewart does a passable job in the first half of the movie, and is quite believable as the ex-detective brought low by his vertigo-inducing acrophobia. The first real hint of trouble comes in the last scene of the first half, Scottie sits in a sanitarium incommunicado and withdrawn as his stalwart friend Midge tries to engage him in conversation. Stewart's playing of this borders on the comedic with a deer-in-the-headlights gaze that calls to mind one of the Warner Brother's toons after being conked on the head rather than a man ravaged by guilt. It drags the scene down so much that Barbara Bel Geddes is left to carry it on her own, and she does make a valiant attempt but her efforts are hindered by Stewart. From this point forward the movie enters its most crucial phase and Stewart's ineffectualness grows more obvious in each successive scene. In the scene where Scottie tries to convince Judy to change her hair color Stewart's phrasing and pitch are semi-comedic. The lack of chemistry between the two leads brings the haunting scene of Judy's emergence from the bathroom to a crashing halt as Stewart is unable to infuse his performance with even a modicum of passion. But a few minutes later Stewart's performance goes completely south as the movie's climatic moments unfold. Scottie is righteously angry as the truth dawns on him, but, unfortunately, Stewart does not play angry well at all. His maniacal and slightly feminine delivery from this point on detracts from what could have been cinematic magic. At a point in the movie where Scottie should have regained his senses and his sense of manhood his tone and pitch shrilly foreshadow the strident tones of Mrs. Bates in Hitchcock's next project.No doubt my remarks here will be met with disdain by some of the film's more ardent boosters on IMDb. I shall join the ranks of the great unwashed heathens who do not understand great cinema nor Vertigo's rightful placement at the apex of that pyramidal structure. I do appreciate Hitchcock's use of color as subtext in the film (I am particularly fond of the color and lighting shifts in Midge's apartment when she allows Scottie to view her painting). I also appreciate and easily grasp the undertones of Hitchcock's own obsessive behavior with the leading ladies of his work, but wonder if that subtext was intended as dramatic irony or whether Mr. Hitchcock was even aware of the mirror he was peering into. But, the brilliant touches of a master artist are not enough to make up for what this film lacks. Hitchcock was indeed The Master, and his body of work stands above a field of mostly mediocre efforts that his peers were turning out, and even today not one exists who can approach his mastery, but to suggest that Vertigo is the cinematic equivalent of Leonardo's Mona Lisa is ludicrous and undeserved.

After this we see him making his decision to retire from police work. The audience is deprived of any referent to the type of person Scottie was before the incident on the rooftop. This failure to establish the character and set a benchmark to measure his return by in the closing minutes of the film deprives the audience of a vital connection to any character. But this problem could have easily been overcome had the third fatal flaw, which I will take up soon, been avoided.The second problem in Vertigo is a decision by Hitchcock and George Tomasini, the editor, to insert a scene shortly after Scottie meets Judy that reveals all of the secrets the story holds. This throws away the element of suspense that might have had audiences on the edge of their seats during the final part of the movie, unable to relax even at the moment of revelation for Scottie's character as the movie would sweep them up and hurl them through the roller-coaster ride that the climax of the movie should have been. But I think Hitchcock and company made the decision as a direct result of an even earlier and worse mistake.The third, and most glaring, mistake Hitchcock made with Vertigo was in the casting. Most of the cast does work ranging from passable to outstanding, with one notable exception Jimmy Stewart. In Aulier's account of the Vertigo project he details how Stewart came to star in this movie, which had a lot more to do with the desires of Lew Wasserman, agent to both Stewart and Hitchcock, than good judgment. Jimmy Stewart was the wrong man for this role, and Aulier recounts that Hitchcock himself blamed Stewart for Vertigo's dismal showing at the box office. Hitchcock concluded that Stewart was too old for the part and refused to cast him in North by Northwest because of this. But I don't think Stewart's age was the real hindrance here, I think Jimmy Stewart tried to step way beyond his range as an actor and falls flat in certain key scenes. Mr. Stewart does a passable job in the first half of the movie, and is quite believable as the ex-detective brought low by his vertigo-inducing acrophobia. The first real hint of trouble comes in the last scene of the first half, Scottie sits in a sanitarium incommunicado and withdrawn as his stalwart friend Midge tries to engage him in conversation. Stewart's playing of this borders on the comedic with a deer-in-the-headlights gaze that calls to mind one of the Warner Brother's toons after being conked on the head rather than a man ravaged by guilt. It drags the scene down so much that Barbara Bel Geddes is left to carry it on her own, and she does make a valiant attempt but her efforts are hindered by Stewart. From this point forward the movie enters its most crucial phase and Stewart's ineffectualness grows more obvious in each successive scene. In the scene where Scottie tries to convince Judy to change her hair color Stewart's phrasing and pitch are semi-comedic. The lack of chemistry between the two leads brings the haunting scene of Judy's emergence from the bathroom to a crashing halt as Stewart is unable to infuse his performance with even a modicum of passion. But a few minutes later Stewart's performance goes completely south as the movie's climatic moments unfold. Scottie is righteously angry as the truth dawns on him, but, unfortunately, Stewart does not play angry well at all. His maniacal and slightly feminine delivery from this point on detracts from what could have been cinematic magic. At a point in the movie where Scottie should have regained his senses and his sense of manhood his tone and pitch shrilly foreshadow the strident tones of Mrs. Bates in Hitchcock's next project.No doubt my remarks here will be met with disdain by some of the film's more ardent boosters on IMDb. I shall join the ranks of the great unwashed heathens who do not understand great cinema nor Vertigo's rightful placement at the apex of that pyramidal structure. I do appreciate Hitchcock's use of color as subtext in the film (I am particularly fond of the color and lighting shifts in Midge's apartment when she allows Scottie to view her painting). I also appreciate and easily grasp the undertones of Hitchcock's own obsessive behavior with the leading ladies of his work, but wonder if that subtext was intended as dramatic irony or whether Mr. Hitchcock was even aware of the mirror he was peering into. But, the brilliant touches of a master artist are not enough to make up for what this film lacks. Hitchcock was indeed The Master, and his body of work stands above a field of mostly mediocre efforts that his peers were turning out, and even today not one exists who can approach his mastery, but to suggest that Vertigo is the cinematic equivalent of Leonardo's Mona Lisa is ludicrous and undeserved.
