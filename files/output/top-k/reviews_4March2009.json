Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. So, I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly. In fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the magic transcends all that other stuff. 'Tis indeed what movies are made of.So, how does the film achieve these things? Hmmm, nice question! Stumped am I? Let's see. Really, I feel like it's quite simple. The filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. I probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments, but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack). A zest. You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing.Generally I get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel. Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. Lots of talent, little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through. The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. Maybe I don't feel I have much to say about it because I was half-asleep when I saw it (and\/or as I write this review). Anyway, I'm sort of semi-repeating myself here but I really liked the sense of family the movie had. Full of love I suppose you might say. Again, a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly.And to repeat myself once more, one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly, so The Muppet Movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so. Same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that. Anyway, if that sounds sappy, I also reckon it was pretty hilarious.So, all in all, this movie was very funny, touching and difficult not to smile along to. Plus it features lots of great music! Highly recommended to all humans, both the young and the young at heart.

It is lacking in a few key areas that keep it from greatness.I suppose it is a testament to the staleness of The Phantom Menace's plot that it's taking me a long time to remember it. Two representatives from the Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are on a mission to negotiate some sort of treaty with the Trade Federation who have blockaded the planet Naboo. The Trade Federation leaders are in league with Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid), the evil Sith Lord, and they are ordered to eliminate the Jedi. Soon Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan discover the Trade Federation plans to invade Naboo and take the leader Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) hostage. They rush to the Queen's rescue, who has already figured out the Trade Federation's plans. They must defeat the Trade Federation's stupid droids first, which makes for some good fun. Along the way they meet Jar-Jar, the clumsy Gungan who joins them on their journey (more on him later). During their escape the Queen's ship is damaged and they are forced to make an emergency landing on Tattooine. While searching for spare parts Qui-Gon finds a nine year old slave named Anakin Skywalker, who is surprisingly gifted with the force. He has the highest midi-chlorian count ever recorded, little microbes that connect people to the force. By gambling on Anakin Skywalker in a podrace (a very entertaining sequence), Qui-Gon is able to free Anakin but not his mother; he simply lacked the funds. He joins the gang back to Coruscant where they mount a mission to free Naboo. While this story is fun and all, it doesn't compare to blowing up the Death Star. I will start with the most common criticism of the movie Jar-Jar. He is extremely annoying and he does not have any redeeming qualities. Jar-Jar remains one of the strangest characters in the Star Wars franchise. It is hard to believe people working on the film thought he would be a funny character. The final Gungan battle is a joke because of him and we just want the movie to get back to the lightsaber duel.The concept of midi-chlorians is unpopular for good reason. The very thought of humans having a biological understanding of how people connect with the force takes away a lot of its mystery. The potential to become a powerful Jedi has nothing to do with who you are anymore. It's all biology. I prefer to ignore that part of the movie. Jake Lloyd is not a particularly good child actor and his acting ranges from merely passable to pretty bad. I understand Lucas's reasoning for casting a child as Anakin. Seeing him as a young, innocent child arguably makes his transition more dramatic, and his fear of not seeing his mother again is somewhat more moving than it would be if he was a teenager. Unfortunately I think Lucas wasted some good opportunities with this decision. Anakin is sort of pushed to the side because of his age. He is the subject at hand but he is really just a tag along, because what can he do? They can't start the love story, although they hint that it will happen. Anakin and Obi-Wan can't really become friends because of the age difference. They sort of skip that step and just establish that they became friends in Episode II. Perhaps the worst impact this has is that it makes The Phantom Menace feel far too removed from the other two movies. It probably has the least replay value. One of the better things about TPM is Liam Neeson, one of the best actors in the Star Wars series. Qui-Gon is very interesting, if a bit distant. The fact that he disagreed with the council made the Jedi order much more dynamic and seem less drone like. It is a shame he had to die, because he really carried this movie. His friendship with Obi-Wan was the best written relationship in the prequels. Yet despite these praises, the performances overall are still very wooden. The actors sound and act like their minds are elsewhere, which makes the movie boring even when they are surrounded by beautiful special effects. Natalie Portman gives one of the most uninspired performances in the series. The problem with the characters in the prequels is that they are not distinct enough. We just don't care enough about them.Finally, we get to Darth Maul, who was the highlight of this movie. Maul was the perfect silent type villain. His final lightsaber duel was the best in the prequels and arguably in the whole series. We get to see the Jedi in their full blown glory with great sword choreography. He commands the screen in all of his scenes and is kept mysterious. I should also mention Darth Sidious. His role is small but he makes a strong impression. Eliminate them. All of them. is a bone chilling line. The Phantom Menace is the most lighthearted Star Wars movie and it has a very fun spirit, with some dark undertones. The Jedi know there is another danger lurking but they really do not know what is in store for them in the future. The Phantom Menace is a very appropriate title for the movie. Yet the plot and acting is so stale, and since Anakin Skywalker doesn't really do anything, it's my least favorite Star Wars movie.Superman fans should keep an eye out for Terence Stamp (General Zod), who plays Chancellor Valorum.

Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999), I will try to be coy here for the benefit of those who have just come out of a decadelong coma, and for those Korowai tribesmen of New Guinea and the Munduruku dwellers on the Amazon who may be unaware of it, but who may be reading this posting on their BlackBerrys (and in today's modern world, who knows?!?). For all first-timers (like me) who see the film fully aware of the picture's startling denouement, the question must be Can one still enjoy it with such a movie-spoiling foreknowledge? Well, as anyone who has ever seen The Sixth Sense more than once knows (and I can't imagine anyone seeing this film for the first time who would NOT want to watch it again immediately!), the answer is a resounding yes. In it, Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philly who attempts to help 9-year-old Cole Sear. Cole's problem, as he famously puts it, is that he sees dead people. Anyway, the always likable Willis gives a nicely restrained performance here and, as DVD Delirium puts it, manages to keep his trademark smirk hidden. And young Haley Joel Osment is superb as the troubled Cole, effectively communicating, with his whispered delivery, the fear that is his daily bread. The film is a quiet and understated affair, building suspense and scares through a gradual accretion of detail. It has been expertly lensed by master cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, and Shyamalan's direction is quite ingenious in the way it skips around the edges of the film's big twist while still playing the game fairly. By that famous ending, young Cole seems set to beat Jennifer Love to the punch as a ghost whisperer, while Malcolm comes to see himself for what he truly is. It's some brilliant stuff, and I for one wouldn't even mind a belated, latter-day sequel.... ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2009","score":"","review":" Regarding the famous twist ending of M.

The film is a quiet and understated affair, building suspense and scares through a gradual accretion of detail. It has been expertly lensed by master cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, and Shyamalan's direction is quite ingenious in the way it skips around the edges of the film's big twist while still playing the game fairly.

I like the futuristic 1st half of the movie, but the scenes set in revised 1955 and 1985 seem a bit more cruel and mean-spirited, and not in tone with the rest of the series.

I have, however, also read less than flattering reviews of this film and now I can see why. It reduced the storyline a little too much - the drama is never really at any sort of peak. You feel as though they filmed a longer version but cut out the most dramatic turning points to fit the estimated running time. Strange choice too, to feature the wedding considering that - at the point in the novel where Chris revealed the fate of his grandfather - all they really wanted to do was get away. The last thing the siblings wanted in the book (and, I thought, in the film - up to this moment) was to be around their mother.Chris is oddly cast - he talks like a teenager but he looks about 27, I presume they substituted him calling her Momma for Mom because the first name sounds too old-fashioned, given the date when the film was released but it doesn't give the film any sense of time. Cathy looks very 80s in the second hour - she could almost look like the girl in the Take On Me video by a-Ha with her hair cut (at least in the earlier part of the film, her hair is a convincing 1950s type of style) but she has got that self-preservation ethos and manner of asking the very questions that a teenager would ask and which a mother like hers wouldn't want to have to answer, so the personality is captured quite well. She seems a bit whiny at times, but then, so was the Cathy in the book. The grandmother's dresses are very like they are described in the book and they have got some continuity with Carrie's hair getting longer and longer.The twins aren't badly cast, but the mother seems moronic (I know she was in the book, but she is always talking in this breathy excited whisper, although her tantrums when the kids get fed up with her show at least one other emotion and she is a very spoilt brat - very like in the book, in fact). The wardrobe department must have had a massive stock of white material that they had to use up, though. In the book Cathy is always describing her mother as wearing richly coloured clothes yet in the evening ball or dance (or whatever it was) scene, all the extras are in white - it seems odd.The dramatic bits seemed too obvious - darkness, people hiding behind doors, thumping piano music that somebody obviously equated with scary. The nearly-escape scene contains every cliché going - guard dogs barking, man with a gun on patrol (he was slow to react, given that the dogs had been barking for about five minutes), rope breaking. It's almost Sylvester and Tweety Pie.The vocal, semi-Gregorian chanting gets annoying - I think it's supposed to be creepy. The shot of Cory's grave being filled in looked convincing enough to start with but the idea of a further three graves being dug out and waiting to be filled seems contrived and frankly stupid - if you're going to kill somebody (especially if you're trying to keep it a secret) I don't think most intelligent killers would have ready-made graves on standby to be filled in as the body count rose.

Overall, I suppose the film makers made an attempt at telling the story, but they didn't seem to have a clear vision of its purpose.

We have the sort of introduction and we see a moment with each one, we see the first funny moment with Pedro pissing and on the other hand we have the classic situation of a guy who at the age of what 30 or something still lives with his parents, certainly the father is just tired of having his lazy son doing about nothing during the entire day. Both Pedro and Anthony are out with cars yet only Pedro will be able to continue driving, to continue looking for a lost babe or maybe babes but he will have only kind of a really big disappointment but after all there he meets who will be his best friend. Certainly these two have a lot in common but mainly two things will keep them together drugs and rock and roll. Is just amazing and hilarious the first joint they smoke together, Pedro was like I been smoking since always, I can smoke anything but the Led Zeppelin is something else, heavy s***, dog s***! And that s*** will give them some troubles and certainly we will laugh and laugh. Up in Smoke is one of those movies that are just so damn enjoyable since the very first second till the very last, essentially Pedro and Anthony are just looking out for some s*** but of course things will happen.

A giant telephone looms in the foreground of the shot and when it rings a man in the distance marches up to it and picks up -- a giant phone. A man falls off the wall of a fortress and does one of those carefully times head-over-heel flips that stunt people have perfected and when he hits the ground, he shatters because the figure is made of pottery.Others come across as rather too extended. At least a minute is given over to a scene in a bookshop -- one take -- that's filmed backwards and has the dialog backwards as well.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"4 March 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Back in 2002, it was tough to go into theaters for Episode II Attack of the Clones and be full-heartedly excited. After the overall less-than lukewarm reception The Phantom Menace garnered, Star Wars fans were left unsure if the next prequel could manage to even come close to being an improvement. In some ways, Attack of the Clones doesn't feel all that different from its predecessor; in-spite of a number of changes made.The story has a very similar format to that of The Phantom Menace, with two main story lines existing simultaneously (while occasionally intertwining with each other). First is the more politically-involved plot which begins with an assassination attempt on Amidala and an attempt to find the assassin along with the introduction of a later character's precursor (Fett) leading to the clones introduction to the mix. The other main plot present is Anakin and Amidala's love for each other, which I'll get to later on (since it's determined by the characters more than the storyline itself). In regards to the plot involving the clones (leading to the Storm Troopers), it's sufficient enough and is carried well throughout the film. Other small story tidbits are tossed in, but they tend to feel like they were tossed in simply to link the two trilogies together (such as the Death Star's conception).As with Episode I, Attack of the Clones' characters either feel weak or well fleshed out. Obi Wan Kenobi is given more much-needed exposure and his character is a lot easier to like this time around (with a mostly solid performance from McGregor). The supporting characters feel sufficient enough as well, with Christopher Lee as Count Dooku being a clear standout.However, the characters in Amidala and Anakin (especially in regards to their acting and dialogue) is where the film begins to fall apart. The main reason for this is that Hayden Christensen's acting is simply awful. Essentially, watching and hearing him talk on-screen here is like watching a soap opera. His voice and line deliveries will either make you cringe or say wow in explanation. If there's anything that can be praised in Christensen it's that he's good at emoting when silent via facial expressions (so the scene where his mother dies works well enough).Unfortunately, Christensen's awful acting as Anakin makes the love connection between him and Padme feel misplaced. For most of the scenes in the beginning where he's talking to her she seems to react with a wow, what a (insert demeaning\/derogatory term here) kind of look on her face. And while Portman had a good screen presence with a solid performance in The Phantom Menace her acting her feels rather off, especially for her character. Another key complaint that can be attributed to both performers in the film is how they're left delivering these absurd, cheesy lines that feel like knock-offs of Shakespearean writing (giving the film an awkward, cheesy feel, respectively). For almost every scene of dialogue interaction between the two there's at least a couple lines that feel so melodramatic that it becomes so easy to be taken out of the picture.On the other hand, when the film isn't (lousily) trying to express and tell the love story it actually manages to be fairly decent. This can mostly be attributed to the action and build-up to the last thirty to forty-five minutes. By the time Obi Wan lands on Geonosis the film becomes a little more engaging since the focus moves towards the conflicts that are about to unfold and away from the unconvincing romance story.If it isn't implied enough by now, then it should simply be said Attack of the Clones has excellent action and has impressive effects even by today's standards to support it. The ensuing battle between the clones and the droid army is one of the most intense and entertaining scenes in all of Star Wars and has a great, light feeling of nostalgia. Even by today's standards, the special effects are very impressive and top of the line, which only help to make the action all the more enjoyable (along with how they're capture on-screen excellently).One light compliment that can be given is that the film ends on a good enough note. When the score kicks in at the end with the clones marching into their ships upon the words begun the Clone War has, chills are almost inevitable. While this does give the film a bit of a cliffhanger ending in regards to the Clone War, it manages to end on a fairly smooth transition to where it doesn't feel rushed (like some key parts of the pacing through the film).Attack of the Clones is, if anything, a slight though debatable improvement over its predecessor. While the plot, action and effects have improved, the characters and pacing are still glaring stains on the once majestic material. There's a decent enough film to be found here, though you'll have to look past the horrible love scenes to find the true film here.
