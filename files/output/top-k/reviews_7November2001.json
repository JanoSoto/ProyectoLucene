They were met. Not only are the computer graphics impressive, but the story is original and entertaining with moments of great action, good comedy, and even some genuinely sad parts.The voice-over chemistry between John Goodman and Billy Crystal is excellent. Like Eddie Murphy in SHREK, Billy Crystal was hilarious and definitely stole the show. Crystal seems to be ideal for voice-over work. Both the lead voices are perfect for their respective roles, and I thought James Coburn was also perfect for his character, Henry J. Waternoose.I loved the premise of the film. The idea of monsters going off to their jobs of scaring children to power their city is at the same time original and vaguely familiar. Boo is one of the most adorable characters I've seen in a long time (and Mary Gibbs, the young lady who does the voice of Boo, is equally adorable), and I LOVED the relationship which was developed between Boo and Sully (Goodman).This movie is everything an animated movie should be. It and Shrek are two of my all-time favorite animated movies, and it's hard for me to choose a favorite between the two (which is interesting, since I'm sure one of the two will win the first Oscar for an animated film this year). See this and you won't regret it.

It is also director James Cameron's second best film behind Aliens.This movie has so many good action scenes, my favorite being the police massacre scene because it shows just how cold and relentless the Terminator is in pursuit of something it wants.This is definitely Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role yet.  He has yet been able to top it off.  His performance in T2 was alright but it wasn't typical Schwarzenegger.  Michael Biehn probably gives his best performance here also.

Titanic deserved to win Best Picture, and I really don't care what sort of flak I'd probably get for saying all that, but I like Titanic. I was 12 when I saw it, and I remember clear as day being touched by it. It may be tacky, sappy, or just plain unbelievable, but Titanic is one of the more memorable movies I've seen. It's basically mindless entertainment brought to life by a group of actors who can really act (DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, etc). It's mindless entertainment that tells a rather corny but moving tale of two people brought together and torn apart by fate, and it's mindless entertainment that just *happened* to make millions at the box office, and just *happened* to scoop Oscars left and right. What are you going to do about that?What I like about Titanic is the simplicity of its plot (yes, it has one).

I actually thought it was a Christmas flick for the longest time, but it's a Thanksgiving flick. I remember seeing previews for it back in '95 when I was 12 and they were first advertising the film and I thought it looked so funny. But, I saw it on Showtime Monday (Nov. 5th) for the first time and it's not as funny as I thought (from the previews anyway). It's still a good holiday movie, though, and it seems the perfect time to write a little review considering Thanksgiving is just two weeks away. Speaking of which, this is like one of the only films ever about Thanksgiving. I don't even think I know anymore. Tons on other holidays though. It completely captures all that going home for the holidays isn't supposed to be but ends up being anyway. You leave for home, inevitably on the absolute worst day of your life hoping for some sort of relief from the rest of the world. Instead, you get your family. The old fights are dredged up, you're treated like you're 12, and everything sucks worse than it did before you left...I liked the acting in this film, especially from Robert Downey, Jr. and Holly Hunter, who had me convinced they were brother and sister. Anne Bancroft was good as well. She was funny and dramatic, and she seemed like such a Mom! Totally believable as well.The only complaint I have is that this film isn't as funny as I expected from the previews. It could have done some good to have more of that good ol' black comedy that I, personally, love. But, the movie does have some funny moments with its true-to-life approach on family get-togethers, and a number of touching ones as well. Overall, I'd say it's a good holiday film that's worth watching and definitely will be more appreciated being watched around its specific holiday, which is Thanksgiving.

After getting over my initial shock of seeing Li as a bad guy in Lethal Weapon 4, I actually enjoyed his evil turn in this flick, but it was the most shallow movie I'd ever seen. This had high, HIGH Demolition Man-type foolishness and fun going for it, but that never happens. While Demolition Man was funny and packed full of quirky, humorous social references which played well on Sly's typical performance and Snipes matrial-arts style, this movie doesn't know what it wants to do with the star or itself and falls short terribly. I kept having visions of Judge Dredd as I watched it, but I actually liked Judge Dredd compared to this rubbish. I sat through 85 minutes to hear the best line in the whole movie that comes at the very, very end. Somehow, that percise moment captures exactly what this movies should have been, campy and funny with top-notch martial arts. Instead we get cheesy $6 Million Man running effects (what were they smoking on that one?) and the most unrealistic marriage in the whole wide world.There were SEVERAL things that could have saved this movie. Like, just have his wife be dead already. As we already know, action stars don't need to be married to anyone. It always works better when the spouse is dead, almost always. Especially when you're dealing with people who don't necessarily have the strongest grasp of the English language (ie. Arnold, Sly, Van Damme, etc.) Second, make fun of the genre more. Don't even pretend to be the Matrix, the Matrix was very serious in it's themes and sci-fi, just go all out wacky with it ... you know, for the kids. Make it a little longer in order to explain and give some depth to this whole alternate universe thing. It would have been funny, exciting and interesting to see some footage of Bad Li going around kicking his other asses in different universes ... especially that blonde-haired one. I wanna see how he got deep-sixed. And lastly, come up with something better sounding than Multiverse, I kept thinking of songs with lots of stanzas every time they said it.Also the movie needed to be bigger. One thing about that very last scene that made it work besides the funniest thing I've ever heard come out of Jet Li's mouth in English, is the fact that it shows the huge scope of our faux mulituniverses potential.Also, I was the only person laughing at this movie because I think the directors didn't get the point across that they wanted the audience to laugh. Everyone else in the theater was trying to take this thing seriously like it was the Matrix.So essentaially my verdict is thus ... If you liked the Matrix, but thought the martial arts was ... er ... not top caliber you'll be pleased with the martial arts here and will wonder why they didn't put more of it in The One (Hollywood producers still think American audiences don't have the patiences for a true Hong Kong cinema fight sequence, which typically last much longer than five minutes and are more daring, dramatic and are choreographed in the way that Fosse choreographed musicals.) But Matrix lovers will be dissapointed by the lack of substance in this farce. (On a related note, most forget the Matrix is more of a live action Anime than a Hong-Kong flick, therefore the technique is shabby, but everyone gets the point, much like in animation.)Basically this is all Hollywood's fault. Li admitted himself that in China, people aren't worried about kissing your ass so they tell you if a scene doesn't work or if you could stand to do a little better. Here everyone just tells him he's great all the time and don't give him the feedback he truly needs in order to make the film he deserves to make, instead of this tripe.Kiss of the Dragon was close, but no cigar.

I must take that back however because I watched last night on digital cable, and it was MUCH cooler then I remembered!!.. (it's been 15years).. The score was so powerful I was actually getting goosebump's watching it! (the last movie to give me goosebumps was watching the 5th Element in theatres). Yes the plot is a little cliched, but the characters and their chemistry is great. It's an over the top movie that never fails. I really love the special effects (I'll take it over CGI any day!), and it truly is a visually stunning piece.. People complain about the mountain climbing scenes and horseback scenes, but damn.. Those are really cool scenes. Probably the coolest mountain climbing scene's ever filmed. I mean come on, they have awesome visuals of Ken Marshall (or stuntman) just dangling on those awesome huge mountains. I could watch 5 hours of that cos it is really thrilling.

Every shot and scene of this movie is tantalizing and this is one of the few movies that your eyes will wander around the entire screen in awe.

I'm surprised a 'bouncing ball' prompt wasn't added to mark our place through the words in this film so often did things pop up to ram home where it was all coming from. Like his hero, Jarmusch seems to find wisdom in a book and not experience. Whitaker's gloomy performance has been praised, but to me it seems monotone, and his special medallion, presumably there to emphasise necessary cultural 'baggage', hangs like a golden millstone around his neck. In short, like a famous review once said, the actor 'ranges across the whole gamut of emotions, from A to B'. Maybe Jarmusch intends in this way to express stoicism. Instead he communicates a lack of vitality - completely diffferent from the hidden strength that informs (say) Toshiro Mifune in 'Sanjuro' or other famous Samurai flics, where we believe we are seeing a dangerous man in repose. Like the famous end of 'Queen Christina' the audience can read everything (or nothing) into a complete lack of expression. Rather than exuding danger, Whitaker merely suggested sloth (a situation not helped by the inept and curiously unthreatening opposition he faced.)The sight of Ghost Dog's somewhat portly figure briefly practising the martial arts was unconvincing to say the least - and pointless in practical terms, as he always uses a gun. Perhaps Jarmusch thought so too, as he dresses it up in fancy optical work. Ghost Dog's adoption of the samurai code was mysterious, remains largely unexplained, and the eventual flashback explanation of his motivation I found peremptory. In short, everything which was subtle and unspoken in Melville's 'Samourai' (one influence, for instance) was here spelt out and taken too far. One example in the French film the assassin has a single bird in a cage, Jarmusch gives him a *whole pigeon loft*. And how I inwardly groaned when Rashomon duly appeared as 'required reading' matter!Jarmush hangs his digressions onto a stripped down revenge plot which had no real surprises. Everything takes so long, unfortunately with little impact - from the longeurs of Ghost Dog's initial car drive, through his sleeping with the pigeons, onto his relationship with a dog which seems to reflect back his own boredom. 'Ghost Dog' has a plot I could have written out on the back of an envelope - and had room to fold the flap down. If Jarmusch had taken time, fleshed things out more, balanced out the characters (classic heavy Silva in particular is utterly wasted) he might have pleased more than the arthouse crowd who take whimsicality and cultural reference for profundity.Finally of course, there's a big irony. If a real samurai was ordered to death by his master(or his master's master) he would shortly commit hari-kari, not go after the 'shogun' or the equivalent elite, which would be considered a shameful act. The best one can say about 'Ghost Dog' is that it is humourously quirky and passes 90 minutes. But it ultimately remains unfocussed and without any real tension.

Whitaker's gloomy performance has been praised, but to me it seems monotone, and his special medallion, presumably there to emphasise necessary cultural 'baggage', hangs like a golden millstone around his neck. In short, like a famous review once said, the actor 'ranges across the whole gamut of emotions, from A to B'. Maybe Jarmusch intends in this way to express stoicism. Instead he communicates a lack of vitality - completely diffferent from the hidden strength that informs (say) Toshiro Mifune in 'Sanjuro' or other famous Samurai flics, where we believe we are seeing a dangerous man in repose. Like the famous end of 'Queen Christina' the audience can read everything (or nothing) into a complete lack of expression. Rather than exuding danger, Whitaker merely suggested sloth (a situation not helped by the inept and curiously unthreatening opposition he faced.)The sight of Ghost Dog's somewhat portly figure briefly practising the martial arts was unconvincing to say the least - and pointless in practical terms, as he always uses a gun.
