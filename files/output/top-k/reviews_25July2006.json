You'll hate what a jerk Landon (West) is at first. You'll empathize with Jamie (Moore) and how she doesn't fit in, especially when she's slandered. You'll be joyful when they're finally together and realize they love each other. You'll cry when you find out about Jamie's illness. It really is a great, romantic chick flick, but I know guys could appreciate it, too. Well, some of them, anyway. The only problems I have with it are the departures from the book. I mean, the book takes place in the '40s, but the teens are in '90s gear. And Jamie is really supposed to be plain until the play. I guess you don't sell movies without beautiful people. I guess you can't make Mandy Moore plain. My biggest complaint has got to be the fact that the title of the movie isn't explained in the movie like it is in the book. The walk is when Jamie is walking down the aisle at her wedding and she can barely walk she's so weak. The wedding was really just brushed over in the movie. But all-in-all, I just love this movie.

They are like those geometric forms that you have to combine. One is a perfect cube and one is a perfect triangle hole in the wall, but they do not match ( go see Fight Club and read the novel to understand what I mean. The director and the writer match and seems like one ). Now if you have not read the book, you may consider this movie a masterpiece coming from Kubrick. On the other side if you read the book and have no knowledges about movies, and Kubrick, then this movie will suck ass just like Carrie. If you are not familiar with none above then this movie should be OK, maybe just a little bit old.For those who read the novel and know Kubrick's work this movie will be so confusing that you will spend your entire life not knowing if you hated it or if you loved it.Why to hate it? Well I'm not saying that Stephen King is a very complex writer, but he surely tries to spread some messages through his books. The Shining was a good read, and with lots of messages and many weird things. And this is the main problem. A lot of those messages did not came with the movie ( the wasps' nest, Tony, the most tensed part of the book where Danny reach into his father head, the big explosion, etc., and finally one of the most important thing Wendy's smile from the end) Beside that, Wendy's past is totally give it away in the movie and the book is very much about her. The book is a road of initiation for her and Danny ( Jack Torrance is just a victim !!!). There where moments in the film when I went Oh my God!!! What the f**k is going on. They missed that part and that part and that part.  Oh my God!!! No No No. Why ? Why ?Why to love it? Not because it's a good horror ( which in my humble opinion it is not ) but because it's a work of art. The image is outstanding. Every moment of the film could be put as an wallpaper. Simply amazing. The lights, the shadows, the angles, the majesty ( which by the way all-in-all does not match the feeling from the book ). All mixed with a very good sound. Beside that, the cast is quite good. Nicholson is in one of his best role, and Danny Lloyd does a great job. The problem could be once again Shelly Duvall. She acts horrible. The only thing that keeps her in is her unusual face ( just like Sigourney Weaver ).While I enjoyed watching another Kubrick's masterpiece I got the feeling that something was wrong with this one and to be honest I have not expected to be otherwise. This film was not for Kubrick, and I believe many of you think so. ( maybe it had been better if they changed its name, cause for many this movie is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining ).

Set in the lush swamplands of Louisiana back in the 1960s, this cinematic feast boasts a full menu of guilt, jealousy, revenge, infidelity, possible incest &#150; and just enough supernatural mambo-jumbo to cast a spell over the audience. Trouble brews beneath the surface for Eve's well-to-do African American family. A clairvoyant aunt (Debbi Morgan) worries about falling in love because of a curse that's already struck down three of her husbands. Eve's elegant father (Samuel L.

On a fateful evening during a party, Eve accidentally sees her father making love to one of their guests, and this incident becomes the most disturbing moment of her life, setting the stage for the tragedy to follow. Despite the film's dramatic opening line, screenwriter and first-time director Kasi Lemmons uses all the tricks of the trade to remind us that memories can be misleading.

If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero?

However, I'd like to offer some further information that you may find useful.The new 50th Anniversary DVD has many good things about it-----but Peter Bogdanovich's rambling and anecdotal commentary is not one of them. While he may be a great admirer of John Ford's work and also produced a documentary about the great director, he is no film historian. Bogdanovich's meandering praise of the film and Ford is certainly well deserved. But the average viewer would have benefited from a more insightful and better organized analysis of The Searchers than the one he presented. I found it frustrating to listen to his disjointed personal recollections of conversations he had with Ford. While they may have had some limited entertainment value, these musings shed little light on the film itself.The principal villain is Chief Scar---played with stoic detachment by veteran Caucasian character actor Henry Brandon. While there may not have been any Native American actors available in 1956 to do justice to this role, it was somewhat jarring to see Brandon's darkly tinted white face looking out at us under that war bonnet. For fans of movie serials, Brandon appeared 16 years earlier in a different racial disguise-----as the titled evil Yellow Peril menace in Drums of Fu Manchu.The adult Debbie was played by the appropriately Caucasian Natalie Wood-----heavily and distractingly made up for Technicolor to simulate some sort of Comanche-like maiden, but with a lipstick-enhanced face. She was about as convincing in this role as Debra Paget was as James Stewart's nubile Indian love interest in Broken Arrow (1950)-----which is no compliment to either actress.This film contains the finest role of Jeffrey Hunter's abbreviated movie career. It shows us what a handsome and talented actor he was---and what a tragedy it turned out to be that he never got another opportunity to do something equally good. Most of his fans know that he was the original Captain of the Enterprise in the Star Trek television series. His failure to pursue the potential of this role did two significant things (other than exhibit poor judgment); (1) it denied us the chance to see how he would have built, shaped and sustained that character as the series developed; and (2) it opened the door for a major television career for William Shatner that might not have been.As for the Searchers---its greatness endures undiminished and continues to grow after 50 years and numerous mediocre and inconsequential imitations (see e.g. Grayeagle (1978)).

Most of his fans know that he was the original Captain of the Enterprise in the Star Trek television series. His failure to pursue the potential of this role did two significant things (other than exhibit poor judgment); (1) it denied us the chance to see how he would have built, shaped and sustained that character as the series developed; and (2) it opened the door for a major television career for William Shatner that might not have been.As for the Searchers---its greatness endures undiminished and continues to grow after 50 years and numerous mediocre and inconsequential imitations (see e.g. Grayeagle (1978)).

However, I'd like to offer some further information that you may find useful.The new 50th Anniversary DVD has many good things about it-----but Peter Bogdanovich's rambling and anecdotal commentary is not one of them. While he may be a great admirer of John Ford's work and also produced a documentary about the great director, he is no film historian. Bogdanovich's meandering praise of the film and Ford is certainly well deserved. But the average viewer would have benefited from a more insightful and better organized analysis of The Searchers than the one he presented. I found it frustrating to listen to his disjointed personal recollections of conversations he had with Ford. While they may have had some limited entertainment value, these musings shed little light on the film itself.The principal villain is Chief Scar---played with stoic detachment by veteran Caucasian character actor Henry Brandon. While there may not have been any Native American actors available in 1956 to do justice to this role, it was somewhat jarring to see Brandon's darkly tinted white face looking out at us under that war bonnet. For fans of movie serials, Brandon appeared 16 years earlier in a different racial disguise-----as the titled evil Yellow Peril menace in Drums of Fu Manchu.The adult Debbie was played by the appropriately Caucasian Natalie Wood-----heavily and distractingly made up for Technicolor to simulate some sort of Comanche-like maiden, but with a lipstick-enhanced face.

Arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind. He likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he don't know and finds everything funny. Arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird).This is a damn funny film. I watched this film because a very famous Indian film 'Sharabee' is based on the character of Arthur. Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur' I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. Its very corny at times. There are so many fantastic one liners in the film. Its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiancé's father and he keeps talking about the 'moose'. Duddley Moore sure has some comic timing. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a 'small' country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud got an Oscar for this film. I don't know that actor. I don't think he did a great job but may be if I watched more of his work I may agree in future. Movie has some flat patches but not very long ones. looking forward to watch the sequel.

It would seem that it has a reputation as being his worst work to date(at least as far as theatrically released movies go)... I must say, if the rest of what he's done is this powerful, I will have to keep my eyes open for it. You seldom see movies that are this unpleasant. There are films that are far, far harder to watch... but this is still not one you put on to enjoy yourself. As many other viewers, I didn't care much for the first half(well, part... it's a third of the projects full length, with a running time of about 25 minutes), Fiction. I felt I had gained little after it was over, though I will say that the concept and themes explored are quite interesting. Non-Fiction proved to be far more worth-while, in my opinion. The writing and direction is excellent in both. The pacing works well... I was never bored, and while it wasn't exactly a good time, it moved along as it should, never really too slow or too fast. The characters were incredible... the sheer amount of development, through so little time spent on each... that's talent. As its title indicates, Storytelling goes into different methods of telling a story... and displays some of the most impressive storytelling that I've seen to date. There is some humor, but it's quite black, and throughout the film, I was unsure of whether I should laugh out loud... or cry my eyes out. The film is strongly satirical, very direct and seemingly almost aggressively anti-PC. Dealing with several subjects of taboo, Solondz pulls few punches, if any. Certainly not a film for everyone. Both parts seem to end somewhat abruptly, but that may be intentional. I will say that my rating would almost certainly have been higher had the first part been improved upon... or removed entirely. It's difficult to say who I'd recommend this to... cynics or realists with a strong threshold for the some of the ugliest sides of human nature, I suppose. From what I understand, though, it's less provocative than the other films of Todd Solondz. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 July 2006","score":"22 out of 30 people found the following review useful","review":" After reading about Palindromes and finding myself oddly attracted to the subject matter of several of Todd Solondz's features, I bought this film.
