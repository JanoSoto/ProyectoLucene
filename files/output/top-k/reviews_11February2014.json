Basically in New York, English art house auctioneer Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant) proposes to his girlfriend Gina Vitale (Basic Instinct's Jeanne Tripplehorn), but she shockingly turns him down, she explains it is because her father Frank Vitale (James Caan) as well as as her cousins and uncles are a crime family of gangsters heavily involved in Mafia activity. She doesn't want him getting sucked into this world, but he assures her this wouldn't happen, but he unknowingly does become part of a money laundering scheme, before they are even officially engaged, the FBI have him in their sights, and soon enough he is being forced into helping the mob with more laundering scams that he is made aware of, once under the given nickname Mickey Blue Eyes. When one the laundering schemes goes wrong Gina's cousin Johnny Graziosi (John Ventimiglia) assaults Michael, Gina gets mad, grabs his gun and fires a warning shot into the ceiling, but is ricochets and Johnny is accidentally killed, Johnny's father Vito Graziosi (Rocky's Burt Young) threatens to Frank that he will kill Gina unless Michael is killed during the wedding speeches. Frank cannot hurt his daughter, so he confesses to Michael what Vito has ordered, and they turn out the FBI for protection, the authorities make a setup that will see Michael apparently get assassinated in a fake attack at the wedding reception, he is also given a wire to try and record Vito confessing to his activities and crimes in the mob. The plan fails and Vito catches onto the setup, Vinnie D'Agostino (Analyze This's Joe Viterelli) is ordered to kill him, but he accidentally shoots Gina, Vito is arrested while Michael and Frank are in the ambulance mourning over Gina's death, but it was also fake, Vinnie and Gina were part of the FBI's backup plan, and she wanted to teach her groom and father a lesson, in the end Michael and her make up, and Frank is happy for the Englishman to be part of his regular family. Also starring Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's James Fox as Philip Cromwell, Gerry Becker as FBI Agent Bob Connell, Maddie Corman as Carol the Photographer, Tony Darrow as Angelo, Paul Lazar as Ritchie Vitale and GoodFellas' Vincent Pastore as Al. Grant does his silly English twit act we have come to expect fine, Caan could have perhaps acted a bit more like the real don of the family but is okay, supporting actors all do their parts alright as well, the film though is a little predictable and perhaps dull, it made me laugh in the right places, like the scene where Grant is trying to get mob lingo and certain scenes in the auction house, but otherwise it's not hilariously funny, so all in all it was a see just once comedy.

Basically, set in Danzig, Germany the film takes place before, during and at the end of World War II, and focuses on the life of young Oskar Matzerath (David Bennent), before being born his mother wasn't sure who his father was, as she had two love interests, she married German man Alfred Matzerath (Mario Adorf), but she continued an affair with Polish cousin Jan Bronski (Daniel Olbrychski). At age 3 Oskar was given a tin drum for his birthday, he is not happy with the world around him as he grows up, so he halted his growth as a child throwing himself down the basement stairs, his tin drum becomes his comfort, but also perhaps his obsession, as he never lets it go throughout, and he found the ability that his high pitch scream can shatter glass, which he uses to stop anyone trying to take his drum away from him. Poland is invading by the German Nazis, including the small town the family live, there are two family deaths, his mother Anna Koljaiczek (Berta Drews) who kills herself swallowing large amounts of raw fish, and Jan Bronski who is killed by the Nazis while continuing to work at the Polish post office, Oskar is sheltered with his peasant cousin Maria Matzerath (Katharina Thalbach) and her father, she over a short time becomes his stepmother, but also his lover, and she ends up pregnant when they have sex. It is unclear if Oskar really is the father, but he assumes baby Kurt born is his son, but he does not stick around as he meets an old dwarf acquaintance Bebra (Fritz Hakl) who invites him to join the travelling circus of other dwarfs that perform to escape the threat the war, he entertains with his screaming talent and occasionally the tin drum, and it is there that he meets his second love Roswitha (Mariella Oliveri). This romance is cut short before the war comes to an end, and he can do nothing but go home, and returning Oskar faces the tragic loss of his father, and at the funeral he finds the strength to finally let go of his tin drum as he buries it with the coffin, and that same day his son Kurt hits him over the head with a rock, and his bodily growth is restored. Also starring Angela Winkler as Agnes Matzerath and Charles Aznavour as Sigismund Markus. In the leading part young Bennent is a fascinating character, with his piercing eyes expressing some severe emotions and never truly growing up, the film is full of surreal moments, especially any part with the tin drum and the young man's insistence to always have it and never let it go, even in dangerous situations, and of course the war element of the story is powerful in portraying struggle to survive and loss, the visuals are fantastic, and it has a lot of expressionism, it is indeed powerful and memorable wartime drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!

I was immediately fascinated by what i was seeing. 'Frank' in his 'stupid bunny suit' and Donnie in his 'stupid man suit'. So, when the DVD was released i had to get it. Returning home i gave a brief outline of the film to my parents. 'It's about a guy called Donnie who speaks to this giant bunny'. Anyway,it was enough to intrigue them and although apprehensive they sat down with me to watch the film. We sat through Donnie Darko enchanted by the beautiful imagery and mesmerising score. From 'Donnie' to 'Gretchen'. And Tears for Fears 'Head Over Heels' to Joy Divisions 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'. The film just oozes a style and sophistication barely recognisable. The film is a fascinating portrayal of life and has a serving of every film genre. The love story between 'Donnie' and 'Gretchen'. The horror between 'Donnie and 'Frank'. As well as a helping of quick whit comedy and drama that I can associate with everyday life. Drew Barrymore is fantastic as Donnie's English Teacher. And Beth Grant also shines as the infuriating 'righteous one',Kittie Farmer. In fact the whole support cast are genuinely individual and believable. Patrick Swayze as 'Jim Cunningham' is a character that shows evil and deceit stretches through all walks of life. Regardless of social status and reputation. Donnie's caring parents and his turbulent relationship with his older sister 'Elizabeth' (a relationship I compare with me and my twin brother). It's because Donnie Darko makes it so easy to believe the characters that the film is a good account of how 'normal' people view others as 'strange' or,'weird'. The film gave me the chance to make up my own mind as to what it meant. After endless discussions with family and friends,Donnie Darko still lets my imagination run wild. Being a keen fan of Horror and Steven Spielberg films I like the references to 'Evil Dead' in the 'Portal' scene and 'E.T. in the 'Cellar Door' scene. It is without doubt in my top five films of all time and films of this calibre come around all too rarely.The film emphasises to me that as a Race,our existence depends on acceptance and equality for all. While at the same time showing a togetherness in times of need and hurt. Donnie laughing at his own fate at the end of the film emphasises this to me. In my eyes the films acceptance depends on what you believe in. What is fate? What is real? What is fake? Why do we dream? Why are we here? Do you believe in deja-vu or,a parallel Universe? Or,how about Portals? The fact is we all have our own ideals and beliefs and I see a lot of mine in Donnie Darko. Through life comes death and through dark comes light. That is what the film means to me and that is the way I see life. Donnie Darko is a refreshing take on the way we view life and death as individuals. It is indeed a 'Mad World' and video is a form of escapism. Without films like Donnie Darko what would we do? Go mad i suppose. With films like Donnie Darko in it the world is a better place.

(Never mind that Australia has its own big cities such as Sydney.) He is actually unaware of prostitution, transvestites, drug use, etc. Okay, he hasn't been around, but this is ridiculous.At best, this movie is mediocre. The story is very predictable, the jokes are weak and trite, the characters are little more than stereotypes, and the romance between Dundee and the reporter lacks chemistry. It doesn't hold up well today.

It was actually kind of pleasant compared to the rap and other styles the main characters liked.Family was important here.

I did like the cat and its friends, in the one scene.Chicago was probably my favorite character. He was funny and likable, most of the time.Janet Jackson has a nice smile and she can have a nice personality when it is called for. Sometimes here, she had to be depressed or angry. That's fine.

It is a good film, but not great.This is a fairly generic underdog story. The film is kinda boring until the last third and the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian doesn't really work. The way Rocky goes after her seems more like harassment than love. She doesn't show any interest in him. She feels really uncomfortable in Rocky's apartment and tries to escape but Rocky blocks her in. There's no way that two minutes later they're kissing. A big disappointment was Mickey, I thought he was going to be some awesome trainer like Mr. Miyagi but he's hardly in this film, and kind of a jerk. I'd heard of that one famous line of his You're gonna eat lightning and crap thunder, but I didn't realize that's basically the extent of the training he gives. The most iconic part of the film is probably the training montage (in which Mickey just watches him do push-ups and pull- ups) which is the best part of the film. I felt the words Trying hard now was actually referring to the filmmakers trying harder compared to the rest of the movie. Although without that song you have to admit all Rocky's really doing is running around and punching things. The final fight is alright, but fairly underwhelming.

Director Taylor Hackford (Mr. Helen Mirren) maximizes the juicy script (adapted by Tony Gilroy with superb grasp on verbal tit-for-tat) with contrast palettes (seamlessly segue between bleak present and balmy past) to channel us into two unsolved death cases. 15 years later, Selena (Leigh), a young reporter in New York, reluctantly revisits her mother Dolores in remote Maine, who is accused of murdering the aforementioned Vera, a rich widow and the longtime employer of Dolores, who works as a maid in her house for over 20 years.

Bates is simply a nonesuch to be a big-screen diva with her killing bearing fluctuating between a vulnerable housewife and redoubtable matron. Jennifer Jason Leigh, the most under-appreciated actress among her coeval, strikes as an unthankful and wayward stuck-up hipster at first, but she slowly unwinds her wound with aching perseverance and she is pretty amazing too, we are all fully aware there must be a reason behind all the bickering and rebuffs, then we discover her deepest trauma which she wholly obliterates, it hits like a big bang, and she generates wonderful luster of compassion no lesser than Bates.

Although the She is my current win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS of 1995 while Leigh comes strong as the third.

The film comes up with a new twist on the time travel theme - at least I had not seen it before. Thanks to some powerful solar flares and northern lights, a firefighter father and policeman son communicate instantaneously, sitting in the same house at the same table at the same HAM radio - but two decades apart. The screenwriters do not miss the poignancy of this father-son meeting through time, by making sure these characters did not get to communicate when the son was a child because of the father's (Dennis Quaid) untimely death.Or does he need to die? His son saves him from a fire he was fighting because to the son, it's old news. The repartee through the HAM radio and time is exquisite as the son must convince his father that he's from the future for real, not just a prankster, with just hours to go before his dad's death.A complicated story of unsolved mass murder ensues, drawing in friends and family past and present, who fade in and out of existence as the son alters the past by tipping off his father. After seeing it three times, the time travel plot is full of little holes, besides obvious ones, such as why the son would be the only one to remember the altered past, while everyone else's memories adapt to the past as it changes. Then there's the butterfly effect no way will a random mass murderer hit the same targets in same order once he's been messed up once. But the inconsistencies that are unavoidable in a time travel film are handled deftly by the writers, unlike, for example, the ridiculous premise of a recent Star Trek remake that an upset Romulan thrown into the past would rather blow up the planet of a man who almost saved the Romulan homeworld, instead of just trying the salvation procedure again, since he has 100 years to succeed!The film is well acted, the time spent developing the characters is interspersed with excellent action, from dangerous fires to life-threatening pursuit of a mass killer in the past and present. As a carefully set-designed period piece, the film holds up well, and is worth more than one viewing, if for no other reason than to see how the scriptwriters wrote around temporal paradoxes about as good as one can. For an almost perfect time paradox film, watch the Heinlein-based 'Predestination.' The SF grand-master knows how to circumvent every paradox.

Thanks to some powerful solar flares and northern lights, a firefighter father and policeman son communicate instantaneously, sitting in the same house at the same table at the same HAM radio - but two decades apart. The screenwriters do not miss the poignancy of this father-son meeting through time, by making sure these characters did not get to communicate when the son was a child because of the father's (Dennis Quaid) untimely death.Or does he need to die? His son saves him from a fire he was fighting because to the son, it's old news. The repartee through the HAM radio and time is exquisite as the son must convince his father that he's from the future for real, not just a prankster, with just hours to go before his dad's death.A complicated story of unsolved mass murder ensues, drawing in friends and family past and present, who fade in and out of existence as the son alters the past by tipping off his father. After seeing it three times, the time travel plot is full of little holes, besides obvious ones, such as why the son would be the only one to remember the altered past, while everyone else's memories adapt to the past as it changes. Then there's the butterfly effect no way will a random mass murderer hit the same targets in same order once he's been messed up once. But the inconsistencies that are unavoidable in a time travel film are handled deftly by the writers, unlike, for example, the ridiculous premise of a recent Star Trek remake that an upset Romulan thrown into the past would rather blow up the planet of a man who almost saved the Romulan homeworld, instead of just trying the salvation procedure again, since he has 100 years to succeed!The film is well acted, the time spent developing the characters is interspersed with excellent action, from dangerous fires to life-threatening pursuit of a mass killer in the past and present. As a carefully set-designed period piece, the film holds up well, and is worth more than one viewing, if for no other reason than to see how the scriptwriters wrote around temporal paradoxes about as good as one can. For an almost perfect time paradox film, watch the Heinlein-based 'Predestination.' The SF grand-master knows how to circumvent every paradox.

I will not start to explain it here, but I'm sure they worked very hard to put together the scenes. Many objects have its own meaning (for example the taxi badge in last scene), and these are not explained in the speeches, you just have to look very carefully. And the rest? The actors made their best. The scenes well developed, the fast and slow scenes have a good rhythmic. The music is perfect for this film. The humor? I found this film funny all the 100 times, so it have to be damn good. And the story? Well, I read the comments here, and I found out, somebody got some familiar ideas. There are many storyline collide in here. But the main story (a mentally injured man try to hold the last bit of his sanity by his love) is great. I understand this is not a technically great film, and there are not raining aliens from every corner, there are no hills of bullets, but you have to feel the pressure of the unknown enemy. We didn't know, how Jerry (Mel Gibson) was applied for the brainwashing program in the first place, but you can feel, it could be you or anyone else. Jerry just a normal guy, and he has no special skills. That makes him so likable. About Alice Sutton (Julia Roberts) plays very nicely. And about the evil, representing by Dr. Jonas (Patrick Stewart), well... The film mostly follow Jerry, and lot of time Alice, and rarely we watch someone else, like as a gunmen of the evil organization, or something like this. But we never see Dr. Jonas, from Dr. Jonas's point of view. We only see him when interact with Jerry or Alice or other character, and from their point of view. The truth is, he never even lie, only dezinform. If you watch the movie many times, it's clear, he never thinks himself, as a bad guy. He got a position, made some success, but sometimes failed and that is unacceptable. So he try to repair his faults. Even, if this mean he have to kill more and more people. Good question who is the real crazy guy in this movie. Therefore, I think Stewart made a great job here. This character is really nicely fit in the bad guy picture, who tortured many person, make them killers. So, if you didn't watched this film yet, do it, at least twice.

A low budget but extremely well acted and directed movie.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a gangster comedy with complex plot, dark humour and memorable characters. Writer-director Guy Ritchie did great on this, it's his first film. He is probably my favorite new director. It is a clear recommendation for everybody who enjoys good gangster films with humorous aspects, and if you liked Tarantino's films, this is a suggestion.The movie is about a poker player named Eddy .who is bankrupted by Hatchet Harry,a gambling and porn king. Harry cheats, Eddy runs up an enormous debt, Barry the Baptist explains that he will start chopping fingers of his friends if he don't pay up. What to do? So the action begins&#x85;but you get the idea. Or maybe you don't. The plot is complex yet understandable and enjoyable. My first reaction was to compare Ritchie's style with that of Quentin Tarantino. On following reflection, no, director Guy Ritchie with this film has a style of his own. What impresses is the way Ritchie handles all of the story lines in this one story. He also does it in such a high-energy style that you have to stop and catch your breath. Ritchie also gets mostly unknown cast, but every single actor in this film does a great job of acting, each plays a unique character. Dialog, dialog, dialog! Don't get me wrong - there's plenty of action in this movie, but dialog (it happens seldom in a movie) are absorbing. As I said, this movie will not be every one's cup of tea. It contains a lot of violence, guns and shooting, blood, dead bodies, fighting. One may say that language is very strong, with multiple uses of f--k and various other words, including English slang. The plot involves marijuana growers and stolen drugs, there are no positive characters (it's great, what's to like in them?, positive characters are nearly the same) . But it is done tastefully, funny and fashionable. Finally, the music accompanying this film is excellent. Out of the perhaps several thousand movies I have seen , this was the first soundtrack that I downloaded and it is a very strong collection of old and new tunes that really added a lot to the atmosphere. I rank this movie in my top 10 all time list. If you haven't seen this film yet, you must. It is so funny; you'll want to watch it over and over again.

My first reaction was to compare Ritchie's style with that of Quentin Tarantino. On following reflection, no, director Guy Ritchie with this film has a style of his own. What impresses is the way Ritchie handles all of the story lines in this one story. He also does it in such a high-energy style that you have to stop and catch your breath. Ritchie also gets mostly unknown cast, but every single actor in this film does a great job of acting, each plays a unique character. Dialog, dialog, dialog! Don't get me wrong - there's plenty of action in this movie, but dialog (it happens seldom in a movie) are absorbing. As I said, this movie will not be every one's cup of tea. It contains a lot of violence, guns and shooting, blood, dead bodies, fighting. One may say that language is very strong, with multiple uses of f--k and various other words, including English slang. The plot involves marijuana growers and stolen drugs, there are no positive characters (it's great, what's to like in them?, positive characters are nearly the same) . But it is done tastefully, funny and fashionable. Finally, the music accompanying this film is excellent. Out of the perhaps several thousand movies I have seen , this was the first soundtrack that I downloaded and it is a very strong collection of old and new tunes that really added a lot to the atmosphere. I rank this movie in my top 10 all time list. If you haven't seen this film yet, you must. It is so funny; you'll want to watch it over and over again.

A low budget but extremely well acted and directed movie.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a gangster comedy with complex plot, dark humour and memorable characters. Writer-director Guy Ritchie did great on this, it's his first film. He is probably my favorite new director. It is a clear recommendation for everybody who enjoys good gangster films with humorous aspects, and if you liked Tarantino's films, this is a suggestion.The movie is about a poker player named Eddy .who is bankrupted by Hatchet Harry,a gambling and porn king.

Baby Jane felt like it will be exactly what I was looking for. However, I was deeply disappointed.First off, I love Bette Davis (Jane) and Joan Crawford (Blanche). Nonetheless, their characters really got on my nerves because they were so over the top, both of them. Bette with the excessive crazy person look and Joan with the excessively polite person behavior. The movie wasn't thrilling at all - it's more of a drama than anything else. I don't think there was one moment that held me on the edge of my seat, except maybe the one where Blanche is trying to get to the phone downstairs. At the same time, though, I was irritated by it. Every time Jane would go out to run errands she would be away for a long period of time, giving Blanche enough time to seek help in many ways. Yet all she did in that time was one or two activities like eating candy or trying to get down the stairs. What, this took her hours? I know she was in a wheelchair but come on! If you're afraid for your life you'll frickin' drag your body down the stairs if you have to. And you'll do that as soon as your abuser left the house, too.Another thing that really irritated me was Blanche's complete incompetence. What, she couldn't scream out the window when she saw the neighbor? She couldn't throw things out to get somebodies attention? It's not like they were living in the woods, away from all forms of civilization. Imagine you're being held captive in your own house and you manage to get to the phone AND call for assistance. Would yo beat around the bush or scream come help me right now, my sister is crazy! Come NOW!!!? For me, the whole movie is totally unbelievable.

Every year, we see at least one of them and every time they come out, it's money in the bank for the studios. But with how popular the genre has become, one film that's often overlooked in the genre is M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable. Which is sad because this is actually one of the more thought-provoking and unique films in the genre. So why do so few people talk about this movie after all these years? Let's find out.Plot David Dunn is a security guard who becomes the sole survivor of a train accident with no sustained injuries whatsoever. After surviving the train accident, David receives a mysterious note asking him the question How many times have you been sick? and from then on, he embarks on a journey with Elijah Price, a comic-book historian and museum owner who suffers from Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a disease that causes the patient's bones to be extremely brittle, to discover that David may be, a superhuman.The thing that surprised me about this film is how it has its own mythology and how believable and unique it is. This film has the idea that comic-books are basically representations of real-life but that they've been commercialized so they lost some of that truth but the essence is still there. People may not be able to see through walls or shoot fire out of their hands in real-life but people DO have extraordinary abilities that seem out of this world such as David's ability to never be injured or his ability to tell bad deeds someone's done simply by touching their hand. There's a lot of films made about the idea of having a superhero in real-life such as Kick-Ass and Super but I've never seen a film before that suggests comic-books to be real. Also, while the idea of a man being unbreakable and able to tell someone's bad deeds just by touching their hand would seem very silly if it was done in the traditional, Hollywood blockbuster way where we would see David do all sorts of crazy stuff with CGI and stuff, Shayamalan presents this idea in a believable, realistic fashion. David in this movie is certainly not a regular human being, but at the same time, his powers are JUST down-to-earth enough for us to buy that someone could possibly possess these powers in real- life. It's a remarkable achievement for a film to make me believe that a guy could possibly possess superpowers in real-life.There's also lot of philosophy and questions raised in this film. This movie features the idea of destiny in that we're all meant to follow a certain path in life whether we want to or not and it's quite fascinating. This movie features the born to be the hero archetype in David with him destined to be a superhero but it also features the OTHER side of the spectrum, the man born to be the villain, Elijah Price A.K.A Mr. Glass. The concept about a man being destined to become a hero is obviously not anything new as we've seen it all throughout film and literature but what makes this different is that this movie doesn't quite present it as simply Destiny is good, you are meant for great things!. It challenges us by asking What if you are born a villain?, and this is a great, FASCINATING topic that this movie thankfully delves into quite a lot. It makes you question Is evil born, or is it created?. And while there a bunch of different ways to look at this film, in my eyes, it's both. Mr. Glass in this film is born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which causes him to feel lonely and lost as he struggles to find his place in the world but when he finds out he's meant to be the yang to David's yin, he finally knows who he is and why he's born the way he was. While it's not exactly a comforting thing to know, he at least finally knows his place in the world. But on the other hand, it's CREATED because it was Elijah's desperation that led to him to his quest where he initiated acts of terrorism just to find his opposite, David.Now, let's talk about the acting and the directing. I'll just talk about Willis and Jackson since this film is really just about them. Bruce Willis is excellent here as David. He plays David as someone who is simply lost as to who he is life and who's feeling this constant sadness with that he can't explain and Willis'soft-spoken, brooding personality fits very well into this character. Samuel plays Elijah as a very determined and philosophical figure. He delivers all of his lines with a presence of authority and Sam's voice really convinces you what he's saying, is true. His best scene is towards the end where he breaks down in tears from finding out who he is and this is a very tricky scene for any actor to act out because his character is feeling a lot of different emotions at the same time. But Sam really sells this scene and makes it a really powerful moment in the film.Shyamalan surprisingly did a very good job directing this film. He gives this film a slow, unsettling mood and it makes the film all the more engaging and interesting as it makes it feel very unpredictable. He used a lot of takes that go on for a really long time and that really helps you get into what the actors are saying for some reason. But one minor thing that bugged me about his direction was his constant use of upside- down shots. I don't know, I just found them sort of distracting.Overall, the unique mythology, fascinating philosophy, solid acting, and engaging direction all add up to one of the most captivating superhero films ever made. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 February 2014","score":"","review":" Superhero movies, what can you say about them?

Running into strife, paying off some gambling debts to Porky, the Angel Beach guys, looking older (though they we're old in their parts to begin with, but back then you could get away with it) try to reason out a deal with their arch nemeses, none too happy to see them, after their last encounter. Though still having it's moments, this pic has outworn it's welcome, the actors still giving their all, and staying true to their characters, a new hot chick popping up in this, with big, you know, part of our undersexed Pee Wee's dreams that became a triumphant reality, in the end. Too, Ballbreaker and the Angel Beach gang finally make a truce. You can't be angry forever. There are some quite familiar scenes, like Pee Wee's morning, 'Mum walking in' routine, plus another revenge from the boys in relation to Porky's business when Meat is kidnapped. He is forced to marry Porky's daughter who makes her pops good looking, and as you can guess, Meat, has a complete different agenda. Pee Wee is again made a brunt of the guy's remarks, pranks, one backfiring. The soundtrack among excerpts of other fifties tracks, High School Nights rocks. Not a disappointing effort, this Porky's I still quite like, but there's a time where you have to quit. Enough is enough. This will still go down as a hit with most Porky's fans, although, story wise it was a bit thin, I mean gambling debts. Trivia note. Flipper's Sandy (Luke Halpin) was the scuba technical adviser on this movie, oh how he's career changed.

In this third movie in the National Lampoon Vacation film series, Clark and his family have one entertaining disaster after another. Clark's wish to have a small family party ends with a full house of bickering family members, pets and even the SWAT team.John Hughes brings another hilarious comedy to the big screen. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold accompanied by new actors as their children, Rusty (Johnny Galecki) and Audrey (Juliette Lewis).The movie begins with Clark and family going to a Christmas tree forest and ends up with Clark drag racing a beat up truck and ending up wedged under a semi. When the family finally decides on the perfect tree, they realize they have forgotten the chainsaw. The tree they choose is way longer than their car and still attached to its roots.The movie gets funnier when Cousin Eddie and family show up in a beat up RV expecting to spend Christmas with Clark. Eddie decides to empty his RV waste into the neighborhood drainpipe which leads to several explosions throughout the movie.The sledding scene with Chevy Chase is the most memorable in the movie. Clark oils his sled and takes a wild ride through the roads and forest to end up in a Wal-Mart parking lot unhurt.Chevy Chase carries the film with his comical delivery. His facial expressions and crazed actions keep the audience entertained. Mae Questal as senile Aunt Bethany keeps the audience laughing with her confused actions and comments. The scenery includes real life images. The plot keeps the movie interesting and the audience wondering what will happen next.This movie is nearly perfect and I would give it a 9. The only thing I would improve upon is having Clark's boss undergo more of a fight over the missing Christmas bonus instead of just giving in and adding twenty percent to Clark's bonus.
