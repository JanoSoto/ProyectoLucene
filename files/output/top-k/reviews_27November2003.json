It starts out very good and right on target, but towards the last 45 minutes the film loses not only all credibility, but also all sense of cohesiveness. It's as if the writer wrote himself into a wall and tried to cut through it with a spoon. I'm not sure if that analogy was any good, but it's a bit better than the end of the movie.Of course, I haven't seen the original Oscar-winning Arthur (1981), which may be a part of the reason I enjoyed the first half of Arthur 2 (1988). I still remember when I first saw The Fly--I had read all the positive reviews, I was really pumped up and after the credits started to roll I just sort of sat back and let out a sigh. But I had already seen its sequel, aptly named The Fly II, and I had enjoyed it. Why? Because prior expectations can truly ruin a great movie. If I had gone into The Fly expecting nothing, I probably would have come out of it satisfied. But, in hindsight, I expected too much. And I hadn't expected anything going into The Fly II, which may amount to why I prefer it to the first film, despite its goofy nature and campy effects.Maybe that's why Arthur 2 On the Rocks didn't seem so bad when I watched it. I didn't find a single positive review of the film on the Internet. IMDb's average user rating is currently 3.6, and a year ago it was lower. Rotten Tomatoes' rating is 0%, with not a single positive thing to say. And I can understand why people might not like this movie, but if they think it's one of the worst films of all time...they've got another thing coming.Arthur and his wife, Linda (Liza Minneli), are living freely. They own five homes in and around New York City, and Arthur's only worry in life is that he may get some. Linda, on the other hand, has a single worry she can't have children, and she wants some. So they visit an adoption agency downtown, run by Mrs. Canby (Kathy Bates), who promises she'll do her best to fix them up with a kid. Joy!But then Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliot) buys out Arthur's family company, promising to sell out if Arthur is cut off from the family fortune -- all 750,000,000 dollars. Johnson's scheming is because he wants his daughter, Susan (Cynthia Sikes), to be happy -- and she still wants to marry Arthur. If Arthur divorces his true love, Linda, and marries Johnson's snobby daughter, he can get his money back. But soon Arthur learns that money isn't the most important thing in life.This is an interesting premise, of course, but the fact that the entire character of Arthur is one built upon the sole theory that there's nothing to worry about in life is contradictory. If Arthur were a television show, it would have been a decent half hour of laughs to see him hit the streets in an attempt to sober up. But as a 107-minute film, Arthur 2's premise just isn't Arthur, as far as I can tell. At the end, Arthur cleans up and gets sober, and -- without spoiling how -- wins the day (like there were any doubts as to whether that would happen). But the lasting image of a sober Arthur is far from the central idea of the character in the first place.And I must complain about something else I noticed -- something more disturbing than anything else in the film. At the very end, Kathy Bates delivers an adopted baby to the couple as they reunite on the street, only for Linda to announce on the spot that she's pregnant. Wouldn't Mrs. Canby (Bates) take the baby back and give her (the baby, that is) to a couple that can't have children? No, she just smiles and stands back from the scene. This is an example of poor scriptwriting. Arthur 2 On the Rocks is a hilarious film in its first half, and a bumbling message-driven snoozer in its second. If only all comedies could sustain laughs at a steady pace throughout.

While agreeing with both former and latter, those labels shouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. Director Doug Liman (Swingers, The Bourne Identity) doesn't shy away from the non-linear interweaving approach to plotting, ala Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, with Go adding plenty of new flavor using elements of both realism and formalism to the classic narrative style.There are plenty of locations, acting and perspectives in Go with both filming styles spilled all over it. Many of the scenes take place in normal households, apartments, or parking lots, supermarket break-rooms even. The whole second third of the film is a road movie, venturing from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in a drop of a dime (this would parallel with Swingers as well as Pulp's Travolta\/Thurman experience). Many of the characters, while all attractive to the screen, and well known on the scale of their late evening television spots, perform how teens would act (no pun intended) under uncomforting circumstances. There's plenty of modesty fished around every sequence, perhaps with the exception of Marcus' (Taye Diggs) `tantric' lovemaking.Go is shot into three different character perspectives Ronna, Simon, and Adam & Zack. Each plot sequence has its own camera biases, making multiple viewing not only a must but a warm welcome. Unfortunately, Go has a habit of branching out too far the two ex-convicted gay actors don't seem important enough for us to care about their `quality' time spent with the ubiquitous P.O. and his seductive wife. Go also stumbles onto other pitfalls. Some moments in the Las Vegas-edged second sequence should read Stop. Though primarily entertaining, the act runs through a line of plot holes and lack of strong characters. Breckin Meyer is unquestionably hilarious again (think Road Trip), yet his over-the-top `ghetto' whiteboy is as clichéd as the strip club baboons that go on to pursue him and his pals.Sarah Polley makes the best of her hollow character, Ronna, exacting herself with the brinks of desperation. The story sets Ronna into a drug-deal gone sour; a `wrong place, wrong time' situation that tags along Claire-maybe the depicted hero of this film for merely keeping composure. Claire, much like Katie Holmes' `Joey' on Dawson's Creek, looks for the best in others that even include p*ssed-off-turned-empathized-drug-dealer Todd Gaines (Timothy Olyphant). Is Claire truly the narrator of Go? Is this film subjected to her point of view? Although debatable, it is Claire, in spite of all this, that doesn't have her own `sequence' as hers picks up where Adam and Zack's ended.If not for the constant Pulp-comparisons, Go could definitely be defined as a cult-classic in that it stays within that `underground' feel, despite having a Hollywood director and `hot' young stars. Perhaps the problem with Go is that it's probably `too cool' for its own good (i.e. following Tarantino). Doug Liman does brilliantly construct the worst-case scenarios of the storyline for the beginning and end (you'll notice how odd the Las Vegas getaway ends up being the best-possible scenario for its characters). Liman placed more emphasis into the drug-dealing and drug-taking aspects of the story than a highly Hollywood-esque Vegas trip; after all, the four boys involved weren't the drug dealers and aside from a little post-wedding hemp, they weren't the ones doing the heavy stuff.

There's plenty of modesty fished around every sequence, perhaps with the exception of Marcus' (Taye Diggs) `tantric' lovemaking.Go is shot into three different character perspectives Ronna, Simon, and Adam & Zack. Each plot sequence has its own camera biases, making multiple viewing not only a must but a warm welcome. Unfortunately, Go has a habit of branching out too far the two ex-convicted gay actors don't seem important enough for us to care about their `quality' time spent with the ubiquitous P.O. and his seductive wife. Go also stumbles onto other pitfalls. Some moments in the Las Vegas-edged second sequence should read Stop. Though primarily entertaining, the act runs through a line of plot holes and lack of strong characters. Breckin Meyer is unquestionably hilarious again (think Road Trip), yet his over-the-top `ghetto' whiteboy is as clichéd as the strip club baboons that go on to pursue him and his pals.Sarah Polley makes the best of her hollow character, Ronna, exacting herself with the brinks of desperation. The story sets Ronna into a drug-deal gone sour; a `wrong place, wrong time' situation that tags along Claire-maybe the depicted hero of this film for merely keeping composure. Claire, much like Katie Holmes' `Joey' on Dawson's Creek, looks for the best in others that even include p*ssed-off-turned-empathized-drug-dealer Todd Gaines (Timothy Olyphant). Is Claire truly the narrator of Go? Is this film subjected to her point of view? Although debatable, it is Claire, in spite of all this, that doesn't have her own `sequence' as hers picks up where Adam and Zack's ended.If not for the constant Pulp-comparisons, Go could definitely be defined as a cult-classic in that it stays within that `underground' feel, despite having a Hollywood director and `hot' young stars. Perhaps the problem with Go is that it's probably `too cool' for its own good (i.e. following Tarantino). Doug Liman does brilliantly construct the worst-case scenarios of the storyline for the beginning and end (you'll notice how odd the Las Vegas getaway ends up being the best-possible scenario for its characters). Liman placed more emphasis into the drug-dealing and drug-taking aspects of the story than a highly Hollywood-esque Vegas trip; after all, the four boys involved weren't the drug dealers and aside from a little post-wedding hemp, they weren't the ones doing the heavy stuff. Culture definitely influences what's important in Go.3.5\/5 stars  ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"27 November 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  What a real disappointment movie from John Woo.

One theory is called deconstructionism, in which it is stated that language as a whole is slippery and unstable, forever contradicting itself, falling in on itself, and revealing its binary oppositions, the polar opposites of life. Light\/dark, happy\/sad, etc. In other words, each text, when deconstructed, has not one meaning, not even two meanings. But multiple meanings depending on the reader. Language is always changing, shifting meanings. A kaleidescope of interpretations. The reason I have gone into all this, is because it's very relevant to the study and understanding of why Gus Van Sant decided to remake Hitchcock's classic. Since the 1960s, so much has changed socially, culturally, and in other ways of interpreting situations, people, words, innuendoes. And within an art form such as film, it's very intriguing to explore this dynamic to its potential. And it's something you don't see done very much at all, which is why I believe people were so weirded out by the approach to remake, shot for shot, Psycho, including using the original script. This aspect especially is the most intriguing to observe same dialogue, same story, same setting, same characters, but DIFFERENT actors, which means altogether different interpretations, different approaches. The best example is Julianne Moore's portrayal of Lila Crane watch Vera Mile's very good performance, and then turn around and watch Julianne Moore say the same exact lines, but bring to it a whole other attitude sexually, aggressively, even politically. Julianne Moore decided to play her Lila Crane as a lesbian, and even though this was not a significant aspect of her character - at least to the extent of making it verbally known - it is an underlying layer that completely spins the character on its head, reversing its role in the film completely. She's much more aggressive, which actually makes more sense given the things she does once she's at the Bates Motel peering boldly into the cabin her sister stayed in when Bates is right behind her, going into the Bates house and stepping right into almost guaranteed danger with Norman right upstairs, etc. While Vera Miles did an excellent job, it's not as believable within her interpretation of the character that she would do all those things. With Julianne Moore's bold, sharp, confrontational Lila, it's much more plausible. That is just one example of how the remake of Psycho offers a whole new insight into a classic story, giving it wholly new undertones to today's societal climate. Certain lines that, because of today's poltical correctness, take on whole other context within the scene; the very nature of the character of Marion Crane and her death - in the early 60s it was much more of a shock that a woman would steal, leave her job, to run off, UNMARRIED. But now it's not such a shock, which then leaves the question, is her seemingly punishable death as shocking now? Maybe so. And the masturbation Van Sant added shows the psychology of Norman Bates as soon as the thrill has left him after orgasm, he's left with the shock and shame that he gave into his desires, which propells him into Mother Mode, killing the object of his forbidden, suppressed desires. These are just some examples of how the remake of Psycho makes perfect and creative sense, and how it should have been much more exciting to artists, who should have realized the thrill in reinterpreting a work of art that takes a great story and gives it whole new meanings. There are so many possibilities within this method, stylistically and story-wise. It just seems to me that most audiences missed the point.

He goes to a catholic school but definitely does not behave like a good catholic. He hangs out with his friends Mickey (Mark Wahlberg), Neutron (Patrick McGaw) and Pedro (James Madio) and they like to experiment with popping pills and using inhalants. In his spare time Jim writes in his diary about his everyday events and the people in his life. One night while partying with some rich girls he experiments with cocaine for the first time and it doesn't take long before he is using hardcore drugs on a daily basis. During a game Jim passes out and his coach Swifty (Bruno Kirby) kicks him off the team and he and Mickey quit school. Jim's mother (Lorraine Bracco) can't deal with him in this state and kicks him out of their home so now he is living on the streets with Mickey. They rob stores and steal cars to feed their habit until Jim is passed out in the snow. A friend named Reggie (Ernie Hudson) finds him and takes him back to his apartment where he forces Jim to quit cold turkey. After a rocky ordeal for a few days Jim sneaks out and meets Mickey where they try and score in a park. They get ripped off and chase the dealer to the top of a building and during a scuffle with Mickey he is pushed over the edge where he falls and dies. After getting beaten up by the locals in the neighborhood Mickey is hauled off by the police. Jim heads to his mothers and begs for money but she doesn't give him any and the police later catch up with him there. This film is directed by Scott Kalvert who is making his debut in feature films and the only thing he had directed before this was the video The Marky Mark Workout and at times while watching this film I had the notion that the material may be over his head. At times this film does have a strong visual style but as a director his storytelling is pretty basic. This is your familiar story about someone getting involved with drugs and it doesn't really offer anything that you haven't seen in other films about this subject.

Don't get me wrong, its great if he can stop individuals from entering a life of hell but for most of us that sort of information is unnecessary and it certainly doesn't equate into a good film. Kalvert does do one thing correctly that enhances the film, he allows DiCaprio the freedom to submerge himself into this character and the camera at times lingers on his face as he wallows in his grotesque state. Some have said that DiCaprio is miscast but I disagree. DiCaprio with his youthful appearance was certainly believable as a teenager and this is a very strong performance. The scene where he is crying by the front door begging for money from his mother is one that is not quickly forgotten. Juliette Lewis has a small role as the hooker Diane and she is also pretty good. I think they're are much better films dealing with this subject and even though I can't really recommend it I do think that the performance of DiCaprio would be the only reason that curious viewers might want to check it out.

Kalvert does do one thing correctly that enhances the film, he allows DiCaprio the freedom to submerge himself into this character and the camera at times lingers on his face as he wallows in his grotesque state. Some have said that DiCaprio is miscast but I disagree. DiCaprio with his youthful appearance was certainly believable as a teenager and this is a very strong performance. The scene where he is crying by the front door begging for money from his mother is one that is not quickly forgotten. Juliette Lewis has a small role as the hooker Diane and she is also pretty good. I think they're are much better films dealing with this subject and even though I can't really recommend it I do think that the performance of DiCaprio would be the only reason that curious viewers might want to check it out.

This movie is the story of two characters, Neal Page (Steve Martin) and Del Griffith (John Candy) who meet coincidentally while Neal is struggling to catch a cab for a 6pm flight in New York City, just days before Thanksgiving. Del ended up getting the cab and, with a layover at the airport, they reunite when they discover they were both trying to catch the same flight.      Going from a layover to a cancellation from snow, they're forced to stay in the city until the next available flight. Del notifies Neal that he should probably make reservations at a motel and promises he'll hook him up with a room in the same motel that he'll be checking in at.     When they show up at the motel, there's only one room left, so they ended up having to share.      This comedic drama is carried on throughout the movie, while this odd couple tries to find a way back home before Thanksgiving dinner.Planes, Trains and Automobiles was overall a great comedy that had good humor and just the right amount of comical tension\/build up to make the movie extremely enjoyable.      The rating for this movie is R, signifying that this movie may not be appropriate for audiences under the age of 17, which is, infact, true in this case.      One of the only inappropriate aspects, but a large one, is the language. If you take offence to crude language, this movie isn't for you.

Luckily, the cuts and alterations that he has made do little damage to the old Shakesperean chestnut. I wouldn't say that any of the tweaks are particularly for the better, but the essence of Shakespeare's tale of envy, jealousy and deceit is so powerful that it would take a bungling fool - an Ed Wood wannabe, for instance - to rob it of its power. The weighty themes shine through as strongly as ever in this latest presentation. Laurence Fishburne plays the titular character, a renowned Moorish soldier. His courage has impressed young Venetian lady Desdemona (Irene Jacob) and the pair of them secretly marry. However, her father is displeased by this secret ceremony and he warns Othello that if she can deceive her own father then she may one day do the same to him. One of Othello's soldiers, Iago (Kenneth Branagh) fails to get a promotion of rank which he feels he deserves, and to gain revenge he engineers a series of lies and incidents designed to convince Othello that his wife is being disloyal to him by fornicating with another man. Inevitably, viewers may find themselves comparing this version with other productions. How does it rank alongside the 1952 Orson Welles version and the 1965 Laurence Olivier one? To be honest, it depends upon the viewer. Purists would probably opt for the Olivier offering, since it is only very slightly abridged and contains such strong performances that all four lead actors earned Oscar nominations. Film buffs might go for the Welles version, with its moody b&w lighting and a now-classic murder scene, not to mention the fact that the production history itself is as fascinating as the story. This version will undoubtedly find favour with viewers more inclined towards modern tastes. It has high production values, a sweeping score, accessible delivery of the lines, flashy photography, and cool stylistic touches (Fishburne's head tattoo, for instance).

This is the first movie in a long time where i've not found myself looking at how long there is left about half way through. I didn't want it to end, and now its over i have this lingering affection for it. I knew this would be a beautiful movie, no matter the outcome, when Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino) lets his newly hired assistant Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnel) know, as they sit at a lush meal, in an expensive restaurant, where they came from their hotel, the Walforf-Astoria, that while they are in New York, Slade plans to drive a ferrari, sleep with a beautiful woman, and lay down on his bed and blow his brains out.This is a movie about what there is to love in life - what reasons there are to live. And for Colonel Slade, above all things, that is making love to a woman - and a distant second, driving a ferrari.Feminists may find themselves uncomfortable when seeing this movie - because it indulges in a traditional stereotype of women, putting them up on a pedestal, so that they're so special they can not even be spoken to as a man can speak to a man. In many ways (contrary to what you might think) this is a man's picture. Its about the brotherhood between men, where the highest virtue is integrity; and its about man's love of women. In fact, women only pop up in this picture to serve the needs of the male characters, and the male scriptwriters. The most memorable of these cameos, of course, is Gabrielle Anwar, in the magestic (and famous) tango sequence. It surprised me that Anwar didn't return, until i realised that she was only there to dance with Slade, and what was important was the relationship between Slade and Simms.So although this movie is very much about men, and is very old-fashioned in its value system, it is these things in an affectionate way. Since women consider this a chick flick (i think), then perhaps they like the way they look through men's eyes?In any case, this is a special movie, which leaves you with a lingering feeling for it.

I knew this would be a beautiful movie, no matter the outcome, when Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino) lets his newly hired assistant Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnel) know, as they sit at a lush meal, in an expensive restaurant, where they came from their hotel, the Walforf-Astoria, that while they are in New York, Slade plans to drive a ferrari, sleep with a beautiful woman, and lay down on his bed and blow his brains out.This is a movie about what there is to love in life - what reasons there are to live. And for Colonel Slade, above all things, that is making love to a woman - and a distant second, driving a ferrari.Feminists may find themselves uncomfortable when seeing this movie - because it indulges in a traditional stereotype of women, putting them up on a pedestal, so that they're so special they can not even be spoken to as a man can speak to a man. In many ways (contrary to what you might think) this is a man's picture. Its about the brotherhood between men, where the highest virtue is integrity; and its about man's love of women. In fact, women only pop up in this picture to serve the needs of the male characters, and the male scriptwriters. The most memorable of these cameos, of course, is Gabrielle Anwar, in the magestic (and famous) tango sequence. It surprised me that Anwar didn't return, until i realised that she was only there to dance with Slade, and what was important was the relationship between Slade and Simms.So although this movie is very much about men, and is very old-fashioned in its value system, it is these things in an affectionate way. Since women consider this a chick flick (i think), then perhaps they like the way they look through men's eyes?In any case, this is a special movie, which leaves you with a lingering feeling for it.

The depictions of Appalacian poverty in coal mining towns are dead on, and solidly grounds this film.

This notion is parallel to that of Alfred Hitchcock a director who merely used his big name actors (e.g. James Stewart, Cary Grant) to draw people toward his films, a brilliant stunt if there ever was. Like the auteur Hitchcock, Joel and Ethan Coen apply their signature through their own particular themes and styles. Typical Coen trademarks include wacky characters with even wackier circumstances, complex narratives, and of course, malicious criminals. The use of dialogue throughout their flicks is sharp and witty, and the cinematography is usually astounding. Like all formalists, style to the Coens is very important. Luckily for them, their actors have been excellent too.While the Coens have been sticking to their guns with the right team to emulate their indigenous southern players (John Goodman, John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, etc.), the end result lies in the view that stresses the dominance of the director. This view is the auteur theory whoever controls the mise en scene is the true `author' of a movie (Giannetti, 305). Mise en scene is the medium of the story. Many elements strike across this medium throughout Coen films, beginning initially with quirky, eccentric characters.With a commonly esoteric, well-read audience, many will claim Ethan and Joel to be elitists of sorts, holding them to their own acidic mockery of both white-trash (Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski) and white-collared foolishness (Barton Fink, Oh Brother Where Art Thou), with characters emulating intellectual superiorities. The Big Lebowski's the Dude recurs various dream sequences any time he's cold-cocked by incriminating visitors, or whenever he enters his own `acid-flashback' state of mind. Like the fate of these dreams, meticulous camera angles focus on the fate of the individuals.Dialogue to the Coens is so important, perhaps so debatable to say that it's the very element that links and ties the entire story of The Big Lebowski together. Each character in Lebowski follows their own rules of dialogue Walter (John Goodman) ties everything back to Vietnam; Donny (Buscemi) does nothing but appear to be confused and behind in conversations the others are spewing back and forth. For example, the Dude (Jeff Bridges at his best) and Walter are exasperated about the Dude's missing car, yet Donny is still hung up on why there is underwear in the briefcase and not the one million dollars that are supposed to exchange. Even in a smaller role, the dedicated assistant to Jeffrey `The Big' Lebowski, Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman) never breaks from his `Smithers' personality (using the Simpsons' analogy, Brandt obeys to every request). Finally, the Dude incorporates tidbits from previously encountered conversations into new dialogues later in the film `This aggression will not stand,' `We're gonna cut your Johnson off, Larry,' and many more.Technical aspects in Coen projects-a Joel specialty, as Ethan is more the writer-employ much intimacy towards the characters, in order for the usual black humor to work. Even in extremely violent situations (and there are a lot of them), camera angles and particular framing allow scenes to become flat-out hilarious. Characters are always framed in a way that the viewer can anticipate that something God-awful is going to happen. When the Dude first enters his house alone, the camera aims down on the poor guy just before his face is flushed down the toilet and almighty carpet is soiled on. This type of anticipation makes this sequences a lot funnier than the usual `pop out of nowhere' scams we see in much horror and crime-drama today.Another important element to the Coen's filmmaking is the use of cinematography with rather `obscure' environments. Even when characters are not isolated throughout many of the Coen brothers' films, inner solitude is still apparent. This notion might only contradict with The Big Lebowski's closeness in its framing. The film just screams, `This is the Dude and his simplicity.' The varying close-ups indicate that The Big Lebowski might not be `the big Lebowski' we might think. Other formalist elements include a plethora of jump cuts that often signify cliffhangers concluding jokes.When you think Coen, you probably don't think sound. However, their soundtracks often tell a lot more than even the characters do. Who can forget Credence Clearwater Revival's `dude dude dude' (okay so it's `doo doo doo') when The Big Lebowki's Dude shoots from a former-fundamentalist to California, err, Dude?An auteur is not known for his or her consistency; heck, even critics will tell you that not all of French New Wave was good. The Coens' Miller's Crossing, Raising Arizona, Fargo, and Oh Brother Where Art Thou are all huge hits with critics; yet The Hudsucker Proxy, Big Lebowski, and Blood Simple, likewise, all have had their cynics (their not-so-talked-about films such as The Man Who Wasn't There and Barton Fink are cult classics.). Perhaps this case of hit-and-miss is so mightily apparent due to the Coen brothers revolving their films around witty dialogue and style (almost nominated for a Best Screenplay or Best Cinematography whenever dropping a film), and not the extensiveness of character development.The struggle between becoming a great auteur and shooting for a Hollywood hit is a debate that now has become more visible with the release of Intolerable Cruelty. The film stars an ensemble Hollywood cast, including huge stars Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas and an again-used Clooney, and even employs the use of a little romantic-comedy flair absent from previous Coen independents. Can the Coen brothers be deemed for films much to the liking of an Alfred Hitchcock who's acclaimed for using `style over substance'? After all, an auteur figure is one who adds his own personal touch to his art. The Coens' make great art look black, much to the humor that has helped separate these two directors from any other-independent or Hollywood notwithstanding.4\/5 stars  ","genre":null},{"date":"27 November 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Movies from the Coen brothers hardly ever circle around its stars-even when they feature George Clooney.

This notion is parallel to that of Alfred Hitchcock a director who merely used his big name actors (e.g. James Stewart, Cary Grant) to draw people toward his films, a brilliant stunt if there ever was. Like the auteur Hitchcock, Joel and Ethan Coen apply their signature through their own particular themes and styles. Typical Coen trademarks include wacky characters with even wackier circumstances, complex narratives, and of course, malicious criminals. The use of dialogue throughout their flicks is sharp and witty, and the cinematography is usually astounding. Like all formalists, style to the Coens is very important.
