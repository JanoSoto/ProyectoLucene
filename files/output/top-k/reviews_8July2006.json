[{"date":"8 July 2006","score":"","review":" Originally saw this in the cinema on release and went along because (a) my buddy Gary thought it would be good (b) it had Edward Norton in it. I didn't really get the whole poker thing at the time,and as I now am a big fan of Texas Hold 'Em, thought I should re-watch it.The movie begins with us meeting Mike (Damon), a young, cocky poker player. He thinks he's in for the win of his life until Teddy KGB (Malkovich) beats him heads up and takes the whole pot. Devastated and emotionally destroyed, he decides to quit and put his focus into his law studies. Things get shaken up though when Mike's best friend and poker buddy, Worm (Norton), gets released from prison. Worm is a card shark and uses every trick in the book and looks for every sucker he can to win. As soon as he's released from prison Worm has a game set up. He begs Mike to come play with him but Mike refuses (or does he?). When Worm gets some old debts called in and is back up to his old tricks, Mike has decide whether to get back to help him out or to break the friendship before he gets dragged back in.The poker in the game is good, but the movie is about far more than that. It brings up lots of questions- how many times do we forgive those around us, how far should you go to help a friend, redemption, generosity.... a lot more than you'd expect from a poker movie.Easily re-watchable and there's something in it for everyone, even non-poker fans. Plus it's a great way to scrub up on poker terminology. Great script, great cast. Thumbs up.

I was about 8 years in 1963 old when I first saw this movie with my family at the big Cinerama, with its giant curved screen and an actual intermission (the DVD contains the intermission). It really left an impression on me. The cast is what really makes IAMMMMW great. Even the bit parts are are played by will-known comedians, such as Don Knotts as a bumbling motorist. This movie has it all... Suspense, drama, slapstick (sorry, no nudity, bad language, or adult situations). There is some violence, but it's all in fun. I can't think of a movie made since, or before, which has the star quality of IAMMMMW. It's difficult to say whether viewers younger than about 40 can really understand the importance of this epic, since they don't see the cast as giants of their time. This movie was originally filmed on 70mm Cinerama film, and it shows. This movie needs to be in the top 5 of best movies. If you haven't seen this movie, do it. If you have seen it, enjoy it again.

These words are sung by Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra), who promises his tough gang of New York high rollers that his floating crap game shall live on, especially now that the highly respected big-city gambler Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) has just arrived in town. When the two high rollers meet up, they just cannot resist placing a bet on anything imaginable. Complicating their lives are the romantic interests of Sky with a straight-laced missionary (Jean Simmons) and Nathan with a nightclub singer (Vivian Blaine), and both of these respectable women want absolutely nothing to do with gambling. Such is the plot for Guys and Dolls, a very colorful MGM musical with a fine cast of characters. Frank Sinatra's vocalizations are top-notch as usual, and even though many will claim that Marlon Brando cannot sing, I personally feel he vocalizes quite well in this picture. Not to mention the heavyset Stubby Kaye as the friendly & harmless Nicely-Nicely Johnson, and B.S. Pully & Sheldon Leonard as the two toughest gamblers in the bunch, respectively Big Jule & Harry the Horse.For myself, the main highlights of Guys and Dolls are primarily the musical numbers. The opening song, Fugue for Tinhorns, indicates a conflict between racehorse pickers Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Benny Southstreet (Johnny Silver), and Rusty Charlie (Dan Dayton). The musical crap shoot in the sewer is very lively and exciting what with all the fine choreography. Adelaide's Lament is perhaps the greatest show-stopper for Miss Adelaide (Blaine). The patriotic song The Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in New York is sung by Nathan, Benny, Nicely, and a bunch of other barbershop employees & customers praising good old reliable Nathan. The tune If I Were a Bell, well performed by Sarah Brown (Simmons), later became a jazz standard. The title song Guys and Dolls is well executed by Nathan, Benny, and Nicely. Nathan sings a beautiful romantic number, simply titled Adelaide, in Mindy's Restaurant as all the New York gamblers celebrate the fact that Nathan shall finally marry Miss Adelaide after a fourteen-year engagement. And finally, Nicely is best featured in the song at the midnight prayer meeting, titled Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat. Guys and Dolls was originally a musical play, and this might be the major contributing factor as to why certain folks do not appreciate the movie quite as much. As of this writing, I have never seen the play, but it is my understanding that a few of the musical numbers from the play have been deleted from the movie, including one particular song sung by Sarah & Adelaide titled Marry the Man Today; in the movie, Sarah & Adelaide do not even meet, nor do they exchange even one line of dialogue during the joint wedding at the end, their only scene together in the film. In addition, by the time the film reaches its midpoint, in which Sky takes Sarah to Havana on a bet, it tends to bog down a little. But, with all that aside, Guys and Dolls has quite a bit to offer. Romance, funny dialogue, lively choreography, vocalizations of swell musical numbers, they're all intact! I therefore recommend that you enjoy this picture for what it is, a lavish & colorful musical.
