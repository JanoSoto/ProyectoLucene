The film starts out with a blistering collection of clips played over music from the band X. Many interviews with bands and punker's that offer an enlightening perspective as to what surviving was like on the low rung of the mainstream rock ladder. No internet, crappy jobs, and all out hostility collide in this genre. At some point later in the decade the emphatic singer from the drumside Phil Collins recorded a song that may have been written about Germs singer Darby Crash, the hook of the song goes I cant dance, i cant talk, the only thing about me is the way i walk which sums up Crash's performance here and on into infinitum perfectly. Forget about Keith Richards and f#*k AXL, Darby was for real and lived every moment like he was falling down an elevator shaft drunk. He really cant dance or talk or walk or fry an egg, he, in my mind is the perennial rock god, not afraid of what happens later, only thoroughly confused at the now. For new kids who haven't heard of these bands or are just starting one themselves this movie is a true lesson in how to rock. All the band performances (and there are many) are awesome, especially FEAR who never cease to amaze me. This and the second installment are amazing time capsules offering those who care a rare glimpse into the lives of these crazy people. It's true punk, like in the interview with Darby Crash's girlfriend when their recalling a painter who mysteriously\/suddenly died outside their house and it took a week or so for them to figure it out, they take pictures next to the guy and everyone including the EMT's had a chuckle on this one, and in true form the interviewer asks the girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy had died while painting their house, the response no i hate painters. How about Black Flag renting their apartment\/rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month! My jaw almost fell off at that moment seeing as i'm renting a ten by ten closet to practice in for 400. Between watching this and Deadwood i feel like i was born in the wrong time period, just missing those cowboy days and nights of the old way.

It really doesn't have much originality to it and the movie 'borrows' its elements heavily from other genre movies. Yet the movie manages to not become the standard average horror movie that we've seen so often this modern day and time. The movie is less exploitation like than normal horror flicks and it doesn't feed on its scare or gory moments. The approach works rather original but of course it also makes the movie less exciting and takes away lot of the tension of it all. So its strongest point also becomes a weak point for this movie.Guess that most horror fans will still be disappointed with this movie overall. The movie just doesn't handle its horror elements very well and the movie made me think about how director Victor Salva just doesn't seem suitable enough for the genre. It had a rather good and potential scary premise and it does have a good killer in it but it just doesn't know how to handle it right. The killer, or monster as you will, gets featured quite a lot and is shown fully on screen, which just makes him less scary after a while. Also its story doesn't help much to make him a real good scary horror character. It's pretty silly how he lets the two main characters live throughout the movie, despite his obvious superior physical skills. He could had killed them at basically every given moment throughout the movie, without them ever knowing what hit them.It's atmosphere is also constantly too dark, at least during its second halve.

Austen, Dickens, the Bronte sisters, Wells and Verne will always be what they are regardless of how many films are made of their work. Gone with the Wind is a rare exception &#x96; a best-selling and critically acclaimed book upon release, and yet the name and the story now belong firmly to the motion picture tradition.When you look at Gone with the Wind, in particular its heroine Scarlett O'Hara, it's sometimes hard to fathom its appeal. It is essentially the story of bull-headed individualism in the face of social catastrophe. But if there was ever an attempt to make bull-headed individualism look romantic, this was it. Gone with the Wind is not, as so many film noirs of the next decade would be, a misogynist mope about the men ruined by such a self-centred woman, but neither is it a feminist glorification of the strong-willed woman. I think its impact lies in that it is really two stories &#x96; the tragic depiction of a vanishing way of life, told through the eyes of someone who cares only for herself. The one offsets the other, and gives the whole some kind of honesty.After that, it all comes down to the gloss and polish of David O. Selznick's production. There's no shame in this, any more than there is in making a painting or piece of music a work of beauty, and besides Gone with the Wind is the kind of lily that can withstand a substantial amount of gilding. Probably the most special thing about the way the picture is done is its cinematography &#x96; an absolutely magnificent job by Ernest Haller and Ray Renehan. Painting is an apt metaphor here. The tones and compositions are reminiscent of fine artists such as Auguste Renoir (especially at the Twelve Oaks barbecue), with some nods here and there to Renaissance art as well. There is also some excellent use of silhouettes, creating those now-iconic images at key moments, and demonstrating just how much that errant lock of hair can add to Clark Gable's allure.Which brings us onto the actors&#x85; Despite the hoo-hah over casting, a lot of the performers were simply ticking boxes &#x96; Mr Gable and Hattie McDaniel in particular. But this does not diminish their efforts. McDaniel was always a talented actress, she just needed a role big enough to show it. Yes, she plays a stereotype, but the beauty of the performance is that she brings intelligence, wit and humanity to the surface through the stereotype. As for Ashley, I would prefer to have seen Melyvn Douglas in the role. Leslie Howard is a good actor but his physique is too willowy, and he is far too English. However, no-one could have guessed the British background of Vivien Leigh (except possibly Henry Higgins, but he's fictional). Her southern belle authenticity is quite incredible, given how rare it was back then for players to become so immersed in character, and also given that her normal speaking voice made the queen sound common. I would say though that purely as a performance it is merely good rather than outstanding. It is really just 95% sulks and hissy-fits, but she at least nails all the right emotions and even manages to make us sympathise with Scarlett.Gone with the Wind was famously troubled by directors coming and going &#x96; which is always great for confounding the auteur theorists, not that many of them would touch this movie with a 10-foot pole in the first place. The thing is, it really doesn't harm the production. George Cukor and Victor Fleming may have been total opposites in personality (an urbane homosexual and a rugged outdoorsman), but their shooting styles were very similar. Both used a lot of movement, of the camera and within the frame, to give atmosphere and dynamism to the scene, and both gave their actors a lot of coaching. The difference with Fleming is that, despite being the ultimate man's man, probably had enough of the no-nonsense attitude to coax out the shrewishness in Scarlett. He certainly brings Scarlett's personality to the quality of the image, with the quick dolly-in that introduces her character, the general bustle in background and foreground, people walking and talking at the same time &#x96; all of which are Fleming trademarks. It's as if Scarlett's flighty, haughty, teenage persona has coloured the whole world around her, and it's a very effective way to open the movie, engaging us immediately.The funny thing is, that despite it being a colossal cultural event in its time, and holding its box-office record for over thirty years, Gone with the Wind has since been surpassed in popularity by its contemporary The Wizard of Oz. And even though it is still a highly regarded classic, it is probably now remembered more than it is enjoyed. The truth is, Gone with the Wind was very much a wonder of its age &#x96; a work of unprecedented lavishness and a herald of maturity in the motion picture. Whereas The Wizard of Oz, Mr Smith Goes to Washington, Ninotchka and many other hits of 1939 were simply great pictures of their day which can speak to people of any place or time, Gone with the Wind was a great phenomenon which meant something to a generation, but is now just a pretty-looking melodrama.

And even though it is still a highly regarded classic, it is probably now remembered more than it is enjoyed. The truth is, Gone with the Wind was very much a wonder of its age &#x96; a work of unprecedented lavishness and a herald of maturity in the motion picture. Whereas The Wizard of Oz, Mr Smith Goes to Washington, Ninotchka and many other hits of 1939 were simply great pictures of their day which can speak to people of any place or time, Gone with the Wind was a great phenomenon which meant something to a generation, but is now just a pretty-looking melodrama. ","genre":"Drama, History, Romance"},{"date":"24 March 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Normally when a classic novel is adapted to the screen, the novel still remains definitive. Austen, Dickens, the Bronte sisters, Wells and Verne will always be what they are regardless of how many films are made of their work. Gone with the Wind is a rare exception &#x96; a best-selling and critically acclaimed book upon release, and yet the name and the story now belong firmly to the motion picture tradition.When you look at Gone with the Wind, in particular its heroine Scarlett O'Hara, it's sometimes hard to fathom its appeal. It is essentially the story of bull-headed individualism in the face of social catastrophe. But if there was ever an attempt to make bull-headed individualism look romantic, this was it. Gone with the Wind is not, as so many film noirs of the next decade would be, a misogynist mope about the men ruined by such a self-centred woman, but neither is it a feminist glorification of the strong-willed woman. I think its impact lies in that it is really two stories &#x96; the tragic depiction of a vanishing way of life, told through the eyes of someone who cares only for herself. The one offsets the other, and gives the whole some kind of honesty.After that, it all comes down to the gloss and polish of David O. Selznick's production. There's no shame in this, any more than there is in making a painting or piece of music a work of beauty, and besides Gone with the Wind is the kind of lily that can withstand a substantial amount of gilding. Probably the most special thing about the way the picture is done is its cinematography &#x96; an absolutely magnificent job by Ernest Haller and Ray Renehan. Painting is an apt metaphor here. The tones and compositions are reminiscent of fine artists such as Auguste Renoir (especially at the Twelve Oaks barbecue), with some nods here and there to Renaissance art as well. There is also some excellent use of silhouettes, creating those now-iconic images at key moments, and demonstrating just how much that errant lock of hair can add to Clark Gable's allure.Which brings us onto the actors&#x85; Despite the hoo-hah over casting, a lot of the performers were simply ticking boxes &#x96; Mr Gable and Hattie McDaniel in particular. But this does not diminish their efforts. McDaniel was always a talented actress, she just needed a role big enough to show it. Yes, she plays a stereotype, but the beauty of the performance is that she brings intelligence, wit and humanity to the surface through the stereotype. As for Ashley, I would prefer to have seen Melyvn Douglas in the role. Leslie Howard is a good actor but his physique is too willowy, and he is far too English. However, no-one could have guessed the British background of Vivien Leigh (except possibly Henry Higgins, but he's fictional). Her southern belle authenticity is quite incredible, given how rare it was back then for players to become so immersed in character, and also given that her normal speaking voice made the queen sound common. I would say though that purely as a performance it is merely good rather than outstanding. It is really just 95% sulks and hissy-fits, but she at least nails all the right emotions and even manages to make us sympathise with Scarlett.Gone with the Wind was famously troubled by directors coming and going &#x96; which is always great for confounding the auteur theorists, not that many of them would touch this movie with a 10-foot pole in the first place. The thing is, it really doesn't harm the production. George Cukor and Victor Fleming may have been total opposites in personality (an urbane homosexual and a rugged outdoorsman), but their shooting styles were very similar. Both used a lot of movement, of the camera and within the frame, to give atmosphere and dynamism to the scene, and both gave their actors a lot of coaching. The difference with Fleming is that, despite being the ultimate man's man, probably had enough of the no-nonsense attitude to coax out the shrewishness in Scarlett.

Therefore, despite what some seem to think, it is not really a remake of the 1963 film. I myself have not read the novel, so I cannot tell you how closely this follows it. I have seen the original film, but a while back. I seem to recall enjoying the movie, but not the ending. I was always a Happy Ending kind of guy.But this review isn't about those stories; it's about this one. So here goesFirst we are introduced to Miss Eleanor Nell Vance; a mousy, yet good-hearted caregiver. She receives a call from a Doctor David Marrow(Or is it?), who invites her out to Hill House, the estate of the late Hugh Crane, to assist in a study on what he claims to be Insomnia Research. He pays 900 dollars a week, plus room and board. She accepts (I would too) and journeys to the manor itself. Quite a home. The exterior of the mansion was Harlaxton Manor. The interior was most likely sound stages, for it was a bit too creepy to be real. What with spikes hanging over the bed and all.Nell meets the caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, played by Bruce Dern (The 'burbs), and Marian Seldes (Tom and Huck, Home Alone 3). Mrs. Dudley gives Nell a lengthy explanation about just exactly how alone her and her fellow research subjects will be. I don't stay after dinner. Not after it begins to get dark. We live in town, nine miles, so there won't be anyone around if you need help, we couldn't even hear you. No one could. No one lives any nearer than town; no one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark. She ignores this not-so-subtle B-movie hint, of course. If she didn't, there would be no movie.Next she meets Theodora Theo. (I don't remember her last name. She might not even have one.) Theo is a gaudy, brazen, bisexual cosmo girl, who is apparently attracted to Nell. (In spite of what some think, there was no deleted love scene, just a slightly sensual scene leaving Theo's attraction to Nell undeniable. Read the script for further info.) Next comes Luke Sanderson, the boyish cynic with the dry wit. And finally, Dr. Marrow. After dinner, some drinks, and a bedtime story involving the house's haunted past, Marrow explains his goal OK, so why are we here? Probably to answer the most basic question What is wrong with you people? After a pretty much unnecessary scene where Marrow's assistant gets slashed with a piano wire, and taken to a hospital, never to be heard from, or of, again, we descend into the pit of Hell, I mean Hill, House, and watch as the main characters get chased by ghosts, spooked by specters, and haunted by haunts. Think 'The Haunted Mansion'. But, we mainly get barraged by some of ILM's special effects. Which are quite good, I think. Scenes that stand out for me include a ghostly scene involving a ghost traveling through and under a bed sheet and curtains (you really have to see it), and scenes with hands reaching out of walls. (Those are always cool) And, of course, a breathing ceiling.When I started watching, I thought to myself Jerry Goldsmith would be perfect for this movie. To my pleasant, he did compose the music. What more can I say. It's awesome. The sound effects are also very good; a 5.1 speaker viewing is recommended.The movie's errors lie in the screenplay itself, which is plagued with plot holes and corny lines.

Maybe even more than Leone's other Westerns, all visually stunning and brutal masterpieces, Once Upon A Time in the West shows the old West from in its most brutal and most beautiful side. Leone's fourth Western in often compared to opera, and these comparisons are well founded. Visually overwhelming from start to finish, Once Upon a Time in the West comes along with what is positively the most brilliant of Ennio Morricone's magnificent film scores; a score that overwhelms. Listening to Morricone's music alone is capable of building up suspense, even if it's listened to out of context. Maybe more than anything else, it is this score by the positively greatest film composer who ever lived, that carries the film and makes it the unforgettable experience it is.Once Upon a Time in the West is a film that uniquely takes time in order to build up tension. The opening sequence alone is a unique piece of art the likes of which are very seldom in cinema. I do not wish to go too deeply into detail about the story, as this fantastic experience should be experienced rather than read by anyone who hasn't seen it (if there still is somebody out there who hasn't). As much as it is a film about the Old West, Once Upon a Time in the West is also a film about the end of the Old West, the triumph of capitalism over the 'pioneer spirit'. The film begins with the brutal massacre of a family over a piece of land, which becomes the object of desire for a murderous villain (Henry Fonda), a bandit leader (Jason Robards) a vengeful gunman with a Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and a ravishing beauty (Claudia Cardinale).The film casts Hollywood's best, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson are all at top of their game, this positively being the greatest film either man has starred in. Robards is fantastic as the rough-and-ready desperado Cheyenne, Fonda is gloriously devilish as the villainous Frank, and Bronson, one of my personal favorite actors, is unforgettable as the vengeful Harmonica. All three characters rank among the most memorable ones in cinema, all three actors deliver outstanding performances. As fantastic as these three brilliant actors are, there is one person who steals the show In over a century of cinema, there have been countless beautiful, sexy, ravishing actresses in seductive, charming, fascinating roles. It is a rare actress and role, however, whose beauty is so overwhelming that it makes the viewer fall in love with her at the very second of her appearance. This is the case with Claudia Cardinale in Once Upon a time in the West. Doubtlessly one of the most ravishing women who ever blessed the screen, Cardinale plays Jill, who is angel, femme fatale and hooker with a heart of gold all in one, and who brings out the most lovable, most intriguing and most erotic side of either of these traditional female roles. Cardinale isn't simply beautiful in this film; she is a goddess, who will immediately turn every male viewer into a lovesick teenage boy. Without displaying explicit nudity, Clauida Cardinale's Jill is one of the most erotic roles ever in any film. It is impossible to watch this film and not fall in love with her.The supporting cast includes many fantastic actors such as Woody Strode, Lionel Stander, Jack Elam ad Frank Wolff. All cast members fit perfectly in their roles.The locations and cinematography are overwhelming, unlike Leone's Dollar Trilogy which had been shot in the Spanish Almeria desert (as many other Spaghetti Westerns), Once Upon a Time in the West was mainly shot in Arizona.As mentioned above, Once Upon a Time in the West is a film that overwhelms in all aspects, be it Leone's unique talent to build up tension, the phenomenal photography and rough beauty of the landscapes, the incredibly compelling story, the brilliantly drawn characters or the incredible score by Ennio Morricone &#x96; there simply isn't the tiniest aspect about Once Upon a Time in the West that is not absolutely brilliant.The Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns have been personal all-time favorites of mine ever since childhood, and it is impossible to say which one is the best. To me, it's either The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or this one, these two films being my choices for the greatest Westerns ever made. They are doubtlessly also two of the greatest films ever made, regardless of genre. I could go on for a long time doing nothing but praising this masterpiece, but it would all come down to the same point Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the greatest, most essential films ever made, and nobody who hasn't seen it is yet a true film fan.

There are Westerns that every film fan should see. And then there are the chosen few that everybody MUST see. Sergio Leone's quintessential Italian Westerns doubtlessly belong to that latter category, and C'era Una Volta Il West aka. Once Upon a Time In the West (1968) in particular is a masterpiece that no one even remotely interested in the art of motion pictures could possibly consider missing. Along with Leone's earlier masterpiece Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo aka. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), this is arguably one of the two most brilliant and overwhelming Westerns ever made.There are countless reasons why this masterpiece must be seen by anyone interested in cinema, but I shall stick to the most obvious ones Co-scripted by Bernardo Bertolucci and the later Horror-master Dario Argento (who is a personal god of mine), Once Upon a time in the West is absolutely overwhelming in all regards, be it story-wise, stylistically or visually. Maybe even more than Leone's other Westerns, all visually stunning and brutal masterpieces, Once Upon A Time in the West shows the old West from in its most brutal and most beautiful side. Leone's fourth Western in often compared to opera, and these comparisons are well founded. Visually overwhelming from start to finish, Once Upon a Time in the West comes along with what is positively the most brilliant of Ennio Morricone's magnificent film scores; a score that overwhelms. Listening to Morricone's music alone is capable of building up suspense, even if it's listened to out of context. Maybe more than anything else, it is this score by the positively greatest film composer who ever lived, that carries the film and makes it the unforgettable experience it is.Once Upon a Time in the West is a film that uniquely takes time in order to build up tension. The opening sequence alone is a unique piece of art the likes of which are very seldom in cinema. I do not wish to go too deeply into detail about the story, as this fantastic experience should be experienced rather than read by anyone who hasn't seen it (if there still is somebody out there who hasn't). As much as it is a film about the Old West, Once Upon a Time in the West is also a film about the end of the Old West, the triumph of capitalism over the 'pioneer spirit'. The film begins with the brutal massacre of a family over a piece of land, which becomes the object of desire for a murderous villain (Henry Fonda), a bandit leader (Jason Robards) a vengeful gunman with a Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and a ravishing beauty (Claudia Cardinale).The film casts Hollywood's best, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson are all at top of their game, this positively being the greatest film either man has starred in. Robards is fantastic as the rough-and-ready desperado Cheyenne, Fonda is gloriously devilish as the villainous Frank, and Bronson, one of my personal favorite actors, is unforgettable as the vengeful Harmonica. All three characters rank among the most memorable ones in cinema, all three actors deliver outstanding performances. As fantastic as these three brilliant actors are, there is one person who steals the show In over a century of cinema, there have been countless beautiful, sexy, ravishing actresses in seductive, charming, fascinating roles. It is a rare actress and role, however, whose beauty is so overwhelming that it makes the viewer fall in love with her at the very second of her appearance. This is the case with Claudia Cardinale in Once Upon a time in the West. Doubtlessly one of the most ravishing women who ever blessed the screen, Cardinale plays Jill, who is angel, femme fatale and hooker with a heart of gold all in one, and who brings out the most lovable, most intriguing and most erotic side of either of these traditional female roles. Cardinale isn't simply beautiful in this film; she is a goddess, who will immediately turn every male viewer into a lovesick teenage boy. Without displaying explicit nudity, Clauida Cardinale's Jill is one of the most erotic roles ever in any film.

For this one, they took a 19th century story and incorporated the Muppets into it, just like they did with the first 90's movie featuring the famous puppet performers. The Muppet Christmas Carol is an adaptation of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens and Muppet Treasure Island is an adaptation of Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. I didn't see this film in the theatre, but first saw it around the time it was released on VHS later in 1996, and remember seeing it more than once in the 90's. I watched it for the first time in many years in 2007, and again three years later. I still think it's a good comedy adventure after these two viewings.Jim Hawkins is the orphaned son of a former first mate. He lives a dull life, working for a hot-tempered boss named Mrs. Bluveridge at an inn with Gonzo and Rizzo. Jim and the two Muppets live off table scraps. Billy Bones is an ex-pirate who lives at this inn and has a treasure map hidden away. After a pirate named Blind Pew comes and gives Billy a black spot, meaning the pirates are coming to kill him tonight, he plans to flee, but has a heart attack! Just before he dies, he tells Jim to take the map and to beware of the one-legged man! Pirates then come and invade the inn, and the place is soon set on fire, so Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo all leave with the treasure map and set out to a nearby town. This is where they meet the half-witted son of Squire Trelawney (Fozzie Bear) and convince him to fund a voyage to find the treasure. They set out on a ship with Captain Smollet (Kermit the Frog), First Mate Samuel Arrow (Sam the Eagle), and many others. The cook on this ship is Long John Silver, a seemingly friendly man who has only one leg, which means that he could be the one Billy Bones was talking about! The opening sequence features the first song in the film, Shiver My Timbers. I really liked this song as a kid and still do. It's an intense tune with a great melody. The film then goes from there to the inn, and there certainly are funny moments here. Gonzo and Rizzo, the first two Muppets that appear in the film, are definitely a part of the humour, and it helps that Billy Bones is played by Billy Connolly, a talented comedian. It also isn't long before the story gets exciting. After Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo leave the inn, more Muppets soon appear, starting with Fozzie Bear as Squire Trelawney's son, who soon mentions Mr. Bimble, an imaginary man who lives in his finger. Even though this is very silly, it still made me laugh. As usual, the Muppets generally don't fail to provide laughs, and while most of the characters in the film are played by Muppets, there are some played by on screen actors other than Connolly. Tim Curry really stands out as Long John Silver. In addition to the humour, characters, and performances, this is also a movie with a lot of excitement and very impressive visuals. Most of the songs are not great, unlike the first one, but none of them are that bad. Also, the humour may get a BIT kiddish at times, the Mr. Bimble jokes may not always be that funny, and I didn't care much for certain moments in the movie with Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn, but other than that, there really aren't too many problems I can think of.This was the Muppets' last feature film before Muppets From Space, their sixth film, which was released three years after this one. The only time I've even seen that 1999 film was in 2008, and I remember finding it kind of hard to believe that came only three years after Muppet Treasure Island. Now that I've seen the other five theatrical Muppet movies again since seeing the 1999 effort, I honestly think that's the only bad one! Unlike the rest of them, I really thought it wasn't that funny and was also too dark for the Muppets.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"24 March 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Casablanca director Michael Curtiz made another classic melodrama with Mildred Pierce, and actress Joan Crawford scored a major comeback with this tour-de-force soap opera about the rise and fall of a woman as an entrepreneur. Crawford had been dumped by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and picked up by Warner Brothers where she loitered for a couple of years before she found precisely the kind of role that she felt was ideal for her. Initially, Curtiz wanted nothing to do with the high-handed Crawford with her padded shoulders. The Hungarian-born workalcoholic Curtiz originally sought Barbara Stanwyck for the lead role, but he changed his mind about Crawford when he observed her aggressive work ethic. Indeed, Mildred Pierce represents Crawford at her zenith, and she won her one and only Best Actress Oscar. Warner Brothers surrounded Crawford with a sterling cast including Anne Blyth as her snotty, stuck-up daughter Veda, Jack Carson as the fast-talking Wally Fay, and Zachary Scott as a dissolute womanizer with a closet filled with swim suits belonging to his many sisters. The theme of mother versus daughter stands above all others in this woman's film that depicts a woman struggling to succeed in life without a man and raise two daughters. At the same time, the theme of women versus men hovers in the background. Just as Mildred seems doomed to be a bad mother because she indulges her arrogant daughter's every whim, Mildred achieves no success with the men in her life. Zachary Scott is simply brilliant as a worthless playboy type who preys on Mildred like a leech and eventually robs her of every dime. Cast as Monte Beragon, Scott not only takes Mildred to the cleaners, he takes advantage of Veda. Hollywood made several movies about tempestuous mother and daughter relationships, among them the Bette Davis soaper Now, Voyager, but Mildred Pierce ranks as the most memorable. Producer Jerry Wald convinced studio boss Jack Warner to buy the rights to James M. Cain's novel, but the writers had to eliminate much of the sexual content because the Production Code Administration prohibited the kind of behavior that Cain portrayed in his book. Such had been the case with previous cinematic adaptations of Cain's work, including Double Indemnity (1944) and later The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946).Warner Brothers released Mildred Pierce in 1945, less than a year after World War II ended. Although there are many references to the war in the film, such as Monte's crack about nylons being out when he pays a spot inspection visit to Mildred's diner, the filmmakers never make any overt references to the war. The setting is clearly in the early 1940s while the Allies were fighting the Axis Powers. Never do we see any servicemen in uniform wander through the mise-en-scene. Essentially, Mildred Pierce qualifies as a film noir. Curtiz shoots virtually everything with shadows and the plot focuses on the death of a major character at the outset of the action. Curtiz loved to tell stories in flashback and his Humphrey Bogart World War II thriller Passage to Marseille is related in flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks. Mildred Pierce isn't as convoluted as the Bogart film and the mystery about who murdered Monte Beragon is what drives this black & white film forward. After the opening sequence when unsavory Monte is shot and killed in cold blood at his house, the plot reverts to the past as Mildred recounts her life story to a detective. We learn that the marriage between Mildred and her real estate salesman husband Bert (for U.S. Olympic shot-put champ Bruce Bennett) is not congenial. Mildred lives and breathes to please her two daughters, Kay (Jo Ann Marlowe of Dangerous Intruder) and Veda (Ann Blyth of Brute Force), but she concentrates on Veda, at the expense of Kay. Sadly, nothing that Mildred does for Veda ever pleases Veda and Veda winds up making life hell for Mildred. Mildred usurps her role as a wife and Bert grows sick of her and has an affair with Mrs. Maggie Biederhof (Lee Patrick of The Maltese Falcon) that leads to his divorce from Mildred. Mildred strikes out on her own, reflecting the success that women achieved in the workplace since most men had been mobilized for the work effort. Indeed, Mildred becomes a seeming success story over night, owning and managing a franchise of restaurants with the help of her right-hand girl, Ida Corwin (Eva Arden of The Doughgirls), who delivers the choicest wisecracks. At one point, Ida observes about her relationships with men When men get around me, they get allergic to wedding rings. Later, she adds about the opposite sex Oh, men. I never yet met one of them that didn't have the instincts of a heel. Sometimes I wish I could get along without them. Altogether, Mildred tries to act as the mother and the father and she winds up failing miserably. Daughter Veda emerges as a villainous of the worst sort and her comeuppance is something that you enjoy watching her get. Mildred Pierce emerges as a very atmospheric movie and Curtiz never wears out his welcome, even when he shifts back and forth in time. For the record, there was no murder in the novel, but it occupies the centerpiece of Mildred Pierce and all the characters swirl around it. Mildred Pierce is a brilliant example of top-notch film-making. Don't miss it.

Crawford had been dumped by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and picked up by Warner Brothers where she loitered for a couple of years before she found precisely the kind of role that she felt was ideal for her. Initially, Curtiz wanted nothing to do with the high-handed Crawford with her padded shoulders. The Hungarian-born workalcoholic Curtiz originally sought Barbara Stanwyck for the lead role, but he changed his mind about Crawford when he observed her aggressive work ethic. Indeed, Mildred Pierce represents Crawford at her zenith, and she won her one and only Best Actress Oscar. Warner Brothers surrounded Crawford with a sterling cast including Anne Blyth as her snotty, stuck-up daughter Veda, Jack Carson as the fast-talking Wally Fay, and Zachary Scott as a dissolute womanizer with a closet filled with swim suits belonging to his many sisters. The theme of mother versus daughter stands above all others in this woman's film that depicts a woman struggling to succeed in life without a man and raise two daughters. At the same time, the theme of women versus men hovers in the background. Just as Mildred seems doomed to be a bad mother because she indulges her arrogant daughter's every whim, Mildred achieves no success with the men in her life. Zachary Scott is simply brilliant as a worthless playboy type who preys on Mildred like a leech and eventually robs her of every dime. Cast as Monte Beragon, Scott not only takes Mildred to the cleaners, he takes advantage of Veda. Hollywood made several movies about tempestuous mother and daughter relationships, among them the Bette Davis soaper Now, Voyager, but Mildred Pierce ranks as the most memorable. Producer Jerry Wald convinced studio boss Jack Warner to buy the rights to James M.

Such had been the case with previous cinematic adaptations of Cain's work, including Double Indemnity (1944) and later The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946).Warner Brothers released Mildred Pierce in 1945, less than a year after World War II ended.

I've seen it dozens of times, as a play on Broadway, and as a TV pilot with an excellent cast that sadly didn't sell. It is probably one of the most quotable films ever made. The movie was even a major plot device in one of the most popular episodes of Designing Women, which is ironic considering that much later Delta Burke of DW appeared in SM on Broadway.This is an ensemble piece of the highest proportions. If you were to ask any person to name a movie where ensemble is the keyword, Steel Magnolias would probably rank in the top ten. The major character is Julia Roberts' Shelby, but she is really supporting. It is her life that is the glue that holds all of these people together. Shelby gets married, Shelby has a baby, Shelby gets ill, etc. But it is each of the other characters who put the outside pieces together of this beautifully written Southern poem. Mama M'Linn (Sally Field, whose presence indicates the lead) is a mother hen, gentle and loving in every way, but strong and resistant. (In other words, a Steel Magnolia). When tragedy hits her family, it is her friends who come flocking together to help M'Linn deal with it. They are grouchy Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine at her most eccentric), good-hearted Truvy (the wonderful Dolly Parton, whom Designing Women focused their hour long episode around), bashful Annelle (an understated Darryl Hannah) and most outrageously, the cheerfully wisecracking Eve Arden of the group, Clairee (Olympia Dukakis). Unlike the play, men are included, and amongst them are Dylan McDermott as Roberts' hubby to be, Tom Skerritt as Fields' rascal husband and Sam Shepard as Parton's distant spouse.The men are there, but it is the women that the film concentrates on. There are also a few other women around in smaller roles, most notably Ann Wedgeworth as McDermott's aunt and Porkys vet Nancy Parsons (Gym teacher Ms. Ballbricker) as the physically wounded Janice Van Meeter, a victim of a collision with a baseball. Looks like two pigs fightin' under a blanket, Dukakis quips while watching Parsons dance at a wedding reception. (For the record, Parsons was a fine character actress who had only a few opportunities to shine in films; Like the equally stout Shirley Stoler, she could infuse even her nastiest characters with something memorable.) Everybody has great moments, but it seems that most people particularly remember Dukakis and MacLaine's teaming. Yes, they definitely steal every magnolia scene they are in. They are the Lucy\/Ethel, Laverne\/Shirley, Cybil\/Mary Anne. At times they are also a Paul Lynde\/Charles Nelson Reilly combo. (Yes, those two did work together.) For the TV pilot, it was Polly Bergen and Elaine Stritch, two Follies girls makin' with the cracks, and in the Broadway production I saw, it was Frances Sternhagen and Marsha Mason. (I must say that I originally thought of the actors cast in the opposite role in that production, but Ms. Sternhagen was a delightful Clairee who knew how to make each moment she was on stage count. It's ironic to see MacLaine supporting a mother in distress after being the mother in distress in 1983's brilliant Terms of Endearment. After her triumph as Cher's wise mother in Moonstruck and a few years before her outstanding portrayal of Anna Madrigal in Tales of the City, Dukakis scored this film role which became the final nail in the proof that she was indeed the best not-so-newcomer finding success in middle age even though she was already one of the most respected actresses in the theater. Like her SM successor Frances Sternhagen, Dukakis is capable of winning laughs and stealing scenes with just a rise of her eyebrow. Up against that, how can Parton and Hannah hold up? They do just fine, but I think they were probably resigned to the fact that opposite that pair, they'd be all but forgotten. Indeed, they are excellent. They have equally great lines Parton's line about one relative not knowing whether to scratch their watch or wind their behind is a gem, as is Hannah's delivery of the simple line about not letting her personal tragedy get in the middle of her doing good hair. Field gets the real chance to bite into the acting apple as she continues to hold in her grief through each of her sadness's until like a volcano, she builds up and explodes. She is excellent and missed out on a third Oscar Nomination. Check out her physical reaction when, after emotionally blowing up, she witnesses Dukakis's response to the whole scene. It's so filled with spontaneity and realism, and it is priceless. That brings me to Julia Roberts, here a novice in a group full of vets. She scores wonderfully and probably is the least showy. That's probably why the Oscars gave her a nod for Supporting Actress. It's understated and simple, yet filled with humanity, strength, and a quiet acceptance of a fate she can't escape. Stage acting can be big, but successful film acting for the most part meshes all of those qualities together to really touch the heart. While I would choose Dukakis for Supporting Actress, I can see why they nominated Roberts and not the rest of the fine cast. Bill McCutcheon is amusing as MacLaine's old beau who pops up, and Skerritt is funny as M'Linn's scoundrel husband who loves harassing the grouchy Ouiser. But to wrap things up in this long review, I can state that you don't have to be female, Southern, or gay to really get into these women's passionate friendship. The film is sumptuously filmed and features a beautiful musical score that is as touching as the friendship these ladies share. It is obvious that the tales several of these stars have told about making this film (Parton, MacLaine and Dukakis) that they loved working with each other. They should again.

When tragedy hits her family, it is her friends who come flocking together to help M'Linn deal with it. They are grouchy Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine at her most eccentric), good-hearted Truvy (the wonderful Dolly Parton, whom Designing Women focused their hour long episode around), bashful Annelle (an understated Darryl Hannah) and most outrageously, the cheerfully wisecracking Eve Arden of the group, Clairee (Olympia Dukakis). Unlike the play, men are included, and amongst them are Dylan McDermott as Roberts' hubby to be, Tom Skerritt as Fields' rascal husband and Sam Shepard as Parton's distant spouse.The men are there, but it is the women that the film concentrates on. There are also a few other women around in smaller roles, most notably Ann Wedgeworth as McDermott's aunt and Porkys vet Nancy Parsons (Gym teacher Ms. Ballbricker) as the physically wounded Janice Van Meeter, a victim of a collision with a baseball. Looks like two pigs fightin' under a blanket, Dukakis quips while watching Parsons dance at a wedding reception. (For the record, Parsons was a fine character actress who had only a few opportunities to shine in films; Like the equally stout Shirley Stoler, she could infuse even her nastiest characters with something memorable.) Everybody has great moments, but it seems that most people particularly remember Dukakis and MacLaine's teaming. Yes, they definitely steal every magnolia scene they are in. They are the Lucy\/Ethel, Laverne\/Shirley, Cybil\/Mary Anne. At times they are also a Paul Lynde\/Charles Nelson Reilly combo. (Yes, those two did work together.) For the TV pilot, it was Polly Bergen and Elaine Stritch, two Follies girls makin' with the cracks, and in the Broadway production I saw, it was Frances Sternhagen and Marsha Mason. (I must say that I originally thought of the actors cast in the opposite role in that production, but Ms. Sternhagen was a delightful Clairee who knew how to make each moment she was on stage count. It's ironic to see MacLaine supporting a mother in distress after being the mother in distress in 1983's brilliant Terms of Endearment. After her triumph as Cher's wise mother in Moonstruck and a few years before her outstanding portrayal of Anna Madrigal in Tales of the City, Dukakis scored this film role which became the final nail in the proof that she was indeed the best not-so-newcomer finding success in middle age even though she was already one of the most respected actresses in the theater. Like her SM successor Frances Sternhagen, Dukakis is capable of winning laughs and stealing scenes with just a rise of her eyebrow. Up against that, how can Parton and Hannah hold up? They do just fine, but I think they were probably resigned to the fact that opposite that pair, they'd be all but forgotten. Indeed, they are excellent. They have equally great lines Parton's line about one relative not knowing whether to scratch their watch or wind their behind is a gem, as is Hannah's delivery of the simple line about not letting her personal tragedy get in the middle of her doing good hair. Field gets the real chance to bite into the acting apple as she continues to hold in her grief through each of her sadness's until like a volcano, she builds up and explodes. She is excellent and missed out on a third Oscar Nomination. Check out her physical reaction when, after emotionally blowing up, she witnesses Dukakis's response to the whole scene. It's so filled with spontaneity and realism, and it is priceless. That brings me to Julia Roberts, here a novice in a group full of vets. She scores wonderfully and probably is the least showy. That's probably why the Oscars gave her a nod for Supporting Actress. It's understated and simple, yet filled with humanity, strength, and a quiet acceptance of a fate she can't escape. Stage acting can be big, but successful film acting for the most part meshes all of those qualities together to really touch the heart. While I would choose Dukakis for Supporting Actress, I can see why they nominated Roberts and not the rest of the fine cast. Bill McCutcheon is amusing as MacLaine's old beau who pops up, and Skerritt is funny as M'Linn's scoundrel husband who loves harassing the grouchy Ouiser. But to wrap things up in this long review, I can state that you don't have to be female, Southern, or gay to really get into these women's passionate friendship. The film is sumptuously filmed and features a beautiful musical score that is as touching as the friendship these ladies share. It is obvious that the tales several of these stars have told about making this film (Parton, MacLaine and Dukakis) that they loved working with each other. They should again.

I had always assumed it was another musical lost in its time-- you know, one of the Jesus Christ Superstars of the day. But there's a difference Jesus Christ Superstar is sensational, electrifying, and at times riveting. Cabaret is crap-aret.Liza Minnelli is terrible at just about everything, most especially acting. She's a fair singer, but on screen she means nothing. She brings absolutely no emotional weight to the role. After seeing how well the original Sally Bowles, Jill Haworth, could act (please see Exodus), it's a freak of nature that Minnelli beat her for the role. The entire film is like a punchline and it's all because of the leading lady, who has no rightful place in popular culture except the subject of catty jokes in shows like Queer as Folk, Queer Duck, and Will & Grace. Michael York is, was, and always will be great, but Minnelli actually succeeds in dragging him down to her level. He gave a better performance in the super-camp Logan's Run, for crying out loud! The only good performance in this movie comes from Grey, who actually does astonishingly well (astonishingly considering the quality of his costars). But even his best efforts aren't enough to salvage the whole thing.As opposed to the fearlessly stylized visuals of his directorial debut, Sweet Charity, Bob Fosse under-utilizes master cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. The film has no visual scope and even the exterior scenes are so dank and so poorly constructed cinematographically that they, too, look like they were shot in someone's basement.The only good song? Mein Herr, a rare moment in Hollywood History when Minnelli's camera-centric sleazing actually works.Whatever you've heard about Cabaret from its proponents, don't listen. It'll drive you crazy. The film is terrible, visually glum and uninspired, poorly scripted, dismally acted, and shoddily slapped together, haphazard. For all the bad things people say about 1972's Man of La Mancha, it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. The worst crime of all? The awards Cabaret stole from The Godfather, a true classic of American cinema.A note about my personal tastes I *love* musicals. Seriously.

Basically identical twins Beverly and Elliot Mantle (both Jeremy Irons) are both doctors, gynaecologists, personality wise however they are most different, one is more confident than the other with women, and often manages to seduce them. When of them is bored of his current partner, Claire Niveau (Geneviève Bujold), she passes to the other brother, without her knowing that he had a brother, especially an identical twin brother. It is when Claire visits the clinic after finding out they are twins that everything starts going wrong, starting with the shy brother falling for her, and she of course can't choose between them, well, you can't when you don't know which one's which. It should be said that this film is based on a true story where in New York, Upper East Side, two twin gynaecologists were found dead, and while this story is set in Toronto, Canada, that is exactly what happens in the end. Also starring Heidi Von Palleske as Cary, Barbara Gordon as Danuta, Shirley Douglas as Laura, Stephen Lack as Anders Wolleck and Nick Nichols as Leo.
