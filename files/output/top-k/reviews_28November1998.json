[{"date":"28 November 1998","score":"","review":"  Elizabeth reminded me of what's really the best way, in my opinion, to watch a movie  don't analyze it too closely, but be sure and pay very close attention to the characters and the story.  Follow this advice and you will thoroughly enjoy this film.  It follows a young queen -- vibrantly portrayed by Cate Blanchett, who was so wonderful in Oscar and Lucinda -- as she matures from an impulsive young girl who wants to follow her heart into a strong, charismatic ruler with the courage to kill her enemies.  Joseph Fiennes smolders prettily as her only true love (don't all costume dramas require a good smolderer?); once she realizes that she can't have him, and that any other marriage she might undertake would only be for political gain, she chooses to reinvent herself as the Virgin Queen.  Lots of brutal executions, torture, battle scenes, and lots of palace intrigue, religious persecution, and debauchery... all in all, a most entertaining film centered around a riveting actress playing a fascinating woman.  Don't think too hard about whether the historical details or costumes or music are perfectly accurate... just pay attention to the story and you'll have a great time.
