It may not be a half-assed attempt to take the idea of a Hitchcock film and turn it into something more contemporary (Rear Window, A Perfect Murder), but its decisions on where to pay homage to the original and where to embark on its own decisions make the movie more choppy and awkward than it should have been. The thing I liked about the original, and still do over the new version, is that Norman Bates' character had a boyish innocence to it. Vince Vaughn turns the character into an overly moody, and somewhat agresive geek. He doesn't even seem to believe his own lines. I can't blame him totally for his off target performance since the lines, written to sound normal and like small-talk in the 60's, sound too strange and pointless. Twelve cabins, twelve vancancies. is said by Vaughn like a simple minded little boy, while Perkins actually dilivered it sounding natural and like an everyday sort of comment. The script needed more than the very few touch-ups that were applied to better explain a small amount of the points in the movie. Van Sant just couldn't decide if he was actually trying to remake the original shot-for-shot (it is up to the shower scene), or turn it into a newer story more set in today's world. My final gripe with Van Sant's version is Anne Heche. She seemed like a resonable choice for Janet Leigh's role, but she comes off stupid and like she really isn't thinking at all. Van Sant can't even pick good times to poke fun at the original. Heche's outfits for the movie are downright outrageous, and distracting. They draw so much attention to themselves that you forget that there is a story going on. I cringed thinking of the original when she pulled out an umbrella that looked like a big bright version of a decoration for a drink in a bar. The only thing that I can commend Van Sant for is that he has brought Psycho to a new generation, that although may not appreciate or have seen the original, can find a good shock from the story. It actually could have been a good film if Van Sant had decided what kind of movie he wanted to make. The new version is definitely NOT for film buffs or fans of the original Hitchcock version. However for those who can't stand the idea of watching actors from a different time or a film shot in black & white, this is a movie you should definitely see.

I was both revulsed and turned off by AR, and when I saw it again on cable recently my feelings were only confirmed.The original Alien was one of the first movies that used the doom and gloom view of the future to good effect.  Everything's dark and murky, spaceships look more like industrial waste yards, and the view of people and society is cynical.  The first few times you see it that approach is different or interesting, but now it seems every aspiring sci-fi movie uses it.  Will somebody please turn on the lights?The makes of AR forgot one key element of making this approach work is giving someone for the audience to care about.  Ripley's dead, now we have a cloned half human hybrid who spouts wonderful lines like Who do I have to f$%! to get off this ship?, a gang of smugglers who kidnapped colonists to use as hosts for the aliens, and a bunch of soldiers and scientists on the other side.  The only person in the entire movie who I cared lived or died was the poor infested colonist who ended up getting blown away as the alien was about to burst out of his chest.Sigourney Weaver overdoes her creepy hybrid human but, let's just say you can tell she was the executive producer.

I had fun watching the film, (very minor spoiler) enjoyed the added stuff in the peephole and shower scenes. But I really think the film has problems up until the car exchange scene (when Crane trys to bolt off). It just seemed kind of slow (even slower than the orig). To me many of the actors seemed like they were 'phoning in' their lines... even Macy at times! The only quality acting seemed to come from Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche as they were terrific as Bates and Crane. Vaughn did a different more child-like, giggling, hand twisting version of Norman, which was a relief as I really wanted him not to even try to touch Perkins Norman... and he really didn't, he provided us with similar yet different Norm, which I liked. Heche was very close to Janet Leigh almost down to the smallest detail, which was ok too as she was able to pull it off, and the role was fairly straight ahead to start with. The rest of the cast really could have learned their lines a bit better, and some of the pacing seemed a little odd. Macy was very good at points and not so good at others, I just couldn't stop thinking about him in Fargo, because his voice was very similar, and as we know that character was a loser.Another HUGE problem in my eyes is the fact that it was set in 1998. I really have a hard time believing that Norman Bates, a child-like loner who does very strange things to dead birds (and other things once living) is able to go to the local hip shoppe and purchase cool black 3\/4 length sleeve turtlenecks or $100 whacky pattern shirts. The only time Norm looked like Norm was when you first meet him, the next two wardrobe changes are ridiculous. Also was it just me or did everyone's wardrobe look stupid in general? I think the wardrobe folks on this pic need to re-think the way they dress actors in movies, because it really sucked. The only other problem with the fact that it's set in present day is the dialog... it really didn't sound like the kind of things people say today, except perhaps Let me get my Walkman. Should have kept it in the 60's.I guess it sounds like  I'm kind of trashing this film, but I'm not because I did enjoy it and will purchase it when it's released on DVD\/VHS, the moments where things gel in this film were great fun to watch. Hell, I had a lump in my throat while watching the reworking of the shower scene, all the way up to the submerging car in the swamp... it really worked for me.   So say what you will about this film, I still like Perkins as Norm and the orig is the ORIG, but this was fun and may get some folks interested in Hitch who may have never bothered... I know the original Psycho is what made me rent N\/NW, Rope, TMWKTM, Frenzy, Birds, Rear Window and many others by Hitch so I don't see why this movie can't do the same thing for those who have yet to have the same experience\/revelation I did fifteen or so years ago.Psycho (1998 ) ***\/**** CenobYte ","genre":null},{"date":"8 December 1998","score":"","review":" I saw Psycho 98 yesterday, and being a big fan of the original I wanted to share my thoughts with others.

Allen brilliantly focuses on four people and the people who they have relationships with, and the neurotic effects their past relationships have on them.Allen's character, Gabe, is once again falling in love with the interesting yet crazy women as he did in Stardust Memories, another often forgotten film of his. Mia Farrow, as Judy, is portrayed as a passive-aggressive shrew, or perhaps Woody Allen's perception of Mia Farrow at the time of filming. Judy Davis (Sally), in her first major Woody Allen film role, pulls a great part of the acting weight, but all of the actors including director Sydney Pollack (who plays Judy's separated husband, Jack). Other lost souls include Michael (played by Liam Neeson) who falls in love with Sally but ends up marrying Judy, Judy's ex-husband (who calls her passive-aggressive) and Gabe's student Rain, who has had three December-May relationships, by the young age of twenty who falls for the small man in the big glasses.

The comedy is lame.  The jokes are gross!  Chris Farley was not a good comedian.  All he knew how to do was use disgusting humor along with his size to make raunchy jokes. The only hope for the film is David Spade who provides some comic relief in an otherwise unfunny film.  I don't recommend this film to anyone.

I don't love it as much as the original but it is great just the same.  Michelle Pfeiffer is great as is Adrian Zmed as Johnny.  The other cast members from the original such as Didi Conn(Frenchy), Eve Arden(Principal McGee), and Dody Goodman(Blanche) are a welcome addition. The songs in this sequel are catchy and fun!  The theme is light and the overall effect is good.  I love this movie!

I like Winona Ryder and think that she is a very talented actress besides beautiful. The only part I didn't care too much about was the ending. If only the guy she ended up with looked a little younger, the one in the movie could pass for her father. I thought for sure she would end up with Eric Stoltz.
