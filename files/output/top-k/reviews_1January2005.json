And, I was not disappointed by You've Got Mail - I enjoyed it. I was able to forget about the bill collectors and how far away my family is from me and all those other worries only significant to myself. If you are a fan of the romantic comedy genre, you won't be disappointed. I do have one caveat with this film. I find it odd that Ryan's character, as a small business owner (***SPOILER*** that was eventually put out of business by the larger box store *** END SPOILER***) still bought coffee at Starbucks. I wonder how many small coffee shops 'around the corner' have been put out of business by Starbucks???

Kingsley, as usual, gives a stunningly nuanced performance, and steals the screen when he speaks. His speeches are absolutely riveting. Excellent performances as well from Sigourney Weaver and Stuart Wilson, who round out the ensemble. Wilson is a vastly under-appreciated actor who does a phenomenal job portraying a very complex set of conflicts. Good choice by Polanski. Needless to say, the real star of the film is the screenplay. It's a shame that the film wasn't made more specific in terms of which country it dealt with. Although set in countryside intended to look distinctly Chilean, the dates it deals with more closely match those of the Argentine dictatorship. The film appears to have been designed this way in order to intimate to American audiences that it could have taken place in either country, and indeed it could have; maybe the aim was to help viewers focus on the universality of the emotions and trials involved, rather than involving them with the historical specifics of one particular dictatorship. The net effect, however, is unfortunate, in that it deprives the audience of a chance to actually learn something about a hideous part of world history in which the United States was overtly complicit. By mythologizing the territory, Polanski makes it easier for the audience to walk away feeling a sense of pity and mild remorse while remaining comfortably ignorant of historical realities the details of which they may simply not care to confront. In other words, the temporal and geographic displacement of the plot makes it easy to conclude that these sorts of things happen to those people over there, but could never happen here. (How interesting it would be to remake this film now, in America, with a Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib detainee, her husband, and an DOD agent!) The movie also skirts the spurious so-called theory of two demons, that is, the fascista excuse that leftist guerrillas were equally guilty of crimes as the military. However, in so doing, it is actually simply being as apolitical as possible, and so can't really be applauded for that -- better had it addressed the issue directly when it had the chance. For a better understanding of the sociopolitical issues Death and the Maiden is really commenting on, it's well worth seeing La Historia Oficial (Argentina  1985), Imagining Argentina, (2003) and Oliver Stone's Salvador (1986), to get an idea of American involvement in the atrocities that took place in Latin America from the 1950s onward. Many books have also been written on the subject, including Fear in Chile Lives Under Pinochet (Politzer) and Pinochet's Chile An Eyewitness Report 1980\/81 (Macleod. Out of print.)
