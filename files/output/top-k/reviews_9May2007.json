It was like total recall without the virtual reality. Westworld starts out as a place that would be fun to visit, but near the end, it's like You like this place, do ya? Well, you shouldn't because this might happen!, and by this, I mean being chased by the scariest mechanical monster this side of the terminator. The film starts out a large group of people going to Delos, the most fantastic theme park in the world(In the future, unfortunately). They can chose between 3 worlds(only 3??!) Roman world, Medieval world, and West world. Personally, I'd like to see Pirate World, Egytion World, etc. But I managed.While most critics on here focus on the 2 guys played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin, I also got a taste about the unnamed old couple who couldn't decide which world to go to. She wanted Roman world and he wanted Medieval World.Ultimely, They split. Y'know if this film would focus more on them, this whole thing would be a fable telling us to be faithful to our wives(You'll have to see this to know what I mean.), but it didn't(Phew!) Meanwhile, when they're in Westworld, We not only get to see what this park has to offer(like the gunslinging' Yul Brynner.), but we get to know Benjamin and Brolins characters Ones been there before, the other's an everyman on his first trip. The whole thing goes alright; They have robot sex(what????!), kill a sheriff, and have a bar fight. Then the robots start malfunctioning and start killing everyone they see. The film's climax is a long, dialog-lacking chase with the evil android Brynner chasing Richard Benjamin all over the park, with no one to help him(I swear by the time this chase end, everyone within 100 miles are dead!) Although there are some problems with this outdated vision, and the chase goes on for too long, It's great insight into the dangers of the technological world when it's brought into something fun and exciting. It's good concept(even ripped off by Juraissci park), and a fun time, but when it ends, it shows us something that will haunt us when ever we'd go to a ghost town, scaring us to think the gunslinger would appear to hunt us down.

Unaware of his neglect, young Scotty, as too his parents, is completely oblivious to the fact that the parallel world that revolves around them is in great danger of crossing the divide of talking animals and dumb humans.Cats and Dogs is more than puppets meet Muppets; it is more than that, even though just as entertaining, it has progressed to greater levels.

It was obvious that our three leads, Spears, Saldana, and Manning, were quickly becoming strong friends &#150; and that friendship translated well onto the screen, but it was their individual stories and accomplishments that created the pain. In one scene, we saw this trio as little girls &#150; friends without a care in the world &#150; then instantly we are pushed into the awkward high school dark ages where nobody is friends with anyone. Riffs have been issued, and we are asked to rediscover who these characters are again. Matching them with their young counterparts is easy, but when their mouths open, it is another world all together. Spears leads with a hodgepodge of different characteristics. She dances sensually in her bedroom, unrobes nonchalantly in front of her lab partner, but is most avid about doing the right thing when it comes to morality and truthfulness. There is even one scene where she hangs up on her father, no doubtably instilling the correct visions into her impressionable teen fan base. She couldn't give us a straight character to save her life. Coupled with the annoying Zoe Saldana who tries the hardest of the group, but cannot seem to quite understand the life surrounding her. Then, painful to write, there is Taryn Manning (who gets better with each film) using every cliché redneck white-trash persona possible to define her character. It isn't bad enough that we have Spears fading in and out of her real character that to have Manning use y'all like it is Shakespeare &#150; yikes. Again, the acting isn't bad (I have seen far, far, far worse), but it isn't Juliard &#150; closer to flunking out of Acting 101.I have mediocre respect for director Tamra Davis. The woman that gave us the hysterical and near cult-classic Billy Madison as well as Half-Baked, has also turned out slow duds like Gun Crazy and, surprise, Crossroads. Her talent seems to be all over the place instead of choosing projects that will continue to define her. Listening to the commentary, it felt she did this to 1) work with Spears, 2) she needed the rent money, and 3) it was an all girl cast &#150; her youthfulness will be returned. Not exactly the typical reasons artist create on a blank slate. With Davis, I wanted humor, darkness, or anything that would make me remember why I loved Madison or Half-Baked' &#150; ANYTHING &#150; there was nothing. Did I expect it with Crossroads, probably not, but it would have been nice to see something that was uniquely hers. Road movies are made weekly, and it is those road films that try to bring something new to the genre that stand out and bring more to the table. Wasn't Billy Madison just a take-off of Back to School? I just question the ability of Davis without a studio baking and thankfully she has taken her raw, rotten talent to television only to further infuse the masses.We are left with nothing more than the story. What story did Crossroads tell? How about one lone girl's quest to find herself and loose her virginity? Does that sound right? Again, this wasn't rocket science writing, yet it seemed amateur from the first word. We know who Spears' love interest is going to be from the beginning, the take at the end is given away within the first twenty minutes, and the only strength to this entire film is a scene with Dan Aykroyd saying I was a Ghostbuster, a Blues Brother, and Conehead &#150; I did this film for my kids. I believe that sums up this whole story in a nutshell. Needless to say, the story lacked any depth, and there was one scene where we attempted to bring real life to the screen with a rape, an accidental death, and our old friend, underage drinking. Thankfully, Spears could push beyond all this and finally sing her songs near the end, the obvious finale to the film that was started. The ending point didn't match with the starting point in this film.So, I watched this film. Everyone will have to at one point in their life, I just shortened the inevitable. Again, it wasn't the worst film ever made, Glitter still ranks below this, but there wasn't any value in the final performance. Spears didn't push for this film to be made because she wanted to be an actress, she wanted more face time with an audience that seemed on the fence about her ability &#150; and as time has shown, we didn't make the best assumption. The acting wasn't horrible, but everything else was so we are left with a sour taste in our mouth coming from all directions. I will not, nor suggest this film to anyone except my wife, who thought it was better than Clerks II.Ouch. I will end on that note.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"},{"date":"9 May 2007","score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" To begin, because that is always a good starting point with films of this nature, I must take a step forward and say that the acting wasn't excruciating, but it was painful.

It was obvious that our three leads, Spears, Saldana, and Manning, were quickly becoming strong friends &#150; and that friendship translated well onto the screen, but it was their individual stories and accomplishments that created the pain. In one scene, we saw this trio as little girls &#150; friends without a care in the world &#150; then instantly we are pushed into the awkward high school dark ages where nobody is friends with anyone. Riffs have been issued, and we are asked to rediscover who these characters are again. Matching them with their young counterparts is easy, but when their mouths open, it is another world all together. Spears leads with a hodgepodge of different characteristics. She dances sensually in her bedroom, unrobes nonchalantly in front of her lab partner, but is most avid about doing the right thing when it comes to morality and truthfulness. There is even one scene where she hangs up on her father, no doubtably instilling the correct visions into her impressionable teen fan base. She couldn't give us a straight character to save her life. Coupled with the annoying Zoe Saldana who tries the hardest of the group, but cannot seem to quite understand the life surrounding her. Then, painful to write, there is Taryn Manning (who gets better with each film) using every cliché redneck white-trash persona possible to define her character. It isn't bad enough that we have Spears fading in and out of her real character that to have Manning use y'all like it is Shakespeare &#150; yikes. Again, the acting isn't bad (I have seen far, far, far worse), but it isn't Juliard &#150; closer to flunking out of Acting 101.I have mediocre respect for director Tamra Davis. The woman that gave us the hysterical and near cult-classic Billy Madison as well as Half-Baked, has also turned out slow duds like Gun Crazy and, surprise, Crossroads. Her talent seems to be all over the place instead of choosing projects that will continue to define her. Listening to the commentary, it felt she did this to 1) work with Spears, 2) she needed the rent money, and 3) it was an all girl cast &#150; her youthfulness will be returned. Not exactly the typical reasons artist create on a blank slate. With Davis, I wanted humor, darkness, or anything that would make me remember why I loved Madison or Half-Baked' &#150; ANYTHING &#150; there was nothing. Did I expect it with Crossroads, probably not, but it would have been nice to see something that was uniquely hers. Road movies are made weekly, and it is those road films that try to bring something new to the genre that stand out and bring more to the table. Wasn't Billy Madison just a take-off of Back to School? I just question the ability of Davis without a studio baking and thankfully she has taken her raw, rotten talent to television only to further infuse the masses.We are left with nothing more than the story. What story did Crossroads tell? How about one lone girl's quest to find herself and loose her virginity? Does that sound right? Again, this wasn't rocket science writing, yet it seemed amateur from the first word. We know who Spears' love interest is going to be from the beginning, the take at the end is given away within the first twenty minutes, and the only strength to this entire film is a scene with Dan Aykroyd saying I was a Ghostbuster, a Blues Brother, and Conehead &#150; I did this film for my kids. I believe that sums up this whole story in a nutshell. Needless to say, the story lacked any depth, and there was one scene where we attempted to bring real life to the screen with a rape, an accidental death, and our old friend, underage drinking. Thankfully, Spears could push beyond all this and finally sing her songs near the end, the obvious finale to the film that was started. The ending point didn't match with the starting point in this film.So, I watched this film. Everyone will have to at one point in their life, I just shortened the inevitable. Again, it wasn't the worst film ever made, Glitter still ranks below this, but there wasn't any value in the final performance. Spears didn't push for this film to be made because she wanted to be an actress, she wanted more face time with an audience that seemed on the fence about her ability &#150; and as time has shown, we didn't make the best assumption. The acting wasn't horrible, but everything else was so we are left with a sour taste in our mouth coming from all directions. I will not, nor suggest this film to anyone except my wife, who thought it was better than Clerks II.Ouch.

Rather impressive. Not just with that in mind, either. I will definitely have to look for other films by this man. Two of the actors featured, I knew beforehand; Dern and Rifkin. Both I have seen in recent productions, filmed beyond the beginning of the new millennium, and both clearly had talent way back when. The environmentalism is fairly obvious in this film, but I would not classify this as a film that demands or even asks us to take better care of forests and nature, in particular; it promotes life, warmth, vitality. I found it interesting to note who were the more humane and caring creatures on the ship in this film, apart from, of course, the lead. The story is quite good, and well told. The pacing is magnificent, I was not bored for a single second. The imagery is very appealing, that of nature as well as the spacecrafts. The acting is very good. The special effects look great, and hold up well. The length of the picture is just about perfect... it neither overstays its welcome nor ends too soon or too abruptly. The editing and cinematography are both nice, I can't think of a single visual in the film that should have been done differently. The two songs by Baez aren't bad, and they fit fairly well where they are used. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, especially as far as predicting what the future may hold and provoking thought and debate go. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 May 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This was Douglas Trumbull's first film as director.

I do not get the idea, but I have to admit that I indeed enjoyed both films very much.That much said, be prepared for beautifully shot scenes, spectacular fights, some interesting characters (there could have been a little enhancement in this respect, but nevertheless, the characters are strong and sound).Kudos to Joaquin Phoenix in the first place. He performs a haunted, tormented and cruel emperor you can still sometimes glimpse the human and pitiable side of, and is altogether very creepy and goes under your skin. Yes, he definitely should have gotten the Oscar. He is the only member of the cast I can not imagine to be replaceable. His interpretation of Commodus adds depth to Gladiator as otherwise it might have been just the usual the very, very, very good guy battles the bad, stupid, really bad one against all odds. Russell Crowe is a fine Maximus. He engages in some spectacular fights in and out of the arena while showing off genuine feelings and wits. The opening battle is in its genre perfect in my belief. The much disputed scenes where he is floating over the fields are a bit kitschy, a bit cheesy, but still, nice thought, and do not work that bad with the excellent music. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are both rendering great performances and contribute mainly to the authenticity (not meant in a historical sense) of the story. Why is it a problem for so many that in the end Maximus fights and kills the Emperor in the arena in a duel that never ever took or would have taken place in reality? Do not expect historical correctness or accuracy, this is not a documentary to be broadcast on National Geographic or the History Channel.

In most cases Director's Cuts ruin the original Motion Picture they set out to improve, yet this film is the exception.

Scenes are purposely slow which allows the atmosphere of the film to wash over the viewer like a warm bath rather than being bombarded by action and explosions as in the second of the Motion Picture series. There are obvious references to Stanley Kubrick's 2001A Space Odyssey (1967), which I admire because to want to aspire to those heights and nearly succeed can only be regarded with respect. I have to say that the production design by Harold Michelson has never been bettered. The scope of his sets gives real life and location to the interior of the Star Ship Enterprise. The gathering of the whole crew in the lounge for example or Kirk emotionally trapped in his quarters by the dark glass sliding doors. The bridge of the Enterprise has never looked, sounded or functioned better.

Its content does not seem to offer much to a viewer who expects something ambitious. While seeing the movie, I must admit that I felt disappointed, sometimes even angry with the whole thing; yet, I don't deny that I liked some aspects of it. What surely remained in my memory after I gave a view to STEALING BEAUTY?First, it is definitely Liv Tyler. She is beautiful and sensual in the lead. Her character of Lucy is seemingly innocent, she is called a virgin since she waits and waits patiently to find the love of her life. When we see her through the first half of the movie, we discover her, get to know her similarly as we get to know someone in real life. It's like a sort of striptease of emotions. Lucy's straightforwardness is conveyed in her love to her late mother, Sarah, who had once been to Tuscany before Lucy was born... However, her innocence is not that endless... The lusts and desires take over soon... But concerning Liv Tyler alone in this picture, she is really good and fits to the role. Unforgettable!Second, it is the dreamlike locations that you will not forget. Bertolucci, after his far away exotic movie journeys to China, Sahara Desert and Tibet, comes back to his homeland, to Italy and, more precisely to the beautiful Tuscany where, as many poets wrote, the sun shines more pleasantly, the hills bear a magical power and the people best understand the word Amore (Love). Yes, the movie can boast some romantic moments in the marvelous region with its olive trees, picturesque hills and almost heavenly colors.Third, it is for Jeremy Irons that you will not forget the film. He does a great job in the interesting and moving role of seriously ill Alex whom Lucy supplied with the incredible frivolity of the dying. Irons does his best to express the desire to live, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, a change of heart forced by his cruel destiny. Alex is one of these people whom Lucy really trusts.But that is all that talks for the movie's value. If it weren't for the three above aspects, STEALING BEAUTY would be just a sheer waste of time, a film that has nothing to offer, that carries no good message. Its content is not ambitious at all; there are chaotic moments; the action is deadly predictable; there are weak performances, including Carlo Cecchi or Sinead Cusack. I also disliked the many vulgar scenes in which everything appears to be focused on lust and no feeling. As a matter of fact, the entire movie is about sexual desire, which occurs to be provocative, tempting, vulgar, sometimes even deviated. Lucy observes the people she meets, is fascinated by their making love to one another (consider the moment she finds Niccolo with a girl in the park). The final moment is one of the most erotically detailed scenes of cinema and excuses itself by the fact that it is meant to show the first love. A 19-year old virgin who at last takes a man! It is true that it is the first time for both, Lucy and her vacation lover but it cannot be called beauty or art. The moments the youngsters smoke marijuana are also vulgar and obscure. Moreover, music is nothing special in this movie, which disappointed me keeping in mind that it could have been so great. Actually, the film is about love affairs in Tuscany...Putting it in a nutshell, STEALING BEAUTY is not a film for everyone. People who know Bertolucci will be shocked by his difference here. Ambitious viewers will find it so so just average. People who want a movie to carry a message will leave the seat in disappointment. Yet, I don't discourage you to see it.

With a simple premise setting these 13 warriors off to counter an evil force, the uninspired screenplay simply brings viewers through the tired motions. Antonio Banderas, not as bad as I thought he would be here, can still hardly do anything to rescue this methodical homage to cinematic glory days of old. He plays The 13th Warrior, a foreigner who has been chosen to accompany a rogue group of vikings on their quest to seek out and destroy this evil presence.And that, is basically as specific the will plot gets here. Banking on pricey set design and pseudo-spectacular battle sequences, the mediocre project fails because it does nothing to invest the viewer into what producers must have felt was priority here, making the entire journey feel like a few over-bloated set pieces with nary an explanation to hold the action together. Director John McTiernan, of Die Hard fame, is just not in his element here, and with careless editing, lackluster performances, and a shallow story from Michael Crichton, The 13th Warrior will be unnecessary to all but adventure film fanatics.

Antonio Banderas, not as bad as I thought he would be here, can still hardly do anything to rescue this methodical homage to cinematic glory days of old. He plays The 13th Warrior, a foreigner who has been chosen to accompany a rogue group of vikings on their quest to seek out and destroy this evil presence.And that, is basically as specific the will plot gets here. Banking on pricey set design and pseudo-spectacular battle sequences, the mediocre project fails because it does nothing to invest the viewer into what producers must have felt was priority here, making the entire journey feel like a few over-bloated set pieces with nary an explanation to hold the action together. Director John McTiernan, of Die Hard fame, is just not in his element here, and with careless editing, lackluster performances, and a shallow story from Michael Crichton, The 13th Warrior will be unnecessary to all but adventure film fanatics.

Spoiler Negatives The foremost villain was plainly stupid, except the part when he rips the victim's heart from his\/her chest. The guy look like a devilish monk. The idea about the Indian children eating monkeys and acting like savages was totally ludicrous. One stupid idea was the voodoo doll. Wassup with that! And oh my god, the actress that plays Willie! The only thing she's good for is, hmm... whine and cry every time her poor-heroic boyfriend is in danger or hurt. All she does is scream, repeatedly say Oh god! She definitely can't act! She tries too damn hard! I really wanted to throw this DVD disk at the wall because of her. Stephen Spielberg could have selected a better actress. Last but not least, the atmosphere is to light-hearted. I mean it's not realistic and it's too cartoony and elementary, despite the fact it is obviously a kid's movie. But wait isn't it? The movie has some abusive action towards children like slave drivers beating little children and well yes, the 'Indian' children are slaves. I seriously believe that India feels absolutely humiliated when this movie first came out but what I heard, India forbid this movie to show in theaters. Positives Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones) was pretty good at his role! The little kid was also great! That's mainly it. I haven't seen the other sequels just yet but I heard the others were way better than this. If this is true, this means that George Lucas lost his touch, once again. Well it is a certain that I don't like this movie very much. I did like it when i was eleven but the only thing that interest me was the ending. Now since I grew older and became more concerned and aware about the plot, graphics, and offensive stereotypes, my liking to this movie has suddenly dropped. But if you enjoy dark-adventurous, light-hearted movies well this is one of for you!

I first saw this movie when i was about nine-years-old and this was my first Star Wars and probably my first space movie I had ever watched. This movie wanted me to study astronomy; let my interest towards space to expand but that's irrelevant. I still hold this episode my third favorite under Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith. SPOILER Skip the positives and negatives please if don't want to be spoiled!Positive 1. We begin with two Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn. Qui Gon is my favorite of his character and his look. I think we all know who Obi-Wan is. They fight their way through the Droid ambush and try to infiltrate the command center to arrest the viceroy. So mainly we have a great introduction!2. Jar Jar Binks. Now I know there has been many critics about this alien but during my childhood, most of the children and i adored him when this movie first came out. He's funny and I still like his character. He was the alien that at least tried to bring some comedy into the movie. 3. Anakin Skywalker. The boy that was close to my age that was the prominent character and hero of the episode. Cut this kid some slack! He changed from a slave into a pod-racing winner and a war hero for destroying the main ship that deactivated the droids in Naboo. 4. Naboo! Ah man... I still remember the underwater city and the adventure of seeing new aquatic creatures the gigantic piranha-like fish, the Godzilla-like fish, etc. 5. Darth Sidious, alias as Senator Palpatine. His anonymous identity made us wonder who he was. He didn't do anything major in this but still he was so cool. 6. And yes who could forget Darth Maul, the only Sith warrior who used a double-bladed lightsaber and gave us a hell of an entertaining-lightsaber battle. He murdered Qui Gon and then the Obi Wan vs. Darth Maul duel was very phenomenal. Negative Okay there was some negatives1. I mainly ignored the political debate in the assembly but if viewers first watch Star Wars in this order, people will be confused of what the bureaucrats are squabbling about. 2. Jar Jar Binks. I'm not putting this because I think he's negative, I am just warning the viewers that Jar Jar does several silly things and he's illiterate. So if you get used to the comedy or simply ignore him, you'll have a great time with this movie. 3. Darth Maul didn't have a long script. He only had about three sentences to say. And I wished he didn't die at all! The way he died didn't bother me, until I saw AOTC and thought he would resurrect or survive but... 4. If I watch it again, most of the characters are bland and dull. But it's understandable if you think about it Jedi are pacifist and have broad discipline and can't feel no emotion, politicians generally are dead inside so they don't have a character of their own, and the queen's people and her planet are seized by the Trade Federation which is why she never had alternate feelings. Maybe the problem were too many serious people. Okay you got it! For the majority, many people hated and berated this movie because of Jar Jar Binks and it wasn't as the old trilogy. But what people should understand is that the prequels are for the new generation and the people that grew up with the prequels, like me... will adore the prequels more than the originals. So most of you Star Wars fans out there that love the originals, take an open mind and be comprehensive to the new Star Wars sagas. And for the rest of you that never saw Star Wars, star with number 4; it'll be more exciting that way.
