These movies are so outrageously bad that you'll enjoy them on many levels and will be quoting them probably for the rest of your life, more so than well- respected movies. But behind every disaster is a director with heart, and a cast in need of a paycheck.Call it irony, but Tim Burton assembled a fine cast of character actors and made a film about the worst director of all time and in the process spent more money than Ed Wood could ever dream of. Like Dolly Parton once said, it costs a lot of money to look this cheap. Say what you want about Ed Wood, but 50 years after his monstrosities were produced, people are still watching them. I doubt you could guarantee this longevity for The Hobbit or any of the current 40 million films that star Benadryl Cabbagepatch.Martin Landau carried away an Academy Award, as Best Supporting Actor, as did Rick Baker for his make up effects, but, even with these selling points, audiences never gave it a chance, which is a real shame because the movie needs to be seen to be believed, and for all aspiring or struggling filmmakers out there you will find many familiar problems between yourselves and Mr. Wood, regardless of your talent.Chronicling the events of the mid-Fifties, through the production of three of Wood's classic disasters, Tim Burton's biopic achieves the impossible - we side with Ed, we identify with him, we wish him and his eccentric gaggle of pals only success and happiness in his cozy little world of half-baked ideas and misguided optimism. Success eluded Wood, but he achieved a greater fame and lasting appeal beyond his short life and this eccentric movie, which will make you faceplam for most of its running time, is our portal into Wood's oddball mind.Alternately hilarious and touching, our sympathies lie with Wood and his ever loyal, declining co-star Bela Lugosi (a barely recognizable Martin Landau). Other characters pop up, including the hairy-as-hell Tor Johnson (George 'The Animal' Steele), wannabe transsexual Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), a very, very buxom Elvira-type (Lisa Marie), Criswell - the most famous predictor in the land (Jeffrey Jones), and a beleaguered Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio) - an atypical assortment of rejects, failures and weirdos.Burton is inclined to produce a flop, when he indulges too much. Just as the audiences stayed away from Mars Attacks!, they never even considered Ed Wood, because of the black-and-white photography, which was a truly inspired decision. One cannot imagine how much the movie's legitimacy would have been lessened if it was in color. I must assure you that, no matter how offbeat and strange it looks, this film is an absolute classic that begs to be seen. It may not be to everyone's taste, but it has a wicked sense of humor and is sure to have you in stitches.

Even if you are not a Monty Python cultist you must recognize that every joke in the film is a well-articulated kick up the arse to some issue. The plot outline is of the three wise men come bearing gifts to the newborn Brian thinking he is Jesus.

Right, now forget all about this plot because nearly all scenes sidetrack from the key template &#150; instead the story tips over into hilarious diversions and detours in Jerusalem. Even the opening credits do not seem to serve any purpose to the story it tells; it is a spoof of the James Bond openings with surrealistic montages and a sensual singer wailing.

It's got some of the ingredients of more than a few biker movies of the late 60s and early 70s; a small-town biker gang with plenty of nasty personalities and psyches tear ass without a moral or care in the world. But these ingredients are mixed up with much more intense chases (sometimes with cars), attitude, and an anarchic future world where there's very little control of the law and justice has to be taken personally. It's got a tinge of the revenge movie in it too, though not until later on. I knew this, of course, from having seen the Road Warrior first. That film may possibly be very slightly better, or perhaps more accomplished and more compelling, but Mad Max ends up kicking up the ante on its low-budget cred, and its star cuts his teeth in a performance that isn't too shabby at all. There's an opening that ranks with the best action sequences in the Max series, as we get introduced to the (reluctant) hero by his prowess at scaring the pants off of 'the Night Rider' into his explosive demise. Then the villains get their due along with the cops, who really don't have as much personalities or full-on attitude (unlike in the Road Warrior), but still give off enough of a vibe that can mark them as the great one-dimensional antagonists of the picture. The premise is only this- to get away from the gangs that took a fellow cop on the force, Max Rockatansky (Gibson) takes his wife and little baby out on vacation. But the gang is still about, harassing the wife, and soon it leads to a very tragic and rough scene. From then on, Max dons his full-on leather look, plus a general look in his eye of desperation and un-yielding revenge, all in a take-no-prisoners super-car. All of this is done with a level of complete un-pretentious style, and it doesn't second guess its audience even with the typical 'talky' scenes.Gibson's Max here has twice the amount of lines that he had in the sequel, though in this film he is still partially less than mythic in stature. Thus it does add to his own crisis as a character- how does one fight these crazies on the streets without becoming crazy too? It all ends in a bang that feels less like a climax then a 'this will never end' kind of sequence of chasing and harsh death.

It's got some of the ingredients of more than a few biker movies of the late 60s and early 70s; a small-town biker gang with plenty of nasty personalities and psyches tear ass without a moral or care in the world. But these ingredients are mixed up with much more intense chases (sometimes with cars), attitude, and an anarchic future world where there's very little control of the law and justice has to be taken personally. It's got a tinge of the revenge movie in it too, though not until later on. I knew this, of course, from having seen the Road Warrior first. That film may possibly be very slightly better, or perhaps more accomplished and more compelling, but Mad Max ends up kicking up the ante on its low-budget cred, and its star cuts his teeth in a performance that isn't too shabby at all. There's an opening that ranks with the best action sequences in the Max series, as we get introduced to the (reluctant) hero by his prowess at scaring the pants off of 'the Night Rider' into his explosive demise. Then the villains get their due along with the cops, who really don't have as much personalities or full-on attitude (unlike in the Road Warrior), but still give off enough of a vibe that can mark them as the great one-dimensional antagonists of the picture. The premise is only this- to get away from the gangs that took a fellow cop on the force, Max Rockatansky (Gibson) takes his wife and little baby out on vacation. But the gang is still about, harassing the wife, and soon it leads to a very tragic and rough scene. From then on, Max dons his full-on leather look, plus a general look in his eye of desperation and un-yielding revenge, all in a take-no-prisoners super-car. All of this is done with a level of complete un-pretentious style, and it doesn't second guess its audience even with the typical 'talky' scenes.Gibson's Max here has twice the amount of lines that he had in the sequel, though in this film he is still partially less than mythic in stature. Thus it does add to his own crisis as a character- how does one fight these crazies on the streets without becoming crazy too? It all ends in a bang that feels less like a climax then a 'this will never end' kind of sequence of chasing and harsh death. In short, it's a pure-blooded exploitation flick, the kind that A.I.P.- who distributed the picture in the US- should have made as their marquee movie of the year.

It was a part of the school of 70s \/ 80s horror that forever changed what the genre would be. In addition to be influential and important, it really is an entertaining film. Like many other genre classics, it is never slick or subtle but is certainly scary. The lack of basic explanation and surrealism make it all the more frightening.By now you probably know about the plot. I'm not going to go into detail about it, because you can read a synopsis elsewhere. Also, the storyline isn't one of the more original aspects of the film and follows the Night of the Living Dead concept of being trapped in a house and bombarded by evil from the outside (even though it innovatively tinkers with the concept at times).There are several aspects to the film that make it one of the most memorable horror cult classics. First off, not since the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre had there been such an effective blend of horror and grim dark humor. While the other films in the trilogy were slapstick comedies, this one had just a bit of subtle black comedy to make the shocks all the more uneasing. The effects (which begin about twenty minutes into the film after some character development) are very well done considering the budget and are, more importantly for most slasher fans, very gross. Finally, Bruce Campbell. Even from the beginning it was obvious this guy was one cool and charismatic individual. While he usually plays Tough Guy spoofs, his role of a helpless hero is actually well portrayed. Its a shame he didn't become a big star.The film has dated a bit, but not ludicrously. Its the kind of film folks may laugh at when in a group with humorous buddies. Don't let that fool you however - this is one of the most well made low budget horror films. The sequel Evil Dead 2 was one of the very few films to successfully blend slapstick comedy and horror. The third film in the trilogy Army of Darkness, despite having its amusing moments, leaned too much on humor and attempts to make the franchise relatively mainstream.

The Strangers can tune, i.e. alter reality at will (I'm not giving anything away here -- that point is mentioned in the opening titles).

Perhaps you outgrew the emotional strings it pulled. Maybe you learned how things worked in film and now you know what they are doing and decide you actually don't like it.Possibly, the world has moved and left the thing stranded on some lonely hillock of irrelevance. For me it may be all three.This truly was celebrated when it was new. Great actors &#151; we were told &#151; in a clash of intensity never seen before. Violence and pain as well.Watching this now, it seems unsuccessful in all dimensions, all but one Schlesinger vision. This man really was adept at presenting things to us. Three scenes stand out in this regard.One is the famous chase scene near the Brooklyn Bridge. Another is the Bertolucciesque meeting and stabbing at the red stairs fountain. And finally and best for me &#151; the last scene in the waterworks set. That's sheer pleasure for me every time I see it, and the obnoxious manner of the two actors doesn't bother me either. Its obvious that the scene and particularly the dialog was written by someone other than the clipper Goldsmith. Its all so satisfying, that set.A scene that should have been great but wasn't was when our Nazi blackmailing death dentist visits the Jewish-dominated gem district to inexplicably ascertain the prices of his thousands of diamonds. Its a completely offensive setup in how artificial is the excuse to present this irony. Lost Race He is at risk of being recognized, and he is. Its a remarkable scene even while it doesn't work because it is a real, complex street scene when such were rare. But it just doesn't work. We are only left with the realization that it was a clever idea and ambitiously filmed.Here's what doesn't work. The violence. The world here is presented as falling apart. New York is nothing but piles of garbage and people quick to explode. Paris is run by mobs. The contrast with the smooth Germanic order we'd have if things had gone the other way is implicit.

For example, its cinematography is gritty, blunt, and brassy, with brutal closeups, truly lurid imagery, and inspired use of hand-held camera-work that sends you head on to the edge of your seat. Another example is how its characters are in no way horror film stereotypes. Aside from its hero being a mild-mannered, confident, and dignified black man, which was a bit bold of George Romero in the '60s, especially in making a low-budget independent debut, all of its characters are their own beasts. They are down to earth, with very human flaws and realistic emotional responses to everything.I don't consider this film to be very scary, though. Yes, it has a very creepy atmosphere, great suspense, and two jarringly wicked scenes of violence. It has a perfect setting for a movie about being trapped by surrounding zombies, a crumbling old house amidst a long field and a graveyard in the country. However, despite its ranking as one of the most popular movies of the horror genre, it doesn't afford the luxuries of an ideally scary film, such as being kept up at night, your dreams being affected, its weight on your mind for the next couple of days, having a strange feeling of not wanting to be alone at night, your nerves being on end, etc.Romero, however, delivers a great, infinitely inventive movie. At its core, the plot basically consists of debating on a decision between staying upstairs in a house or going down into the cellar. I mean, come on. What formula could that possibly be following? Its back-story is told in a very very clever fashion, as the hero rapidly goes through the house securing the windows and doors and preparing weapons and building fires whilst we hear the radio in the background with an announcer informing us of the epidemic and what places have been overtaken by mysterious stoic killers and how their victims have risen and begun killing as well, and we as the audience put the pieces together. In this review, I've given just a few reasons why I think this film is so well-written and well-directed. Granted, you will never see any of the actors doing much else, and thankfully so on account of their incredibly campy performances, save for Duane Jones, who plays the hero, Marilyn Eastman, who plays the humble but sneering wife of the egotistical family man who constantly fights Jones, and the earthy, laid-back man who leads the posse.

It seems that audiences never truly get his films until long after their release. Only now are people warming slightly to Escape From L.A.They Live is no exception. It takes forever to get going and has hardly any dialogue. But remember, I'm talking from the angle of someone who lives in an era where there is always an explosion in the first ten minutes, just to interest the audience.Taken from a short story, Eight O'Clock In The Morning, the film focuses on John Nada (Roddy Piper), a drifter, who comes to L.A. in search of work. After scrounging a job at a construction site, he stays in a shantytown, run by Gilbert (Peter Jason), and becomes friendly with Frank (Keith David). After a while, he reckons that Gilbert is up to no good, as he is always disappearing into the gospel church across the street, and is reluctant to spill the beans too easily.Nada gets the feeling that something's not quite right. And so do we. Only we can't figure out what. Then the fuzz show up and lay waste to the shantytown. Nada just stands there and watches, looking totally confused. Next day, he raids the church, only to find boxes of sunglasses. He swipes one and when he wears it, not only does he see in black-and-white, but the world isn't quite the same. Ads and billboards tell him to Eat, Sleep or Marry And Reproduce. Magazines say nothing but No Independent Thought and Do Not Question Authority. But, most distressingly, some humans do not look human in the least. They have big bulging eyes, with purple skull-heads. Naturally, Nada is freaked out.Everything rests on his shoulders. He hardly ever speaks, yet the story is told through his eyes. We know what he knows only by reaction and facial expression. It's a difficult role and yet Piper handles is pretty good. Although the dialogue is pure exposition, Carpenter never fully presents us, or Nada, with a threatening situation.Obviously, the non-humans are aliens. But, like the tagline says, who are they, and what do they want? It seems like they want to rule the world and exploit the working class, but that's the way things are anyhow. Apparently, they lead ordinary lives. If they weren't around, then someone would still be running the show, probably in the exact same way.It is because of this that Nada's sudden desire to go on an alien killing spree is too much to handle. Carpenter fails to make much of the movie after this. Meg Foster's character is almost totally irrelevant and extraneous. She serves no purpose. The prolonged fight scene between Nada and Frank is supposed to be funny, but simply isn't. It just feels odd and the comedy doesn't come through. I guess Carpenter let this scene go because Piper had a lot of wrestling experience and it might be a good idea to film a less fake-looking fight with him. Although Nada and Frank are friends, the reason for them to beat the crap out of each is stupid and not ironic at all.The ending is a bit abrupt, but the director has never been one for indulgence. It's a good ending though and it will make you laugh, which is fortunate, because you're hardly likely to smile much in the second half.Interesting, but not up to the standard of Carpenter's earlier work.

Although Nada and Frank are friends, the reason for them to beat the crap out of each is stupid and not ironic at all.The ending is a bit abrupt, but the director has never been one for indulgence. It's a good ending though and it will make you laugh, which is fortunate, because you're hardly likely to smile much in the second half.Interesting, but not up to the standard of Carpenter's earlier work.

To introduce someone to Star Trek with this film would be a bad idea.Being the first Trek product since the original series one might expect the familiar campy story lines and beaming down to M-class planets - a bit of desert 10-minutes drive from LA - but there's none to be had. Veteran director Robert Wise has crafted a film very much in the style of his original version of The Haunting.

The three suns that shine upon the land are about to line up in a great conjunction that only happens once every 1000 years. If the crystal is not repaired before then the cruel Skeksis will rule the land forever.Jen is a Gelfling (a sort of fairy creature), believed to be the last of his race. A prophecy tells of a single Gelfling defeating the Skeksis and restoring peace to the land.

On his way he meets Aughra, a sort of witch creature and Kira, another Gelfling and her race of Podling people (sort of like Fraggles).

Henson, Oz and Froud teamed up again a few years later to make Labyrinth which seems to be more fondly remembered as it's not as sinister as The Dark Crystal and has human actors in it to make it more accessible to those with narrower minds.

Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Bladerunner, 1492 Conquest Of Paradise) is at the director's seat in this stylish, visceral and shocking live action painting of a horror film. This movie takes place almost a decade later from SOTL. Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), once famed but now discredited by the FBI gets contacted by a weary, yet refined Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). She trails after him to Florence, a stylish and archaic city full of recorded history from containing some the world's most famed writers and artists.Starling is not the only person that is hunting Lecter. Apparently, a deranged and wealthy lunatic, that survived Hannibals attacks, wants vengeance in the most deranged way no sane or insane man can ever think of. There is a crooked police officer, with an unwanted history of his own, that trails after Lecter as well and uses and abuses people to get to him for his own lusts and greed. A unique pattern develops here which I found particularly interesting and controversial- a theme that I and others believe cost Hannibal from getting any Academy Award nominations. You see, all of the noticeable Hannibal stalkers, with the exception of Clarice, are rotten and evil to the core. This makes Hannibal, an anti hero- evil for evil. That is one of the reasons why I believe Hannibal got no Academy Award nominations, which I vastly disagree with, in my outspoken opinion . The technicals such as lighting, camera, sound, editing and special\/ visual effects are all intricately weaved in stark detail and are all top score. The original score is well spun also and fabulously composed. The directing and writing is above and beyond description. Ridley Scott, in some wave lengths, crosses artistic lines with Stanley Kubrick. Scott's style of directing, is far beyond measure as he is a natural born artist- it shows in fantastic fashion. I'm an artist\/ painter as well, since I was age seven. So, I know artistic genuine quality, detail and integrity when I see it- and Scott is it. The violence in this film is, to say the least, visceral and extreme. It is well directed, crafted and executed by Scott. It is 100% realistic and the continuity is 100% applicable, possible and on target. We see Hannibal, not as a one dimensional human eating machine in SOTL, but a three dimensional killer that has other interests and agendas. This is excellent because the writers make Dr. Lecter out to be a well refined, structured, focused and well seasoned man of high intelligence, strength and dexterity. This film is not for the faint hearted and simple minded thinkers. You would have to watch this film more than once to understand the detailed concepts. Hannibal weaves a detailed web of the Macabre, a type of horror style that originated from such writers Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft. It also creates a busy live action painting of betrayal, dark humor, extreme violence, sadism, opera, forbidden affection and intelligence. Just when the viewers think they have seen it all, the film takes the stunned viewer to the vomitorium in the third act. That said and in one scene, in the vomitorium, made audiences groan and 'reacte'. I'll never forget that segment and that moment.Hannibal got no Academy Award nominations which, in fact, contradicts everything they stand for. You see, the Academy Awards always talked about how they want and like realistic and plausible motion pictures about ordinary or conventional 'people, places or things'. Well, Hannibal has a significant amount of those qualities and qualifications, but it didn't get nominated anyways. This has made me very disappointed in them. There is no excuse for that. None. Their decision to cross Hannibal off the list of getting Oscar knods was merely, in my opinion, 'clear politics' and I haven't watched the Oscars since. The film should have got, at least, 4 following nominations (1) Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), (2) Best Screenplay, (3) Best Director, (4) Best Original Score.Hannibal is a revolutionary horror film- a trend setter. Many people were majorly or minorly disturbed by the film and that is another key factor I respect about the movie. It put a marker in peoples minds. The film is controversial for touching issues that people don't want to talk about or too afraid to face. The films brings it up from the deep confines of either denial or unawareness. The film is intensily realistic and a masterpiece of monumental proportions...Five stars out of five.Tom Millan Indie Filmmaker ","genre":null},{"date":"1 October 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" People compare Hannibal to Silence Of The Lambs which, if they want to play that game, is better than SOTL.

That is one of the reasons why I believe Hannibal got no Academy Award nominations, which I vastly disagree with, in my outspoken opinion . The technicals such as lighting, camera, sound, editing and special\/ visual effects are all intricately weaved in stark detail and are all top score. The original score is well spun also and fabulously composed. The directing and writing is above and beyond description. Ridley Scott, in some wave lengths, crosses artistic lines with Stanley Kubrick. Scott's style of directing, is far beyond measure as he is a natural born artist- it shows in fantastic fashion. I'm an artist\/ painter as well, since I was age seven. So, I know artistic genuine quality, detail and integrity when I see it- and Scott is it. The violence in this film is, to say the least, visceral and extreme. It is well directed, crafted and executed by Scott. It is 100% realistic and the continuity is 100% applicable, possible and on target. We see Hannibal, not as a one dimensional human eating machine in SOTL, but a three dimensional killer that has other interests and agendas. This is excellent because the writers make Dr. Lecter out to be a well refined, structured, focused and well seasoned man of high intelligence, strength and dexterity. This film is not for the faint hearted and simple minded thinkers. You would have to watch this film more than once to understand the detailed concepts. Hannibal weaves a detailed web of the Macabre, a type of horror style that originated from such writers Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft. It also creates a busy live action painting of betrayal, dark humor, extreme violence, sadism, opera, forbidden affection and intelligence. Just when the viewers think they have seen it all, the film takes the stunned viewer to the vomitorium in the third act. That said and in one scene, in the vomitorium, made audiences groan and 'reacte'. I'll never forget that segment and that moment.Hannibal got no Academy Award nominations which, in fact, contradicts everything they stand for. You see, the Academy Awards always talked about how they want and like realistic and plausible motion pictures about ordinary or conventional 'people, places or things'. Well, Hannibal has a significant amount of those qualities and qualifications, but it didn't get nominated anyways. This has made me very disappointed in them. There is no excuse for that. None. Their decision to cross Hannibal off the list of getting Oscar knods was merely, in my opinion, 'clear politics' and I haven't watched the Oscars since. The film should have got, at least, 4 following nominations (1) Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), (2) Best Screenplay, (3) Best Director, (4) Best Original Score.Hannibal is a revolutionary horror film- a trend setter. Many people were majorly or minorly disturbed by the film and that is another key factor I respect about the movie. It put a marker in peoples minds. The film is controversial for touching issues that people don't want to talk about or too afraid to face. The films brings it up from the deep confines of either denial or unawareness. The film is intensily realistic and a masterpiece of monumental proportions...Five stars out of five.Tom Millan Indie Filmmaker ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"1 October 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" People compare Hannibal to Silence Of The Lambs which, if they want to play that game, is better than SOTL. Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Bladerunner, 1492 Conquest Of Paradise) is at the director's seat in this stylish, visceral and shocking live action painting of a horror film. This movie takes place almost a decade later from SOTL. Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), once famed but now discredited by the FBI gets contacted by a weary, yet refined Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). She trails after him to Florence, a stylish and archaic city full of recorded history from containing some the world's most famed writers and artists.Starling is not the only person that is hunting Lecter. Apparently, a deranged and wealthy lunatic, that survived Hannibals attacks, wants vengeance in the most deranged way no sane or insane man can ever think of. There is a crooked police officer, with an unwanted history of his own, that trails after Lecter as well and uses and abuses people to get to him for his own lusts and greed.
