It was a time of video salons, so my parents rented a crappy pirated VHS copy of this film with a single-voice semi-amateur dubbing. As far as i can remember, the quality of the video and sound was all but horrible.But i was around 10, and it meant absolutely nothing to me. After all, at that moment it seemed that i was watching the greatest movie of all time. Because it's an adventure, and not some random one but about Robin Hood! And it has magic, people in cool costumes, sword fighting, bow shooting and, the best of all, the tree houses. And not just a few of them, but a whole village on trees. Accompanied by a happy ending and a song they made so much fuss about on TV, this movie had everything that a pre-adolescent boy could've wished for.Now, two decades later, i got a chance to re-watch Robin Hood. Except for the technical quality of the media - now the video and sound were their best - and the English language track this time, the movie had no changes. One thing that really changed was me. I'm no longer a 10-year old boy, and it implies a completely different viewing angle and perception.The first thing i must say is that, being a boy, i hardly realized how silly this movie is. From the scene with people getting out of a manhole in the sandy street of medieval Jerusalem - yeah, a manhole in the sand, i kid you not! - it was clear that no historical accuracy or at least logical consistency is to be expected from this film. But there was still hope for it, since one doesn't need to be historically accurate or logical to be a great adventure, and the best proof is the Indiana Jones films.Unfortunately, Robin Hood is no Indiana Jones. And definitely not because the topic it's based on is inferior, for it's not. This film had all the potential to be the landmark of its time and one of the best adventure movies of, if not all time then, at least, 90's. But a few director's choices wasted this opportunity.First of all, the film is too thin for its length. For your information, Robin Hood goes for more than two and a half hours. Yet for this huge screen time, we get to see not nearly enough of robinhooding itself. With lots of not so necessary and slow paced scenes like sheriff's hoodlums burning peasant villages or the sheriff himself running around his castle and throwing hissy fits, you might wish for a bigger lot of cool action moments. Yet there are only a handful of those throughout the whole movie.Another thing that kinda spoils the enjoyment is the overused comedic angle. Indeed, there must be some comedy in adventure, otherwise it would turn itself into drama. But in Robin Hood there clearly was too much of it. Mostly due to the Alan Rickman's character of the sheriff. I mean, we all know that he's a great actor and can play super vicious villains like Hans Gruber. Yet in this film all he could do is buffoon around, scream nonsense and make preposterous faces. Even out of his own death he made a clown's performance. And since he's the main opposing force in the movie, it kinda undermines the value of the confrontation and transforms adventure into visiting a spooky room attraction in an amusement park it may look scary sometimes, but you are simply 100% sure that all is gonna be okay.Yet, with all these flaws, Robin Hood Prince of Thieves still leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Maybe because it's a movie of my childhood, and although it doesn't live up to the impression it made back then, it's still nice to see something that you loved when you were a kid. Maybe because of the whole nostalgia about 90's that it brings, seeing all these actors so young again. After all, it's not everyday that you get to see a movie with Morgan Freeman playing an action role and swinging a giant crooked sword.All in all, Robin Hood may be not the best adventure film of all time. But its flaws are not unique to it, they are pertinent to the way filmmaking was back then. So while the current generation will hardly rave about it, it'll never lose its appeal and historical value as one of the most notable adventure movies of the late 80's and early 90's. So, if you haven't watched it yet - give this film a try. Maybe you won't fall in love with it, but a certain degree of enjoyment is guaranteed.

Mr. Stallone had to fight tooth and nail to bring this story to life as he saw it, wage an uphill battle of seemingly impossible odds that only a crazed man loyal to his passion would be willing to endure. And this comes through for his titular character as well. When that much earnest drive is poured into the characters, the film simply cannot help but benefit. Overall, I highly recommend this film.

It is found though that he does not die, but in fact becomes immortal, and centuries later in 1985 New York he and the Kurgan are once again drawn to battle in the streets of the Big Apple to fight to the death so as to gain the ambiguous 'Prize'.Now, what parts of this film are good? Near enough everything in my mind. There's heart, there's emotion, there's well choreographed and gripping action scenes, the story is well paced and keeps you interested, and the acting for the most part is very very good! Indeed I won't say Christopher Lambert is my favourite actor, and some of his acting in this is a bit over-the-top and hard to sit through, but the performances of Sean Connery and Clancy Brown are a ton of fun to watch, Connery being the strong minded and wise mentor, whilst Brown is the psychotic warrior of the past.The soundtrack though is one of my favourites as it's all done by Queen, with some incredible and even emotional songs that help set the tone. 'Who Wants to Live Forever' is indeed the best song in this film, really bringing on the emotions of the scene and making it all the more tragic.Overall, this film gets my support every time I watch it!

To be fair there is no doubting that this is superbly acted and the same goes for the writing and directing which all together makes this a fine film in cinema history. It also stays a mystery and never gives up the ending easily and leaves you not only guessing but also thinking about all the intricate details going on.Now Chinatown doesn't have the most exciting story, or maybe the premise doesn't seem exciting but the movie itself is good when it comes to the depth involved. The story is so well researched and so well put together, you don't need big thrills and gunshots everywhere to be made to enjoy this piece. I think one big thing about the plot is it's level of detail as mentioned as it is just overly detailed and really makes the plot thicker if anything.Jack Nicholson portrays J.J. Gittes with a certain ease In his demeanour and a kind of worked out character that seems planned and as if Nicholson put a lot of work in before taking the role. Cast such as Faye Dunaway do a top job too here and she seems calm and yet her character is very complex and hard to figure out what's going on with her, the certain chemistry if you will between Nicholson and Dunaway could be analysed over and over and you can really see Gittes does not understand her fully. Robert Towne the writer creates a script that is considered among the very best in cinema, and I mean worldwide. It is calm and calculated and Towne makes a screenplay something more than well, a screenplay, he creates drama and intrigue in all the right places. The script is slow but somehow Towne makes it exciting in a way and lets you watch with an air of what's next around the corner, just a top job from a top writer.The neo-noir style is in abundance, but it is safe in it's pickings of where to put it, it isn't overused in any case and when the biggest examples of neo-noir are seen, they work very well. I felt the score that is in line with the neo-noir style is a fine one and the late Jerry Goldsmith does a magnificent job in making quite bland and ordinary scenes seem yet again, exciting and also gives a lovely air of mystery even in the music.You know many films we see the cinematography over looked and not really thought of as one of the highlights, but here it very much is the case and a big one. John Alonzo was nominated for an Oscar for his work but the fact that when people mention this they only go for the directing, writing and acting is an insult to the beautiful craft Alonzo creates. The shots are just so well timed and the close ups and very few cuts make this ahead of it's time in camera work for movies.Overall I felt it to be firmly a brilliant movie and one that should stay with the viewer no matter what they felt about it. I do feel this is overrated and without shooting me here me out, I can see why people love this and it definitely isn't a mystery why, it is just I didn't find this exciting enough to be flawless, but is still a wonderful and glorious movie that even with just what I say, is still near the very top.

Gittes with a certain ease In his demeanour and a kind of worked out character that seems planned and as if Nicholson put a lot of work in before taking the role. Cast such as Faye Dunaway do a top job too here and she seems calm and yet her character is very complex and hard to figure out what's going on with her, the certain chemistry if you will between Nicholson and Dunaway could be analysed over and over and you can really see Gittes does not understand her fully. Robert Towne the writer creates a script that is considered among the very best in cinema, and I mean worldwide. It is calm and calculated and Towne makes a screenplay something more than well, a screenplay, he creates drama and intrigue in all the right places. The script is slow but somehow Towne makes it exciting in a way and lets you watch with an air of what's next around the corner, just a top job from a top writer.The neo-noir style is in abundance, but it is safe in it's pickings of where to put it, it isn't overused in any case and when the biggest examples of neo-noir are seen, they work very well. I felt the score that is in line with the neo-noir style is a fine one and the late Jerry Goldsmith does a magnificent job in making quite bland and ordinary scenes seem yet again, exciting and also gives a lovely air of mystery even in the music.You know many films we see the cinematography over looked and not really thought of as one of the highlights, but here it very much is the case and a big one. John Alonzo was nominated for an Oscar for his work but the fact that when people mention this they only go for the directing, writing and acting is an insult to the beautiful craft Alonzo creates. The shots are just so well timed and the close ups and very few cuts make this ahead of it's time in camera work for movies.Overall I felt it to be firmly a brilliant movie and one that should stay with the viewer no matter what they felt about it. I do feel this is overrated and without shooting me here me out, I can see why people love this and it definitely isn't a mystery why, it is just I didn't find this exciting enough to be flawless, but is still a wonderful and glorious movie that even with just what I say, is still near the very top.

Meiks claims that a member of his family was the person responsible for the so called 'God's hands' killings which have remained unsolved for several years. Doyle initially appears content that he is now in a position to solve a case that has left him frustrated for years, but not everything is as it seems.There are quite a number of problems with this picture and the first notable problem is its rather unimaginative and clichéd plot line. Here we have a serial killer that is instructed to kill people because God is telling him to - how original? Had this been the only problem it would have only been a minor irritation, but what makes it worse is how heavy-handed the whole film is. We're told that God is telling our killer to go after these demons and the writers kindly remind you of this fact about every 3 minutes... you know just in case you forget. Whatever happened to subtlety? The worst aspect of all of this is when you see Bill Paxton putting his hand on the 'demons' heads in order to be able to see all their various indiscretions, murders etc. I mean seriously? I thought this was supposed to be a serious thriller, not a fantasy film. Once I realised how silly it was becoming, I really had a hard time taking it seriously.The script is sloppy and silly at times, but thankfully many of the actors are good here and do at least lend some much needed gravitas to proceedings. The ever reliable Bill Paxton is always a good presence and he's supported well by both Powers Boothe and Matthew McConaughey. Frailty is also well-paced, reasonably compelling and it also has a few disturbing and creepy moments.Ultimately, this is a good film, but it would have been a much better film had it not been so heavy with the 'God' stuff - it really didn't need to be this 'agenda-heavy'. However, it does have some strengths and generally the film just about does enough to cover up for some of its weaknesses.

Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it is a thrilling story of freedom, political machinations and love set in the ancient world. It is a very well written film with often marvellous dialogue.At 43, Kirk Douglas was perhaps a little old to play the title character but he is very good as the dignified, principled man who wishes to free every last slave in Italy. Like Charlton Heston, he has a face that looked as if it was chiseled from marble which gave him the perfect look for historical epics. More importantly, Douglas' performance effectively communicates Spartacus' intelligence and courage and I never doubted why so many would be willing to follow him anywhere. To his followers, he is a symbol of hope or even a Messiah but, for the audience, he is humanised through his relationship with Varinia, played by Jean Simmons. They meet in Batiatus' gladiator training school and soon fall in love. It is a gentle, tender love story and Douglas is at its best in these scenes. He and Simmons have great chemistry. One of the most gifted actresses of her generation, Simmons excels as the proud, brave and intelligent Varinia. As good as she is in her scenes with Douglas, her best moment is the scene towards the end of the film after she is recaptured and sold to Crassus, played by Laurence Olivier, in which he threatens to kill her newborn son if she does not submit to him. Varinia realises that he is afraid of Spartacus and disturbed by the fact that he inspired so much love and devotion, not least of all from her. Simmons, who previously played the Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet, plays this scene wonderfully and we get a real sense of Varinia's strength.Speaking of Olivier, he is characteristically excellent as Crassus, one of Rome's greatest generals and one of the wealthiest men to have ever lived. A patrician from a very old Roman family who despises the mob, he is an extremely shrewd military and political strategist who manipulates the threat posed by Spartacus to substantially increase his own political standing. He is eventually named Consul of Rome with Julius Caesar as his protégé, thereby beginning the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. On the battlefield, he manages to defeat Spartacus by forcing him to march on Rome where not only his own legions but those of Pompey and another general are waiting for him. Crassus is a very dangerous man of fierce intelligence, which makes him a very compelling character. In his penultimate film before his death in 1962, the great Charles Laughton is excellent as Gracchus, the (fictional) leader of the Senate and Crassus' hated rival. Gracchus is an interesting character who is even more shrewd than Crassus. He does not believe in the gods but worships them publicly and is perfectly willing to make deals with criminals, namely the Cilician pirates, if he believes that doing so is in the interests of Rome. He is part of the corruption that plagues the Roman Republic but considers that better than a dictatorship and I certainly can't disagree with him there. Gracchus is not a particularly good man but he is a far better one than his rival.As strong as the film's cast may be, it is the one and only Peter Ustinov who steals the show as the cowardly slave trader Batiatus. He won the first of two Best Supporting Actor Oscars for the role, the only actor to win an Oscar for a Kubrick film. Batiatus is scornful of Crassus in private but extremely obsequious to him whenever they meet. He has a very strong sense of self-preservation or, to put it another way, he is a complete coward. This is best demonstrated when Crassus orders him to remain in camp the night before the final battle with Spartacus so he can identify him. When Batiatus asks what will happen to him if Spartacus wins, Crassus tells Batiatus that he has no doubt that he will help Spartacus to identify him. This is one of Batiatus' best scenes as it perfectly illustrates that his first loyalty is most definitely to himself. He possibly becomes a better man after being flogged on Crassus' order but he never comes to regret his earlier actions and only agrees to transport Varinia and her son out of Rome in exchange for two million sestertii. Tony Curtis is good as Antoninus and I love the father-son relationship that develops between him and Spartacus but he is underdeveloped, making him the least interesting of the major characters. With his tough guy image, Curtis may have been miscast as a singer and poet with no practical experience of fighting before joining Spartacus' army. The only weak links are Charles McGraw as Marcellus and John Dall as Marcus Glabrus but neither of them have particularly big roles.Overall, this is an extremely intelligent film. Spartacus is crucified, meaning that it lacks a traditional Hollywood ending but there is still a great sense of hope as his son has been granted his freedom. My main historical area of interest is about 2,000 years after Spartacus' death but I think that the film sticks to the general thrust of events while admittedly taking quite a few liberties here and there. However, these are only minor issues which in no way detract from a brilliant film, one of the best of the historical epics which dominated 1950s and 1960s Hollywood.

","genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama"},{"date":"25 April 2015","score":"","review":" I saw this movie years ago and the story so intrigued me that I bought it on video. It's a story by Stephen King and although I'm not a fan of the science fiction he writes, his drama is always surprising. This does not disappoint. Kathy Bates as the abused wife who is accused of killing the wealthy woman she has cared for for many years, is a tour d'force. Jennifer Jason-Leigh is another who gives a wonderful performance as her daughter who returns reluctantly to help her estranged mother. She is convinced that her mother did this crime but decides she must delay her return to her high profile journalism job in order to find a lawyer for her mom. While in the process, all the family history comes to light with a dramatic climax. The telling of the family history and the story that unfolds is so well acted by Bates, Jason-Leigh and Christopher Plumber that I was sorely disappointed when this was overlooked by the Academy Awards. I've seen many movies staring Kathy Bates but in my opinion this was the best performance of her career. I felt that this certainly ranked higher than her performance in Misery.

The lengthy franchise of 28+ films had to start somewhere, and Ishiro Honda's 1954 original Godzilla (or Gojira) movie is still quite possibly the most unique Godzilla film because, unlike its sequels, it has a dead serious tone all throughout, and a message against nuclear destruction from the country that experienced it firsthand. If you choose not to believe that King Kong Appears in Edo (1938) is a real film, that means that Godzilla is the first kaiju film (giant monster movie) ever made, so it also has major historical significance in the film world. It was re-cut two times; first as an American version called Godzilla King of the Monsters! starring Raymond Burr (the guy from Rear Window), and then in the '70s by Italians as Cozzilla, which is basically the American version dubbed, colorized, and stock footage'd.The movie was partially inspired by The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and partially by some real-life disasters involving radiation. It wasn't the first Japanese special effects (tokusatsu) film, but its tremendous success made for many films of the same genre to be produced. Godzilla is basically a guy in a rubber monster suit crashing cars and trains that are obviously miniature models, so the effects definitely aren't realistic, but the shots of Godzilla rampaging around Tokyo are nevertheless powerful because of the very implication that an unstoppable force of nature created by humans themselves is running wild. Godzilla is always partially lit so that a part of him dwells in darkness, making him seem more mysterious. Two effects I liked is Godzilla melting down electrical towers made of wax with his atomic breath and his roar, produced by stroking contrabass strings with a leather glove.The movie has some great monster rampage scenes alright, and a catchy soundtrack, but the majority of it is very underwhelming, unfortunately. The human characters aren't all that interesting and the obligatory pseudo-romance sub-plot is just boring. Takashi Shimura, known for higher-brow Kurosawa films, graces us with his presence but his character is nothing special either. There's also a mad scientist guy with an eye patch (which doesn't fit him) whose fate is predictable and who doesn't leave a mark after the film's over. Although the movie is very dark, the suspense is scarce and the reveal of Godzilla is pretty lazy and sudden (I wouldn't even call it a jump scare). There are also many technical hiccups characteristic for many films of this age; awkward scene transitions, jumpy editing and such. Also, this was the most expensive Japanese film of its time (in fact, the simultaneous production of both Godzilla and Seven Samurai almost lead Toho studios into bankruptcy), so with all the budget involved, how is it that nobody remembered to check that the Jurassic period wasn't 2,000,000 years ago, as the paleontologist states (he's off by 142 million years)? I mean, at least -some- research would be enough, right?This movie is definitely flawed and far from a perfect monster movie, but it made history and the scenes with Godzilla are great, so at least it has those going for it. I actually prefer the sillier, less serious tone of the sequels because I don't think a serious message fits a movie where the main issue is a huge reptilian monster which spits out atomic breath.

This film is also based on a Stephen King novel and again I have generally liked many films that have been adapted from King's novels. Therefore I was sure when I sat down to watch Christine that it was going to be at least mildly scary and relatively suspenseful. Yet sadly it wasn't....The screenplay for this film has been adapted by Bill Phillips and I'm unsure whether that's part of the problem with this film. The start of the film is quite dull and seems to start out as some weird 'teen dramedy' - some of it is needed to explain the 'revenge' aspect that we see later in the film, but the first half of the film just seemed to be way too drawn out for my liking. As mentioned, the characters are either annoying or unlikeable and I found myself becoming more and more bored with this film as it trundled along.Things do pick up slightly in the second half of the film when 'Christine' is let loose on all those that have wronged her. The tension is cranked up slightly and it at least becomes a little more exciting and enjoyable. Sadly though you have to sit through an hour of pretentiousness, dull dialogue, and a boring romance etc before the film even begins to take a darker turn. Although the second half of the film was mildly engaging, it wasn't particularly scary and the wrap up was also formulaic and far too predictable.Ending on a positive note, I thought that Keith Gordon was superb in the lead role. He had the difficult task of taking on a very complex character and was effective as both the nerd we saw at the beginning and was also great as his much darker alter ego. Robert Prosky was also great fun as Cunningham's ruthless boss. Both of these actors were clearly much better than the film itself. I'd give this one a swerve.

This film is also based on a Stephen King novel and again I have generally liked many films that have been adapted from King's novels. Therefore I was sure when I sat down to watch Christine that it was going to be at least mildly scary and relatively suspenseful. Yet sadly it wasn't....The screenplay for this film has been adapted by Bill Phillips and I'm unsure whether that's part of the problem with this film. The start of the film is quite dull and seems to start out as some weird 'teen dramedy' - some of it is needed to explain the 'revenge' aspect that we see later in the film, but the first half of the film just seemed to be way too drawn out for my liking. As mentioned, the characters are either annoying or unlikeable and I found myself becoming more and more bored with this film as it trundled along.Things do pick up slightly in the second half of the film when 'Christine' is let loose on all those that have wronged her. The tension is cranked up slightly and it at least becomes a little more exciting and enjoyable.

Furthermore, the special effects are great. I also like how realistic scenes like the decompression scene are, unlike other movies where one can somehow magically survive exposure in space. This is a hardcore science fiction movie!I honestly do not understand why this is underrated by the critics, this movie is nothing like Hellraiser, its not a rip-off. Actually i found this movie to have been a lot more memorable then the Hellraiser series. Even in 2015 this movie beats other more recent so called sci-fi movies. If you are a guy like me who grew up reading sci-fi and has a healthy brain (unlike these critics), i'm pretty sure you will enjoy this one.

Kline was an ultimate ass in this picture. Needless to say, I hated him, like you wouldn't believe.As well - Drab, dull actor Peter MacNicol was utterly forgettable as the Stingo character who befriends Sophie and learns of her deep, dark secret.And, finally - I thought Meryl Streep speaking broken-English with a Polish accent was pretty disappointing. Half the time I couldn't understand what the hell she was saying.All-in-all - I do not recommend this movie at all. It is far too over-rated, if you ask me.
