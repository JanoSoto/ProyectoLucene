Then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record as a solo effort, Ice Age is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are priceless, and show-stealing.

Well, if a child saw a movie, it's automatically scarier, because a kid can't see immediately if it's real or not. I'm now 16, when I saw this movie 8 years ago, it was a very scary movie, and actually it still is scary after all those years. So that can only mean one thing It's a great movie, and it is.  If I compare it with its sequel, this movie has a darker and moodier atmosphere, and it's more original than T2.. If you have seen both movies, you can see that T2 inherited a lot of its original. And Arnie as the bad guy (excellent performance by Arnie), that was the best thing, he carries the whole movie by himself, no one else could do this role better than Arnold, because he was just perfect. He doesn't have to say a lot, but that's one of the most effective points of its character. Other points is his cold-blooded appearance, just ice-cold and no emotions at all. Great job, Arnie!!James Cameron has made an excellent sci-fi movie, with a very original story, a good cast and good special effects for a movie out of 1984. He really keeps the suspense in it, it never goes away, because you never know when The Terminator will strike again. With the story I have to say that it really opens your mind for the future, because what happens in that future, COULD happen in real life(So watch out for every machine in your house, you never know). Did you know that this movie had a budget for only 6$ million. James Cameron really showed me what you can do with a small budget like that, he made one of the scariest movies and one of the best sci-fi movies ever. A real classic and its sequel too, so my advice is rent both movies or buy them, either suits me.

This was a joke and an embarrassment to everything the old movies were.  Right of the bat, the 'explanation' for how Michael Myers survived H2O made me want to leave.  I guess it wasn't him, it was a paramedic who had his throat crushed by Michael Myers, so he couldn't talk, and Myers just dressed him up to look like him.  Absolutely brilliant. Never mind the fact at the end of H20, 'Michael Myers', oh yeah I mean 'the paramedic' was trying to kill Laurie Strode.  I guess the paramedic decided at the end of H20 to act like Myers and try to kill Laurie for the heck of it.  The writers of this movie must've forgotten about that.  Let alone the fact that Laurie was dead within the first 10 minutes; forgetting the fact that the woman survived every single attack by Myers in the other movies, and we are to believe she just gets killed like that?  Not likely.  Even more so, any fan of Halloween knows that burning Michael Myers alive, will not kill him.  It didn't work twice before, and watching this movie I knew it would not be over, when he was 'dead'.  I guess the writers figured that if a capable guy like Dr. Loomis couldn't kill him, a shot in the testicles by Busta Rhymes would definitely take care of him.  Anybody that enjoyed this pile, is a testament to how easily amused people are these days. What used to be an original series of movies, turned into a mockery, and a prime example of how bad horror movies have gotten.  Gone is the intelligence, and good storylines, and in are really bad lines, a plot full of holes, and really bad camera work (it was horrible as well).  Whoever OK'ed this movie, should be fired, and what's even worse is there has to be another one, Myers is still alive.  It's like Laurie tells Michael Myers before she dies, I'll see you in Hell.

There, I said it!But my biggest question is Why do the people at IMDB think that I would enjoy this movie, if I like horror, comedy, suspense, thriller, drama, or adventure, etc. Personally I do not think that EVERYBODY who loves ANY kinds of movies like this. I have seen some movies that I really liked. I have seen some i adore. This is not one of them.Not a complete waste of time, but if you need action, don't even bother...6\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"18 July 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I am tired of seeing Tom Hanks play over serious roles.  I guess it is more accomplished acting, but I really liked him when he did comedy.  He does play a good role and of course he is a great actor.  I found the film a bit too long.  I wish he would try his hand at a different type of character;  he is getting too typecasted.  It is a good film. The characters were chosen well.  The movie was too predictable; especially the ending.  Paul Newman played a good role again.  I never get tired of seeing his movies.

The acting of Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeifer was very well fitting but the child's role and her acting was what disturbed me most. She is said to be 7 years old and Sam's mental age is also said to be 7 but how come the little girl can act like a 30 year-old grown up? She is so much grown up that it feels she can even look after his father but it was so unrealistic to portray a 7 year-old as an extremely mature girl.Also the film was far too long. It could have made its statement in 2 hours as well. There was too much subthemes like the problematic lawyer (yes i know it was important for the well-being of the plot but from time to time it made me lose the main theme), the never-going-out neighbour. But these are also not very much elaborated either. It was as if all of those plots were loosely fitted to the main plot to underline the statement of `all you need is love to raise a child`. 5\/10 and that's for the good performances of Sean,Michelle and Dianne Wiest.

Elizabeth Shue also gives an outstanding performance which also improves as the movie progresses.The thing i really liked about this movie is that it stays true to the end.
