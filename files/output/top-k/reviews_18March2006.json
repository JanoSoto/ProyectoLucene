The lightsaber choreography is excellent throughout the film, and the 'Duel of the Fates' at the end of the film is one of the most incredible (and tragic) sequences in the whole saga.All in all the movie was just OK, nothing compared to the original trilogy or even the other two movies in the prequel trilogy. It did leave you wanting more, however, and even though Episode II wasn't spectacular Episode III more than made up for the first two chapters.

The film is generally well-made from a technical point of view, apart from possibly being too long. The acting is mostly very good, although Kevin Spacey isn't given much space to explain his character's motivation (apparently ambition rather than racism), and Sandra Bullock's only function seems to be as eye candy, which she admittedly manages very well.At a fundamental level the film's heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism, and I get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it. However, it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew (I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much of that is down to Grisham). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice. Aside from the fact that I don't agree with that position, I don't think that such a view actually helps the anti-racist cause at all - it's more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims. At the end the prosecutor invites the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end the message seems to be that it's OK to kill someone as long as you hate them enough. It's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt, which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case.Samuel L Jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately this also undermines the plot - he comes across as someone with considerable integrity, but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea (and indeed he doesn't, when push comes to shove). We're presumably supposed to think that it's because he faces the death penalty, but in fact at one point he's offered a plea of manslaughter, although if you blink you might miss it. Why not take it, given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim? Or if he wants to make a stand in court, why plead insanity?There are less serious flaws too. The medical experts, on whose testimony the case supposedly rests, are jokes - both are discredited for highly implausible reasons, and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they're asked to say, and shouldn't be believed. The fact that the injured policeman supports Jackson is moderately plausible, but still a bit convenient (and what if he had died?) I find it hard to believe that the KKK would march down the street in broad daylight. Other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) go by without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. And the scene where the dog comes bounding back is ludicrous.My final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty - as though I must be a racist because I disagree with the resolution. It may be that the film intended to explore different viewpoints and leave the audience to decide, but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end. The film did make me think about my views, read what other people thought here and add my own opinion, so at some level maybe it succeeded - but I worry that it may have re-inforced highly illiberal views in some people, which I hope is the opposite of what it intended.Final thought - try watching Law and Order, it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!

No, please do not take it in the negative sense. But the adjectives that come to the mind when thinking about the movie are very mixed, Brilliant, Grotesque, Depressing, Brutal, Unique. The story is that of a psychotic killer, whose each kill is a 'modern day' representation of the original Seven sins from the ancient texts. The sins are Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, Pride, Lust, Envy and Wrath. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are the two homicide detectives that have been assigned this case. In fact, it is Morgan's last case, as he is due to retire soon. The case becomes more and more intriguing as each murder unfolds. Each murder is more gruesome and more gory than the previous one. (I must say at this point that it has been one of the most difficult movies to watch. Watching it alone at night ,as I did, is definitely not recommended.) By this time audience is certain that the killer is brilliant but a very twisted guy. A very clever technique employed by the director here is that he has not shown any crime being done in action, all are just the post murder shots of the dead. Just the level of detailing shown in the movie makes an amazing treat. Morgan Freeman is as usual very good. But it is Brad Pitt that really shows amazing acting abilities especially during the last part of the movie, the final confrontation scene between Brad, Morgan and the killer. Having said that movie belongs to the killer, who is the eventual winner (you will have to see the movie to find that out). Kevin Spacey as the killer has only around 15-20 minutes of the role during the end. But by Jove, he does carry it off amazingly well. While watching the movie, I was really wondering how would the director show the viciousness of the killer, which he has shown earlier during the murders. But Spacey carries it out with ease. He is a rare breed of an actor. A class apart. One had to just look in to his eyes and the expressions on his face, to become convinced that he is same person that performed all those murders. Also worth mentioning is how well the movie ends. The last sequence, the last two murders ( or should I say the Sins) are a treat to watch. What an ending. In the end, I would like to quote the brilliant director himself, Mr David Fincher, to understand why the movie is so dark, stark and gruesome. I don't know how much movies should entertain. To me I'm always interested in movies that scar. The thing I love about JAWS is the fact that I've never gone swimming in the ocean again.

There are very few who would have played his part better, especially at the time this movie was made. And quite frankly none of them immediately come to mind. And as the storyline progresses Fonda's portrayal of the desperation in his character is flawless. Almost as if he were the personification of the devil himself, and he knows his time is short. Another note on Fonda, his other main movie that year I believe was Yours, Mine and Ours with Lucille Ball. He played two very distinct characters in these movies. It just goes to show the quality of his acting ability.As for the other characters they revealed depth. Save for Bronson's character. Which is how he should be. Because of his experiences he is left changed. As if he is no longer human, nobody can appeal to him any longer. Except for justice and cynicism. He becomes almost as if he were a law of nature rather than a person. Morricone's music score was again ingenious. But this is one item that absolutely drives me insane. In the latest release on DVD it seems that they actually increased the music score volume to the point where it detracts from the movie. And it seems there are a few songs that are overplayed. I believe this detracts from the overall experience. I found I would constantly be adjusting the volume up and down depending upon whether or not we are listening to dialog or music.

One of those things is the cast, which is a very strong one. Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Barry Pepper, ... All of them have a role that seems to be written especially for them. It's good to see David Morse again, he's one of those actors you commonly see, but never in a leading role. Doug Hutchinson's character is one of the most annoying I've ever seen.

There are many movies out there that have a storyline that are shorter in length that have you glancing at the clock from time to time wondering when the movie will finally end. The Green Mile however, keeps you hooked and makes you curious about what will happen next and further.

He made us pay attention to archeology and the Ark Of The Covenant; he educated us on Great White Sharks;, a made us love an ugly little space alien and he even made Whoopi Goldberg look good. Wow, say what you will, the man has done some amazing things in the world of film. Here, he brings dinosaurs back to life and gives us another classic adventure story, unlike anything seen up to this time. I rank this one right up with the best of all-time among great adventure stories. Few people can forget how stunned they were when they viewed these life-like dinosaurs for the first time on screen. And who can forget the T-Rex in the first frightening scene and the Raptors in the last intense scene? This is truly memorable stuff. To this day, those scenes can still get your attention.The movie has always been fun to watch, and not just because of the thrills or special effects, of which there are too many to recite here. There is humor in here and characters are interesting, led by Richard Attenborough as the scientist who creates Jurassic Park.

To me, a good film is a good film - no matter what the subject.The original Halloween movies belong to that teenage-horror genre that have been putting adolescent bums on seats and provoking hugs and gropes in the back-row since the 1950's. Generally; they're B-movies, rather amateurish, and not my scene.For this reason I found halloweens 1 & 2 repetitive and boring - just like the Freddy Kruger 'Nightmare' hokum. How many kids does one really need to see being systematically disembowelled with a sharp knife? There's no plot to such movies, you don't need to think; it is just set-piece slash after set-piece slash. All the more absurd is the seeming invulnerability of the assailants. Michael Myers is no exception. Why are these slashers always supernatural? Thank heavens for jolly old Mr Lecter.Sadly, lots of people seem to be turned-on by serial slaughter, and the absence from Halloween 3 of Mr Myers and his tedious, predictable butchery caused indignant outrage amongst those gore-fans who made the originals such a success. 'Season Of The Witch' apparently bombed at the box office. Well; more fool the Myerettes. This third Halloween actually has a lot more going for it. For one thing; there's a story. It builds-up gradually with some unexpected twists. The plot is entirely much darker, concerning some evil genius who threatens unspeakable mischief to American children (I liked him immediately!). Effects and shocks are spooky and original. The hospital assassin who practically tears someone's head off, and then runs away only to immolate himself was particularly unexpected, as was the imaginative use of creepy-crawlies. Employing child-victims is something of a Hollywood taboo - even in 'Aliens' the little girl is sacrosanct. But Mr Carpenter is never afraid to dispatch children violently in order to make a point check-out the tiresome ice-cream-demanding brat in his 'Assault On Precinct 13'.The script isn't anything to write home about. The acting is about his usual, rather wooden, standard. And there are no 'stars' to speak of. I won't disclose any more details because that would spoil the surprise.Nevertheless it certainly didn't deserve the caning it got from the slashionistas. Sure; it's still a B movie, It's a million miles from his classic 'The Thing', but it's a worthy little item even so. If you like suspense, a creepy little plot, and some rather grisly ideas, give it an airing. There are far worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life.

The theater projector, Alfredo, is the one in charge of cutting the scenes out. And a little boy named Salvatore visits often to ask if he can run the projector himself and maybe steal a few of the edited clips. A bag of them in his room catches fire and nearly destroys his home. His mother instructs Alfredo never to let Salvatore near the theater again. At first, he does. But the boy's love of the movies brings him constantly back, and Alfredo's heart warms to the boy.In one of the more magical scenes in the movie, a small crowd gathers outside the theater when the theater is full, asking to see the movie before it gets too late for them to stay up. Salvatore watches as Alfredo removes the back of the projector and uses a mirror to reflect the movie onto the wall of someone's house, where the audience brings chairs and watches contently.Salvatore grows older. As a teen, he mainly runs the projector, (the theater is no longer censored by the priest - now it occasionally shows porn), takes photographs and falls for a wealthy new girl in town. The film is predictable in plot, but not predictable in the way it makes us follow it s storyline eagerly. The film is scored by Ennio Morricone (who reuses a theme or two from The Untouchables) and is directed by Gieuseppe Tornatore.

I was absolutely horror-stricken by the way Oliver was treated in Dunstable - the dismal workhouse, Bumble's cruel treatment of the child, and Oliver's being locked up in the cellar. I cried throughout those scenes and my mom kept assuring me that it was going to have a happy ending. In fact, I cried all the way to the introduction of the Artful Dodger. Then I felt much better when the Dodger was befriending Oliver and with the humour that came with Fagin. Later that year, my mom bought me the Soundtrack album for my eleventh birthday, and I played it constantly. I have high-functioning autism, so I had obsessions, which made me very bright in certain things. As a result, before long, I knew the entire score of the songs by heart. When I was in my twenties, I had a penpal with the same special needs as me. One of his interests was British child actor Mark Lester. I wrote to this guy in Texas about Mark Lester because I wanted to find out about his adult life. Many child stars become messed up later in life and Lester was no exception. But according to my friend in Texas, Lester is now an osteopath in England and has a family. I'm very happy for him that he turned out successful in the end. I wrote to him and told him what I've been saying and asked for his autograph. Apparently, so many people have asked him about his child-acting career and little else that he's long been burnt out with talking about this; therefore, he doesn't usually answer people's letters. He just wants to be left alone about it and I don't blame him one bit. But Lester sent me a card with his autograph on it, and while he sent only that, and not a letter, it is a very special thing that he replied at all. He must have been very happy to get my letter. Once, when I was a kid, when I was obsessed with Oliver!, my grandparents came to visit for the summer, and Grandma made me the things mentioned in Food, Glorious Food, including gruel (Grandma just made it so I could see what it looked like, and warned me I wasn't going to like it - YEAUCCCHHH!), pease pudding and savaloys, hot sausage and mustard, etc. I still find the Dunstable scenes very disturbing. If Bumble thought that rich food raised an artificial soul, why did HE eat it, I would like to know! That no-good hypocrite! If I were in Oliver's shoes, I'd have told Bumble that he was a fat, greedy pig! And imagine that teenage bully Noah Claypole saying such terrible things to Oliver about his dead mother! He deserved the licking he got from Oliver, being so much bigger! And it made me furious when Mrs. Sowerberry and the others took Noah's side instead of Oliver's.
