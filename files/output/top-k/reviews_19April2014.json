So here we have both facets that make this interesting. It is, more so than Ben Hur and perhaps even Spartacus, less grand in the cinematic brushstroke but more troubled and honestly so about the spiritual picture it paints, more human.It starts with what we know as a spiritual narrative, Pilates' trial of Jesus, but approaches it in the historic light. It follows only the last legs of that narrative from the crucifixion on but does so through Barabbas' questioning eyes. We assume divinity because it's that story but the body could have been stolen, the eclipse natural; it all might just be a story about god.The spiritual question that looms is why doesn't god make himself plain? If this is a spiritual narrative as the newly devout insist throughout, why is it so hard to discern its truth?Barabbas finds it hard to believe so returns to his banditry which opens up a cycle of sinking deeper into a life of meaningless toil and punishment, seen most clearly in the sulphur mines where each subsequent year the slaves are lowered to a deeper level as their eyes become accustomed to the dark, again eyes tied to light. It isn't so just for him of course, Christians suffer next to him so what difference does it make, faith or god?There's a scene where a Christian lectures gladiators that their pagan gods are fictions that will be sure to amuse modern viewers.

Its greatness can be gauged by the fact that it has never lost its punch even though it is set at the height of the Cold War. What keeps it so fresh?Firstly, there is the performances of everyone in the cast. Sellers is astonishing and the rest of the cast also seems to have been inspired by the prospect of creating a masterpiece. George C. Scott was reportedly angry with Kubrick because he used Scott's over-the-top takes rather than his straighter ones but I think Stanley's instincts and understanding of the overall dynamics of the film led him to make the right decision. Scott's performance as the highly dangerous buffoon, Buck Turgidson, is unforgettable. Turgidson was apparently based upon a U.S. Air Force colonel, Curtis Lemay, and is a comment upon people who decide the fate of millions by relying on statistics. Slim Pickens replaced Sellers as Major Kong and this is indicative of how circumstances beyond even the control of the director can capture lightning in a bottle. Sellers had not relished playing the fourth role of Kong possibly because it required a Texan accent. After Sellers broke his leg after falling from the bomb, Kubrick sent for Pickens because he needed a real life Texan not just an actor who could pretend to be one. Pickens rides the bomb to its target like a rodeo rider whooping and waving his cowboy hat as only he could do it. He is the embodiment of a generation of cowboy generals and politicians and no doubt a percentage of the general public who seemingly relished the thought of ending the world in an orgasm of dimwitted enthusiasm for destruction of Ruskies and evil empires.Perhaps what makes Dr. Strangelove most memorable and enduring is Ken Adam's sets &#x96; in particular, the war room. Adam was master of producing slightly ahead of their time sets and ones that isolated the subjects. They were little worlds which distanced their occupants and the audience from the rest of the world. Under the huge ring\/dome of light the generals play a game of poker with the world at stake. I would suggest that it is the script, written or improvised, that keeps people coming back to this film. The one line that jars with me is the one most people like to quote You can't fight in here; this is the war room. I find it the one obvious gag line in a film that never relies on gags. It relies upon most of the characters delivering the lines with a deep sense of belief. It is Major Kong's sense of duty and destiny that makes his line &#x85;this is it; nuclear combat, toe to toe with the Ruskies at once funny and frightening.

And also, I'm pretty sure most people will agree that this is definitely one of those cases where the movie is actually better than the book (although I do also love Philip K.

And it is incredibly boring. Don't get me wrong, I do admire 2001 very much. But nothing will ever make me think that some guy flying through an iTunes visualizer for ten minutes is entertaining (and yes, I know that particular sequence was groundbreaking for its time but it's not incredibly impressive now). Blade Runner doesn't stop its story to create its ambiance. You feel the atmosphere while the plot is moving forward. But Blade Runner also isn't some totally philosophical and pretentious movie. It isn't completely devoid of action or romance.And I must say that my favorite cut of the movie is the original American theatrical cut.

It's a romantic comedy without too much of the sappy love stuff and an overload of the sarcastic, cynical, funny stuff. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as a victim of OCD and love. Every line he spits out is quotable. He's somehow charming and slimy at the same time. Every interaction he has with other characters just makes his character better. All of Melvin's interactions with Simon and Verdell are a riot. Melvin has a sweet spot with Verdell that he can't seem to have with any human, even Carol, and a critical nature towards Simon. He is so judgmental, but can't stand to have the tables turned on himself which is true to life. That's probably what I like most about this film- it's a true depiction of life, perhaps a bit dramatized, but life is never easy. People are never simple. We are all complex. We all have our OCD ticks and our sick kids, but somehow we all have other traits that make us bearable and necessary to the rest of the world. It gets better, because we can't always be low.

I remember it from when I was a kid, but I also remember it leaving a bad taste that has taken 30+ years to get over. So tonight I gave it another try and... well, it is better than I remember, but I also understand now why I didn't like it then. First, the good - it actually does a pretty good job following the feel and tone of the original cartoons. If you don't know the characters or cartoon, don't complain about Shelly Duvall's singing, or the goofiness, or everything that was completely and directly related to the original Popeye. (Why would you even watch it? Sheesh.) As for the bad... It's long. Really, REALLY long. Not like Desolation of Smaug long, but it's just hard to take a concept that was always meant to be 5-10 min. and turn it into a full length feature film. (Sadly, Hollywood didn't learn this from Popeye and has tried everything from cartoons to board games since; Expect Candy-Land The Movie any time now.) The first hour is cute, and quaint, and you think about the cartoon and it's kind of fun. The second hour is... well, I can't say for sure. I fell asleep for part of it, and couldn't stop thinking about what else I should be doing the rest of the time. Then there is the Haul Ass final pseudo-song ending. OK, maybe Popeye's Pappy is saying Haul Aft, but this is supposed to be a kids movie and it simply gets old and wasn't really funny the first time. So, I guess my suggestion is this - watch the first half hour or so, see some great performances, have a trip down memory lane and then let it go. It ends how the cartoons end - Popeye eats the spinach, Brutus looses, and toot-toot, all is well in the world. I just saved 60-90 minutes of your life. You will thank me someday.

Reaching deep down into our deepest and most darkest nightmares, he generated some of the best horror novels of his time. Most of them have made it onto the big screen. His best adaptations are Carrie, The Dead Zone and The Shining. All three movies and his other future adaptations also fared well.His latest film adaption to the big screen isn't really that great, but it fares pretty good. Silver Bullet is told through the perspective of a young girl named Jane (Megan Follows), who's younger brother, Marty (Corey Haim), an wheelchair-bound kid, who's wheelchair is named Silver Bullet ( the title has a double meaning. It is the only thing that can kill a werewolf and it is also the name of the wheelchair that Marty travels in.), lived in a peaceful town called Tarker's Mill, located in Maine. The town seems to be normal, until one night, an railroad worker's death startled the townsfolk. Nobody knows who done it. But, as more bodies start to pop up, the town sheriff is convinced that a serial killer is on the loose. What he doesn't know is that a werewolf is behind all this. Marty and his older sister take notice of the current murders and tries to convince their alcoholic Uncle Red, (Gary Busey) that a werewolf is responsible for the killings. Together, the three of them must kill the werewolf. But, in order to kill it, they will have to wait until the next full moon.As mention above, Silver Bullet is not a great Stephen King movie, but it is a fun and good horror movie. I think the reason why this movie works is that you don't really take the main characters seriously. The more you don't care, the more fun you will get out of this movie. Unlike other Stephen King's projects, Silver Bullet skips the usual Stephen King greatness and goes straight into a formula setting, where a peaceful small town is invaded by unspeakable and startling horrors.The special effects in Silver Bullet is okay, even though the suspense that is created during the werewolf are fun, even if you're still not experiencing the frightfulness that this movie possess. Busey, who is a good actor, is very good as Uncle Red and also very wise when it comes to being with his niece and nephew. There are a few scenes in this movie where I laughed because I was having fun being scared, but also because of the movie's slight sense of silliness. There's one scene where a vigilante group try to hunt down the werewolf in a bog. Probably the funniest line in the movie is when one of the townsfolk who is hunting for the werewolf says, Are you going to made lemonade in your pants? Later on after that hilarious piece of dialogue, the werewolf start to pick off the townsfolk one by one. They don't even realize that the werewolf is right beneath them in the knee-deep fog. Of course, you can laugh during a horror movie if you're scared, but you can also laughed because you realize you're having a good time watching what's up on the big screen. Another criticism that I had about the movie is that I found it hard to realize that the voice that is narrating the story is the same girl that appeared in the movie. If she is 9 years old in 1976, wouldn't she be much older than that? She can't be more than 18 or older. These are the kind of questions you don't ask during this movie or any other movie that is supposed to be implausible. But, that's okay. Silver Bullet doesn't shoot high for Stephen King greatness, but it does shoot for some sort of entertainment. ★★★ 3 stars.

It's tough and not many films can portrait it beautifully, so more credit to this film.Now, I've said too much, you would probably hate me for spoiling things. So if you want something different, harsh yet so beautiful, seek out for this film and enjoy!Score 4.5\/5 ;) ","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"19 April 2014","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Joel Schumacher has destroyed a multi-million dollar franchise. He didn't REALLY destroy it with this film, Batman Forever, but rather Batman & Robin. Batman & Robin was released two years after Batman Forever. 1995, Batman Forever is released and it quickly disappoints fans all around the world. Joel, you've wrecked it. But don't get me wrong, there are some brilliant things about Batman Forever. These things being Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face, I guess, should make this list. He was okay as Two Face. Val Kilmer as Batman....was not bad, but pretty poor compared to Michael Keaton. And finally, Jim Carrey as the Riddler, as he was pretty good and carried the film all the way throughout, and somewhat made it enjoyable. I can honestly say that Jim Carrey is the best thing about this film and you're either going to agree with me, extremely, or disagree with me, extremely. He's either very good as the Riddler, or very bad. I, personally, think he's really good. I do, however, think there are some people out there, actors, who are worthy or portraying a far greater Riddler. Yet, we're still to see that. This film isn't anywhere near as Dark as the first two films from Tim Burton and this one focuses more on a 'Family approach'. It's rating is less and it's been made to suite younger, more lackadaisical fans. The one's that can't be bothered speaking of the differences and are too lazy to notice why the film isn't so good. Well damn it, I am lazy, but I can still be bothered writing this review saying that this film, Batman Forever, isn't even half as good as the predecessors. They're amazing, and then this came, from Schumacher and practically destroyed the franchise. Thanks to some things, it's not all bad. But oh, let me tell you, Batman & Robin (1997) is VERY bad. It deserves a rating of 3 out of 10, whereas this one deserves a solid 6.5\/10. I sometimes think about lowering my rating to 5.5 or 6. but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and stick with 6.5 since Carrey's somewhat enjoyable, well-portrayed role is what makes the film watchable. Kilmer as Batman is slightly different and with him in the film, the director being Joel Schumacher and it being rated lower and less than it's two prequels, this film isn't as dark, isn't as daring and isn't as eerie as Tim Burton's classic 89' and 92' ones. But remember, it's still the second-worst Batman film out of them all. Batman Forever - 6.5\/10.
