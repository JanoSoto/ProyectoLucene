He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema. And The General, even clocking in at around three hours, is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance alone.Granted, I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts, because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature, especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything that's unnecessary, but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments. There are multiple points in the General, a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War, where Keaton's character, Johnnie Gray, has to stop his train, jump out, and remove something from the tracks, which in itself can be quite boring, but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertained.And it's a marvel how so many realistic, yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with. It's nothing fantastic like some of his other films, but it's still funny. And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversity--but he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and it's just enough to know that he is frightened, but that the rest of him doesn't react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny. Whether he's pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something he's unskilled in and being shocked by it, that response of his is winning.But the General does show its age a little. It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesn't get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context. I wouldn't dare cut those moments out of this film, even if I could re-edit it, because the space always had something going on, but at the same time, this film, if made today, would be cut to one-and-a-half, or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly. The plot and story are simple, but exist more than to just help the comedy move along--except at the end when the first story was accomplished. Then we move into a second extraneous, but still amusing, story regarding a battle between the North and the South that could've been excised and still having a decent, though simple, story.I didn't really love the score that the DVD company attached to it, which is a number of classical pieces end on end. I think a new commissioned soundtrack would've better matched the piece, but I guess we get what we get. And on the plus side, you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of it.Is it perfect? No. But despite the age it shows, it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinema's greatest physical comedians. If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown, this is not a bad way to go. 8\/10.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"5 November 2007","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" The director made some pivotal choices in the creation of this film which helped develop the theme to a great extent, including character development, use of linear narrative, and application of music for atmospheric effect. The theme I extracted was of heroism&#151;the divine role each of us contributes in life is important no matter how small and insignificant we may think we are.In the beginning of the film, the viewer is introduced to a seemingly small and insignificant man played by Buster Keaton. He is a simple Atlantic railroad attendant who becomes motivated to join the Civil War effort in hopes to win the affection of his love-interest. Already, the director subconsciously alerts the viewer to the linear narrative format by developing this inciting incident. The rising action begins when his love-interest gets kidnapped by the South in attempts to aggravate the North. The character Keaton plays is a man of little or of no consequence. However ordinary he may seem, he is thrust into a heroic situation where he must become extraordinary in order to prove his chivalry.It was interesting to observe how the director chose as serious a topic as war to center the theme of heroism around and to then capture those events in a rather humorous light. Because of the fact that The General is a silent film, the director uses music as the primary mechanism for exploiting this humor as well as the other emotions in the film. Through the course of the entire film, a piano plays various melodies in an almost parlor-shop-like fashion. During happy or humorous sequences (i.e. Keaton riding on the train engine-spoke), the sounds evoked by the piano are primarily major, and even a bit bubbly. During distressing, climactic scenes (i.e. chase sequences on the trains), the piano work produces an atmosphere of tension; dissonant chords and minor key underpinnings. Because there is no vocal dialogue to get across emotion, the choice of piano music was a crucial directorial decision to get across the otherwise one-dimensional aspect of emotion (that would come through the acting and body language alone). Just as we see the protagonist developing and maturing in heroic type fashion, so to we see the musical score heroically developing through the various emotions and atmospheres shown through the film. Both protagonist and music seem insignificant through the course of their developments, but upon closer examination demonstrate their extreme importance in developing the theme even further.It was also interesting to observe this film from the perspective of a director of the 1920s. Considering the limited budget and the resources he was available to, the techniques and effects used to develop the story and theme were also highly effective the fact that the film was silent, the film was grainy, and the effects were primitive (i.e. canons exploding; model of the train crashing) all conveyed the battle between what is considered significant and insignificant. By viewing standards today, these effects would be considered insignificant because of their mundane quality. Perhaps even the hero would be considered insignificant because he doesn't conform to the fast-paced action hero persona. If we view this film in context however, the choices used for this specific time period illustrate the man in a heroic light. If he hadn't acted the way he did, the girl may never have been rescued.
