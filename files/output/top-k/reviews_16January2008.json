After all, it's not suppose to be taken seriously to begin with. It's called Dumb and Dumber for a reason. However, to this day, this movie is still one of the most beloved comedies in decades. It still has a cult following. This movie is so damn funny, that I can't even explain it. The movie does a superb job at what it's suppose to do. It's not perfect, which is why I didn't give it a perfect score. It has a flew flaws that some movie critics would pick at. However, it's nothing compared to all the good.The storyline to the movie is both ridiculous and hilarious. It takes you on a tour of the lives of Harry and Lloyd; two guys in Rhode Island who are going nowhere in life. Once Lloyd finds the love of his life, he obsesses over her and even gets involved further in her life then he should have. She leaves an empty suit case at the airport and the content in it is very valuable. Lloyd grabs it and thinks she forgot it and wants to give it back to her but it's too late, she flew all the way to Aspen. So, Lloyd wants to go on a road trip with his buddy Harry and drive all the way to Aspen to return it to her. Little do they know that kidnappers and the FBI are after them. On their way they encounter several crazy and memorable characters. Seabass the tough redneck, Mental a somewhat stupid hit man and many more.The acting is very hilarious and well done. Jim Carrey does a great job at Lloyd who is so damn stupid and hilarious, it's hard not to like him. This character is one of Carrey's best. Jeff Daniels does and equally good job as Harry who is less dumb then Lloyd but still gets into plenty of trouble. The story overall is a road ride in the eyes of two likable idiots who are oblivious to everything and yet, they still manage to get out of trouble without even trying. The dialog in the movie is very funny and memorable. Several scenes are equally as memorable. Lloyd's fantasy dream for instance with his so called love Mary, Harry's explosive diarrhea, The cop drinking the pee out of the beer bottles, the Seabass scenes, the blind kid pretty bird scene, the Don't worry, I'm a Limo driver scene and several more. There were very few moments in this movie where I wasn't laughing.Overall this movie may not be perfect because the humor will not appeal to everyone. Some people may be too serious for this movie and if so, you're lose, go watch Titanic. All I know is it's one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and to this day, I still watch it. I never get tried of it. It will be very hard for people with a sense of humor not to find this movie funny.

But my sister's big obsession was with Interview with the Vampire and Legends of the Fall, and to me, Legends of the Fall just looked boring, and I never wanted to see it. But on New Year's day, my friend and I were flipping through the channels and came across Legends of the Fall and decided to go ahead and see what it was about. So we watched it and I have to say that actually it was a good movie. It was beautifully shot, thanks to Edward Zwick's talent as a director, and created this into a wonderful story. Also the performances were absolutely terrific, the cast really made the story a pleasure to watch.The Ludlow brothers are close and have a wonderful brotherhood, but as adults, their lives take on separate directions. Tristan and Samuel go to war and Samuel is tragically killed. Tristan comes back home to his other brother, Alfred, and his father, William, and Alfred has taken an interest into politics as well as trying to woo his crush, Susannah, but she loves Tristand and has an affair with him. But Tristan soon leaves to discover himself and when he returns, he finds out that Susannah has married Alfred. Tristan then marries a beautiful woman, Isabel, and has two beautiful children with her, but when tragedy strikes again, Tristan wants revenge and Alfred must learn the meaning of loyalty and brotherhood.Legends of the Fall is really a good movie I would say. I think besides the way it's shot, it's the performances that really make the film a good one. Because we know that this film could have been really boring, but thanks to Zwick, he made it into one of the semi-over looked films of 1994. Aidan and Anthony pull in the great performances though, especially Aidan, he was so heart breaking, he makes you hate his character and then love him again. I would recommend Legends of the Fall, for those who appreciate film, this is a good one to watch.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2008","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1994, my big sister had this huge thing for Brad Pitt, well, every woman did, I think it was Brad's hair, the hair every woman wanted to have, lol.

I for one may be blind to that. It might not be the movie for me. I'm not saying it's bad since I know a bad movie when I see one; it's just that I found many parts of the movie completely dull and boring. The storyline is complexed and I'll admit, I didn't understand all of it simply because it didn't keep me interested. If a movie's story does not capture my interest, I will take some points off for that because that's what movies are suppose to do.One thing I did like about the film is that it mixed the storyline up. As an example, the beginning scene in the movie was actually near the end in the real time line. It basically mixed all the story lines up. They didn't go in the right order. Pulp Fiction is structured around three distinct but interrelated story lines in Tarantino's conception. However I had mixed feelings about each of the main three story lines. The main story that involved Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife was extremely boring in my opinion. I'm not into watching people do drugs and talk because that's what most of that scene was. Only the end of that story was a little interesting. That whole scene overall dragged on for nearly a half hour which really killed some of my interest.The Gold Watch scene gave me mixed feelings. The beginning where Butch was with his girlfriend at the hotel was again very dull and boring. Once he left the apartment and you see the mess he gets into, it gets a little more interesting. The crazy scene that follows almost made the movie worth watching. Finally, the very end of the movie, which actually started at the beginning(yes it maybe a little confusing)was probably the most interesting scene in the movie. Overall, the plot is very complexed. Many people may like the story's setup and content. I for one am not exactly crazy about watching people do drugs for 20 minutes; then watch people talk in a hotel for another 20.

Just the story needs some work, I wouldn't really recommend the movie though, it's just alright, I probably won't see it again though.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"16 January 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When the Russians launched Sputnik in 1957, it was something the world viewed with great trepidation. If they had the ability to put something man-made into space, it didn't bode well for the future of the free world. The Cold War was still very much in effect, and most people thought of Sputnik as something to cast a shadow over their freedom.But Homer Hickam saw something different. He saw Sputnik not as an end in itself. But a beginning. A whole new chapter in human history was being written right before our very eyes. The people just couldn't see beyond their own fears.October Sky is one of those surprisingly charming films that even when you sense the film is tugging on the heartstrings, it doesn't feel like manipulation. Perhaps because I'm a sucker for films about the space race. Or maybe because October Sky comes from one of my favourite directors, Joe Johnston.Johnston is a filmmaker best known for rousing action\/adventure films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Rocketeer. In fact The Rocketeer could almost be construed as the same film but in a slightly lesser developed form. So OS comes as a nice change of pace. Its more leisurely than Johnston's norm but that's OK. The film has excitement alright. Just of a different sort.When Homer first spots Sputnik gliding through the night sky, it is a sight that will change his life forever. Up until that point, Homer's future was very clearly mapped out for him. Once he graduates from high school, he's supposed to work in the local coal mines. Like everybody else.The mine is the town's main source of income. So its very important they get as many workers down there as they can. And for Homer, the pressure is on him especially because his father happens to be the pit foreman.John Hickam (a flawless Chris Cooper) doesn't want his son wasting his time building rockets. Homer knows his future is tied up in engineering, but John thinks the needs of their town are more important.Homer refuses to accept a life in the mines, and convinces a few other boys at school to join together and build a rocket. But the Rocket Boys (as they come to be known) face stiff opposition from just about everybody. The school principal. Their peers. And especially John.October Sky, based on the manuscript by Homer Hickam Jr is one of the nicest films you'll catch on TV. Its slightly underrated, even if its no classic. But it has a really excellent cast. And it does a surprisingly good job of sidestepping the clichés inherently buried in the narrative.There does seem a slight predictability to the film. Things like the stern, traditionalist father. The idealistic young man who dreams of the future. Opposition from all sides. The helpful teacher who's more enlightened than the rest.But surprisingly, the film succeeds more often than the above paragraph would suggest. Johnston has chosen a fine cast to remedy any possible uncertainties. Although Jake Gyllenhaal didn't make public notice until Donnie Darko, he more than proves his worth as Homer. October Sky was Gyllenhaal's first starring role. And already he shows his budding talent. Gyllenhaal always projects a fierce determination hidden behind an amiable expression. In Donnie Darko it was particularly startling. Homer of course is a complete opposite, but Gyllenhaal channels it into his ambition to prove his worth, and make a life for himself outside of a coal mine.Joe Johnston is always notable for drawing out strong, gracious performances from children, and he seems equally at home directing teenagers as well. Any scene with the Rocket Boys is thankfully devoid of over-sentiment and slush. Sometimes it threatens to. But it never boils over.And in regards to the adult cast, they do their part as well. Laura Dern is always good value and so she is here as Miss Riley, the schoolteacher open to Homer's ambitions. Her terminal illness does seem to emerge too quickly though, given a curious lack of buildup by Johnston.But its Chris Cooper who steals the show as John. He does wonders with the role of a father set in his ways. He never seems a one-dimensional tyrant. There are subtleties in his acting if you look hard enough. He may disapprove of Homer's activities, but I think hidden in his words is a grudging respect for Homer. And Cooper shows all this with a prolonged silence or a casual glance.Don't forget, John never outright stands in the way of Homer. He could have done any number of times and refuses. I think John is concerned Homer may be setting himself up to be disappointed. And wants to spare him that. John may have had ambitions at a young age too, and circumstances robbed him of that dream. Perhaps he wants to save Homer the same fate. Its all very fascinating when you think about it. A quite faultless performance on Cooper's part.There is the inevitable happy ending. And a few inevitable bumps in the road to get there. But October Sky is a fine, unpatronising film well worth your time. Plenty of 50s tunes to enjoy. And a nice consideration for the plight of the working man, and achieving what may seem hopeless dreams.

Ferris Bueller, the executor of the plan, decides to fake an illness in order to trick his parents into taking the day off. Ferris convinces his sick friend, Cameron to also take the day off and bring his fathers Ferrari. As soon as the two unite they form a plan to bail Ferris' girlfriend Sloane out of school. The principal, Ed Rooney, is aware of Ferris' rebellious manner and is hot on Ferris' tail to expose him for wagging school. Fortunately Ferris is always a step ahead of Rooney as he gallivants around the city. Ferris' sister Jeanie, jealous that Ferris is able to get away with ditching school on a regular basis, decides to catch Ferris in the act when she finds out the entire school thinks Ferris has come down with a serious illness. Ferris and his friends throughout the day manage to dine at a prestigious restaurant, attend an art gallery, view a baseball match, and sing at a street parade and other escapades in which he almost encounters his father. Cameron, Ferris' friend, is a neurotic individual who is eventually set over the top after the miles on his fathers Ferrari are raised significantly by the hoodlums in charge of taking care of it throughout the day. Eventually he is set into a catatonic state of mind before the entire car is destroyed set off by his mental angst. Cameron learns a valuable lesson in life following these incidents. Following the days events, it's eventually time to head home. Ferris' sister Jeanie learns not to stick her nose where it doesn't belong and Ed Rooney is in the end outsmarted by Ferris and Jeanie. Ferris achieves his goal of having an enjoyable and fulfilling day. Many genres of music are featured in the film, notable songs are Twist and Shout by The Beatles (lip synched by Ferris at the parade), Oh Yeah by Yellow which is played throughout the film, Star Wars is parodied with the main theme song when the men in charge of the Ferrari accelerate it into the air.Interesting camera shots include a long shot of Ferris on the top of the float singing at the parade, a mid shot approximately 24 minutes into the film of Ferris and Cameron's feet right before they gaze upon the Ferrari, mid shots of the dull looks on the children's faces in school at the beginning of the film. Hughes took his time when editing. Edited scenes such as Jeanie triple kicking Rooney came out nicely. There is also another scene where Ferris has disguised himself and he kisses Sloane while Rooney is watching. The kiss was in fact brief and because of the editing which switches back to shots of Rooney and the kiss, it is made to appear longer then it is. Other interesting production elements are the fake 1960 Ferrari which in actual fact was worth $350,000 at the time. Insurance for the car to stand still most of the time on a movie set would cost a fortune. Instead they had three cars with fiberglass bodies using the framework of a mustang. One for the stunt was a higher powered vehicle, one which was driven by Ferris and his friends, and one which was just a shell to be driven through the window towards the end of the film. Acting is the film is outstanding at times the characters express more through actions and expressions rather than dialogue. Alan Ruck is able to project his voice in an amusing manner for one particular prank call scene which is exceptional, Mathew Broderick is fantastic in his portrayal of a confident and charismatic young teen and Mia Sara is also strong on performance. Jeffery Jones plays a convincing principal who seems to be more of a villain. Jennifer Grey accurately portrays the jealous and spiteful sister. Overall the acting is excellent and the supporting casts are great. Charlie Sheen's brief cameo appearance as a drug addict is even brilliant.My favorite part of the film would have to be where Ferris takes Sloane and Cameron to the street parade and jumps on board the float and dedicates a lip synched solo to Cameron a young boy who thinks he hasn't seen anything good today. Ferris gets everybody dancing in a lively performance of Twist and Shout by the Beatles, with the band. This is my favorite scene because it's quite entertaining and shows just how much Ferris is able to influence those around him. There is a choreographed scene of the crowd dancing which is also quite good. My overall opinion of the film is that it is a highly entertaining film and definitely one of the greatest teen films ever made. Overall the scenes are well put together showing us what one can accomplish in one day with the right mind. The humor in the film works on a scale of different ages which makes this one suitable for the entire family. The acting and shots are definitely strong aspects making the film a highly enjoyable one. I give this film four stars and highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to get into films of the teen genre.

Eventually he is set into a catatonic state of mind before the entire car is destroyed set off by his mental angst. Cameron learns a valuable lesson in life following these incidents. Following the days events, it's eventually time to head home. Ferris' sister Jeanie learns not to stick her nose where it doesn't belong and Ed Rooney is in the end outsmarted by Ferris and Jeanie. Ferris achieves his goal of having an enjoyable and fulfilling day. Many genres of music are featured in the film, notable songs are Twist and Shout by The Beatles (lip synched by Ferris at the parade), Oh Yeah by Yellow which is played throughout the film, Star Wars is parodied with the main theme song when the men in charge of the Ferrari accelerate it into the air.Interesting camera shots include a long shot of Ferris on the top of the float singing at the parade, a mid shot approximately 24 minutes into the film of Ferris and Cameron's feet right before they gaze upon the Ferrari, mid shots of the dull looks on the children's faces in school at the beginning of the film. Hughes took his time when editing. Edited scenes such as Jeanie triple kicking Rooney came out nicely. There is also another scene where Ferris has disguised himself and he kisses Sloane while Rooney is watching. The kiss was in fact brief and because of the editing which switches back to shots of Rooney and the kiss, it is made to appear longer then it is. Other interesting production elements are the fake 1960 Ferrari which in actual fact was worth $350,000 at the time. Insurance for the car to stand still most of the time on a movie set would cost a fortune. Instead they had three cars with fiberglass bodies using the framework of a mustang. One for the stunt was a higher powered vehicle, one which was driven by Ferris and his friends, and one which was just a shell to be driven through the window towards the end of the film. Acting is the film is outstanding at times the characters express more through actions and expressions rather than dialogue. Alan Ruck is able to project his voice in an amusing manner for one particular prank call scene which is exceptional, Mathew Broderick is fantastic in his portrayal of a confident and charismatic young teen and Mia Sara is also strong on performance. Jeffery Jones plays a convincing principal who seems to be more of a villain. Jennifer Grey accurately portrays the jealous and spiteful sister. Overall the acting is excellent and the supporting casts are great. Charlie Sheen's brief cameo appearance as a drug addict is even brilliant.My favorite part of the film would have to be where Ferris takes Sloane and Cameron to the street parade and jumps on board the float and dedicates a lip synched solo to Cameron a young boy who thinks he hasn't seen anything good today. Ferris gets everybody dancing in a lively performance of Twist and Shout by the Beatles, with the band. This is my favorite scene because it's quite entertaining and shows just how much Ferris is able to influence those around him. There is a choreographed scene of the crowd dancing which is also quite good. My overall opinion of the film is that it is a highly entertaining film and definitely one of the greatest teen films ever made. Overall the scenes are well put together showing us what one can accomplish in one day with the right mind. The humor in the film works on a scale of different ages which makes this one suitable for the entire family. The acting and shots are definitely strong aspects making the film a highly enjoyable one. I give this film four stars and highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to get into films of the teen genre.

Needless to say; watching it now for perhaps the first time proper since that cinema viewing hasn't made me like it or love it any more than I perhaps did then but it hasn't made me dislike it any more, either.The Lion King was made at a time when Disney was booming. The 1980s wasn't exactly a great decade for Disney but what with The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and the best picture Oscar nominated Beauty and the Beast; Disney were thriving. So there was an expectancy behind The Lion King and watching it now, it does deliver on an entertaining and well told and well animated level. I laughed at some of the jokes, couldn't remember certain scenes and generally enjoyed it. But the film does feel like it is orientated at children more than adults. The general synopsis for the film does not rely on a love story like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast did but rather uses a theme of self discovery with a rather meek love plot entwined between Simba and Nala; the two lead lions of the narrative. This would suggest more of an infant target audience as the film would like to think it is educating young ones on how to face your fears and beat your demons etc.But this isn't a criticism, merely an observation. Aladdin was as routine love story as you could ever get but it included the genie as a post-modern stroke of genius that made the adults laugh. Similarly; the complicated love story in Beauty and the Beast, full of emotions and situations kids won't have experienced yet had the items of furniture that amused and entertained on another level. In The Lion King, there is no get out clause; there is no escape hatch that the film can rely on to get across to two demographics. I suppose if Simba's journey of enlightenment is supposed to be aimed at adults then the buddy combination of Timon and Pumbaa are supposed to be kid orientated but I didn't see it entirely this way &#150; yes Timon and Pumbaa seem adult enough but they remain too lacking in everything else what with the emphasis of toilet humour cropping up every now and again.Like most Disney films, The Lion King suffers from its issues with race, religion, class and\/or gender. People will deny it but that's only because they cannot see it. The lions in The Lion King are golden brown, beautiful and voiced by Americans; all apart from Scar who is brown with a black mane. It's no surprise that he is the 'evil' one and is consequently English, voiced by Jeremy Irons. There is also the shameful representation through the hyenas one is Mexican, one is a mute retard and the other may well be voiced by an American (Goldberg) but in truth; the character is a big, black, loud, 'man-eater' of an animal. Watch Aladdin when the title character steals a loaf of bread and the representation of the fat black woman who hugs him whilst saying the line Still I think he's ravishing! There is also the character of Timon who is the victim of Disney's most cruel representation. Timon's gender is confused; it is neither male nor female and his name is too ambiguous to be classed as one or the other. Timon is extremely effeminate and embodies very 'touchy-feely' traits around Pumbaa; frequently stroking his rear-end and stroking his nose and general facial area. Timon's voice actor Nathan Lane is also homosexual and I read that the line towards the end where the distraction tactic of 'dressing in drag and doing the hula' was improvised, further embodying homosexual traits on this character. Now; whilst my specific class\/race\/sexuality\/etc. wasn't targeted to extremities (Scar was English, like I am but I'll look past that); I still feel these sorts of things are highly unnecessary in a film I've already established is child orientated.The characters are also obsessed with food. There is frequent reference to food and hunger. The lionesses report no food which angers Scar, Pumbaa belches before announcing that he is 'starved' and the Hyenas live in a constant state of looking where the next meal will come from. There is also heavy emphasis on how Timon and Pumbaa get by on nourishment by eating bugs. Perhaps this is reference to Africa's state of affairs regarding health and food with the Ethiopian humanitarian crisis of the 1980s fresh in memory. The Lion King also suffers in its obvious plotting the hero has a wrong belief but needs a mentor to come out of the blue to aid him in his correct quest which I found a little forced and unoriginal for a film made in 1994. But the message about the 'circle of life' and the ideas that you confront your demons when required is good with Mufasa himself saying I'm only brave when I need to be; I don't go looking for trouble. The film clearly saying that picking fights is not a good idea.The Lion King also has time to throw in a domestic relationship featuring Simba and Nala. They meet up; reminisce; Simba shows her around and to 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight', they make love before breaking up the morning afterwards. Incidentally, the sex is witnessed by Timon who displays disappointment and disgust. The Lion King is a somewhat strange film but has fun with its plot and its characters and is an enjoyable animation film on the whole with one or two tragic scenes particularly standing out in memory for me; both then in the cinema and now.

It is arguably his greatest work, and it will inarguably live forever as the ultimate execution of his film-making style.The ultra-tight, choppy editing of long-time Scorsese collaborator only adds to the excitement of this riveting tale of small-time New York mobsters spanning three decades. Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) grew up around the mob figures he eventually identified himself with, and became one of them at a very early age. He became partners and friends with local legend Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), also at a young age.Liotta's performance is one of a man that is blinded by material excess and permanently shaped by the violent and assertive people with which he surrounded himself. He rises, falls, rises again and falls again all within the 150-minute narrative of the film, and his story is the epitome of the old adage crime doesn't pay. De Niro is subdued, yet stunning as Jimmy Conway. His lack of attention from pundits and fans is only because he disappeared so deeply into the role, you weren't aware you were watching a Robert De Niro performance. Pesci is nothing short of extraordinary as Tommy DeVito, an irrationally violent man who abuses his abilities as a mob figure to the point of going too far. He meets his comeuppance in one of the great build-ups and payoffs of all time.Scorsese's oft-visited themes of moral ambivalence and male assertiveness have never been so prevalent, and every single shot of the film has a purpose. The tracking shot of Henry and wife Karen entering the Copacabana nightclub still remains one of the great all-time long takes, as we are introduced to his world just as Karen is. There are several great sequences, including a montage of dead bodies seamlessly set to Layla and Henry's coked-up follies in the May 5, 1980 sequence that demonstrates the virtuosic vision and talent that Scorsese possesses.It's a crime that Scorsese was not awarded the Oscar for directing and best picture. It was undoubtedly the best film of 1990, and is arguably the best film of the 1990s. It is a seminal piece of film-making that influenced the VCR generation of Tarantino, P.T.

I can understand why so many hardcore Batman fans didn't like it, because of the new direction this was heading, but I also think that many just bash it because of the overall bad reviews. I understand that Batman and Robin is not as good as the first two movies, but a lot better than the dreadful Batman Forever. What I liked about it? Well, first and foremost I think George Clooney was a good choice. He really did a great job (Keaton is still the best). He was way better than Val Kilmer (which I love in so many other roles). I also liked Chris O'Donnell as Robin. I think they had great chemistry as the evil fighting duo. Way better than in Batman Forever anyways. The only problem was that they made him so wimpy. It was annoying sometimes. The best thing about Batman and Robin are the villains. Poison Ivy, perfect! Uma Thurman was exquisite as the femme fatal. She didn't overact IMO. She always seemed to know how far she could go with her character. I feared we might would have another Jim Carrey debacle on our hands, but she really knew how to pull it off and had some pretty cool lines. Arnold Schwarzenegger was hilarious. I am from Austria so of course I am a little biased. The only thing that bothered me where the many one-liners. It was a little over the top. Bane, well I agree that he is not the Bane from the comics, but this is not Schumachers fault. Wanner Brothers forced him to use a popular and well-known villain as Poison Ivy's sidekick. This way they could sell more toys. To bring in Batgirl wasn't the smartest move, since everyone had to get used to the Batman and Robin team first. It felt like all those different characters were stuffed down our throat. This again, was not Schumachers fault. Warner Brothers forced him to use Batgirl, since they wanted to sell as many action figures as possible. Alicia Silverstone is a very good actress, but in Batman and Robin she seemed to be on heavy medication. It really was an overall bad performance. I could picture her as Batgirl but she seemed somehow distracted. I once read somewhere that Alicia didn't even have to audition. She got the role because of her contract with Paramount (?). Many people didn't like that Batgirl was suddenly the niece of Alfred. Since being forced by Warner Brothers to use her in the first place, this was the only way Schumacher could have done it. There where already too many characters and if he would have went by the comic there would have been a lot more explanation necessary. This way also Alfred got a larger role, so znder the given circumstances I think this problem was solved in a very uncomplicated way. What bothered a lot ofpeople were all the shots of the gadgets and the costumes. Again,Warner Brothers wanted to use this as a commercial for selling all this as toys. Some shots really felt like a commercial, but Joel Schumacher didn't decide to do it this way. Warner Brothers wanted to make this more children friendly to appeal to a larger audience. All the toys were already made before the movie was even halfway finished. Schumacher had to stick to everything studio bosses decided. He just tried to make the best of it and I think he did.All in all, yes it looks like a cartoon, bright colors and the settings are over the top and the movie has a campy look, but with all the pressure from studio bosses, who where only trying to exploit the movie as much as possible, I think Joel Schumacher did a good job. People should just watch it for what it tried to be. Mindless action and fun. BTW, the special effects still look great nowadays.I know a many think Batman and Robin was a flop, but they are mistaken. It almost doubled its production cost. I know that a movie is only considered ''a hit'' if it doubles its budget, but there IS something in the middle. Nowadays it seems every movie has to be a major hit otherwise it is immediately a failure. Batman and Robin WAS a successful movie.

It's a typical Woo movie, which shows once more that he is a real master in making action movies. His action directing in this movie is really flawless.The movie is basically non-stop action, with a lot of gun fights, explosion and fights. But it's not just a mindless action-flick, it also pays lots of attention to its story and development and interesting character building. The emotions within this movie are also really truly powerful, especially toward the ending.The characters are really strong within this movie. Yun-Fat Chow plays a great and intriguing 'good' hit-man, who is being chased by cop Danny Lee. The whole game and chase and the eventual teaming up between those two is done great. They are like each other and also fall for the same woman (at least that was the original concept) but are on the different side of the law. They have a certain respect for each other, which makes it all the more meaningful and interesting to follow. You also really start to care about those characters. The movie is also filled with plenty of other interesting and backstabbing characters, cops, gangsters and fellow hit-men. It's not hard to see why John Woo in his early days was often called the Asian Martin Scorsese. But it's of course mostly the action that makes this movie such an amazing one to watch. There is plenty of Woo-ism present, so expect lots of slow-motion and stylish action, including Mexican stand-offs, running, car chases, boat chases, flying doves. Yes, this movie has got it truly all. There are a couple of sequences toward the end that really stand out and are among the best the genre has to offer. Yeah, it's a real testosterone driven guy flick, with also typical important guy themes such as loyalty, bravery and friendship in it, with added to that a whole load of bullets and killings. The body count of this movie is 120, all being committed by about 3 guys, that should really say something about this movie.It's a movie with a great style.

The question was posed by one of my old partners, a guy whom I had known for about 25 years at that time. Let's just call him Officer Elmo Aymee. (Much like DRAGNET, The names have been changed to protect the Innocent.As for an answer (there were about 6 of us in the Doughnut Shop then) it was myself who finally answered Well, Elmo, CITIZEN KANE is considered to be the greatest film of all time, and this is its 50th Anniversary. Without much of a hesitation, Elmo responded; Yeah well, I'm not watchin' it because I don't like Orson Welles! That was sure as about a tough and unexpected a reply that could be returned; but I did my best to maintain the 'high' level of this discussion by saying, Well then you must not have seen THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979); as it had Welles in a Cameo, toward the end. But now seriously, folks, it is no exaggeration to heap such praise on the Film. And it is certainly not considered to be puffing to bestow such a title as the Greatest Film on this one, singularly conceived and so constructed movie. We must remember that at that time, circa 1940, the young Mr. Welles was considered to be a young genius with his Star still rising in the Hollywood Zodiac. His accomplishments in varying theatrical areas were undeniably superb, being in the classification corresponding to Academia's designation as Suma Cum Laude, or in the Queen's own tongue, With Highest Honors.* We of course know of his famous and infamous WAR OF THE WORLDS national broadcast over CBS Radio in October, 1938 as a weekly installment of The Mercury Theatre of the Air programme. Everybody's heard of that and there was even a Made-for-Television Movie telling the story. But the accomplishments of the young Orson Welles date back much further than that; extending back to the time before the New York Stage and Radio days. .At 14 years of age as a Prep School Freshman, young Master Welles was writing and producing plays which were staged at the Woodstock Music Hall, in Woodstock, Illinois. This was nothing unusual, for the talented adolescent lad. This sort of thing had become expected of him and no surprise in those days in New York with partnership with John Houseman in the Federal Theatre Project.So when Orson was being courted by RKO Radio Pictures to ink a standard, Rich & Famous Hollywood contract; Welles would continually make what would surely be deemed as being outrageous demands, but RKO apparently double crossed him. They gave in.

We all know that! So let's waive this part. All in favor signify by saying, Aye! All opposed signify with No! The Ayes have it. So, on with the Show, Schultz! For such an outstanding example of the Cinematic Arts, the underlying structure of the story & screenplay is rather simple, amazingly non-intricate even. When all is cleared away, what we have left is a good, old-fashioned Detective Story. Sure, we have no hero with names the likes of Sherlock, Marlowe, Spade, Blackie or Philo. And there are no colorful supporting characters to help solve the mystery. There's no mysterious murder, but there is the mystery of the identity. Just who or what is Rosebud and just what did this mean to Charles Foster Kane on his deathbed? The non-frilled structure of the Detective Story would certainly not be enhanced by the use of flashbacks, for the flashback is an almost indispensable ingredient of the way a detective or other investigative person uses by way of the interview. But again, how does an otherwise normal and standard story-type command such great acclaim and accolades? The secret lies in the methods of story-telling by flashback with the most colorful of overlays.

The story is also seen from a different view point each time some re-visitation occurs.All of the scenes no matter where they come in the story, in present or flashback, are accompanied and successfully underscored with the original score of themes, queues and incidental music, all specially ordered and special delivery sent to the movie audience by the Maestro, himself, Bernard Hermann.As a result of the Mercury Theatre Company's relocating out to the left coast it truly does appear that Tinsel town would never be the same.

His accomplishments in varying theatrical areas were undeniably superb, being in the classification corresponding to Academia's designation as Suma Cum Laude, or in the Queen's own tongue, With Highest Honors.* We of course know of his famous and infamous WAR OF THE WORLDS national broadcast over CBS Radio in October, 1938 as a weekly installment of The Mercury Theatre of the Air programme. Everybody's heard of that and there was even a Made-for-Television Movie telling the story. But the accomplishments of the young Orson Welles date back much further than that; extending back to the time before the New York Stage and Radio days. .At 14 years of age as a Prep School Freshman, young Master Welles was writing and producing plays which were staged at the Woodstock Music Hall, in Woodstock, Illinois. This was nothing unusual, for the talented adolescent lad. This sort of thing had become expected of him and no surprise in those days in New York with partnership with John Houseman in the Federal Theatre Project.So when Orson was being courted by RKO Radio Pictures to ink a standard, Rich & Famous Hollywood contract; Welles would continually make what would surely be deemed as being outrageous demands, but RKO apparently double crossed him. They gave in. So, it was armed with guarantee of absolute Artistic control and an essentially a the skies are the limit budgetary considerations, that he headed West; taking his company of players and Musical Director, Mr. Bernard Hermann, along for the ride and appointment with destiny.OUR STORY&#133;&#133;&#133;.Aw, c'mon! We all know that! So let's waive this part. All in favor signify by saying, Aye! All opposed signify with No! The Ayes have it. So, on with the Show, Schultz! For such an outstanding example of the Cinematic Arts, the underlying structure of the story & screenplay is rather simple, amazingly non-intricate even. When all is cleared away, what we have left is a good, old-fashioned Detective Story. Sure, we have no hero with names the likes of Sherlock, Marlowe, Spade, Blackie or Philo. And there are no colorful supporting characters to help solve the mystery. There's no mysterious murder, but there is the mystery of the identity. Just who or what is Rosebud and just what did this mean to Charles Foster Kane on his deathbed? The non-frilled structure of the Detective Story would certainly not be enhanced by the use of flashbacks, for the flashback is an almost indispensable ingredient of the way a detective or other investigative person uses by way of the interview. But again, how does an otherwise normal and standard story-type command such great acclaim and accolades? The secret lies in the methods of story-telling by flashback with the most colorful of overlays. As the story continues to unfold, it goes over the same ground already covered, but it always takes us a little more along the way. The story is also seen from a different view point each time some re-visitation occurs.All of the scenes no matter where they come in the story, in present or flashback, are accompanied and successfully underscored with the original score of themes, queues and incidental music, all specially ordered and special delivery sent to the movie audience by the Maestro, himself, Bernard Hermann.As a result of the Mercury Theatre Company's relocating out to the left coast it truly does appear that Tinsel town would never be the same. First of all, Mr. Welles' own Star quickly increased in size to that of a Nova and then to the status of a Super-Nova; before its explosion and crashing down to Earth. It would be years before Orson's brief flirtation with life at the top was gradually supplanted with the appreciation with performances in films like THE STRANGER (1946), THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1947) THE THIRD MAN (1949) and scores of other roles over the years.And over the years whatever the role that Mr. Orson Welles had in whatever film project, or Television appearance, he always did his best in giving his all. And that includes THE MUPPET MOVIE.

I haven't seen Joe Esterhasz's Telling Lies in America in a few years, but I remember that it was a good movie, Esterhasz's reputation notwithstanding.It goes like this. Karchy Jonas (Renfro) is a Hungarian immigrant in Ohio in the early '60s. He has trouble fitting in with the world around him, partly due to his trouble pronouncing a th sound, and feels disenchanted with the Catholic church that he and his father Istvan (Maximilian Schell) attend. But when he hooks up with DJ Billy Magic (Kevin Bacon), his luck changes...with some strings attached.I interpret this movie as sort of the flip side of American Graffiti. In that case, they were all the same ilk and all fit in with everything. In this case, Karchy tries to fit in but has trouble doing it, and so his only option is to hook up with the shady Billy. More than just a nostalgia piece - though there are some oldies - we see Karchy's inner conflict between his desire to be a modern American, and trying to maintain his ties with his past.Overall, I recommend this one. I think that it would have been kind of fun to play that trick with the confession booth. And just remember what people tell you about Spanish flower.Also starring Calista Flockhart.

I didn't know that David Lynch both directed and wrote this movie until years later, but when I did, everything made perfect sense. The author of the book chose the Wrong person to do a screenplay of it! Lynch wrote the movie not caring if it was coherent or made sense to the audience. He directed all of the scenes to be bizarre for the sake of bizarre, and off-putting for the sake of itself. In short, he directed it for himself, not caring what the audience would think. This works if the director of a film is realizing his vision and his vision happens to be accessible to the public, but Lynch's vision and mentality are anything but that. There are artists that paint for themselves, and have contempt for what viewers think. I don't respect these people, because they're not artists; the definition of art is that it communicates, to a purpose. Art is by definition a form of communication. Here, Lynch does not communicate, nor cares to. The result is incoherent, off-putting, repellent, and contemptuous of its audience; in other words, the film is pure Lynch.If you happen to have Lynch's peculiar mentality, with a preference for bizarre visuals without context, you'll think the movie is brilliant. If you like a movie to have more than empty style, if you want it to have substance, meaning, hope and a storyline of some kind, with characters you care about, you have described something that Lynch does not care about, and will not produce. This film is the most pure example of that; he eventually met his karma with Twin Pinks, when his nonsensical and bizarre scenes reached the point where it became clear he was jerking around his audience to no purpose with no plot in mind, and the series was canceled suddenly at the height of its popularity; a singular thing to happen to a popular series I think.Thankfully, Lynch has been on a decline ever since, and people have finally caught on to his Picasso-like style of painting something bizarre for its own sake, and letting audiences read into it whatever they want, with no real direction or statement intended or cared about. If there was ever a movie that deserves to be lost deep under what it is named for, it's this one. There is only one mystery that remains that is a big one; how did a screenplay this incoherent, horribly written (especially the dialogue), and meaningless get approved with a budget of $40 million?
