I did not remember it well upon this new viewing, but I did remember enjoying it and loving Milla Jovovich's performance and character, and was excited to see it again. What I got in store for me this time was something miraculous and much more extravagant than I could have imagined in all the ways a movie could be. I really do believe it is a wonderful, moving film with the right amounts of action, love, comedy and horror to be total entertainment from beginning to end and, in my case, a breathtaking experience.Let me start off by praising the cast. Everyone is full throttle on their characters. While Milla Jovovich is still one of my favorite aspects of the movie, I really enjoyed Bruce Willis, surprisingly more than almost any other movie I have seen him in to this day, as well as Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker who were hilarious and entertaining as well, and all the cast gave great attitude and likability to their characters which made the film work more than it would have if the cast would have been careless or not casted properly. The script, while probably nothing special to some, I thought was fresh, fun and satisfying in the utmost sense and provided a lot of material to work with. The scenes are captivating and either fast or slow depending on what the movie is wanting you to take in at the time, which ultimately works for the better to help everyone understand what is going on plot- wise.One of the most mesmerizing and enchanting scenes for me is the performance of the Diva Plavalaguna. I was astonished by how amazing the scene came off to me while watching. It is made out in the movie to be one of the most beautiful experiences the characters have been through, and in all seriousness, for me at least, it was. I thought it was excellently directed with beautiful vocals and the beat halfway through the vocals is catchy and I just enjoy the scene so insanely much. Some other great scenes include the climax and a scene close to the beginning including some excellent first chemistry between Jovovich and Willis's characters in a cop chase. I hope I have expressed my newfound love for this movie in a strong enough manner to encourage anyone to see it. It took another viewing for me to realize how excellent of a movie this is, so maybe it's haters that underrate it will give it another chance in time. It is an overlooked gem, and I highly enjoy it in many ways.

Here's a movie that probably inspired the more recent flicks, The Devil's Advocate and The Ninth Gate. It has really good acting and very solid dialog, but the pacing is a little off and the plot revelations come very late in the film and rather clumsily at that.Mickey Rourke is really good. His character is pretty entertaining to watch, likable and revolting at the same time. The exchanges between him and most other characters are pretty good and Rourke's guy Angel gets in a lot of good lines. The homage to '40s noir is really excellent, the sets are legit and the music is moody and eerie and never lets up. This stuff carries the movie pretty far. Really excellent is the elevator motif and its recurring symbolism. I liked that a lot. Those elevator shots ruled and were way ominous.In the DVD extra interview, the director mentions the book this movie is based on stays central to NYC. But the director took creative liberties with the film and moved part of the story to the Louisiana bayou. This is where the film slows down and becomes somewhat choppy. A lot of stuff happens with loose ends or nothing is revealed to the viewer until the final scenarios play out, those of which I personally did not find to be anything particularly mind-blowing. The first half of the flick breezes by, but the second half seems to take a really long time.Oh, also the occult elements are totally amateurish (not to mention the horrible, horrible special effects!). I mean, come on people! Consult someone who knows their satanic jazz before you start talking about black magick and whosits. Intriguingly, I felt the same way about The Devil's Advocate and The Ninth Gate, though I thought those films had much better pacing, even though the acting might not have been up to par.It's worth watching if you're a sucker for Rourke's acting chops, occult or alternative suspense\/horror flicks, or you just wanna see Rourke's hairless bum (I'm serious). The feeling of this movie reminded me of some of those decent H.P. Lovecraft movies (From Beyond) and the presence of a NYC-Bayou connection with the devil involved reminded me of that guitar\/blues-related Ralph Macchio vehicle, Crossroads, from around the same time as Angel Heart.

For many, he truly WAS Superman and Superman fans are currently having a hard time accepting newcomer Brandon Routh into the tights. I must admit I thought Routh was alright, but I digress.Superman The Movie begins with Jor-El (Marlon Brando) putting his infant son Kal-El into a spaceship and sending him off to Earth as, seeing as he's a cunning scientist, he has estimated that his home planet Krypton is going to blow up pretty soon. Sadly, the Kryptonian Council disagree with Jor-El's theory and refuse to evacuate everyone off the planet, therefore Jor-El sees sending off his son to another planet as the only way to preserve the Kryptonian race. Kal-El eventually reaches Earth after three years and is found by a kind farmer and his wife who adopt him and name him 'Clark Kent'. From then on, the infant will grow up to become the unstoppable superhero Superman (Christopher Reeve) after he eventually learns of his Kryptonian heritage.Good points? Firstly, Christopher Reeve manages to take on the role of both mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent and his heroic persona Superman extremely well. Reeve deliberately made Kent goofier and made him lose the S curl in his hair in order to stop anyone sussing out he and Superman are one and the same. On the other hand, Reeve made Clark's alter-ego Superman have that great S-Curl and of course, he loses the large glasses, displaying his handsome features more clearly. The differences between Clark and Superman are brilliant - its almost convincing. If I didn't know that Superman was actually Clark Kent, I reckon I'd be fooled.Secondly, the visual effects are great and are quite advanced for a film which was created in the seventies. It's hard to shake off the thrills as Superman flies about and the tension as the natural disasters occur late in the film (which is no spoiler I can tell you; trust me, there are more exciting things I could spoil you on in this movie, but I won't )).Thirdly, Marlon Brando's scenes are brilliant and you get a real sense of a God-Jesus relationship between Kal-El and Jor-El (which is what the Creative Consultant Tom Mankiewicz wanted). Whilst most of the credit should be directed towards the script, some should be given to Brando who says his lines in such a wise, posh manner as he declares to his son that you will never be alone, even in the face of our death and other great lines.One thing that bugs me with this film is the fact that it contains no real 'action' as such. During the film, a few robbers try to hit Superman with a crowbar which, of course, results in bad vibrations and Superman races through the earth's core effortlessly but there isn't much action. Don't get me wrong, I love character relationships as much as the next guy, but the Superman moments were dreadfully wasted. I'm not saying that there should've been a large kickass villain - Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) was great; instead of just chucking Supes into a swimming pool, perhaps he should've kicked the crap out of him a la Superman Returns? It would've provided much more action at least! In conclusion, Superman The Movie satisfies as a great superhero flick that taught many the lesson of how a superhero movie should be made. The love relationship between Superman and Lois is gripping as is Superman's rivalry with criminal mastermind Lex Luthor. One of my favourite parts of the movie is Clark Kent's relationship with Lois; he never fails to make me laugh! So should you watch this film or shouldn't you? If you're someone who appreciates a good film no matter what era it was made then go ahead. If you're someone who has been brainwashed already with mind-blowing CGI, then steer clear - want some modern day Superman action? Try Superman Returns featuring the talented Brandon Routh instead!

And using the stolen money to buy out the town and turn it into his own domain. And no ones wanting to arrest him because he's giving away free gold in the river. Dudley Do-Right must find a way to stop Snidley, and show the towns people that Snidley is still the villain.The movie has a load of pet peeves. Including script, plot, jokes, cast members, direction, and acting.The script needed to take away all the part that sucked and replace them with stuff that doesn't suck.The plot needed a better idea, but it didn't it made the movie unbearable within the first 1 minute of the movie.The 3\/4 of the jokes were either lame or stupid. Including the usage of the characters thinking there are vampires. It was like they couldn't think of anything that is funny.Cast members, really poor choices and unsuitable roles. Brandon Fraiser should of skip doing this film. While Alfred Molina had far better roles than this movie.Direction and production, the whole movie was unorganized and the director probably didn't care it was going to bomb the box office without even trying to make the flow of the movie any good. And I can tell they waisted so much money on the sets and the props for a movie that didn't even deserve to be on the silver screen.Overrall this movie was so bad the DVDs and Videos of it are very scarce at the retail stores cause no one in their right minds would buy a below C rated movie.Even if you manage to find it at your rental store, just be worn that it's no where close to being good.

For some inexplicable reason, I had it in my head for years that I wouldn't enjoy most of his work. Even sillier is the fact that the two Hitchcock films I HAD seen, 'Psycho' and 'The Birds,' were two of my favorite movies ever. Go figure. A few years ago, I rented two of his lesser offerings, 'Rope' and 'Marnie,' which seemed to confirm my suspicions. (Loved the giant backdrop of the battleship at the end of 'Marnie,' though.) Then this year, I have watched three bona fide Hitchcock classics- 'Rear Window,' 'Vertigo,' (both commented on elsewhere) and last night, 'North by Northwest.' Need I even point out that I am now a full-fledged Hitchcock devotee and am really looking forward to seeing the rest of his catalogue. As with 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window,' I had no preconceptions about 'North by Northwest' and it, like those other two, took me very much by surprise. It is an almost perfect blend of thriller and comedy, neither aspect overwhelming the other. In fact, they compliment each other beautifully. A favorite Hitchcockian theme is the misunderstood main character, in this case Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill (the 'O' doesn't stand for anything), and there has probably never been a more misunderstood character in the Hitchcock canon, maybe in all of cinema. Through the most casual mistake imaginable, a group of foreign spies come to believe Thornhill is actually George Kaplan, an American secret agent on their tail. Naturally, Thornhill's protestations to them (after they abduct him) that he is not Kaplan only serve to reinforce their conviction that he is hiding his true identity by pretending to adopt another. It would be an understatement to say Thornhill's life is never the same from that point on. James Mason and a very young Martin Landau portray the foreign (Soviet?) spies and they are perfect choices for their roles. Mason's character, Phillip Vandamm, reminds me quite a lot of one he would play over twenty years later, the defense attorney in 'The Verdict.' Both are well-spoken, quietly threatening, and absolutely cold-blooded while appearing very mannered and reasonable. Nobody does this type of role as well as Mason. After a point, it is revealed that in fact, there is no government agent named George Kaplan. He is a purely fictitious character created by US intelligence to provide cover for another, flesh and blood agent working the case. Thornhill accidentally and unintentionally being mistaken for Kaplan provides the US agency both risks and opportunities; in any event, they are not at all inclined to come to Thornhill's aid and clear him as that would endanger the real agent. Yes, it's complicated and I'm even leaving a lot of stuff out! The head of the intelligence unit, 'The Professor,' is wonderfully underplayed by reliable old Leo G. Carroll. Nothing surprises The Professor anymore, everything the agency does makes perfect sense... this is a man who long ago resigned himself to doing whatever is necessary to achieve, well, whatever is necessary. Because there's nothing else you can do, really. Carroll's conversations with Grant are priceless. The final piece in this convoluted puzzle is a strange woman named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who Thornhill meets on a train as he tries to evade both the spies and the police. Eve helps him and for a while her motivation is unclear; it seems as though she may just be a thrill-seeker who likes living dangerously by picking up strange men. There are some wonderfully provocative exchanges between her and Thornhill; I suspect these are about as far as a mainstream Hollywood film could go in 1959 but aside from that, they are beautifully written by Ernest Lehman and just as well-acted by Grant and Saint. There is a real chemistry between them and... what's the old saying? 'Sparks fly?' Cary Grant himself seems like an odd choice to play Thornhill. With his cultured mannerisms and one-of-a-kind manner of speech, he's hardly the Everyman James Stewart specialized in portraying for Hitchcock (Stewart was originally to play the role but was dropped in favor of Grant.) It is an unusual character for Grant, but one thing is for certain- he is much more convincing as a ladies' man than Stewart ever was. And a funny thing about the character of Thornhill is we really don't get to know him well before the identity mix-up, other than he's a fast-talking ad exec who's twice divorced. Everything else that we learn about him, we learn from his reactions and responses to the situation he finds himself in. He's far from being perfect or brilliant, but he is resourceful and seems to surprise even himself in the degree to which he is attracted to and cares for Eve. Lehman and Hitchcock have thrown everything including the kitchen sink into the plot of 'North by Northwest' and somehow it all works magically. No doubt this was a real crowd-pleaser back in 1959 and it managed that without compromising Hitchcock's talent and vision one iota. A wonderful, wonderful film.

The plot focuses on a group of young twenty-something local residents who enjoy snowboarding, getting drunk, getting high, and playing practical jokes on each other. Leading this group of likable misfits is a man named Rick Rambis (played by Jason London), who is unable to form a relationship with attractive snowboarding instructor Jenny (played by A.J. Cook) because he is still pining over a girl he met during a drunken binge in Cancun, Mexico.When wealthy businessman John Majors (played by veteran actor Lee Majors) steps in with the intent of buying Bull Mountain and turning it into an Aspen-like espresso and tofu resort that caters to rich yuppies, the residents of Bull Mountain begin to fear that they will all be fired and forced to leave town. Adding to the turmoil is the arrival of Majors' two daughters Inga, (played by former Playboy Playmate of the Year Victoria Silvstedt) a gorgeous blonde bombshell, and Anna (played by Caroline Dhavernas), Rick's old flame from his Cancun vacation.What follows is a slobs versus snobs comedy in the tradition of Caddyshack and Animal House as the locals try to stop their town from being taken over by Majors and his cronies. The film also directly parodies Casablanca in several parts, with Rick finding himself in a situation similar to Humphrey Bogart's most famous character from his most famous film.The acting or script will never win any awards, but the film does provide enough humor to make it worth a rental. It also features some truly impressive snowboarding footage performed by some of the top snowboarders in the world.

I previously made a joke about the DVD title, but I'm gonna skip it this time around. You know the plot (or maybe you don't, I don't know) a young couple has a car crash. Girl losses her head. The boy is a scientist and brings the head back to life. Since her body is mangled, he's going to get her a new one. How's he going to get a body? He's gonna kill a stripper or model and use their body. Now I'm a fan of somewhat bad sci-fi\/horror movies. This is one of those films you should never take seriously. It's one of those films you make fun of with your friends and have a good time. The problem for me was that I did take this movie seriously. Don't ask me why. At the time I just haven't seen too many of these cheesy 50's-60's sci-fi\/horror movies before. I not sure what I was expecting. Wait. I do know what I was expecting. I was expecting this would probably be a better movie than The Atomic Brain. I mean I buy this DVD with the word classics in it, the first film was just OK, so I'm thinking well the movies must get better with each film. Then I watch this and it's pretty much The Atomic Brain just not as good. I'm sorry. I know, I just go on these rants that go no where. I never said I'd be a great critic like Ebert. But I'm just trying to shed some insight into the situation. Back to the review. Like The Atomic Brain this just felt kinda slow. There was only one scene that I sort of liked. The cat fight scene. It was just unexpected and... yeah that's pretty much it. I don't know, maybe if I watch it again my rating for this film will go up. We'll see.

He's gonna kill a stripper or model and use their body. Now I'm a fan of somewhat bad sci-fi\/horror movies. This is one of those films you should never take seriously. It's one of those films you make fun of with your friends and have a good time. The problem for me was that I did take this movie seriously. Don't ask me why. At the time I just haven't seen too many of these cheesy 50's-60's sci-fi\/horror movies before. I not sure what I was expecting. Wait. I do know what I was expecting. I was expecting this would probably be a better movie than The Atomic Brain. I mean I buy this DVD with the word classics in it, the first film was just OK, so I'm thinking well the movies must get better with each film. Then I watch this and it's pretty much The Atomic Brain just not as good. I'm sorry. I know, I just go on these rants that go no where. I never said I'd be a great critic like Ebert. But I'm just trying to shed some insight into the situation. Back to the review. Like The Atomic Brain this just felt kinda slow. There was only one scene that I sort of liked. The cat fight scene. It was just unexpected and... yeah that's pretty much it. I don't know, maybe if I watch it again my rating for this film will go up. We'll see. So if you come across this movie watch it with friends, get some drinks, and bash the hell out of it.

But the leading lady playing Kate is just unbelievably wooden and there's a contrived subplot involving her and Stewart\/Kennedy which is quite unconvincing.
