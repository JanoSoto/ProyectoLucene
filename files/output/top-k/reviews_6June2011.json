John Williams' score is also fantastic and enhances the drama, not his most iconic of his scores, that would be a three-way tie between Jaws, Schindler's List and ET, it serves its purpose very well.

Seventeen years later Munson is a worthless drunk who sees his chance back in the hopes of a Amish man (Randy Quaid) who he plans on getting to Reno for a big tournament. This was the Farrelly brothers follow-up to DUMB AND DUMBER and unlike that film, this one here wasn't a huge hit out of the gate and instead it took sometime to build up its cult following. I'm really not sure why this movie didn't hit it big when first released but time has been quite friendly to the raunchy comedy as it's certainly one of the better comedies of its period thanks in large part to a terrific cast, a nice story and plenty of big laughs. I think the story itself really isn't anything too special as it's pretty much your typical road movie with the biggest difference being the bowling subplot. I think what really makes this film so special are the three leads who are so perfect in their roles that you really can't imagine anyone else in the world playing them. Harrelson has always been an underrated comic actor and he does a very good job here and manages to get laughs out of the smallest stuff. Just the way he laughs or looks at someone can get a laugh but even better is the way he sells some of the jokes including a hilarious bit on the Amish farm where he pretends to know what he's doing, which leads him to milking a bull. Quaid can play an idiot like no other and make it look very easy. The way he brings this Amish guy to life is a lot of fun to watch because you really do feel as if you're watching someone real and someone experiencing the real world for the first time. Murray does what only he can as that type of comedy isn't easy and I can't think of anyone else who can pull it off. Apparently Murray ad-libbed just about every word in the film and the way he pulls this character off really helps bring in the laughs. Vanessa Angel fits in with the boys very well and manages a few nice laughs of her own as does Chris Elliott in his brief scenes. I think the film would have benefited had it lost about ten-minutes worth of footage because at just under two-hours the film is a little too long. The stuff with Angel's boyfriend isn't the funniest bits here and everything that happens with him in the second half should have been left out. The great thing about KINGPIN is that it never really delivers the type of laugh that you might expect and that's why the film works so well. The movie will have a scene set up and you might think you know where it's going but the funny part is seeing how different it plays out.

I'm the sort of film buff that will watch film knowing nothing about it, it's the way I like to do it. If i'm going to watch a film I want to have my own interpretation and not have IGN, Empire or my friends for that matter tell me what I should and shouldn't watch. If someone has given a bad word-of-mouth about this film because it portrays real life and it's themes are confusing. Well the camera work and the use of diagetic sound are there to show you that when all these little personal conflicts come together there is going to be reactions. Watch the film, make your own thoughts and as you grow older, remember the moments when felt happy most in your life. A little bit of a hypocritical statement here, I would recommend this film to anyone that feels that life hasn't been quite what they wanted or not what they expected after finishing College (or High School) it's good story which could if they wanted say based on a true story because, the conflicts it provides us are real. In on way shape or form is this film sur-real or anti-realistic, yes it is a bit multi-strand. But people are stalked, people are homo-phobic and people experience a mid-life-crisis. As much as I want to ramble about Kevin Spacey's inspiring performance as Lester Burnham, I want to talk about the actress that went un-noticed in the 2000 Oscars (American Beauty was 1999 film meaning the Oscars for that year were in 2000, just in case you didn't know) Annette Bening. I hate to say it but it is true, the Academy made a mistake. The major moments with Annette could contend with the major moments with Kevin, the last shot which resonates with through neighbourhood, Alan can't help but edit these perfect moments in which we see everyone's lives effected, all though it doesn't actually show it is implied in the sub- text, the lake of sound and camera work. Also to notice is the mise-en- scene, each character has their own moment of isolation where all their possessions mean nothing to them and realise that they are in control of their own lives. Most notably to the focused character of Lester Burnham how he finally has the courage to do all the things he wanted to do, funny how this film portrays a man seizing control only when he's lost everything that in some cases mean more people in real life. So before you go throwing plates of asparagus and buying a brand new Pontiac fire-birds because you think i'm talking a load bull. I suggest next time you watch this or the first time you watch this film. Try and digest what Alan Ball is trying to show you, when your life is at its worst, take a step back and have a look around at what you are missing. Let's just say I could write about 10pages on this film (oh wait, I have already!) if you haven't yet discovered, this is my favourite film of all time, and I understand why the message can spark a distasteful feeling towards it, but please for me go back and sit through it if you can and concentrate on the final zoom out crane shot, there's a lot of world and a lot of problems, you cannot hide from them.

THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI picked up seven Oscars and it's also picked up the reputation as being one of the greatest war movies ever made and in my opinion it deserves ever bit of praise it's gotten over the years. Yes, you could get upset that the true events weren't shown 100% accurate but this is a movie and not a documentary. With that said, Lean's epic is grand on just about every scale and it's truly amazing how much power the two halves of the film are. I say two halves because we pretty much get two different stories being told in the movie. The first half deals with British Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) battling with Japanese Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) over the rules of war. The second half of the film deals with the building of the bridge and the Allies plan on destroying it. Of the two portions of the film I must say that I prefer the first half due to the brilliant performances by Guinness and Hayakawa. The two men are so perfect in their roles and they bring such an intensity to their performances that you really do get sucked into their situation and try to see both points of view. Guinness has always gotten the recognition that he deserves and he even picked up an Oscar for his performance but I think it's unfair that Hayakawa has gotten overlooked in some ways. I thought Hayakawa did a remarkable job with the performance because you hate him for being the enemy and doing the things that he does but at the same time the actor is so good at showing someone doing the job put in front of them that you can look past him being a villain and see that he's a human as well. The scenes with the two actors battling and trying to break one another are tremendously done and certainly rank among some of the greatest stuff ever made.

THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI picked up seven Oscars and it's also picked up the reputation as being one of the greatest war movies ever made and in my opinion it deserves ever bit of praise it's gotten over the years. Yes, you could get upset that the true events weren't shown 100% accurate but this is a movie and not a documentary. With that said, Lean's epic is grand on just about every scale and it's truly amazing how much power the two halves of the film are. I say two halves because we pretty much get two different stories being told in the movie. The first half deals with British Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) battling with Japanese Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) over the rules of war. The second half of the film deals with the building of the bridge and the Allies plan on destroying it. Of the two portions of the film I must say that I prefer the first half due to the brilliant performances by Guinness and Hayakawa. The two men are so perfect in their roles and they bring such an intensity to their performances that you really do get sucked into their situation and try to see both points of view. Guinness has always gotten the recognition that he deserves and he even picked up an Oscar for his performance but I think it's unfair that Hayakawa has gotten overlooked in some ways. I thought Hayakawa did a remarkable job with the performance because you hate him for being the enemy and doing the things that he does but at the same time the actor is so good at showing someone doing the job put in front of them that you can look past him being a villain and see that he's a human as well. The scenes with the two actors battling and trying to break one another are tremendously done and certainly rank among some of the greatest stuff ever made.

While the majority of the film deals with his struggle of making it on the radio, we also get the story of his relationship with wife Alison (Mary McCormack). No matter what you think of Stern I think anyone will be able to enjoy this film and in fact I still remember going to see it when it was first released with someone who hated the guy with a passion and even they walked out liking him. I think a large portion of the film and the original book wanted to make people understand Stern and there's no question that the film is a bit one-sided but in the end it accomplishes what it set out to do and that is show people the real person. The film is full of raunchy humor including a great take-off on the Match Game and another terrific sequence with Stern having sex with a woman over the radio and while these comic bits are terrific what really makes the film so memorable is its charm. The film is incredibly charming and one can't help but really fall in love with Stern's character and especially the way he's determined not to stop until he reaches the top. I think the film is rather remarkable in that it can be downright filthy one moment but then sweet the next. It's really hard to mix those two things but the screenplay and director Thomas really make it work and by doing so they've created a rather special movie that keeps getting better with each new viewing. It should come as no shock but Stern makes for a terrific actor even though he's playing himself. I've heard many great actors say that playing themselves would be a very difficult thing to do but Stern handles it with no troubles as does his supporting mates Robin Quivers, Fred Norris and Jackie Martling. McCormack is also extremely good as the wife and her chemistry with Stern comes off as real and they make you feel as if you're watching a real couple. Even better is Paul Giamatti who plays Kenny, aka Pig Vomit, the man who tries to tame Stern when he gets to NBC. The fire and passion that Giamatti brings to the role is rather remarkable to watch and you can't help but laugh at loud when he and Stern are going at it. PRIVATE PARKS is a hilarious movie and a touching one that tells the rise of Stern with loving care and in the end it really delivers everything you'd want it to.

He can't act his way out of a paper bag and yet with the exception of Michael Gough he's still the best performer in this film, which is one of the grand turkeys of the last 20 years or so. So let's assess this startling dose of realism....Dayglow street gangs? Yeah, I have to pass 'em on my way home from work every evening.Gay subtext? Not exactly - it's so obvious it sticks out like Batman's rather hilarious nipples and codpiece combo. A friend of mine refuses to use the proper title of this film and refers to it as Batman Loves Robin. 12 million special effects shots? Yep. As headache inducing as you could wish for. Story? Poison Ivy wants revenge on a Tim Burton look-a-like who tried to kill her. Wasn't done in Batman Returns at all, no siree....Mr. Freeze (the immortal Arnie) in his day-glow light-up Buzz Lightyear suit wants to rob lots of diamonds the size of your fist to bring his wife out of suspended animation, or something. Pity he didn't try it on the rest of the cast...Bane. No hang, on lets get this right. BAAAANNNNNNE! Lovely! Imagine the actor who got the part reading the script - What, is that all I gotta say. Well, I'll just have to give it some welly to get noticed....Somewhere in all this is the rather touching idea of Alfred dying from an incurable illness but carrying on as if nothing's wrong. If only the bulk of the movie had been about this...Robin fights with Batman. Not physically, unfortunately, as I'd love to see the smug little toe-rag get his ass well and truly kicked. Michael Jackson would have made a more convincing boy wonder than Chris O'Donnell...as would Elvis. Ah, where is he now???? O'Donnell I mean, not Jackson or the King! Ah, yes, Uma Thurman as Ivy almost lures him to his doom. Remember when she used to have a career in films like Pulp Fiction? Luckily Tarantino rescued her in Kill Bill or it would have ended here. Pronto! Wayyy! Spice Girl power is present with Batgirl! Racing against said Dayglow street gangs for kicks. Did I mention there's plenty of Dayglow in this film?? Mr. Freeze's super freezing ray immobilises a dog taking a leak against a fire hydrant. Bet that got Oscar Wilde worried.George Clooney's non-performance is a wonder to behold; sleeping walking should be made a criminal offence considering the money some stars get paid.

He has a very outspoken mother who requests of him but one thing to stop the self-abuse. Indeed, in the opening scene we find Dark in the shower ardently stroking his penis as he reimagines some of his sexual encounters with Mel, his bisexual girlfriend, and particularly a moment he shares in the locker room with Montgomery (played by Nathan Bexton). Just like in Araki's Totally F***ed Up (part of the Apocalypse Teenage Trilogy), the story revolves around a cast of troubled teenagers. This is a generation of youngsters that take the imperative of joy to the extreme, they live their lives as if the world is about to end, and everything they do is of the utmost intensity. There is sheer perversity in Shad (played by Ryan Phillippe) and Lilith (Heather Graham), both devotees of bondage and sadomasochism. When Shad is all tied up and about to be dominated by Lilith, he adopts a particular position in the sexual structure here the subject makes himself the instrument of the Other's jouissance. The pervert is the person in whom the structure of the drive is most clearly revealed, and also the person who carries the attempt to go beyond the pleasure principle to the limit he who goes as far as he can along the path of jouissance.Sadism motivates the Teen Idol's actions as he seduces a girl who is totally infatuated by his specular image (namely, the notoriety and fame derived of his TV appearances). As a sadist he locates himself as the object of the invocatory drive, not only brutally hitting the girl but also raping her.The imperative of joy also takes its toll on the homosexual couple formed by Cowboy and Bart; Bart is a drug addict beyond recovery, despite all the efforts his boyfriend does to help him. Perhaps the only normal couple, albeit in the making, would be formed by Dingbat (played by Christina Applegate) and Ducky (Scott Caan). But everything is sort of in the making, as these college kids can't seem to make up their minds. For example, Dark confronts Mel as he is uneasy with her promiscuity (and bisexuality). Sometimes I feel so old fashioned, he confesses. It would be fair to state that theirs is a case of sexual failure because the object of desire, insofar as it is incarnated, never accedes in turn to the Other sex. And this is a translation of Lacan's proposition there is no such thing as sexual rapport. Dark expresses a restrained concept of what is properly sexual. Thus it concerns the rapport to the Other sex, to the Other body as sexed, and specially as sexed differently - body to body, sexed body to sexed body. In so constricting the range of sexuality, in focusing on corporeity he demonstrates that sexuality is utterly undone or not constituted. At the time of sexual jouissance, the rapport one counts upon, the rapport that should be there takes the form of failure. That is why Dark grows more and more comfortable with Montgomery's presence; Dark's object of desire is shifting towards a sexed body that mirrors his own a male body. Lacan's expression of corporeal excerpt serves to qualify what he calls the object a. It entails a debasement of the Other, having it demeaned from the status of Other as such to the rank of the object a of drive. And this is the path Lacan follows when he announces that there is no such thing as sexual rapport. Every couple in the film is a living manifest of this sexual failure, unable to connect to the other, they live desperately and on the verge of destruction. It isn't surprising, then, to witness the suicides of two characters partly prompted by religious zealousness. Suicide here is also a successful attempt of the real to break into reality which coincides with the constant irruption of the alien, not only as a headline that proclaims that space aliens are kidnapping children but as a very 'real' manifestation of an alien monster that only Dark and Montgomery are able to see. The alien serves as a metaphor of the uncanny double, originated as the mortifying aspect of narcissism when it is not limited by castration. Narcissism presupposes to mask death itself. Nevertheless, here the alien is responsible for the death of a few college girls, and once Montgomery disappears Dark fears the worse. When something of this object a (id est Montgomery) of the phantasm appears in the real, on top of the frame, disrupting it and therefore disrupting the 'scene' that so far has contained it, the effect that ensues is marked by angst. Such is the case of the alien monster who appears always between moments, between sequences, almost taunting Dark, on the fringes of reality and the real. Araki's masterful representation of the manner in which the phantasm is framed reveals the importance of what many viewers might consider random and capricious appearances. When Montgomery shows up in Dark's room, stark naked, they start talking. Montgomery affirms I got kidnapped by space aliens. It's not long before they decide to share the bed (yet another hint pointing out the sexual failure). Dark and Montgomery move through a difficult zone, they can't pull it out, they're doomed to let go of the conceptual inveigling that Lacan has accomplished, and that always articulates jouissance with castration, that is a phallic function. When Montgomery experiences an abnormal seizure Dark asks him Tell me what it is, which is an impossible question because, after all, the real exceeds language. Whatever is wrong with Montgomery, no language could express it. The after credits final scene is the perfect closure for Araki's narrative, as it reinserts again not only the failure of sex but also the complete failure of language.

Written and directed by master filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, the film centers around the lives of Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann), two women brought together through the sickness eating away at the last remaining days of their sister's life. This sister, played by Bergman-regular Harriet Andersson, is perhaps one of the most tragic characters ever committed to celluloid, due mostly to Andersson's bravura performance. Several scenes show Agnes gasping loudly for breath, and the noises, which are not too far off from being growls or croaks, are excruciating at times to listen to. In even the most seemingly simple of stares, a deep underlying pain can be seen behind those shimmering eyes. So detailed are these scenes of Agnes' suffering, that one can't help but marvel at the sheer precision involved in capturing such realism on camera. This realism, which is central to all Bergman films, is just as prevalent in the interactions between Karin and Maria, which form the center of the story. Through the conversations of Karin and Maria, we are able to catch glimpses into their damaged psyches. Several flashbacks reveal some rather unnerving scenes in the history of these two sisters, which helps us to understand why they are so cold and distant. One of the beautiful things about this film is the sparse use of dialogue. As is typical of a Bergman film, the cinematography is brilliant and able to convey, mostly through close-ups, a tense atmosphere that grips the viewer and causes one to become acutely aware of even the slightest flicker of a facial muscle. The use of the color red throughout the film only adds to its ominous nature.Cries and Whispers does perhaps have a fault, however. Due to the often ambiguous conversations between the two sisters, the film seems to stop short of fully opening up the audience to the true nature of the sisters' personalities. One can't help but feel distanced from the feelings and experiences of the sisters, which, in turn, causes the viewer to lack any sort of genuine compassion for either of them. Where the simple look of suffering in the eyes of Agnes is enough to strongly elicit such feelings, the self-centered nature and good health of the sisters does not allow for their troubled stares to reach the same level of effect. Though we are shown snippets of their past, by the end of the movie we still do not truly know either of these women. They feel more like acquaintances than central characters we are heavily invested in. But then, perhaps, that is Bergman's point. Perhaps he is trying to give us a sort of outsider's look into the inside world of these two women. We view them as if from behind the keyhole. We catch bits of conversation rooted in the history these two women have together, but as people on the outside, we do not have the privilege of knowing the full meaning, or every intimate detail to their lives. After all, can one truly get a full picture of someone's character without experiencing life from inside that person's own body? So while I still feel being presented with a fuller understanding of Karin and Maria could have benefited the film, Cries and Whispers still stands, on the sheer power of its hauntingly real acting and emotional atmosphere, as a true work of cinematic art. The ending alone is perhaps one of the most perfect I have ever seen- the beauty and near-irony of Agnes' words concludes the movie with an existential message that leaves the viewer in a state of ambivalence. This is, without a doubt, one of Bergman's finest and most fully-realized films, and its impact only continues to grow the more it lingers on the mind for days, weeks, and even months after viewing. To me, this film stands right up there with Persona, The Seventh Seal, and Wild Strawberries.

This movie gives a callback to why American musicals in the early days of films were so popular. The transition from songs to script is so easy and believable. Unlike most bollywood films where you can be whisked away to a mountain top at a moments call, The Green Mile keeps you in the lives of characters and lets the violence speak as their emotions.But let me tell you that if you are not a big Tom Hanks fan you are still going to enjoy this movie 100 percent.The story is just amazing.It's about a single father(Tom Hanks) who's wife died several years ago and now he met with his best pal from college (Kajol) to take their relationship to the next stage.And one of the great thing about this movie is that you are never gonna get bored like the 70 percent Hindi movies.Hanks lowered his standing considerably with this gore-fest.I really wanted to watch this movie but the sound was intermittent and unwatchable.

I've seen all of his films, but this one is my very favourite. This is his magnum opus.It starts off with dear Alex and his droogs sitting in the Korova milk bar sipping away and preparing themselves for what they call 'the old ultraviolence,' which we'll soon see is rape and a severe beating to a particular old writer. From then on, from these events there unfolds a tapestry of chaos, weirdness and disaster. But Malcolm McDowell is just a delight. While all of this horror and oddity occurred, I never found myself blaming him. He makes Alex seem so charismatic that it's amazing.What the hell is ACO about? A guy called Alex living in the distant future, a bizarre colorful kaleidescope of stylized clothing and living spaces and odd people in a Kafkaesque (yep, i just had to use that word) nightmare. He commits a nasty, insane (and somewhat funny) crime and does time for it. And he bumps into a few of his old...acquaintances later on, and the law attempts to cure his delinquency...in a rather disturbing way.The cherry on top is the excellent soundtrack. The weird Moog synthesizer just adds to the strange atmosphere. And the way Kubrick artfully uses classical music, like Beethoven's 9th and Rossini's Barber of Seville overture and Thieving Magpie and William Tell Overture is simply a marvel. It's a pleasure to listen to such lovely music while watching such vivid imagery.Anyways, that can't even begin to describe the film but all you can do is see it for yourself. I watched this as a wide eyed 14 year old and I was just bewildered by the whole damn thing, but I loved it. What's not to love? Call me crazy, but I've always though that the 'violence' in this film was over-hyped. People tend to make a mountain out of a molehill. ACO was not meant to be a goddamn tragedy, it's a biting satire that's darkly humorous and prodigal in it's predictions. It's pretty funny, when it all comes down to it, the irony, the black humor, the sharp wit of Anthony Burgess and Stanley Kubrick, the inane charm of Malcolm McDowell, the ridiculousness of it all.And then there's people who complain that ACO promotes violence and perversion. Reallyy?? Is that so? I guess those people were jerking off for the whole time and not even paying attention. If that's what you got out of it, then you must be brain dead.

The Marx Brothers in a way rescued the more anarchic form of comedy for the talkies with their wild and nonsensical verbal humour, but they also had enough physicality that they went a great way to preserving slapstick for the sound era. Duck Soup is their most perfect movie, and incidentally also the one which features the most visual humour.The Marx Brothers, even when they were not doing slapstick, had a style that very much harked back to the silent comics. If you look at Chaplin's short pictures, he would normally choose a familiar setting, people it with straight but somewhat preposterous characters, then bring on his little tramp to wreak havoc. And this is pretty much what Groucho and Co. do in their first five features at Paramount. Duck Soup begins with an extremely pompous and formal set-up, into which Groucho and Chico come blabbering their disrespectful turns-of-phrase, and Harpo gleefully wrecks all and sundry, to the complete consternation of the overblown figures around them. Regular co-star Margaret Dumont is perfect for this, because she is not a funny character in her own right, but she is a slightly exaggerated version of a stock dramatic figure, and this is enough for the brothers to bounce their comedy off her. Louis Calhern is just right here too, because he is a straight man, but one with prickable pomposity as opposed to dramatic intensity. I am at present undecided as to the importance of Zeppo Marx as the straight foil, but in any case his role in this his last film appearance is fairly negligible, and the picture doesn't suffer for that fact. Duck Soup is directed by Leo McCarey, himself a veteran of silent comedy and a student of the Hal Roach studios. McCarey was not a writer for Duck Soup, but nonetheless some of the physical comedy routines and the general bent towards slapstick do bear his stamp. An especially good example is the hat-swapping routine with Harpo, Chico and Edgar Kennedy, a very simple piece that becomes increasingly funny simply because it is stretched out a ridiculous tit-for-tat conflict. Remember it was McCarey who first suggested Laurel and Hardy team up as a permanent duo, and for Duck Soup Harpo and Chico form a distinctly Laurel and Hardy-flavoured dynamic, with Harpo as the chirpy fool and Chico his long-suffering (but no less incompetent) superior. Unlike the talkie scenes, for which McCarey emphasises the snappy pace with frequent angle changes, the physical comedy is mostly shot in long, unbroken takes, allowing the routines to build up undisturbed and proving really just how good the brothers were at it.But there is something else which makes Duck Soup very brilliant. In an age where satire was not common currency at the pictures, this is a surprisingly bold indictment of war. The setting is a fictional Ruritanian kingdom (a fact that in itself makes this feel like a take-off on all those urbane European comedies that Ernst Lubitsch was making in the same studio), complete with grand halls, aristocratic titles and lots of silly uniforms, and Rufus T. Firefly's militaristic takeover nods towards the fascist governments that were springing up all over Europe at the time. And yet there are hints too at the follies of American militarism, with various patriotic marches woven into the musical score. Of course, the satire is never exactly biting and it certainly doesn't have that poignant quality that is present in even the wildest of wartime comedies (such as Dr Strangelove or Life is Beautiful), but it works on the level of being a big raspberry to the seriousness with which war takes itself.Duck Soup is the absolute pinnacle of the Marx Brothers canon. Their subsequent pictures at MGM were rather more serious and plot driven affairs, which would basically detract from what the brothers were really all about. But despite their previous successes, Duck Soup was not quite as popular with audiences as had been the likes of Monkey Business and Horse Feathers. It does lack the variety show format of the earlier movies, and much as I love it I do find myself missing Harpo's harping and Chico's piano. The 1930s were the era of the formula franchise movie, and the consternation of waiting for things you've come to expect can make a good picture seem tedious.

We the audience are shown how Conrad Brean played by Robert Deniro and Stanley Motts played by Dustin Hoffman create an outlandish fake plot to distract the American public from sexual allegations made by the president. After Albanian war is created, fake news footage is created within a studio, create fads (throwing shoes onto tree branches in support of a false war) and catchy sayings with theme songs are created by famous country singers in support of their fake war hero, Sgt. Schumann, who turns out to be psychotic resulting in his own death. After that, they stage a funeral procession for Schuman. It's amazing how this whole big sham becomes Brean's best work because it's so convincing and looks so authentic. He is so proud and enamored with his own creative work he decides he wants credit and his greed and pride lead to his death. The secret service take care of him. Good example of how the government can easily dispose of someone who gets in their way and no one would ever know. The obvious message is; Americans believe what they are told and hate whom they are told to hate. The American public is very gullible and too lazy to find out the whole situation and facts themselves. In the film, we see how people jumped on the bandwagon without giving the situation much thought. I notice Americans have become very complacent and comfortable within their overprotected lives. We should be aware of global and national politics on a much larger scale. We are so behind compared to other countries. We should get more involved by questioning our government. Corruption exists in many government systems but the American people is the only country I know of that is either unaware or okay with that. It was very frustrating to watch everyone go along with the diversion. I am sure there is much we do not know. I was actually rooting for Brean and Motts to fail but I am sure the outcome rings true.There are so many examples in American Politics that resonate without own because American government has initialized wars (Iraq War) and also created false sense of patriotism to get Americans to back up their country even when the motives seem somewhat blurry (weapons of mass destruction). Even when a conflict is real and necessary (the Gulf War, for example), the packaging of them is invariably shallow and unquestioning; like sportswriters, war correspondents abandon any pretense of objectivity and detachment, and cheerfully root for our side. At one point in the film, Levinson asks, Why does a dog wag its tail? We are told, Because a dog is smarter than its tail. To the film director, the tail is smarter and we the viewers and American people are taken for a ride and invited to be that easily manipulated dog. The message is clearly to be more aware of the government and become proactive by questioning what is going on and don't just accept everything the government tells you to be true.

It's probably the fact that I lost someone close to me recently and the movie evoked some negative emotions from me so maybe that is actually a good thing. Pain, hate, and judgement serve as the premise for this film, which happens to be my first Bergman experience so I had no real idea of what to expect. The world within the film is cold and dull, a reflection on the movie itself in my opinion. I couldn't get myself to care for the characters whatsoever. I don't think there was one thing I enjoyed during this film. It's just too simple and too slow for my liking, but hell this is a movie about the human condition and when you're following three depressed souls like these you can't exactly go in a different direction than the way this film went.

In the movie, a lone gunslinger rides into town and is quickly drawn into a conflict between a group of homesteaders and a ruthless cattle baron. Western plots along these lines are a dime a dozen but here the simplicity of the story actually represents a shrewd distillation of Western mythology. In essence, Shane is to the West what Beowulf is to Scandinavia.Playing the titular gunfighter, Alan Ladd doesn't say a lot, nor does he have to. Neither does his counterpart, Jack Palance's 'man in black', Jack Wilson. These men are larger than life; heroes and villains on a mythic scale. In essence, we see these characters through the eyes of young Joey Starrett.The film garnered a pair of Oscar nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category. The aforementioned Jack Palance's menacing performance was recognized, as was 11-year old Brandon de Wilde's touching portrayal of Joey Starrett. Van Heflin didn't receive any accolades but he contributed a vital performance in the central role of Joe Starrett. The rest of the supporting players (including Jean Arthur in her last film role) all upheld the high standard set by the others.George Stevens' direction was rewarded with an Oscar nomination but, while it was indeed ably handled, I felt that it lacked the verve of previous pictures of his like A Place in the Sun & Gunga Din. Perhaps it could also have benefited from widescreen presentation, which was just then coming to the fore. Meanwhile, Victor Young's score is decent but nothing to write home about.In the end, the story's simplicity, combined with the gravity of the portrayals, invests the film with an elusive quality that is difficult to quantify in words. What would be seen as cliché in a lesser film is here elevated to mythic status. As a result, Shane is undoubtedly an essential American Western worthy of mention alongside the films of John Ford.
