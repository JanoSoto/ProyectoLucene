All of those elements make A Bronx Tale an amazing movie that is Robert De Niro and Chazz Palminteri at their best.Based on Chazz Palminteri's one man stage play of the same name and set during the 1960s,A Bronx Tale tells the story of a young man named Cologero(Lillo Brancato,Francis Capra)who is torn between the love for his Bus Driver Father Lorenzo(Robert De Niro)and smooth talking gangster Sonny(Chazz Palminteri). As Cologero goes from his childhood to his teenager years Cologero has to deal with his love and admiration for his Father and Sonny as well as growing up.Released in 1993,A Bronx Tale is a brilliant and unforgettable film that marked the directorial debut of actor Robert De Niro and he could not have picked a better project as his debut giving viewers one of the most underrated movies of all-time. I love the Coming Of Age movie genre because with any Coming Of Age film whether it's a Comedy or a Drama the genre deals with growing up and A Bronx Tale is one of the best of the genre because it mixes together a movie about growing up with Gangsters,violence and gritty streetwise dialog. A Bronx Tale is a movie that is dramatic and meaningful,intense and gripping and at times funny and humorous and it's those elements that make the movie amazing and watchable for 122 minutes because when you watch the film you as a viewer you feel like you are in the Bronx in the 1960s thanks to it's characters. With A Bronx Tale you are taken back to a different time and place. A Bronx Tale is also a movie that is deep and realistic mainly because there is lessons about morality and wasted talent(a common theme that runs throughout the film)while also dealing with themes such as family,love and friendship but is done with a harder edge. The movie also deals with themes such as racism and violence that was going on during the 1960s and it's done in a brutal way that was honest to the times. What makes A Bronx Tale a fascinating movie is the movie's three main characters Cologero,Lorenzo and Sonny. Cologero(the fictional version of Chazz Palmenteri)is a great character that we see going from child to a young adult having to grow up fast whether it's dealing his Father Lorenzo or his friend Sonny or the influence of his neighborhood or his friends with tons of struggles and danger. Sonny is a classic character and Gangster because while he's not necessarily a nice guy and he does some bad things he manages to be a likable person because he's smart with tons of depth. While Cologero loves Sonny and his Gangster lifestyle Sonny tells Coleogero not to be like him and try to survive with an education and smarts rather than have a gun. Cologero's Father Lorenzo is the polar opposite of Sonny's Gangster image because Lorenzo is a bus driver that is a working man that loves his son and tries to teach him about not wasting his talents and not to live the life style that Sonny lives by walking the wrong path. With Cologero,Sonny and Lorenzo it's not about a tug of war between Sonny and Lorenzo over Cologero but about two men trying to raise Cologero on the straight and narrow. A Bronx Tale is often seen as a Gangster film and while A Bronx Tale owes a lot to the genre(such as Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas which was an influence on this film)it's not a Gangster film in a tradition sense as it is more about a young man's conflicts than a group of Gangsters. The violence in A Bronx Tale is brutal and in your face but works and makes an impact when the violence happens. The screenplay by Chazz Palmenteri is terrific and memorable with dialog that is gritty and truthful. Palmenteri based A Bronx Tale on himself and his real life experiences on growing up in the Bronx and when you watch the movie,the characters or hear the dialog everything feels accurate. The ending in A Bronx Tale is outstanding because it gives viewers lessons about life,humanity and bringing the film's themes full circle. A terrific ending.The cast is wonderful. Robert De Niro is excellent and memorable as Lorenzo,a Bus Driver that loves his son. Chazz Palminteri is brilliant and unforgettable as Sonny,with Palminteri being smooth and captivating. Lillo Brancato is terrific as Calogero and has great scenes with De Niro and Palminteri. Francis Capra is wonderful as Young Calogero(Age 9)with Capra bringing the right emotions. Taral Hicks is great and beautiful as Jane,Cologero's love interest. Kathrine Narducci is good and sexy as Rosina,Lorenzo's wife. Clem Caserta does a fine job as Jimmy Whispers,Sonny's right hand man. Joe D'Onofrio(Slick),Louis Vanana(Crazy Mario),Luigi D'Angelo(Aldo)and Dominick Rocchio(Ralphie)do great jobs as Cologero's friends. Joe Pesci is terrific in his cameo role as Carmine an old friend of Sonny.The direction by Robert De Niro is sensational,with De Niro always moving the camera and giving the film a style that is simple but effective. Great direction,De Niro.The soundtrack is outstanding with a collection of classic Rock N'Roll songs that fit the movie perfectly. Amazing soundtrack.In final word,if you love Robert De Niro,Chazz Palminteri or Coming of Age films I highly suggest you see A Bronx Tale,an excellent,powerful and underrated classic that you will watch again and again.

Well, 1981 brought us just that! The Canonball Run, a lousy, offensive comedy that shows that just because the stars are having a good time, it doesn't mean that anyone else will. The film is about a cross-country car race across the United States, where teams of two or more racers compete for no prize at all besides bragging rights (how exciting!) The team we're supposed to be cheering for is J.J. McClure (Burt Reynolds) and the sidekick he has abused into submission, Victor Prinzim (Dom DeLuise). Every team has to have a strategy to avoid getting busted by the cops during this outlawed race so these guys come up with the actually pretty ingenious idea of empowering what looks like an ambulance with a powerful motor. Against the heroes are a slew of wacky racers, including Jackie Chan and Michael Hui as Japanese drivers with a high-tech car; Jamie Farr as an Arabian Sheik; Roger Moore as what is either himself, a Roger Moore impersonator, or a man named Seymour Goldfarb who is a secret agent, an assassin and a philanthropist who also acts in films under the pseudonym of Roger Moore; Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. as two drunks pretending to be catholic priests, two spandex-clad hotties who seduce their way through their speeding tickets (played by Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman) and more. Because J.J. is a nearly psychopathic horn-dog, he and his team also kidnap an airhead tree hugger they brainwash into calling herself Beauty along for the ride (Farrah Fawcett).This film was an absolute chore to watch. The film is extremely predictable and further hindering it is the fact that we do not see our titular characters race until 42 minutes into the movie. I've forgiven films for starting up slowly before because they were setting up a big story or developing the characters but everyone here is a one-joke paper cut-out that isn't the least bit exciting. Burt Reynolds is a player who always has one eye on the finish line and the other peering down the shirt of every girl in the vicinity. Dom DeLuise is an idiot with a split personality that we're supposed to love because he was a kind heart and is the constant butt of jokes. I hated the both of them... almost as much as Farrah Fawcett's character Beauty. She literally gets kidnapped, drugged and dragged across the United States against her will and barely protests. When her character is introduced, she's a total ditz, meant to be sexually ogled by the audience and the people in the film and it gets really old really quickly. At first, the film threw me for a loop. When she is introduced, she comes off as the kind of person who would be against an illegal car race because she's hanging out with some hippie stereotypes with sticks up their butts. I figured she would be somehow roped into joining the race and would argue with J.J. constantly until they inevitably fell in love. At least, (I thought to myself) she isn't a dumb, ditzy blonde that joined up with the level 3 vegan assembly without knowing what she was getting into. If that was the case, she would be too stupid to argue against J.J. and would, as the film goes along lose more and more clothing to make her an obvious sex object. Just a few scenes later and we can see her wearing a white sweatshirt and no bra underneath, ready to be fooled by the dumbest lies and convinced to abandon her name because of J.J.'s charms.Forget that the characters are bland and that the film is boring, the least it could do is be either funny or charming. It's neither. It plays like an inside joke between this group of friends that are having a great time and don't care who they are alienating. It's like everyone was having such a good time they didn't realize how downright offensive the movie gets. Take for example the introduction of the Japanese Team. They cast Jackie Chan, who is Chinese, as one of the racers. As for his girlfriend, the top movie star of Japan, she's clearly Philipino and is described as appearing in many Godzilla movies. We've got the broadest stereotype of Arabs in the form of the Sheik, several jabs at Jews and we're supposed to let it slide because these actors were having a good time? I rolled my eyes at the endless Roger Moore-James Bond references. We get it! You played 007! Can we move on? Yeah, Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman are attractive, but they don't do anything with these characters. I would have laughed hard at an obvious joke they SHOULD have done, which was see these two being held p for a half hour while a particularly frisky state trooper insisted on strip-searching them after they attempts at seducing him. That would have been clever though and there's nothing clever in this movie.I didn't absolutely loathe this film as much as I did say... Freddy Got Fingered but I cannot think of a single thing that was good about this movie. Some people would say the stunts and yeah, a couple of them are good but the terrible fight choreography edges that out. I found it unimaginative, offensive and worst of all completely boring. I cannot think of anyone I would ever recommend the film to so I have to be honest and give this film a 1 \/ 10. Don't watch it and stay away from the sequels, which I hear are even worse.

Against the heroes are a slew of wacky racers, including Jackie Chan and Michael Hui as Japanese drivers with a high-tech car; Jamie Farr as an Arabian Sheik; Roger Moore as what is either himself, a Roger Moore impersonator, or a man named Seymour Goldfarb who is a secret agent, an assassin and a philanthropist who also acts in films under the pseudonym of Roger Moore; Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. as two drunks pretending to be catholic priests, two spandex-clad hotties who seduce their way through their speeding tickets (played by Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman) and more. Because J.J. is a nearly psychopathic horn-dog, he and his team also kidnap an airhead tree hugger they brainwash into calling herself Beauty along for the ride (Farrah Fawcett).This film was an absolute chore to watch. The film is extremely predictable and further hindering it is the fact that we do not see our titular characters race until 42 minutes into the movie. I've forgiven films for starting up slowly before because they were setting up a big story or developing the characters but everyone here is a one-joke paper cut-out that isn't the least bit exciting. Burt Reynolds is a player who always has one eye on the finish line and the other peering down the shirt of every girl in the vicinity. Dom DeLuise is an idiot with a split personality that we're supposed to love because he was a kind heart and is the constant butt of jokes. I hated the both of them... almost as much as Farrah Fawcett's character Beauty. She literally gets kidnapped, drugged and dragged across the United States against her will and barely protests. When her character is introduced, she's a total ditz, meant to be sexually ogled by the audience and the people in the film and it gets really old really quickly. At first, the film threw me for a loop. When she is introduced, she comes off as the kind of person who would be against an illegal car race because she's hanging out with some hippie stereotypes with sticks up their butts. I figured she would be somehow roped into joining the race and would argue with J.J. constantly until they inevitably fell in love. At least, (I thought to myself) she isn't a dumb, ditzy blonde that joined up with the level 3 vegan assembly without knowing what she was getting into. If that was the case, she would be too stupid to argue against J.J. and would, as the film goes along lose more and more clothing to make her an obvious sex object. Just a few scenes later and we can see her wearing a white sweatshirt and no bra underneath, ready to be fooled by the dumbest lies and convinced to abandon her name because of J.J.'s charms.Forget that the characters are bland and that the film is boring, the least it could do is be either funny or charming. It's neither. It plays like an inside joke between this group of friends that are having a great time and don't care who they are alienating. It's like everyone was having such a good time they didn't realize how downright offensive the movie gets. Take for example the introduction of the Japanese Team. They cast Jackie Chan, who is Chinese, as one of the racers. As for his girlfriend, the top movie star of Japan, she's clearly Philipino and is described as appearing in many Godzilla movies. We've got the broadest stereotype of Arabs in the form of the Sheik, several jabs at Jews and we're supposed to let it slide because these actors were having a good time? I rolled my eyes at the endless Roger Moore-James Bond references. We get it! You played 007! Can we move on? Yeah, Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman are attractive, but they don't do anything with these characters. I would have laughed hard at an obvious joke they SHOULD have done, which was see these two being held p for a half hour while a particularly frisky state trooper insisted on strip-searching them after they attempts at seducing him. That would have been clever though and there's nothing clever in this movie.I didn't absolutely loathe this film as much as I did say... Freddy Got Fingered but I cannot think of a single thing that was good about this movie. Some people would say the stunts and yeah, a couple of them are good but the terrible fight choreography edges that out. I found it unimaginative, offensive and worst of all completely boring.

Memento is quite possibly Nolan's most thought provoking film. It tells the story of a man who was injured during the murder of his wife and has short term memory loss. Only of course the film isn't told chronologically. It is told in two ways. The black and white scenes move forward but are of his past. While the color scenes are more present but are told backwards. When they meet we have the end. I have seen many films that take concepts like this and fail to truly entertain and are more artsy than audiences would like. Nolan mixed brain power with a unbelievably entertaining thriller.Leonard's main goal is to find and kill his wife's killer, only with short term memory loss he has trouble remembering clues or even if he has already killed the man. He has tattoos to remind himself of his daily goals and who or who not to trust. While all this is going on, flashbacks tell the story of Sammy Jankis who suffered from the same disease as Leonard and supposedly kills his wife unwillingly because of it.

It's a super vegetable that requires blood for sustenance, and it makes life very tense for the scientists and military personnel at an isolated Arctic outpost when it's thawed from an icy imprisonment.With an intrepid hero in the form of 1950s icon Kenneth Tobey on hand, it's a guarantee that The Thing from Another World is going to be a good time. It was a fairly odd choice of material for the producer Howard Hawks, who fills the story with overlapping dialogue and a sense of camaraderie among the various protagonists.

Hawks's editor Christian Nyby gets the directing credit, but it's generally believed that Hawks was pretty much in control of things. The score by Dimitri Tiomkin, utilizing the theremin, is suitably eerie.

Otherwise, this film is excellent and one of his best.9.5\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"3 November 2014","score":"","review":" Watched Robin Hood Men In Tights With Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride) as Robin Hood\/Of Loxley , also Starring Dave Chapelle(Con Air) as Achoo, Richard Lewis(Daddy Dearest) as Prince John ,Roger Rees(Cheers ) as The Sheriff Of Rottingham , Amy Yasbeck(DraculaDead and Loving it) as Maid Marian Of Bagel, Mark Blankfield(The Jerk,too) as Blinkin, Tracey Ullman(Three Of A Kind) as Latrine The Witch , Dom DeLuise(An American TailFevel Goes West) as Don Giovanni, Matthew Porretta(South Beach) as Will Scarlett'O Hara and Sir Patrick Stewart(Star Trek Generations) as King Richard The Lionhearted.
