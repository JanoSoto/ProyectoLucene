This movie is very good and reminded me of that fact.  The animals here are so cute and their mouths are digitally altered to make it seem as though they are talking.  That is very funny at times.  Nigel and his friend (whose name I've forgotten) are also very funny.  The story itself is not really worth mentioning.  In essence, Mr. Hoggett hurt himself during a work-related accident and is confined to bed.  Mrs. Hoggett then has no choice but to cash in on some of the many offers that have come Babe's way since winning the sheep-herding competition.  Mrs. Hoggett is not very wise about the ways of the city and becomes separated from the pig.  Babe in the meantime, is working to free other animals and to improve their way of life.  Babe is a very innocent animal, without any of the doubts or hang-ups of the city animals.  However, he is not as aggressive as they either.  But somehow, he manages to get the job done.  He frees some animals which were impounded and is eventually re-united with Mrs. Hoggett.  There are some great lines in the movie.  Babe at one point, refers not merely to his sense of smell, but his olfactory nerve.  Ferdinand, the crazy goose is back, and there is a family of chimpanzees who have their own understanding of the usage of the English language.

It starts out very promisingly Jennifer Pailey(Going) is taking her younger sister Lisa(McGowan) to Snowfield, California to get her away from Los Angeles. The population of Snowfield in the Winter is about four hundred, but when Jennifer and Lisa are driving down the road to their destination they see nobody walking the streets. When they finally arrive at their house it appears to have been broken into. Not much later they find their maid on the kitchen floor dead, of course. They do a bit more exploring in the small town finding a pair of heads and a pair of hands. Everyone else is either dead or missing. Enter Sheriff Bryce Hammond(Affleck) and his slightly odd partner, Stu(Shreiber). Together they figure out that what originally appeared to be a disease(the maid was a bright yellow) was something else(easy to deduce, since rolling pins can seldom be found with the previous owners hands attached to them). Okay, so it's some nut with a meat cleaver, right? Wrong.The plot to Phantoms is very interesting that an evil being that has existed in the Earth since the beginning of time can be blamed for numerous historical disappearances. Not much of this is explored in the film, unfortunately. Instead, we get various scare tactics and, every once in a while, some genuine suspense. Most of the terror is achieved with loud sounds accompanied by a few fair special effects. On the other hand, there're a few scenes toward the end of the film involving a rather innocent looking dog that are quite suspenseful. One scene, in particular, involves a confrontation with Hammond(Affleck). You'll never see such a cute dog look even the slightest bit more menacing. Chappelle manages a few more terrifying sequences, but, unfortunately, they all occur in the first half(the dog doesn't appear until the final quarter). The film goes quickly downhill once it hits the halfway point. That's a shame, since the build-up is quite well done.The final half of the film introduces Peter O'Toole as a tabloid writer. He's got some creative theories about what happened, but, like I stated above, they aren't explored. From what I've heard the confrontation between O'Toole and the monster is detailed beyond belief in the novel. It's a pity to not see it here.If you're interested in jumping out of your seat and being intrigued at the same time then Phantoms isn't a bad choice. Providing, of course, that you don't mind the under-developed characters and finale. It's good old fashion monster movie fun.

One day in the end of April 1998 I went into the cinema to see Titanic, and I had waited for months to see it. I thought it would be a really great film, I had great expectations because almost everyone who had seen it said I was so good, and it was a thousand times better than I thought. It's an amazing story about the rich first-class girl Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) who falls in love with the third-class passenger Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), who won his ticket with a lucky hand of poker, and together they experience the kind of love we all want to have, but seldom find. I've never actually appreciated love stories on film, but this film changed my opinion about what really makes a good movie. It's not just cool action scenes, but also romantic love stories. And Titanic has both of them, the best parts of two totally different worlds of filmmaking, combining the best special effects ever and a great love story. This movie has everything, great script, direction, acting, music (James Horner is the best music composer of all time) and a lot of other things. The movie is so perfect, there's almost nothing I've noticed which is wrong. Of course there are things that don't match the real happenings, such as the flashlights from the lifeboat, which never were there in reality.
