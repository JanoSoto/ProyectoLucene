[{"date":"31 May 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Honestly, the person who made this movie was probably high on crystal meth while making this pile of pig crap. This movie stars Rocky and Bullwinkle in this first(And thankfully last) live-action animated movie. Is it me or is this movie trying to rip off Steven Spielburg's Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Here are a few issues with this movie.1) The names of the characters. Karen Sympathy? Oh, I get it! It's a play of care and sympathy! WHAT THE FLYING FLIP WERE THEY THINKING?! Can you at least come up with a name for the Fearless Leader other than Fearless Leader? 2) The actors. I love Jason Alexander for starring in Seinfeld, but he SUCKS for the role of Boris. What is Robert DeNiro doing in this movie?! For goodness sakes, he was in Godfather II and he sounds nothing like Fearless Leader. And that goes for Jonathon Winters(Who voiced Bigelow in the Pound Puppies TV Special) too! Also, why are Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchel, John Goodman,and Whoppi Goldberg(Yeah, Whoopi Goldberg! I'm not kidding!) in this movie too?! They're great actors, they should have known better! 3) The special effects. Personally, I think this movie is trying to rip off Who Framed Roger Rabbit with the same animated cartoons in real live gimmick.If you're really desperate, you should have let the whole movie be in cartoons. On the bright side, at least Jason Alexander apologized for starring in this heinous nightmare.
