It stars Peter McDonald, Brendan Gleeson, Tony Doyle and Peter Caffrey. Music is by Dario Marianelli and cinematography by Cian de Buitlear.Fresh out of prison, Git Hynes (McDonald) runs into trouble with local mob boss Tom French (Doyle) and finds himself having to work off a debt to him. He's to accompany Bunny Kelly (Gleeson) to Cork and locate Frank Grogan (Caffrey) and bring him back to Dublin. There's some murky history at the core of this request, but for now Bunny and Git must survive each other and a host of life challenges before they begin to worry about Tom French's motives.Hugely popular in Ireland for a number of years, this independent comedy\/drama is finally starting to get noticed by a wider home viewing audience. Film takes a couple of likable rogues and sets them off on a topsy-turvy journey of peril and self discovery. So far so formulaic then. No question about it, plot is unadventurous and outcome is hardly in the realms of the twisty surprise. But dialogue and character interactions are sharp and vital, often cutting and witty. The actors are ever watchable (especially Gleeson and Caffrey), while the fact that the story focuses on a different Ireland to the one that's often tainted by The Troubles, gives the film a freshness that off sets the standard buddy buddy road movie formula of the plot.Director Breathnach goes for the slow burn approach, choosing to let McPherson's script dominate the picture. Yes there's some action, and good sequences flit in and out of the narrative, but the director is mostly about letting his characters breath, fully forming them with each passage of play during the guy's journey\/mission. Even a sex scene is deftly slotted in and comes out as tasteful and a further expansion on the character of Git Hynes. It's thoughtful film making as regards being a character driven piece. There's a most interesting side issue involving the women in Git's and Bunny's lives, two men just about traversing the path on the wrong side of the law, both with gal trouble that gnaws away at their masculinity.It's not the Irish Midnight Run, as I was personally led to believe it was, and any expectation of a violent fun fest will only lead to disappointment. But it has many virtues to make it a safe recommendation to those that enjoy crisp and intelligent dialogue and fully formed characterisations.

This one on a handful of occasions actually had me laughing out loud, so for that reason alone I have to say it's pretty solid. Michael Keaton is what makes this work so well. It's not just because he's the star - it's that he stars in four roles. It's not a costume comedy, though, which makes his performance all the better. He essentially plays the same character with tweaks and variations to differentiate between them, and he pulls it off brilliantly. Each character is a character of his own, and even the interactions between the characters he plays are pulled off flawlessly so that everything is very natural.The story is tailor made for a comedy revolving around mistaken identity. Keaton's basic character is Doug Kinney, an overworked contractor who's finding that he doesn't have time to keep everything in his life in balance. Hoping for a miracle to help keep his life together he finds himself doing some work for a geneticist who's discovered the secret of cloning humans. It's not scientific - the clones come out as exact physical replicas rather than as newborn babies with identical genetic material to the original - but this is a comedy, so who cares! It works! Starting with one clone (named, simply, 2) Doug finds that even one copy isn't enough, so he makes another (named, appropriately, 3.) 2 and 3 are completely different from Doug and polar opposites from each other. 2 is a macho, take charge type who happily takes over the contracting business but chafes about having to stay out of sight when he'd much rather be picking up women, while 3 is an effeminate, stay at home type who loves cooking and cleaning. Eventually, 2 and 3 find themselves over-burdened, and they create another clone (named - guess what - 4.) except that 4 is a copy of copy and so, therefore, imperfect, for lack of a better way to put it. Intended to make Doug's life easier, all these 3 clones do is introduce increasing chaos, and at times it is hilarious.Really the only other cast member of note is Andie MacDowell (who teams again with director Harold Ramis as she did in Groundhog Day) as Doug's increasingly confused wife Laura. Unfortunately, the movie revolves so completely around Doug and the clones that MacDowell, while she was good enough and as always quite lovely, seemed to fade into the background more often than not, so that her talents were generally underused. She's more impressive opposite Bill Murray in Groundhog Day than she is here, but that's more a result of the type of movie and the role that it asked of her rather than any deficiency in her performance.This is almost two hours long - which might be a little bit too much for this type of silly comedy. It gets to that length perhaps by trying to introduce too much drama (if you will) in the last while about Doug and Laura's faltering marriage. Still, it's a funny movie, and Keaton's performance is worth watching.

This was my first movie watching Antonio Banderas in rated R movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect - boy was I surprised. This movie is highly entertaining and packs a punch in multiple genres. For the most part, this is one big shoot 'em up movie. Although much of the action scenes are the same, they still somehow end up being exciting to watch no matter how many times you've seen it. This is not your regular western, where people have their little revolvers and twirl them with one finger, no. This is about a man getting revenge for the sake of his loved one using any weapon he can find.As I said before, Antonio Banderas stars as El Mariachi who looks to find revenge on the man who hired a couple of thugs to kill his wife and permanently damage his playing hand. Co-starring with Banderas is actress Salma Hayek. Although back then she was not well known, this is the film that started her career. I think these two actors really do a good job. Not only do they work well together, but also they look good together. Making things even more awesome are the action scenes. The way El Mariachi fires upon the bad guys, the way he leaps and rolls; is just really exciting to watch. The style of the film is done differently than the usual action movies. Out of all the people that are killed by El Mariachi, you would almost think that he's villain, but he's not. The bad guy's henchmen just keep getting in between the cross hairs.Although much of this movie is shooting people, Banderas has many moments of comedy. And it's not like, Haha! That was a good joke. It's more of, These guys better watch out, because they don't know who they're messing' with. El Mariachi says it himself, he's just looking for a man. And when he says the man's name, everyone starts shooting at him! He's just looking for a certain guy, why does it matter to them- ...Oh well...that's their fault. Those guys got what was coming for them. They just didn't know that.Finally for the music used in this movie was by Los Lobos. I think Lobos did a great job with the musical score. With the Hispanic tone in every part of the music, it really gets the blood flowing. Because the story is about El Mariachi, it has a lot of guitar. That is what gives the film its zest. Director Robert Rodriguez has recreated El Mariachi and made it into a high spirited boom pow movie that can make the viewer start jumping out of their seat. With fun performances, loud action and great music, this film is bound to get the attention it wants.

He was the perfect man to make Scream, a post modern homage and comedy of slasher films but also a good slasher on its own. Writer Kevin Williamson originally wanted to make Scream a trilogy, so getting Wes Craven was a sensible decision to keep the series going.A year after the events of Scream a film has been about it, Stab. During a preview screening two university students (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) are murdered in a crowded cinema. The media descend on the university which the hero from the first film, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is studying at. And it all seem like it was going well for Sidney who seem to get her life back on track. But the survivors of the first film become the targets of the new ghost face killer as the body court starts to raise.Like the first film there is sharp dialogue throughout, there is insight about horror genre and theories about whether violence in film influence violence in real life (I personally think that rubbish because if you got violence tendencies you don't need a film to influence you) and it both a commentary on the genre and social attitudes. Even if Scream and Scream 2 were made as straight forward slasher films they would seen be better then most because the character are more likable and believable then in most slashers, making you care for characters if something happens to them. I also really like Craven's way of shooting chases with the way the camera follows the action of someone being chased in a easy to follow yet tense way. Paul Greengrass should take note that a scene can be tense without the need of shaky cam preventing the audience working out what's happening.The acting is decent enough. Courtney Cox's character Gail Weathers grows to be a little more softer and likable with more tender scenes. Campbell is very solid as the lead, forced back into a situation she thought she would never face again. But after going through all this twice I would have thought she would be psychological scarred for life. Elise Neal and Pinkett basically play typical sassy black women, especially Pinkett who is also a woman with an axe to grind about women's and African American's rights. Jerry O'Connell who plays Sidney's boyfriend is made out to be a decent bloke if a bit of a preppy. I personally thought that Liev Schreiber was a bit of a weak link because I really did not buy into performance and his looked like he was on autopilot.Scream 2 is also filled with subplots, one of them being the three other survivors believing one of them is the killer and they go on the search to find out who it really is and one able Cotton (Schreiber) wanting to get Sidney to agree to an interview about how her evidence got him arrested for her mother's murder and so he could put his side of the story out to the media. There were well handled and did not distract from main plot which a fast paced affair. The scene on the university court yard was an additional tense when characters try and find Ghostface.The film starts off being very similar to the first film, a 10 minute prologue, the police and media going crazy, the debate of film and Sidney punching Gail, it is still different from the first and not just a repeat of Scream. For the most part Scream 2 still plays on horror clichés like two characters arguing a case about whether to run or check to see if the killer is dead and have a valid argument. But sometimes Scream 2 does fall into the cliché trap like a cop having a chance to kill Ghostface or the characters splitting up when Ghostface is around.

Jerry O'Connell who plays Sidney's boyfriend is made out to be a decent bloke if a bit of a preppy. I personally thought that Liev Schreiber was a bit of a weak link because I really did not buy into performance and his looked like he was on autopilot.Scream 2 is also filled with subplots, one of them being the three other survivors believing one of them is the killer and they go on the search to find out who it really is and one able Cotton (Schreiber) wanting to get Sidney to agree to an interview about how her evidence got him arrested for her mother's murder and so he could put his side of the story out to the media. There were well handled and did not distract from main plot which a fast paced affair. The scene on the university court yard was an additional tense when characters try and find Ghostface.The film starts off being very similar to the first film, a 10 minute prologue, the police and media going crazy, the debate of film and Sidney punching Gail, it is still different from the first and not just a repeat of Scream. For the most part Scream 2 still plays on horror clichés like two characters arguing a case about whether to run or check to see if the killer is dead and have a valid argument. But sometimes Scream 2 does fall into the cliché trap like a cop having a chance to kill Ghostface or the characters splitting up when Ghostface is around. But it still a strong, entertaining knowing horror film.

Most of them are not good movies - however he has made a couple comedic action films that do stand out from the rest. Demolition Man is one of these films. There are many elements that help this movie excel past other comedies action flicks. The characters are funny to watch and listen to, the action is very good, and the special effects are well done.The cast of this movie is pretty big. Sylvester Stallone stars as a record-breaking cop, John Spartan, who has jailed the most of amount of criminals during the 20th century. He's the last resort when it comes to taking down the real baddies. The character itself resembles Marion Cobretti from Cobra (1986) because of how he's relied on to do the hardest jobs on the force. The only difference is that Spartan is probably a little more outgoing than Cobretti. Co-starring with Stallone as his partner is Sandra Bullock playing as Lenina Huxley. Although Bullock played in a couple movies before this, I think this is where her career finally took flight. Playing the villain, Simon Phoenix, is Wesley Snipes who plays an eccentric psychopath with two different colored eyes. Nothing better than adding some strange features to the bad guy. To keep the viewer glued to the screen, director Marco Brambilla even cast Rob Schneider and Jack Black. Note Schneider's appearance is longer than Black's appearance. Jack Black appears very briefly and he's hidden a lot so you got to have a keen eye.The action in this film is good too. In my opinion, any movie where Wesley Snipes is involved, is a good action movie. Snipes is a trained martial artist and his style of fighting is really neat to watch although it is quick. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was that there was not enough action. I felt like the film could've had more action scenes but for the most part I enjoyed the film. What made this movie funny was the dialog. Because the story takes place in a futuristic society, much of the language was changed. And some of it is truly weird but it's a funny weird. Stallone and Snipes also have funny moments because of having a hard time understanding and communicating with all the other residents.Lastly, because this story line takes place in the future much of the technology is different. I felt that a lot of the special effects were very creative. For example most of the cars were on auto-drive but as soon as manual driving was turned on, the steering wheel would enlarge and allow the driver to take control. That's cool if you ask me. It's even cooler when the cars get into accidents but I won't say because I'll ruin the surprise.It is rare that Stallone makes a good action\/comedy film, and Demolition Man is one of them. With interesting plot devices and a funny screenplay, this movie is sure to entertain any action\/comedy moviegoer.

Movie starts in a very near sensual way where you see Marion and her lover sharing a hotel room together, soon intimate scenes. Things seems different after there talk when she is in her office, Marion's whole attitude seems different and you sense there is something wrong with her or that something odd is going on in her mind right now. She is in a very desperate need of money and that leads her to do something she never even though of doing but doesn't see any other option than to steal and run. For me the thrill or suspense began exactly the moment when she drives her car. I got chills in my back when her employer (if i am not wrong) spots her at a signal driving away, she gets frightened. The whole Police officer following her to the scary, dark, stormy night that proves as a game changer in her life leading her to what would be the end of her life. I knew for once she would realize it halfway through and would consider returning back to her city with all the money. You feel the power of the moment when she steps into the shower, you feel everything is going to be fine now and that she maybe getting baptized or something as she is going to do a new beginning washing away her sin.Norman Bates is a memorable character and a unforgettable villain for me, someone who as much as feels so shy and weirdly charming has this other exactly opposite side. When they talk, those are some tensed moments for me, you never know what is going to happen to her. I feel so bad for Marion's character, she becomes victim of a total psychopath. Such an outstanding and amazingly done scene, the score and camera angels adds so much to it and yes of course Janet Leigh's screams too. This movie is the reason why i always have been afraid of taking showers when there is no around, i don't feel scared but this scene is so powerful and impactful that it sticks in your mind like forever and ever. The other scene where the detective Milton enters his house and that same figure attacks him, that was an unexpected one, it literally pops up so suddenly that it gave me goosebumps. And the scene when finally thanks to Lila the whole mystery reveals is terrificly scary and out of this world. Psycho has one of the best cinematography i have seen in movies of that period that it seems like a modern black and white converted movie. Outstanding locations and everything which adds so much to the feel of the movie. Camera positions in many scenes are a work of sheer genius and perfection like the one where Detective Milton is killed, the conversation after that, camera is focusing down from the very high angle where you cant see what is going on in the room you just hear them argue and shout, that is something which is so effective which otherwise i hardly think would have had the same feel to it. And the extreme close ups of Marion's face in the shower scene is brilliant.Plot is quite thrilling and engaging where every minute of the movie is quite excellent, never a dull or boring moment. The slowly building tension of the characters and the creepiness of everything thrills me more than anything else that Hitchcock perfectly understood. Screenplay is excellently written and the direction is outstanding. Bernard Hermman's brilliant score to the movie is quite stunning and brilliant though most of the movie doesn't have any score but in those key moments it sounds so good and utterly creepy. One thing i don't understand is why on earth wasn't Anthony Perkins nominated for an Oscar? this guy steals the show in this movie with his portrayal of the layered character Norman bates. he does justice to his character and plays it so much well that you can't help but love him. He knows where and when to act how that in this characters situation really plays out well. His change of emotions on his face are so clear and visible in iffy situations, you can read it so well. He performed amazing in this movie and it is the best performance of his career and that no one else would have done this job with such brilliance as he did.

It's the story of a very close friendship formed between two teenage girls and how it lead to murder. Ever since I saw the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy I have always been looking out for other works directed by Peter Jackson. This one has come up several times in discussions and so I was very pleased when the BBC gave it an airing earlier this week. Here's a brief plot summary before I give you my thoughts.We begin in Canterbury, New Zealand, 1953 where Juliet Hulme has arrived at her new school from England. She forms a friendship with Pauline Parker, an impressionable girl who shares her love of the opera singer, Mario Lanza. They quickly form a strong bond, one that is made stronger by the fact that they both have had bad illnesses in the past. They begin writing stories about a fantasy land with various colourful characters. They re-enact scenes from the stories and eventually this fantasy land becomes real to them. Their parents become worried that their friendship is becoming too intense. As events unfold, it transpires that Juliet's parents are planning to divorce and she is to be shipped out to an aunt in South Africa. This hit's Pauline hard and, because she has been having a particularly hard time with her mother, they hatch a plot to get her out of the way. I can't say any more or the spoiler police will be escorting me down a country path.It's all beautifully shot with some really great CGI in the fantasy scenes; I can now see just why Jackson was chosen for those other films he made later. Great performances from both of the starring actresses. I thought Melanie Lynskey was really excellent as Pauline Parker and, in her first movie role, Kate Winslet did a first-rate job as Juliet Hulme. Honourable mentions must also go to; Sarah Peirse as Honora Parker Rieper, Diana Kent as Hilda Hulme, Clive Merrison as Dr. Henry Hulme, Simon O'Connor as Herbert Rieper and Jed Brophy as John\/Nicholas.Peter Jackson pays great attention to detail and it is the details that make this a particularly good film. It's a period piece and it really looks the part with every detail as it should be. As I've already mentioned, the CGI is expertly done and fits seamlessly into the story. It's quite an unusual plot with much of the action focused on just one of the girls, Pauline, but then it was based on her diaries. In fact, much of the narration is made up from direct quotes from her diaries. It may not be for everyone, but I found it quite engrossing and well worth a look&#x85; Recommended.My score 8.5\/10.IMDb Score 7.6\/10 (based on 30,765 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score 95\/100 (based on 42 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score 82\/100 (based on 35,964 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

Great performances from both of the starring actresses. I thought Melanie Lynskey was really excellent as Pauline Parker and, in her first movie role, Kate Winslet did a first-rate job as Juliet Hulme. Honourable mentions must also go to; Sarah Peirse as Honora Parker Rieper, Diana Kent as Hilda Hulme, Clive Merrison as Dr. Henry Hulme, Simon O'Connor as Herbert Rieper and Jed Brophy as John\/Nicholas.Peter Jackson pays great attention to detail and it is the details that make this a particularly good film. It's a period piece and it really looks the part with every detail as it should be. As I've already mentioned, the CGI is expertly done and fits seamlessly into the story. It's quite an unusual plot with much of the action focused on just one of the girls, Pauline, but then it was based on her diaries. In fact, much of the narration is made up from direct quotes from her diaries.

","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"18 December 2011","score":"","review":" This film is based on a true story; it chronicles the events leading up to a murder in 1954, New Zealand. It's the story of a very close friendship formed between two teenage girls and how it lead to murder. Ever since I saw the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy I have always been looking out for other works directed by Peter Jackson. This one has come up several times in discussions and so I was very pleased when the BBC gave it an airing earlier this week. Here's a brief plot summary before I give you my thoughts.We begin in Canterbury, New Zealand, 1953 where Juliet Hulme has arrived at her new school from England. She forms a friendship with Pauline Parker, an impressionable girl who shares her love of the opera singer, Mario Lanza. They quickly form a strong bond, one that is made stronger by the fact that they both have had bad illnesses in the past. They begin writing stories about a fantasy land with various colourful characters. They re-enact scenes from the stories and eventually this fantasy land becomes real to them. Their parents become worried that their friendship is becoming too intense. As events unfold, it transpires that Juliet's parents are planning to divorce and she is to be shipped out to an aunt in South Africa. This hit's Pauline hard and, because she has been having a particularly hard time with her mother, they hatch a plot to get her out of the way.

It is a masterpiece. It was a revolution. It is wonderful.Why do I even review it?

And how people give the wrong answers toward the criticism.This movie is not being hyped. Mostly hypes do not last for decades, except you would still call classical music or the beatles a hype today. It just is that good. I was born almost 20 Years after it was released, so i may have seen better special effects. I may have seen science-fiction movies, some of them influenced by 2001, that were way more thrilling or had clearer message. I may not even call it the best film of all times. But thats it. Thats all criticism i can come up with. This film is excellent. It has aged like a good wine. It was a revelation to me, as it was to the generations of viewers who watched it before me. And it is not even about the philosophical themes or the mythology ( that is continued in the much more conventional but yet great 2010 ). It was a revelation about filmmaking and reception. It is one of those rare films that show you intensively that cinema can do more than just tell some stories. That film is more than just a way to illustrate something else.However, of course not everyone has to appreciate it. That does not mean that it is only for open-minded intellectuals, it is just such an intense work, that you cannot expect, that everybody likes it. As it is in music or fine arts, there will always be things you can respect, but you just do not like.But if you do not like it, at least show some respect. Do not call it a hype, only because you do not feel the need to spend two hours of your time with this particular piece. Try it and if it does not work just accept that you do not like it and go on to something else. Do not complain about the apes and count the minutes to tell others how boring it is.

Never have been, and probably never will be. But I have to credit John Candy for his brilliant performance as Buck, and it's even the more tragic watching him in this, knowing that he would pass away less than five years later. Jean Louisa Kelly is extremely irritating as Tia, and you'd wonder just why Buck is even bothered... but then again you have to credit him for sticking it out. It has a typical happy ending, where Tia comes around and becomes Buck's best friend after realising what a sleazo her boyfriend was. But as predictable as it is, its enjoyable for at least one viewing.

Uncle Buck is possibly one of his most well known performances, as it is indeed a very popular family film, also featuring a very young Macauley Culkin before his Home Alone fame.The Russell family have just moved from Indianapolis to the Chicago suburbs after a job promotion for Bob, the father, much to the loathing of their rebellious teenager daughter Tia. When Cindy's father has a heart attack, her and Bob have to leave to be with him, but their is no one around to watch the kids on such short notice. Bob suggests his brother Buck, but Cindy vehemently objects, showing an absolute hatred for the man she deems a slob and a bad influence. But they have no choice and they give Buck a call, who comes over right away. Tia immediately gives Buck a hard time, but he hits it off with her two younger siblings.

It gets off to a slow start, but once the two women get off to their vacation, things pick up, and we get an engrossing story.The story was filmed as a mini-series for the BBC in 1992, and it was released theatrically in the US. The story takes place in England in the Twenties, and Lottie (played by Josie Lawrence) is sick of the weather - it's March - dreary, and rainy. Lottie and Rose (Miranda Richardson) become acquainted and are unhappy in their marriages, so they decide to rent a villa in Italy for the month of April. They can't quite afford it, though, so they advertise for another two ladies, and a more dissimilar quartet would be hard to imagine. Lottie's and Rose's husbands are played by Alfred Molino and Jim Broadbent, and all four are excellent. Joan Plowright and Polly Walker play the other two woman sharing the villa. Things get off to a rocky start and the ladies defend their turf and come to terms about who shall dominate whom. But the Italian April works its enchantment on them, and soon things go much better. Lottie decides to invite her husband to see if the magic can help them reconcile. Rose then writes to her husband to invite him. Then things get sticky. Jim Broadbent's character has been chasing Polly Walker's character unknown to Rose; Rose is being pursued by the owner of the villa.The resolution of the various threads is well done, and the ending is satisfying.

Batman and Gordon are working together to keep the streets safe for the holiday season when a new menace arrives in the sewers. A business tycoon, Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken) is captured and taken in the sewers to meet the mysterious man called The Penguin. Penguin uses Shreck's connections to resurface and establish himself in Gotham City. Shreck soon uses the Penguin's new popularity to his advantage and starts a campaign to elect him as mayor.While this is going on lowly secretary for Shreck, Selina Kyle, finds out more than she was supposed to and is killed by Shreck. At least for a moment. Selina survives the fall and creates Catwoman to extract her revenge. She also starts a relationship with Bruce Wayne while frequently going toe to toe with Batman.Batman has his hands full this time trying to stop Penguin's true scheme and contending with Catwoman.This sequel draws the focus more to the villains. This works well at some points, like the origin of The Penguin and not so much other times, Selina's transformation scene. It's not that the scene is terrible it's just it drags a bit long. Batman is still present of course but his role is somewhat smaller this time around. The action scenes could also be better polished as the choreography of the fighting looks sloppy sometimes.But for all its faults what this movie does pull off it pulls off great. I'm most impressed with Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Catwoman which manages to seem confident and edgy but also a little insecure at times. And I'm impressed with Danny DeVito's Penguin. His character actually comes off as pretty tragic at certain points but he still manages to provide a threat to Batman. There are times when I think he tried too much to mimic Jack Nicholson's Joker but I manage to overlook those moments. Gotham City is still beautifully designed and the supporting cast gives it their all. Michael Keaton still gives off one of the best Batman in the history of cinema and Danny Elfman's score is fitting to the dark tone of the film.Overall, this sequel isn't going to please everyone who liked the first movie but I still recommend watching it.

It's one of the most authentically shot films, whether we're talking about visual effects, cinematography, sound, music, art direction and of course Lucas's direction. Perhaps this was the movie that tagged Lucas as one of the all-time greatest directors. Revisiting this movie more than twenty years later brought back a lot of memories. Obviously it has a lot of nostalgic value.More than two decades after its release, Lucas attempts to make its prequels and the consequences are disastrous. With CGI dominating sci-fi films since the late 90s, the look of Lucas's later Starwar films (movies 1,2 and 3 made in the 90's and 2000's) could not match up to the early classics. They lacked the authentic look and atmosphere and suffered from poor editing. Most of all they were so boring (lacking in energy, lacklustre story, dreadful performances etc) that they failed to engage the viewer.Coming back to the movie at hand, it is easily sci-fi action adventure at its best. It's rich in dialogue. The level of energy and tension is excellently maintained. Even the quieter scenes have you engaged with beautiful visuals and what's also amazing is how simple they are, no complex or intricate designing but at the same time very detailed.The characters are a delight. The casting is solid. Harrison Ford is charming and funny as the laidback and slightly self-centered Han. Carrie Fisher redefines bring a princess in films. Before that, princesses were cast as damsels in distress. Mark Hamill captures Luke's innocence and essence very well. Peter Mayhew, James Earl Jones, and Alec Guiness are great.

And why this obsession with round numbers? Why not rise up out of the fog after 83 years 4 months and 35 days, why after exactly 100 years? How I love horror film logic.They could have risen at the 10th anniversary of the massacre, for example.

The ghosts get their revenge, the offspring don't get butchered (well, they don't get born in the first place, actually, ehem) and justice is done.I'd like to also know what exactly it is that ex-lepers-but-now-sea\/fog-ghosts do for an entire 100 years while they wait for revenge. Do they pester their leader to move the Revenge Date a few decades earlier? Do they play chess, or do they just stare into dolphins and squid all day? TF is done with a certain degree of style, typical of the late 70s and early 80s, which is why it isn't boring in spite of the rather slow pace.Why does everyone open the door when they hear ominous-sounding loud knocking after midnight? Why does Carpenter cast two uglies such as Janet Leigh (looking more dried-up and corpsy than the ghosts even), and her awful amateur daughter Jamie Lee? Watching Jamie Lee kiss gave me a big shudder, much more eerie than the most brutal murder committed by the ex-lepers. Carpenter hates beauty, that must be it.
