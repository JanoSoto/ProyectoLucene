Gene Hackman plays a paranoid surveillance operator, Harry Caul, that tries not to reveal any details of his life to anyone, however no matter how hard he tries things still end up getting out. His sense of self and the world around him is completely destroyed by the events that follow him in the movie.Harry takes all precautions to make sure no one is following or listening to him. He takes the bus so his car cannot be followed, he says he doesn't have a phone and always uses payphones, and his apartment is guarded not only by several different locks but an alarm system as well. Harry plays the tragic hero in many ways. He wants to do what is right for a change and it ends up coming back to bite him. Despite the alarm on his apartment his landlady is able to leave him a Birthday present, and his house is easily bugged. In fact Harry is bugged twice during the movie, and he is supposed to be the best. You feel sad for him because he is so alone. When he finally does give in to a woman and seems to trust her she goes behind his back and steals the tapes right from under his nose.This movie not only follows the lonely life of the saxophone playing eavesdropper, but explores the morality of spying as a profession. Because of his work people have died and once he actually becomes involved, like he never wanted to, and listens to the words themselves he grows a conscience. By the end he has literally torn his life apart over it. Throughout the movie there are images of religion that cannot be ignored. It seems that God is the only thing that Harry can truly reveal everything too. It did surprise me that he went to confession though. I was expecting it to be someone that would use what he said against him. Every time he begins to be normal something confirms his need to be constantly on guard. It is sad to think what happens to him after this is over. At first it seemed like he took precautions because he wanted to feel important enough that someone would actually want to follow him, and now that someone is it destroys his life. It was surprising that he brought all those people back to his workshop as well. Either he was drunk or just wanted to fit in and not seem out of place, but it showed that he wasn't being careful when it mattered most. Standing outside his girlfriends place for an hour seems a little much, but taking precautions with your work is understandable.It seems as if Harry is caught between the world of religion and the world of spying, and also reality versus perception. Towards the end it is hard to tell what he is really seeing and what he perceives to be real. His mind is slowly slipping, along with his ability to separate work and the personal. Music seems like the only thing that will save Harry or at least give him some comfort. He allowed himself to become too involved with a job and it ultimately was the cause of his downfall.

As far as I know, this is the first movie Marni Nixon dubbed for an actress, but what everyone does not know is that Deborah Kerr did a lot of her own singing in this movie. It's very hard to tell when Kerr stops and Nixon takes over and vise-versa. Shall We Dance and Getting To Know Your is all Deborah Kerr. Hello Young Lovers is all Marni Nixon, but it's hard to tell who is who on I Whistle A Happy Tune even though sometimes it sounds like both of them pieced together! With Anna's soliloquy, it's very east to distinguish the two voices. Maybe that's why they cut this from the final version, plus the Song to the King! But, you don't really know what really happened in the vocals because Deborah Kerr was interviewed on one of the talk shows and I remember she said that she helped only on the higher notes that she couldn't reach! At that time, no one knew who Marni Nixon was and everyone thought that it was really Deborah Kerr doing her own singing! The dubbing is done exceptionally well combining the voices, but when Nixon dubbed for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. It's quite obvious who is doing who! One of the prettiest songs I Have Dreamed Was Deleted and My Lord and Master was deleted, but this needn't have been if they would have picked the acting pace up a little more!So, is the rumor true, as it stated in the programs given out in the theaters. that no other actress was considered for the part of Anna than Deborah Kerr, and the rumor that Yul Brynner was the one who highly recommended and wanted Deborah Kerr for the role of Anna? Well, uh - noooo! The first person that was contacted to play Anna was Maureen O'Hara. After all, Maureen O'Hara had one extra thing going for her beauty, acting ability, and feisty way about her to play Anna; she could do her own vocals because she was an excellent singer when it came to the vocal department! Let's face it! All Irish people are great singers! But, Rogers and Hammerstien balked at the idea, and said something catty like A Pirates Wench play Anna? Never! So, that ended any more hopes that Maureen O'Hara would play Anna in the movie version of The King and I. Too bad! She would have been great, and much better than Deborah Kerr! So, what about the movie? Well, it's good, but there's something about it that doesn't ring true. Too operatic. Much too long. Sometimes drags. The pace could have been picked up faster in the acting. It's obvious that the Ramesis and Terry McKay are in love. I think that gradually they should have made that a little more obvious and if they had, it would have made more sense why Terry would have wanted, even more so, to stay on and complete the work that she had promised Rameses.I know that there is a longer version of this movie that hasn't been seen for years. I remember when it played at the Valley Theater and the sign read The King and I - Un-cut! Intact! Which means that this version had the complete score in it which isn't in the version that I saw at popular prices as a teenager which is the same version we have on Video today.But, like I've said in other reviews I've submitted It's just a shame that people today can't see these movies on the big Wide-Screen with Stereophonic Saound as they were meant to be enjoyed! We used to have a theater here in Cincinnati, Ohio called The Emery which used to show everything from Silents to Early Talkies to films like The King and I, but the theater is no more! Sad! There's just something about this movie that makes it just a good movie and not the classic that it deserves to be! Maybe Maureen O'Hara had something to do with it!
