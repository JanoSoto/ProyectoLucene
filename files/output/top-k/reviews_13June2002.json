I thought the special effects were phenomenal, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were great in their roles as the Jedi, and Darth Maul was really cool. The number 1 problem I thought was the God awful acting of Jake Lloyd as the extremely important character of Anakin. I have heard some things that people said he's supposed to be like that, all nice and hopeful. I still thought his acting could have been better. If you're reading this Jake Lloyd, know I disliked your acting, no hard feelings. This is really the only big problem I thought. I know hundreds of people hated Jar Jar Binks but he didn't really annoy me as much as Anakin. I actually laughed at Jar Jar's comic relief and my 9th grade friend says Jar Jar is his favorite Star Wars character. I did like Jar Jar despite what other people say. I loved the podrace sequence and the climax. Those were my favorite parts. I liked those Battle Droids, but I do think the Stormtroopers were better. The fight with Darth Maul was great. The guy who played him (I forgot his name)was great I was hoping he wouldn't die, but was happy with the movie and its ending all the same. Overall, I give Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace an 8 out of 10. 2 points for plot, 2 points for acting, 2 points for visual effects, 2 points for its cool characters, and 2 points forit being a Star Wars film. That would give it a 10. Minus 2 for Jake Lloyd's horrible acting. Now Episode 1 gets an 8 out of 10.

Enid and Rebecca, played by Birch and Johannson, are teens who hate pretty much everything about being a teen, but still act like kids at times.  After the girls pull a prank on a low-life, played by Buscemi, the newfound empathy Enid discovers takes over as she tries to make amends for the act.  Over the course of the movie, the girls begin to part ways, a very realistic portrayal of what happens to most high school friends.  Enid's carefree attitude isn't helping her - finding and keeping a job is impossible and her against the grain way of thinking collides with the norm.  The bad things keep coming, like bricks falling from the sky, and we wonder if Enid will make it through her hardships.In some ways I loved this movie, but hated it for other reasons; definitely a mixed bag for me.  As a hater of teen movies, I thought it was excellent to see girls who are not perky, cheerleader types with bleached blonde hair and size 2 bodies.  Scarlett didn't look like the best choice to play Enid's sidekick, but Thora was excellent as Enid in every way.  Enid, as a character, was refreshing, but I didn't care much for her cynicism and cold attitude.  While her troubles during the last third of the movie are genuinely heart-breaking, I sometimes thought, Serves you right, which isn't good.  I think I would have shot myself if I had that kind of outlook on life.  The script got a bit gratuitous with the F-word, one of my biggest pet peeves about independent and artistic films.  A sexual encounter between Birch and Buscemi had me laughing out loud.  On the other hand, the direction was great and the way the movie flowed from beginning to end couldn't have been better.If I were asked someone's advice on whether they should see Ghost World, the first thing I would ask them is if they saw and enjoyed American Beauty.  I think people who loved that movie will especially like Ghost World, the Thora Birch connection notwithstanding.  I hated American Beauty to high heaven, but I didn't hate this movie half as much.  Ghost World had its nice moments, but overall, it's a depressing film which may turn off viewers who are into more light-hearted fare.  I'm surprised to see it ranked so highly with an 8.1, but with its similarities to AB, it's not surprising.

I respect his work because he dares to leave his imagination free, in an arty yet commercial way. I always enjoyed his movies, but after continuously watching them for many years now (especially since they were released on DVD), I can finally spot their weakness.You see, some annoying feelings come to surface when you watch 'Batman' or 'Sleepy Hollow' for a tenth time. They are boring movies! Or to be fair, the are movies with long, boring scenes. Evidently Tim Burton seems to fear and respect every frame he shoots while editing and this behaviour creates very long dialog scenes, that work against the pacing of the movie.Long dialog scenes that don't provide exposition should be cut in a non-drama movie. Let's face it, Tim Burton has never worked with a 'Taxi Driver' script, so most of the long dialog scenes should be divided among action scenes.Also, the suspense doesn't change much in his movies. 'Sleepy Hollow' runs in the same way from start to finish, so does 'Batman'. I must say that his best work, is his comedies and maybe he should try to transfer the mood of those films to his other work too.'Planet of the Apes' is bad and I'm not talking about the ENDING, which is the best part of the movie. Only a moron would try to analyse what really happened there. Have you noticed that stupid people, always need to lower every situation to their own standards, in order to understand it? Of course this creates even more confusion (to them) and they won't get this ending no matter what, so let's proceed. By the way, true cinema is about expressing emotions and not opinions. If you need to state an opinion, the printed word is the perfect medium for it.The biggest mistake of the movie is this Burton element. 'Planet' needed aggressive editing, in order to become fun and not boring, which is what it is now. Specifically the dinner scene and the escape scene in the village. Burton treated this script like it was 'Godfather', so we watch the apes discuss over dinner about every day and social matters for ten minutes, like we care. They're talking apes! On with the story please! Obviously they wanted to balance the action with some drama scenes, but the writing is very bad. A lot of other scenes are boring too and should be deleted, since they destroy everything. Burton seems to have lost his humor in this movie too, since these long scenes could work if they were funny, but they are merely irritating.Unfortunately the script is quite weak, so even if that editing took place, it wouldn't make a masterpiece out of the story. Mark Wahlberg looks like a little kid in the whole movie, possibly because of Burton. He wanted him to become this anti Charlot Heston, an action hero who's in the movie only for the fun ride. It just doesn't work.On the positive side, Burton shows off his craftsmanship for one more time, providing us with some fairy tale images and an introduction in a space station, which is the most spectacular cinematic work since 'Superman'.'Planet of the Apes' shouldn't be made at all. How can you recreate perfection? What's next, a remake of 'Lawrence of Arabia'? Anyway, for once more Burton made an action movie that doesn't stand the test of repetitive viewings and this is because of his fear for aggressive editing.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I am a Tim Burton fan.

If this movie had a better-suited director and Jodie Foster in the lead it could have been a more-than worthy successor to SOTL.After reading some of these reviews, I wonder if MGM employees were given a bonus for posting this crap. 3 stars out of 10.

Episode II has a few things going for it a talented cast including Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson, is a gorgeous movie to look at, and has a whole mythology which has become part of popular culture. Early on there is breath-taking sky diving scene in an aerial city with Jedi Padwan, Anikan Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), and his mentor, a now older Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). This is well done-- great pace, action, full of life. The movie, however soon bogs down. George Lucas and Jonathan Hales have constructed a very wordy script that is full of content about the trade wars, the unrest in the Republic, the conspiracy against the Jedi, and a lame love story between Anikan (Christensen) and Padme (Natalie Portman). There is really no context. If the context of Episode II is to illicit pathos for Anikan's journey down the Dark Side of the Force, it fails or is a half-hearted attempt. Rather Episode II shies away from the dark nature of the legacy. There in may lie the problem-- we all know how the story will end. There is a great scene where Anikan attacks out of anger (even though justified), and later vows that he will be all powerful, because he wasn't strong enough. Following this he whines to Padme (Natalie Portman). What is going on? This does not work for the man who will eventually become the evil and merciless, Darth Vader. Hayden Christensen is a good actor and charismatic, but his lines and the part of Anikan were so inconsistent. The dialog in Episode II is horrible throughout. Anikan really comes off as some whiny punk kid, rather than someone threatening and on the verge of malevolence. After all Anikan will become Darth Vader. Once again this is not a problem with the actor, but the story. The love story between Anikan and Padme is like Naboo 90210. It is a given that they will be together. Obi-wan and Anikan are the Jedi assigned by the Republic to protect now Naboo Senator Padme Amidala after a failed assassination attempt on the senator. 10 years have past since they were together in Episode I. Anikan soon falls in love with Padme which is not allowed for a Jedi. Ewan McGregor is good as the now mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. He gives a new maturity and gravity to the character. Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu is kind of the Shaft Jedi. He kicks some butt. There are some great action scenes in Episode II, and there could have been more. The completely CGI Yoda gets to lay the smack-down at the end, as only the Jedi Master can. This is awesome, and almost saves the movie. Almost.I saw Episode II at a midnight showing on opening day with some dear friends-- so I am a fan. I will see it again. And I did wait a while before writing a comment. For me, although the movie looks great and has some awesome things in it, as a whole it lacks a soul. It seems like Lucas did not have the courage to give it a dark one, while providing the underlying context of Hope that we are familiar with in the stories of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.

Why?  The first remark is in response to the people who saw it early on and believed it to be the scariest film they had ever seen, causing higher expectations.  The second comes from people who sat too close, and the third from people who expected a LOT more than psychological trauma as the true subject of a horror film.  Did they want gut-spilling?  Explosions?  The supernatural depicted through cheesy special effects, as seen in a movie like The Haunting? Please.  The Blair Witch Project was an exercise in realism, using psychological terror (not what you see, but what you don't see) as its weapon, and it IS one of the scariest films ever made.

(lightly) on true events before i review i have to say that i dont like people remaking movies,most of them are trash,however, this one is definitly exceptional and J.C did a great job remaking\/directing this movie the camera work is  perfectly executed(shooted) on the other-side of the coin the cast were at their best(C.REEVE,M.hamell....) the death scenes were awesome but needed

It's a story we've seen in so many movies, you wish they will lift the bar to this already worn out genre.  Will they lift they bar and add something new to this genre, something fresh?  The answer is...no they don't.  This is a forgettable and boring movie, a film you will forget by the time the end of June comes around.This film stars Anthony Hopkins as a old and withered CIA agent, on a mission to buy a Nuculear bomb off a terriost named Adrik Vas(Peter Stormare), until after the first meeting, Hopkins and Chris Rock now in the CIA brother, gets chased and ends up getting killed because he saved Hopkins life.  Now...without the brother that set up the deal, the CIA find his brother, a street smart ticket scalper Jake Hayes(Chris Rock), and tell him about his brother and the deal he set up, they have nine days to turn him into his brother( in a sense that is) to fool the terriosts.  They teach him how to drink wine, how to talk a different language, and many other boring things that you don't really care about.  The rest of the movie is action scenes with bunch of shooting, and other boring scenes.  There is a plot twist(sort of) in the middle of the movie, but i'm not going to ruin it for you on this review.The chemistry between Hopkins and Rock is there, they are good when they share the scenes, but throughout the entire movie Hopkins just looks bored, just looks like he has no clue why he is doing this movie, he looks like he deeply regrests it.  Rock, on the other hand, is funny and works good in this movie, but he also gets kind of annoying torward the end of the movie, he still is fishing out jokes when the world could come to a end? Come on, get real!There are good supporting roles by Stormare as the bad guy, he is always good in no matter what he's in.  The other preformance that is nice to watch is Gabriel Macht(Agent Seal), he is a straight arrow and is smooth, he looks and acts like he should be in the CIA, makes it fun to watch him in action.The movie just falls apart, I saw this movie two weeks before it came out(a screening) and then saw it again few nights ago with some friends, but as I watched it again, i got bored very easily with the film, and couldn't wait until the credits began to roll.

I cannot believe that the rating for this film (I struggle to call it even that) is anything above a 5. Sure it is a fun romp and is much, much better than Episode I, but is that really enough?First of all, the movie (in an effort to be witty and clever) completely destroys any mystery that the Star Wars Universe once had. During the climactic final battle in which a very prestigious Star Wars character fights a light sabre duel I heard people in the theatre laughing. This character should be reverred and respected, not laughed at in an attempt at cheap thrills.I don't think anyone can deny the fact that the entire movie feels dead. There is very little substance in the action sequences that makes up feel for the characters. We know that Obi-Wan and Anakin survive and so scenes that should be tense and thrilling are not. We understand that characters being introduced this late in the game are simply being set up as cannon fodder in the next film.Adding to the sense of a frozen and life-less corpse is the dull script and even worse acting. Hayden Christensen seems confused when delivering his dialogue. He can't decide whether to stay snobbish or turn over to brooding or even show his romantic side. He changes his perspective so often you have a hard time figuring him out. Of course, we don't need to figure him out because we know he becomes Vader in the end.Anyone who tries to refer to the Star Wars series as a sprawling space epic is simply wrong. There is no question about it. George Lucas has simply become pigeon-holed by the success of Star Wars and cannot even begin to consider making another type of movie. He has also become quite a cash cow as of lately. Releasing the Special Editions and then the Special Special Editions and now the three Prequel Films must be paying off. I doubt after years of being hounded by the phantom menace that is the Star Wars Franchise, George Lucas cares much for the integrity of the Star Wars Universe. He doesn't care about plot loops or character development he just wants the cold hard moola.The sad thing is, we keep going to see the movies and we keep fueling his passion to make money.

I felt I had missed the point. Why this title? Was there a message, and if yes which one(s)?Since then, I've read a fair bit on cinema and when I saw Le Mépris again I really enjoyed it. So here are some keys to understanding, which I didn't have the first time and found useful the second. Of course, I don't pretend to give any definitive interpretation. I hope that the film-theory experts will forgive my ill-informed wittering and that at least some people will find it useful - especially those who, like me were first disconcerted - people to whom I can only recommend to go and watch it again.In many ways, there is no simple interpretation to Godard's films and he probably self-consciously tries to make it hard for the audience to come up with any clear-cut message. If he advocates for anything at all, it's more a kind of plurality of views. To support this statement, I would just mention an interview of Godard where C. MacCabe asked him whether he didn't like watching Dallas and soaps from time to time to which G. replied yes of course I like that too. Godard's stand on Hollywood cinema is not so much that it's really bad and it shouldn't exist. Rather, throughout his films, he intends to show that Hollywood is one way of making films but there are many other possible cinematic expressions all too often smothered by Hollywood studios commercial aggressiveness and the ubiquity of their output. One important point is that for Godard, this broadening of cinematic possibilities must first go through a negative phase aimed at making the viewer self-consciously aware of the current cinematic techniques. The weak plot for instance is such a device. Unlike mainstream cinema, he uses the concept of plot in a completely accessory way. What matters more for G is what he can do around it. The reason is partly to get cinema away from the 19th century realistic novelistic\/story-telling cage in which it's been trapped since the beginning. Another reason is probably the brechtian idea that plots induce an easy emotional involvement of the spectator with the show (identification with the characters, fear, suspense...), which tends to inhibit any reflexive\/contemplative attitude from the audience. So, in Le Mépris, the plot is weak and one feels very little for the characters... and it is meant like that. In some ways, the fact that Le Mépris is more accessible makes it more difficult because one tends to watch it as a conventional film (there is a plot after all, the dialogues are plausible...) whereas most other Godard films have to be taken for what they are - some kind of cinematic exploration - because there is no way to take them otherwise.The music is also used against current practice. The baroque-malherian mix does not support the action; instead it is used as a kind of leitmotiv\/refrain throughout the film to punctuate and induce pondering on the action rather than emotional involvement. The use of the meant-to-be beautiful score echoes his use of the equally meant-to-be beautiful scenery pictures at one level they are nice, but the feeling that they are somehow out-of-place hinders their complete enjoyment.What remains is a feeling of pervasive nostalgia, itself echoing Lang's reading of the Odyssey the story of a lost holistic\/mythological\/cosmological Greek vision of the world - vision replaced nowadays by a rationalist\/mercantile consciousness (embodied by Prockosh). Greek Gods now appear as human artifacts (painted statutes...) Following that line, there is probably the idea that Art (including artistic cinema) is today the only way to live a holistic experience, which is completely incompatible with Hollywood's way of making films. The incompatibility of the different views on what cinema ought to be, manifests itself by the impossibility of communication between the various protagonists who all speak different languages. This inability to communicate is also apparent in Javal's inability to understand his wife's behaviour as well as her persistent refusal to tell him.The title...  At one level - central to the plot - it is the contempt of BB for her husband for compromising his work\/views to please Prockosh. But contempt is also rampant between almost each character in the film Lang considers Prockosh as the unsubtle money maker, Prockosh sees Lang as the lost-in-space intellectual, Prockosh treats the woman translator like a dog, Javal at various points looks down on BB as the bimbo secretary... Then at a higher level, there is the patronising\/contemptuous attitude of Prockosh towards the future audience of the film, and maybe Godard's contempt for Prockosh's attitude to cinema and there are probably many more levels...For the anecdote, G also thought of taking Dreyer instead of Lang - two directors whom he admires (I think).

The use of the meant-to-be beautiful score echoes his use of the equally meant-to-be beautiful scenery pictures at one level they are nice, but the feeling that they are somehow out-of-place hinders their complete enjoyment.What remains is a feeling of pervasive nostalgia, itself echoing Lang's reading of the Odyssey the story of a lost holistic\/mythological\/cosmological Greek vision of the world - vision replaced nowadays by a rationalist\/mercantile consciousness (embodied by Prockosh). Greek Gods now appear as human artifacts (painted statutes...) Following that line, there is probably the idea that Art (including artistic cinema) is today the only way to live a holistic experience, which is completely incompatible with Hollywood's way of making films. The incompatibility of the different views on what cinema ought to be, manifests itself by the impossibility of communication between the various protagonists who all speak different languages. This inability to communicate is also apparent in Javal's inability to understand his wife's behaviour as well as her persistent refusal to tell him.The title...  At one level - central to the plot - it is the contempt of BB for her husband for compromising his work\/views to please Prockosh. But contempt is also rampant between almost each character in the film Lang considers Prockosh as the unsubtle money maker, Prockosh sees Lang as the lost-in-space intellectual, Prockosh treats the woman translator like a dog, Javal at various points looks down on BB as the bimbo secretary... Then at a higher level, there is the patronising\/contemptuous attitude of Prockosh towards the future audience of the film, and maybe Godard's contempt for Prockosh's attitude to cinema and there are probably many more levels...For the anecdote, G also thought of taking Dreyer instead of Lang - two directors whom he admires (I think). Maybe Godard sees Lang a Greek God of Cinema?  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"13 June 2002","score":"","review":"  I saw this at a pre-screening this evening with quite an audience. This movie moves Matt Damon up to the big league. He gave a great performance that had the entire theater jumping from surprise events and applauding many scenes before the movie even ended. And rather than repeat many names already mentioned in other comments I would like to say everyone did a great job with their parts. And what a great choice of Franka Potente as his lady on the run with him. (Remember her great movie Run Lola Run?) One of the things I liked best was the incredible sound track and score as well as excellent photography to match the events. Everyone in my group loved the movie and many of us can hardly wait to get the DVD version for our home theaters. This will be a must own movie for my collection. 9 out of 10. Go see this one for sure! ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2002","score":"","review":"  I saw this at a pre-screening this evening with quite an audience.
