The script is brilliant, the acting is superb all around (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), the directing and the photography are inspired, and the music score is touching without being intrusive (like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative).  Every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. This truly is one of the best films I have ever seen and I wish there were more films like it. I am glad that Reese Witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems.

The producers fortunately decided to return the series to its dark roots after the rollercoaster ride of the video gamish Part IV. Although the effort was nice, neither the script nor the direction managed to accomplish fully successful results. The result was quite mediocre but at least this film had a plot (in contrast to The Dream Master) and made an attempt of portraying a nightmarish world with dark gothic scenery.We knew it would happen after the financial success of Part IV the sequel was inevitable. Picking up where we left off, one year after the events of the Dream Master, Alice (Lisa Wilcox) starts having bad dreams once again. Her life will soon change drastically when first she learns that her boyfriend has rendered her pregnant and she then witnesses, in a peculiar day-dream\/vision, the horrific rebirth\/resurrection of the notorious boogeyman called Freddy Krueger. It seems that Freddy simply can't be put to rest. However, I am compelled to acknowledge the fact that the explanation given by the scriptwriters is logical, decent and passable instead of having a dog urinating fire on Krueger's bones. So after Krueger is resurrected he begins his reign of terror once again by intimidating Alice and invading the dreams of her friends dispatching them one by one.There are some interesting plot elements in this one but I don't want to give away spoilers. I will say however that the storyline continues the revelations given in Part III about Krueger's past. The gothic dream sequences where Alice infiltrated the mental asylum are some of the best ones in the entire film. Speaking of Alice, Lisa Wilcox is a much better actress here, portraying Alice perfectly as a dynamic and powerful heroine who struggles to save herself and her unborn child, while in the last film she seemed out of place. The cinematography is good, some of the SFX are great (the comic book sequence comes to mind) the supporting actors give solid performances. The death scenes are quite cool, do not disappoint and will please both the Elm Street and the gore fans in general. The characters are likeable enough to root for them. My personal favorite was Mark, the comic book freak.Unfortunately the liabilities are quite as many . First, the script can't do anything to hide the fate of the supporting cast. From the first moment you see Alice's friends you can watch the stamped label on their foreheads writing CANNON FODDER with huge neon lights. Secondly some of the scenes lack the tension they should have due to Stephen Hopkins' lame direction (like the rebirth scene). The visions Alice has of her 8 year old son Jacob is a quite cliched and stupid idea which doesn't seem to lead anywhere . On the contrary, the visions of Amanda Krueger was a strong plot device which helped the film. One of the worst aspects of the film, which is especially damaging, is Robert Englund as Krueger. Not only has he little screen time but he gives his worst performance in the entire series. Englund is quite bored and tired here, sleepwalking through his role. Rumors have it that he had signed a two movies contract in Part IV and it shows!! Finally the ending sequence which can't deliver what the writers envisioned. Not only does it seem suspiciously inspired by Labyrinth (1986) with the Escher-esque scenery, but it lacks the power it should have. The ending leaves you wanting more of Freddy and a more satisfying resolution. Fortunately Part VI, which followed, accomplished all these tasks perfectly.Worth noting is the fact that the script was written in an era where the media had made a great fuss about abortions, so the social allegories the film tries to pull are vociferous . Unfortunately these subjects are quite dated by now so the film once again loses points in impact. Overall, Part V is a mixed bag. It may disappoint many of you while others may be thrilled. I believe that although it is not worth all of the money you will give to rent it and you may not lose much if you miss it, on the other hand you can take a look at a couple of satisfactory scenes not to mention you may find out if Alice will eventually survive from the clutches of her dream stalker.

I watched it for the first time last night and am glad I did.  A fantastic cast, wonderful performances, and solid direction.Wilkinson and Spacek play a normal New England couple whose world is almost destroyed when their college-age son is murdered by the ex-husband of his older girlfriend (Tomei).  When it appears that our legal system is unable to do the right thing, Wilkinson and his best friend take things into their own hand and eventually do what justice cannot.I was totally sucked into this film and cannot even remember if it had a musical score.  While it dragged a little in the middle, maybe this was necessary to set up the audience for the inevitable, and violent ending. Director Todd Field accomplished more in one steady shot than most directors do in whole scenes, like when he centered the camera on the license plate of Wilkinson's Saab as he observed his son's killer at his place of work. The bottom of the plate had one word; Veteran; This told the audience several things - that Wilkinson probably knew how to handle weapons, that he may have been in combat, or at a minimum, that he was trained how to kill by the military.  This same fact was also established for Wilkinson's partner in crime as the camera panned across numerous photos of him obviously taken during the Vietnam War.I also liked the part when Wilkinson abducted the killer and forced him to turn on a baseball game on the radio, as opposed to having to converse with the man he knows murdered his only son.  Not only did it eliminate the need for conversation in the car (as he guided the killer to his own death), but it showed that Wilkinson did not want to relate to the murderer; that he wanted the man to remain an object,as opposed to a human being - this, probably making it easier to kill him in the end.While it's a matter of opinion as to whether or not Wilkinson was justified in murdering his son's killer, the film expertly shows the trauma experienced by the family of murder victims and how normal law abiding citizens can be forced to take matters into their own hands and do what needs to be done, even if it involves breaking the law.

What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission; but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved.  The genius of that!  The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance.  The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover, he's the leader of the group, and he survives at the end.  He was 'one of the crew' instead of a one-man wrecking machine like in so many of his other films; that was very nice to see.  Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon, as does Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy.  The whole cast worked very well together. The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator.  The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time, the camouflage was pure genius.  I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame.  I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done; from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage, to the suit.  I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!) Predator is evidence of how action films should be done.  A great story and relentless action, all progressing the story along.

The genius of that!  The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance.  The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover, he's the leader of the group, and he survives at the end.  He was 'one of the crew' instead of a one-man wrecking machine like in so many of his other films; that was very nice to see.  Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon, as does Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy.  The whole cast worked very well together. The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator.  The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time, the camouflage was pure genius.  I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame.  I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done; from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage, to the suit.  I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!) Predator is evidence of how action films should be done.  A great story and relentless action, all progressing the story along.

I nearly turned the film off after the first half hour - nothing seemed to have happened.  In truth, I wish I had turned the film off.  The topic of anal intercourse between father and daughter is not one on which a film 'for entertainment' should be made.  It is absolutely disgusting and not for viewing by normal people, only those with a sick mentality.  I can watch horror films, psychological thrillers and the like with no problem, but this I found horrendous.  It deserves a rating so that it can only be watched by people over the age of 200 when accompanied by both parents.  It is the kind of film that might make a suitable discussion topic for a psychiatrists' convention, but I can see no other point in the film.  Avoid it all costs.  Minus 10\/10.

Lane, married to Richard Gere, just becomes an addict to Martinez's advances and creative thoughts and soon it becomes apparent that her affair is going to be found out. Gere, not near as dumb or naive as Lane would hope, proves to be a smart cookie.

Director Adrian Lyne (best known for Fatal Attraction) is able to bring the movie to a fevered pitch at about the 90-minute mark, but soon the thrill slowly dies away and we are left with a strange resolution and a somewhat odd way of getting there. Lane is just so good in this production. She has had a career mired by films that just were not very impressive (usually no fault of her own on the screen), but she was finally able to hit a real winner here. The two men each impress as well, but she is the glue and fire the movie had to have. The love scenes are lustful, erotic and are much like lit powder kegs that are about to explode on the screen.

In the immortal words of MSGT Ernie Bilko, It has that Air Force sweep! This movie along with Fistful of Dollars launched fads like bell-bottoms, platform boots look for them in a few frames. and crooked little cigars. I've known guys who have seen this movie ten or twenty times - me included - in order to memorize the incredible macho lines from the great writers. Even Clint Eastwood co-wrote Fistful of Dollars by simplifying much of the dialog. The writing is tight and humorous yet speaks volumes. Some of the very best parts of scenes had little or no dialog whatsoever, only facial expressions coupled with slight body or head movements that more than got the points across. The music in this movie is arguably the best of the trilogy all having been written by Ennio Morricone.The bar scene with Lee Van Cleef provoking Klaus Kinsky while Morricone's music is poking fun is a scream. Lost in all of this good humor is the ultra violence - without much blood so you know that it was made for Europeans who aren't bothered by sex like American critics pretend that Americans are. This movie even has one or two frames of partial nudity that even the Puritanical American critics surprisingly missed because it involved breasts oh-m-gaud - a no-no in 1968 when it was released in America after The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. A strong portion of the story develops around an incredibly vicious outlaw named El Indio The Indian - including dream sequences - played by Gian Maria Volonte by giving one of the strongest performances in cinematic history as a man you love to hate - I know. You hate me just enough.Most European editors - especially from Eastern Europe - don't waste time destroying 45% of a movie by making it fit into the size of the television screen as in America while paradoxically American editors and critics love to dictate to you what you are allowed to see. See this flick in letterbox only or you will miss out on superb subtleties that make rewatching a pleasure as you see things that you missed like the final showdown that is reminiscent of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in the circular arena with the three protagonists instead of one man and two noses.My wife is a great bell weather for this movie because she hates macho, violent movies - especially westerns. She now ranks this movie just under The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly along with Dr. No, The In-laws, anything with Harrison Ford or Catherine Deneuve whom she resembles facially and anything about Russia.

Ultimately, theres no denying that Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius is a kids film, that's what it was meant to be, that's what it is. That's not a bad thing though.

The story starts out with some promise. Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an down-and-out archaeologist who's trying to persuade the academic community that the pyramids and the Sphinx are much older than they appear. Regrettably, he's never learned the art of tact, and callously slays sacred cows by calling into question the findings of accredited historians while offering little substance of his own. While leaving the lecture hall (which has emptied of his entire audience) he gets an invitation from a wealthy old woman, Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) who invites him to work for her in a project which will help you prove your theory is right.Of course, Jackson proves just that, by solving a two-year-old riddle of a project involving an ancient artifact which has been dated at over 10,000 years (exactly how old Jackson says the Sphinx is). With Jackson's help, the artifact, called a Stargate) is activated, revealing a portal to another world.Enter the know-it-all and universally paranoid military. Personified by Colonel Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) who's given gasp! secret orders and sent through the Stargate. On the other side, they find an ancient alien who has enslaved thousands of humans to mine a mysterious element which not only powers the Stargate but also a device which gives him immortality. The alien has taken the identity of the Egyptian god, Ra, and plans to destroy Earth. Of course, O'Neill and his boys manage to save the day and destroy Ra in a good ol' nuclear blast and free the slaves.If I sound sarcastic, it's because at best, this movie is a rehash of a well-worn concept in science fiction deus ex machina, the god out of the machine. Humans masquerading as gods armed with superior technology, is at the heart of a lot of bad science fiction. And despite the rah-rah nature of the movie, that's what this is about. I'm not downgrading the fact that this movie kicked off a very successful show, I'm pointing out that at its heart Stargate didn't have a lot else to say. And for a film to have a lasting impact, it must ultimately ask a very difficult question which we--the viewers--are required to answer, and then justify. Stargate never did that.It could have, though! When Jackson realized that O'Neill had brought an atomic bomb, he could have asked him why, and then heard about the death of the colonel's son. But director Roland Emmerich never allowed his characters to reach for their own humanity. They remained, at best, two-dimensional cutouts.Likewise we were forced to accept the outright evil of Ra without ever hearing his side of the story. Worst all are the glaring flaws in the story itself. For example, if Ra is such a tyrannical creature, who creates and maintains his technology? Such a vast amount of technology would surely require constant maintenance, to say nothing of a gigantic shipyard and hangar to maintain it. If he is a tyrant who trusts no one and rules by fear, who keeps his ship running in peak condition? Who can he trust?More importantly, if the radioactive element (called Naquadah, in the series) is radioactive enough to set off O'Neill's geiger counters then where are the slave's protective clothing? Even a vast slave population such as we see in the movie would soon be dead from radiation poisoning after so much exposure. But this is never explained.In the final analysis, Stargate is a simple humans beat up on aliens movie, no different from the director's later film, Indepdendence Day. Ironic that it should spawn a thoughtful series which has surpassed the original. But, the same thing happened with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so perhaps I shouldn't be too surprised.
