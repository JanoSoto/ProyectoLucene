Looking at reviews in the newspaper, magazines and even here on IMDB, someone who had not seen the movie would be forgiven for thinking that BE is the single worst motion picture of all time.  It is NOT. BE suffered from the most blatantly prejudiced pre-release smear campaign I have ever experienced.  Almost as soon as principal photography had begun, people were crowing that it was an absolute all time stinker. Hey, that's really fair.   99% of the vitriol poured on BE, at least prior to the release, was based entirely on the fact that Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard wrote the source novel.  One might argue that having this as the reason for deciding a film sucks makes as much sense as panning a newly-discovered Wagner symphony, because Wagner was a raving anti-Semite.   I challenge anyone to find a single instance of Scientology propaganda in Battlefield Earth - the movie, that is - apart from the name 'Psychlo'.  The fact of the matter, folks, is that it is not a Church recruitment movie, but simply a botched attempt at doing a pulp SF epic.Let's take a look at the movie itself, trying for a moment to forget Hubbard had anything to do with it.  And what do we have? We have a badly paced, poorly acted, *atrociously* plotted mess of a filmthat is, quite frankly, an insult to the novel more than anything.  Say what you like about Hubbard (and many have)...the truth is that almost all of the gaping plotholes in the movie are *not* in the book. What sinks Battlefield Earth?  The casting, for one....Barry Pepper is simply terrible as the hero Jonnie Tyler.  Far too weedy and diminuitive to be credible as a rabble-rousing hero, Pepper wanders through the movie snorting and pouting and rasping out sub-Braveheart 'call to arms' speeches that ring false at every turn.  None of the other humans are any better, mind you. John Tavolta's performance as alien bad guy Terl is about the only thing that makes BE worth seeing.  Gleefully OTT, he is infinitely more likable than Tyler - this was the case in the book as well, I should add.  Nobody likes a sickeningly perfect hero like Tyler...we're all cheering for the rascally villain!  Well, we don't in BE, but that's not Travolta's fault. Forest Whitaker turns in a suprisingly average performance as Terl's sidekick Ker...nuff said. Let's get to the crux of the matter, though....the plot.  BE was written by first timers who apparently had less experience in penning good scripts than the poor people who shot Scientology films under Hubbard's frenzied direction in the late 1970s.  There are plotholes large enough to fly a Pyschlo gas drone through everywhere - I'll list just a few.  1) Our caveman heroes not only find 1000-year old Harrier jumpjets that are still airworthy, they also learn to fly them in SEVEN DAYS using only one flight simulator.  2)  Over this millennia, the Pyschlos, who prize gold above all metals, have strangely not bothered to check Fort Knox...inside of which Jonnie and company find thousands of bars of the yellow stuff.  That was handy.  3)  The method by which the humans destroy the planet Psychlo is so amazingly easy, it makes my brain bleed wondering why no other race has ever tried it before. There are lots of other things that destroy any chance this movie had of being even vaguely good...the baffling decision to shoot 90% of the footage in Dutch angle (slanted shots...think the Batman TV show), the numerous and almost sacriligeous deviations from Hubbard's book (one would think Hubbard's every word was Holy Writ, given that his Church oversaw production at every step) that cause plot problems that didn't need to exist...the enfuriating way that the story, already rushing to get finished in only 2 hours, stops every now and then for utterly pointless padding scenes (the sequence where Terl finds out what humans like to eat is the main offendor there)...the wide variation in FX quality from excellent to bloody terrible...and so on. Oh, BE is bad alright, it's ghastly - but it is not THAT bad.  There are far worse movies out there that got none or very little of the bad press BE received.  Spy Kids, for example, is one of the most peurile, plotless, intelligence-insulting loads of drivel in film history...yet it was a hit! SK makes BE look like Ben Hur.
