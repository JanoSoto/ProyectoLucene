This film broke those rules by not having either.The film circled around the 'are we\/aren't we in the game' scenario that has occurred at least once in every sci-fi series in the past 12 years, which ordinarily you wouldn't mind except that Cronenberg did nothing new with it. There was no depth to the plot, in fact I would go as far as to say there was no plot. By the end of the film the story hadn't gone anywhere. That is if you call the last part of the film an ending, the whole thing stopped dead as if there was a power cut while Cronenberg was writing and he couldn't be bothered to reboot and complete the story.As for the film as a whole, it was boring and predictable. In fact because of the unoriginality of the story I could guess the ending almost before the opening credits had finished. The special effects would have looked tacky 10 years ago, I've seen car tires which look more organic that those game pods did. And what was the deal with that tooth gun, I know this is sci-fi, but there's no way anything like that could exist, the very fact that it did should have been a good indication that they were in a game.Then there's the acting. The majority of the characters were two dimensional and poorly written, and that scene at the beginning where the dying man is saying to Jude Law Trust no one you just sit there and wait for him to finish the sentence Mr. Mulder. The best thing about the whole film was Jude Law's character who seemed to change in each new environment so you got the idea that he's not all he appears.

When I watched the movie,  I had no idea what to expect and when I saw the bucket,  I was praying that It wouldn't fall--how naive I was.   I just saw how beautiful and innocent Sissy Spacek was and the thought of blood dropping on her was completely unimaginable.  This is one of those horror movies where people would really care about the protagonist,   and this is important for us to Sissy as a tragic figure,  rather than an evil horror killer.   Ever since my first viewing I have grown to love this movie.  I bought the novel, which is much more detailed with Carrie thoughts on discovering her powers and the very detailed account on Margaret White's relationship with Carrietta.   The whole first hour of the movie I was expecting to be scared but after continuously watching it,  I realized that this is just a nice drama with high school kids.  The characters were well developed, even though I do admit that they were pretty much cartoon figures--which I liked.  Sue Snell was the brown haired nice girl;  Nancy Allen was the blond sexual meanie,   John Travolta was the dumb druken bum, Betty Buckley was the nice,  caring teacher,  and William Katt was the blond jockey Prince Charming.  I loved all these supporting characters,   even though I wanted them to show a more loving relationship(sexual) between Tommy and Sue.  The story was wonderful and that is why the Prom scene came as such a horrifying shock,   I didn't expect that such a provocative drama would turn so horrifying.  There are some reviews that say Carrie is not a horror movie,  maybe not in the first hour but the death of Laurie is undoubbly shocking.  I was young and all of a sudden I saw knives flying and I couldn't believe what I was watching. It was so surprisingly fresh,   something that I have never would expect or witnessed before.   The hand coming out of the grave shocked me because I had no idea what would happen.  I was cautious when watching the scene but I just couldn't fgure out what happened and then Boom--the hand.    This was the most frightening moment of the film because it so unexpected,  at least they filmed the knifes flying before they popped into Laurie.  Even before the prom scene,  images as the crucifix, watching Carrie being dragged across the kitchen floor into the praying closet,  the pigs being slaughtered,  Margaret's fanatical lines,   and the bloody horrifying scene of Carrie's first period.  Maybe this is not 90's horror but the scenes are certainly bizarre and entertaining. I give the movie 4 stars because even though I've watched it about 8 times,  it still thrills and entertains me. The music,  the characters,  and Sissy Spacek's prescence cannot be forgotten in this high school drama which is garnered into an interesting and psychological horror film.

A movie is entertainment -- something that tells a story from beginning to end, and does not necessarily call upon your brain for too much work.  A film is a statement --  it requires you to think and asks just as much from you as you ask of it.  If you don't ask the film any questions (thinking it is a movie, as it were), then you are not going to get anything from it.  If these were books, then a movie would be an Elmore Leonard novel and a film would be a book of poetry or a Shakespeare play.Despite Malick's track record for working on films, I was still expecting 'Saving Private Ryan II'.  I walked out of the theatre saying, What the hell was that crap about?  But something bugged me.  It bugged me day and night -- I knew there had to have been something more to it, so I saw it a second time.  Then I saw it a third time.  Then a fourth.I don't usually call anything 'genius', but The Thin Red Line is as close to genius as you are likely to find in a film nowadays.  The cinematography and direction was absolutely stunning -- no one can deny that this film looks beautiful.  And the message behind the film is as equally beautiful as those widescreen landscape shots.But what about that lack of characterisation and plot, you ask?!I disagree.

So far, I haven't heard anyone say complain that Val Kilmer or George Clooney didn't LOOK like Michael Keaton; the portrayal of their character is a different story...I'll admit, the movie had a cookie-cutter plot.

But, then again, how many movies have been made that have a cookie cutter plot?I was quite impressed with the acting.  I'll admit, I haven't been a big fan of the teen slasher movies, so this was my first experience at seeing a lot of these guys.  The young Blair was portrayed exactly as I would have expected, not too sure of himself, too willing to scurry into a corner rather than face confrontation.  Maniac was great; much better than the poor portrayal in the last 3 iterations of the video game.  I mean, let's face it, Maniac's character was completely re-done in WC3, to make him exactly like Biff.  And Paladin was excellent.  Not anything like the Paladin of the games (it took a while to get used to a non-scottish Paladin), but a very good, dark, but fatherly figure.The effects were incredible, especially when you consider the (relatively) meager budget the film was done on.

Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if the original intent was to NOT show the Kilrathi at all; someone decided this would be too artistic of a move, and created some cheesy looking aliens at the last minute.My favorite aspect of the movie, though, was how it abandons the standard Everything is bright and pretty and technological in Sci-Fi.  The ships were beat on.  The cruisers looked like they had to be held together with bailing wire.  The bridges of the vessels were dark, cramped, and simple.

In these short reviews, I think they give away why they missed the point and didn't like the film.I thoroughly enjoyed eXistenZ, and found myself intellectually (if not emotionally) engaged from the beginning.  Maybe it's just prior experience with Cronenberg.  His modus operandi is to plant hints right in front of the audience all the way along, but never point them out.  It's the audience's job to pay attention, and put the pieces together along the way.Much has been made of a scene in the film wherein Jude Law eats a rather grotesque lunch, then constructs a gun out of the bones from the meal -- and this scene is exactly how the audience has got to watch the film.  Pick through the yucky parts, look at the structure beneath, then construct something meaningful from the pieces.  The question of what is reality and what is part of an elaborate video (cranial?) game is constant in the film, from the first frame to the last.  To Cronenberg's credit, he refuses to state the answer.  Speaking of credits, as with most of Cronenberg's films, even the design of the opening crawl presents the theme of the film.  In this case, we are presented with a multi-layered, constantly shifting combination of what seem to be vivid natural rock formations and forests (and which are probably artificial representations) interwoven with barely visible anatomical sketches; in other words, the artificial presented as real, and the real reduced to the artificial, with each piece obscuring and\/or highlighting the other.  It's a quite remarkable job that far too many people won't pay attention to, because they'll still be yacking and munching their popcorn, waiting for the movie to start.  But, much like the game within the film, it starts before you really think it does...The only flaws in the film are Cronenberg's signature weaknesses as a writer; lack of development in Act II and an abrupt finale.  As with most of his movies (Videodrome and Crash being the most blatant examples) just when we get to the point that should be the middle of Act II, we suddenly leapfrog to Act III, blast through it in a scene, then hit the finish. You certainly can't say he lets his movies drag, but this foreshortening has left me feeling a little cheated in many of his previous films.  I didn't feel as cheated this time, because eXistenZ left so many little puzzles and enigmas to consider afterwards -- certainly enough to carry through conversation on the drive home and dinner afterwards.  And, to further bolster the well thought-out complexity of the script, these questions all connected back to possible answers, and brought up further questions, that fed back to other answers, and so on.Finally, I found all of the performances brilliant, especially considering the trick the actors had to face -- they knew when they were playing real or game, but had to portray their own reality without giving it away to us.  Jennifer Jason Leigh continues to be one of my favorite actresses, and a true chameleon.  She doesn't play a part, she lives it.  Also, Jude Law is a real find, displaying a wide range, from vulnerable wimp to hard-edged tough guy.  Willem DaFoe and Ian Holm turn up in what are basically cameos, but give their all to these small parts.In short, eXistenZ won't please the multiplex crowd, who only want big, loud commercial films that offer up everything in a nutshell, explained neatly on page 87 by a character who knows too much -- but it's perfect for people who like to let their movies make them think, who try to stay a step ahead, and who don't give up in frustration the instant they don't catch something.

It returns over and over to the  theme that people just don't do a good job  of connecting with each other.  They don't  listen and they don't love.  The other  major theme is the sickness that can be  found in the suburbs.  There, under the  guise of normality, the most profound  sicknesses can be found.The film does not cut any corners.  It  looks into violence, sexual fetishes, and  pedophilia like few other films.  It  proves that film can still shock and have  a purpose, which is nice in this age of  been there, done that.  Quite often,  people find themselves unhappy because  they have redirected their sexual energies  into unhealthy objects, such as children.   Of course, even the obese woman finds  herself in a unique and awful situation.   By always making even the most benign  character have a bizarre personality flaw,  Solondz keeps the viewer off-balance and  confused.The film is quite funny, but also  touching.  You can really feel for some of  the misfit characters, even the father who  does such a horrible thing.

I also love to read comments of my favorite movies; I'm very objective in that matter, everyone is free to say his own opinion. And in the comments of  movies like Star Wars, A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Alien, Titanic, Citizen Kane (some of my favourite movies) I've read some likable comments and some disgusting points of view, but I accepted their opinion. But When I got to read The English Patient (Which, if you read my name at the title of this comment you'll see how fan I am) comments I couldn't stand it anymore, I have to make you all understand why this movie deserves NINE Oscars. This goes out especially to the people out there that sympathizes with Elaine (from Seinfeld) opinion of this movie. When 2001 hit the theaters in 1968, many people hated it, they said it was boring and too long. Ok, it didn't win nine oscars but its considered the best science fiction film of all time; its funny the fact that it was a boxoffice success because of the hippies who loved the coloured psychedelic journey. What I mean by this is that when you see a movie first of all you gotta know previously what kind of movie you are going to see. If is a movie like Independence Day or Twister you should expect explosion, great SFX, cool dialogues, and an acceptable running time. But if you´re going to see a movie named TEP, 2001, The Godfather, The Thin Red Line, you got to have a open mind about the whole context of it.  That´s why I can see almost every kind of movie they´re showing, except musicals (I hate musicals).The English Patient opens with a beautiful image of a brush painting a figure we don´t know what it is yet. A woman's voice begins to sing---Szerelem, szerelem, she cries in a haunting lament for her loved one. After the credits we realized the figure is a man swimming (we´ll see where that comes from later). Then we change our view to THE DESERT seen from the air. An ocean of dunes (remember the swimmer) for mile after mile. The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black and makes the dunes look like bodies pressed against each other. An old AIRPLANE is flying over the Sahara, there is a woman who appears to be asleep, behind her the pilot , a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet. He is singing, too, but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's plaintive voice.This are the first images of TEP and believe me it captures my attention simply because of its beauty; maybe because I love the desert. I own this movie on DVD and every frame of the cinematography is worth pausing and admiring. TEP is a movie about mature and intellectual people who are caught up in a time of barbarians who only think about making history by obtaining power over the world. The team of International Explorers are only thinking about making history by contributing with proofs of ancient civilization. They don´t care about countries, or frontiers. You have to be very observant in a movie like this. Watch every frame, it doesn´t matter who long does it last on screen, in a movie like this is not there just because of a bad editing. Think about Hana for a moment, she´s the most naive character in the movie I don´t know about anything she say to TEP when he´s talking about Herodotus, but despite of this she´s the most sympathetic character in the film. Catherine and Count Almasy are the main love story, they are intelligent and passionate characters. She´s married to a clown and sees in Almasy a mysterious man who talks many languages (but doesn´t like to talk), knows many cultures, doesn´t have a home, has got a beautiful handwriting, wrotes poems and its passionate about beauty and art, and if that wasn´t enough he´s handsome; what more do you want?. Many people just sees those two like a lustful couple who have no really interest in the other but in sex. That´s an easy answer for somebody who don´t understand them. When they met they have a discussion about an essay Almasy wrote, there they have their first chemistry shock. When they are telling stories in front of the fire everybody male (except Almasy) is telling a funny and shallow story, but when Catherine´s turn is up she impresses everybody (especially Almasy) by telling a story from Herodotus about a king named Candaules (who is a metaphor of Clifton) who is too proud of his wife and he´s showing her to a subject naked and by that shaming her.  Almasy is mighty attracted to her and that´s why he doesn´t want her to stay when Clifton leaves for an errand, and that´s why he´s rude why her whenever she tries to talk to him or give him the paintings of the swimmers from the credits. This is not an ordinary couple, this is a mature couple of two adults who feel an enourmus attraction and by that betrays everything they know by being together, although she (being a woman) has more integrity at betrayal and leaves him because she knows that´ll never work. I don´t know about you but I have 21 years old and I´ve been in those situations when you are so attracted to a girl, and also is she but cannot be together because she is already taken and cannot betray the man that she loves (or once loved for that matter). The Ending is what I call total climax. There is our Count Almasy running in the desert to save the woman he loves, and maybe he´s thinking that if he does they can be together, and believe it or not they die together (metaphorically).

The characters are hopping from planet to planet seemingly willy-nilly and the side trip to Tatooine, aside from the need to get Anakin into the story somehow, was long (although, thank GOD for the Pod Race!).  There were some major holes and unexplained things in the film (the biggest being, if Tatooine is Outer Rim, too far out to be policed concerning the Republic's anti-slavery policies, then why is it on the way between Naboo and Coruscant (at the center of the system?)).I had basic issues  Why would this character do this?  What's the motivation?  Who's the villain?  Darth Maul?  The Emperor?  Palpatine? The Japanese Aliens?  Who's the hero?  Qui-Jonn?  Anakin?  Queen Amidala?  The writing, the backbone of any movie, and the hallmark of any SW movie, was lacking in the extreme in some very basic things that even I-by no means a good fiction writer-could spot a mile away.The CharacterizationNo one was well developed at all.  Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan are the heroes, but they hardly do anything until the lightsaber duel at the end.  Anakin is cute, but all of his achievements are pre-ordained; of course he has to survive  he's not even childbearing age yet.  And it's hard to root for this cute kid when you know that in 30 or so years, he'll be crushing some guys windpipe with his mind.Probably the worst mistake was the sparse use of Darth Maul!  From what I understand, the actor, Ray Park does all of the training for the lightsaber fight scenes, and it showed in that sequence at the end.  It will take your breath away.  Whereas the Vader\/Skywalker fights were power versus agility, these were ballets of death with all of the backflips and feints that accompany such a deadly dance.  It was beautiful to watch.Then we have the creatures.The damned creatures.Far, far too much attention is paid to them.  You can feel the joy and wonder the filmmakers had in creating these things because they are on screen TOO DAMN LONG.  Too bad that joy and wonder wasn't infused into the script.In a way, I understand  hundreds of FX shots, you need to focus on them since you're spending all of that money, right?  Well, all it did was steal character development time from everyone else and just kick you out of the story even further  little hat droids hopping around, the droid army slowly unfolding from its rack, Watto doing his Greek merchant think with Qui-Gonn, the Japanese Aliens speaking without moving their lips.  And Jar-Jar.Damned Jar-Jar.My hatred of this character knows no bounds.  It's as if someone said Hey, the guys computer animated, who cares what he says?!  Whooooo!). Chewbacca, who you couldn't understand, was funnier than this floppy-eared freak.  I understand that there has to be a toy-ready character for the film, but, man, this thing was a-friggin'-'nnoying!  I won't rant anymore, but God in Heaven, he was painful to watch.In all, the creatures were distracting.  As opposed to just treating them like ordinary characters, the camera stays on them for far, far too long, and for no reason other than to show off the technical wizardry.  If that's why people came to see a movie, though, Godzilla would have made more money.The ActingAll-in-all pretty solid.  Some friends of mine didn't like Jake Lloyd, but I thought the kid did OK; his lines were poorly written, but what could he do about that?  Ray Park was friggin' great and was onscreen for far too little a time.  Neeson.come on.of course he was great.  Ewan MacGregor was good, and could have been better if he hadn't been relegated to a Robin, watch the Batmobile role for a lot of the movie.  Natalie Portman was FANTASTIC. I was very, very impressed with her performance.  Samuel Jackson is in the film far, far too briefly, but he does fine as one of the Jedi Council patriarchs.Acting solid for the most part, even in the smaller characters like Anakin's Mom and the Queen's Bodyguard.  Writing brings it down.The Effects\/Art DirectionStellar.  Amazing.  Awesome.  Completely computer generated creatures built from scratch.  Alien vistas unlike anything you've ver seen.  Coruscant's night side is a spiderweb of mile-high skyscrapers.  Visually, this film was amazing and the effects and computer-genned characters were seamless.  I will watch it again (on video) to marvel at the look of the filmConclusionAs a setup for the fall of Anakin, this movie serves its purpose.  It introduces the main players that will accompany the fall of this doomed figure over the next six years and executes some amazing special effects, easily the best I've ever seen.The story, though, is in dire need of a critical edit, as was the film itself.  Characters needed fleshing out, exposition needed toning down, pace needed speeding up in a lot of places, dialogue retooled, focus acquired, and the concept beefed up (starting out any movie with talk of tariffs and blockades gets the viewer into news at 11 mode and eyes get glassy).  My prediction  this film will be a blockbuster, but it will barely break the top 10 grossing movies of all time (if it reaches it at all).  It WILL make the Top 20, but I can't imagine that enough SW fans are devout enough to want to see such a poor addition to the series a second or third time.All that said, I can't wait for the next prequel.  It's gotta be an improvement.  ","genre":null},{"date":"13 May 1999","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Ghost of a FilmThis movie?  Matinee all the way.

Matinee all the way.  Or the dollar theatre.MY TWO CENTS REVIEWI'm sorry, but the movie was weak.  I forced myself to watch it with fresh, untainted eyes.  The plot was confusing and hard to follow, the characters were poorly developed, and the humor was forced and truly, truly unfunny.The ScriptWeak.  Bad plotting and dialogue .  The characters are hopping from planet to planet seemingly willy-nilly and the side trip to Tatooine, aside from the need to get Anakin into the story somehow, was long (although, thank GOD for the Pod Race!).  There were some major holes and unexplained things in the film (the biggest being, if Tatooine is Outer Rim, too far out to be policed concerning the Republic's anti-slavery policies, then why is it on the way between Naboo and Coruscant (at the center of the system?)).I had basic issues  Why would this character do this?  What's the motivation?  Who's the villain?  Darth Maul?  The Emperor?  Palpatine? The Japanese Aliens?  Who's the hero?  Qui-Jonn?  Anakin?  Queen Amidala?  The writing, the backbone of any movie, and the hallmark of any SW movie, was lacking in the extreme in some very basic things that even I-by no means a good fiction writer-could spot a mile away.The CharacterizationNo one was well developed at all.  Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan are the heroes, but they hardly do anything until the lightsaber duel at the end.  Anakin is cute, but all of his achievements are pre-ordained; of course he has to survive  he's not even childbearing age yet.  And it's hard to root for this cute kid when you know that in 30 or so years, he'll be crushing some guys windpipe with his mind.Probably the worst mistake was the sparse use of Darth Maul!  From what I understand, the actor, Ray Park does all of the training for the lightsaber fight scenes, and it showed in that sequence at the end.  It will take your breath away.  Whereas the Vader\/Skywalker fights were power versus agility, these were ballets of death with all of the backflips and feints that accompany such a deadly dance.  It was beautiful to watch.Then we have the creatures.The damned creatures.Far, far too much attention is paid to them.  You can feel the joy and wonder the filmmakers had in creating these things because they are on screen TOO DAMN LONG.  Too bad that joy and wonder wasn't infused into the script.In a way, I understand  hundreds of FX shots, you need to focus on them since you're spending all of that money, right?  Well, all it did was steal character development time from everyone else and just kick you out of the story even further  little hat droids hopping around, the droid army slowly unfolding from its rack, Watto doing his Greek merchant think with Qui-Gonn, the Japanese Aliens speaking without moving their lips.  And Jar-Jar.Damned Jar-Jar.My hatred of this character knows no bounds.  It's as if someone said Hey, the guys computer animated, who cares what he says?!  Whooooo!). Chewbacca, who you couldn't understand, was funnier than this floppy-eared freak.  I understand that there has to be a toy-ready character for the film, but, man, this thing was a-friggin'-'nnoying!  I won't rant anymore, but God in Heaven, he was painful to watch.In all, the creatures were distracting.  As opposed to just treating them like ordinary characters, the camera stays on them for far, far too long, and for no reason other than to show off the technical wizardry.  If that's why people came to see a movie, though, Godzilla would have made more money.The ActingAll-in-all pretty solid.  Some friends of mine didn't like Jake Lloyd, but I thought the kid did OK; his lines were poorly written, but what could he do about that?  Ray Park was friggin' great and was onscreen for far too little a time.  Neeson.come on.of course he was great.  Ewan MacGregor was good, and could have been better if he hadn't been relegated to a Robin, watch the Batmobile role for a lot of the movie.  Natalie Portman was FANTASTIC. I was very, very impressed with her performance.  Samuel Jackson is in the film far, far too briefly, but he does fine as one of the Jedi Council patriarchs.Acting solid for the most part, even in the smaller characters like Anakin's Mom and the Queen's Bodyguard.
