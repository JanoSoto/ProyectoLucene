Director John Hughes has made another coming of age classic!! Sixteen Candles tells the story of a girl, Samantha Baker, whose family has forgotten her sweet 16 due to her sister's upcoming wedding. The movie is awesome, and I love how Sam is totally NOT a Mary-Sue and she gets the hot jock!! It's so sweet...Jock Jake is sick of his party girl girlfriend, Caroline, who is absolutely beautiful, and he's just looking for true love. Sam has a hopeless crush on him...throughout the whole movie he's trying to get to her, and finally at the end he reaches her after everyone has left for her sister's reception after the wedding mass. Seriously, this movie is so cute!!! It's my favorite out of Molly Ringwald's movies. She's perfect for this part, and Anthony Michael Hall is SO FUNNY. He's hysterical...Farmer Ted. I love how this movie shows that the blondes who are busty and popular don't always get the guys...it's uplifting...it's a movie for anyone whoever thought their love was out of their reach...it's inspiring.

James Cameron does this, sometimes, but usually adds more plot to his stories. Carpenter just takes simple premises, throws some characters together, and lets everything evolve and unwind on their own. Assault on Precinct 13 deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Dawn of the Dead, or perhaps the overrated Texas Chainsaw Massacre, as a very low-budget horror\/thriller that takes a cast of unknowns, places them together, doesn't really delve into their backgrounds, but lets everything just work itself out like clockwork. There's an eager new cop, an infamous death row murderer, and a relocating precinct, all stuffed together into a movie about a vicious gang assault. It's brilliant in a very subtle way; a sign of things to come for a director who has implemented some of the most oft-used camera tricks in the horror world.He pioneered the first-person killer perspective in Halloween - an effect sorely missed on full screen TV and VHS versions, to once again be savored on the wide screen DVD presentation. Carpenter received quite a number of critical jabs in 1978 for his use of the POV technique, explained to be too voyeuristic and potentially dangerous to be shown in a mainstream motion picture. Hitchcock used the POV technique very subtly in Psycho's famous shower sequence, but in Halloween it was far blunter, resulting in an uproar of moral complaints.No matter. Halloween became movie horror legend, casting a spell over its viewers, inspiring major knock-offs such as the Friday the 13th series (which has overall made more money than the Halloween franchise due to more sequels than Police Academy). Assault on Precinct 13 was one of Carpenter's very first efforts at directing. It shows. The movie is flawed, imperfect, both technically and otherwise (some of the dialogue in particular could have used fixing, and the acting is nothing incredible by any means). But it still has an addictive sense of urgency and frantic pacing that makes the movie feel like one long, non-stop, brutal assault - even though the setup for the film takes over forty minutes. It may not be a flawless film but it is one of my favorites.It's about a new cop named Bishop (Austin Stoker) who is put in charge of a transferring L.A. police precinct - number thirteen. As equipment is carried out of the building and last-minute closings are made, far away a bus load of convicts, including notorious murderer Wilson (Darwin Joston), decide to stop at precinct 13 due to the fact that one of the criminals seems to be coming down with a harsh cough. And downtown, a young girl is shot by a ruthless gang member. Her father shoots the killer, and then flees to precinct thirteen, hunted by the gang members, who eventually begin to siege the precinct in a suicide raid. Trapped with two killers, a few cops and a jail warden, Bishop and company try to think of a way out of the place without getting shot by the vicious gang outside.That's basically it - people stuck inside a police station trying to get out without dying in the process. The movie is only ninety minutes long, give or take, which is a good thing, because if it had been any longer it might have lost some of its pacing and become tiring. Instead, there isn't a single scene in Assault on Precinct 13 that I think should have been cut. I'm sure there are some that could have been tossed onto the editing room floor, but I'm glad that the movie is the way it is - it flows smoothly and we don't ever feel like a scene has gone on too long or too short. In that sense, it's just about perfect.Carpenter has had one of the most successful careers of all time, followed by a legion of cult fans. His Halloween is one of the greatest horror films of all time, and one of the most influential. He occasionally makes his duds, like any director, but in this case, the good far outweighs the bad. Assault on Precinct 13 is an utterly refreshing film experience that manages to maintain a fast speed but never appears to be cheating its target audience, or treating them stupid. The movie is being remade in 2005, with a considerably higher budget, bigger names, and probably worse directing. I don't really look forward to this remake because I can almost guarantee that, given the age it is being made in, there will be many pointless plot explanations, worse dialogue and bad direction. Assault on Precinct 13 does not really need to be made again because the first one works so well. History has taught us that most remakes are not at all on the same level as their influences - just look at Hitchcock's Psycho, then Van Sant's. If it isn't broken, don't fix it. Assault on Precinct 13 is not broken and it does not need to be fixed.

After going to hers for sex, Dave assumes he'll never see her again and is surprised when she comes round to his house the next day to cook him dinner. Putting it down to over-enthusiasm he thinks nothing more of it but Evelyn continues to force herself into his life but the more he tries to get rid of her the more unhinged and desperate she becomes.Watching this film now it is hard not to be put in mind of Fatal Attraction; the plots are quite similar and it is easy to look at Fatal Attraction and think it is better simply because it is more recent. Misty has dated quite badly in some regards but it is still a good film in it's own right. The plot follows the thread we all know having seen it repeated in Fatal Attraction, and it does it pretty well, even if it flags ever so slightly once or twice. The ending is good and was the only way to end it after Evelyn madness had gone so far, and it's impact isn't really spoilt by the dated fake blood. As director Eastwood has clearly been influenced by the style of Don Siegel and you can see plenty of touches that have rubbed off him onto these films. However Clint also uses plenty of gimmicks and shots that really make the film look dated (the freeze frame, some close ups etc) although they really would have worked in the early seventies.The film is helped by a good lead pair as well as interesting, if undistinguished support. Eastwood plays his usual macho self and is actually quite understated for most of the film. Occasionally he lets it show that this macho personae that he plays is actually flawed &#150; but this thread is soon let to go by the wayside in favour of Evelyn's collapse. Walter takes the role like a duck to water and certainly one thing you could never accuse her of here is restraint or subtlety. After a normal start she quickly gets down to the business of becoming a bunny-boiler. It bothered me a bit that she was so crazy so quickly but it certainly was an enjoyable performance that helps the lift the tension. The support cast are all very much in the shadow of these two and the only ones that stuck in my mind were small roles from Siegel and McEachin (who I couldn't help but see as Lt Brock from the Perry Mason films!).Overall this is a good film if far from perfect one.

I must have been in the sixth grade when I was appearing in funny play. On the morning of the opening performance, I'd come down with a case of laryngitisso I stayed home that day hoping to recover some of my voice. Having a two minute walk between me and the local video store encouraged me to rent some great comedies for inspiration for that night's performance. The spine of the The Impostors VHS case jumped out at me (it must have been it's funny lettering) and I read the back. Interesting I thought and rented it. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole film and it became an instant favorite. However, this comment is not about the story of my life and passion, it's about this fantabulous film, so I'll shut up and discuss how great this movie is.I'd like to state that this is the definition of slapstick comedy. Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt team up in this brilliantly funny film. They have so much chemistry on screen together. They need to collaborate more!First off, Stanley Tucci's writing and direction are genius. What a comedian in front of the camera, behind the camera, and in front of a computer writing a script like this one. Each character you start to love no matter who they are. The character development is also superb. After watching this incredibly intelligent and comic film, I now have a new respect for Tucci. I loved him in Big Trouble, but The Impostors is simply his best ever.Oliver Platt and Lili Taylor are also the shining jewels of this film. For the past couple of years it seems as if Oliver Platt has sort of disappeared from the silver screen and as much as I hate to admit this, I sort of forgot above my fondness of him. When I decided to take a trip down memory lane and rent Impostors my love for this talented comedian resurfaced. He's an amazing man. Such a clown. Such a hilarious cuddly bear. I've never been too familiar with Lili Taylor. I'd always find myself mixing her name up with another one of my favorite actors, Jennifer Tily. Now I feel that I can tell the difference. I've found a new respect for her. She's the cute, normal, down to earth girl who may not win the heart of the popular sex good, but the heart of an intellectual guy who cares about her and also will save the day. She's so amazing and clever, and I seem to be unable to articulate my new love. Ahh..the power of love.This comment could go on forever. I'd love to explain each character and why I've become to attached and fond of them. Not only are the characters brilliant but the actors who play them are more so. The Oscars should invent a nomination for the Casting Director because this films casting director (sorry I can't remember their name) cast every role correctly. In conclusion, I feel that this film will always remain an unearthed gem. It's so clever, comic, quircky, and entertaining. It is the king of slapstick comedy. Each time I watch this film (I now own the VHS and DVD) and I watch it twice. It will never get old for me. It's become a classic in my life and has a special place on my DVD\/VHS shelf. I swear to everyone reading this comment that when I become a famous director, I'll remake this. Unfortunately, I'm afraid I'll never be able to top Tucci and everyone who worked on this project's genius.

What a comedian in front of the camera, behind the camera, and in front of a computer writing a script like this one. Each character you start to love no matter who they are. The character development is also superb. After watching this incredibly intelligent and comic film, I now have a new respect for Tucci. I loved him in Big Trouble, but The Impostors is simply his best ever.Oliver Platt and Lili Taylor are also the shining jewels of this film. For the past couple of years it seems as if Oliver Platt has sort of disappeared from the silver screen and as much as I hate to admit this, I sort of forgot above my fondness of him. When I decided to take a trip down memory lane and rent Impostors my love for this talented comedian resurfaced. He's an amazing man. Such a clown. Such a hilarious cuddly bear. I've never been too familiar with Lili Taylor. I'd always find myself mixing her name up with another one of my favorite actors, Jennifer Tily. Now I feel that I can tell the difference. I've found a new respect for her. She's the cute, normal, down to earth girl who may not win the heart of the popular sex good, but the heart of an intellectual guy who cares about her and also will save the day. She's so amazing and clever, and I seem to be unable to articulate my new love. Ahh..the power of love.This comment could go on forever. I'd love to explain each character and why I've become to attached and fond of them. Not only are the characters brilliant but the actors who play them are more so. The Oscars should invent a nomination for the Casting Director because this films casting director (sorry I can't remember their name) cast every role correctly. In conclusion, I feel that this film will always remain an unearthed gem. It's so clever, comic, quircky, and entertaining. It is the king of slapstick comedy. Each time I watch this film (I now own the VHS and DVD) and I watch it twice. It will never get old for me. It's become a classic in my life and has a special place on my DVD\/VHS shelf. I swear to everyone reading this comment that when I become a famous director, I'll remake this. Unfortunately, I'm afraid I'll never be able to top Tucci and everyone who worked on this project's genius.

I must have been in the sixth grade when I was appearing in funny play. On the morning of the opening performance, I'd come down with a case of laryngitisso I stayed home that day hoping to recover some of my voice. Having a two minute walk between me and the local video store encouraged me to rent some great comedies for inspiration for that night's performance. The spine of the The Impostors VHS case jumped out at me (it must have been it's funny lettering) and I read the back. Interesting I thought and rented it. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole film and it became an instant favorite. However, this comment is not about the story of my life and passion, it's about this fantabulous film, so I'll shut up and discuss how great this movie is.I'd like to state that this is the definition of slapstick comedy.
