I would point out, also, that this pic probably doesn't have too many Vietnam vets as fans, as it trivializes the experience.The concept of some other dimension intruding on our so-called real world is also given a new lift here. It's not so much a ghost story as a riff on the Hellraiser and From Beyond concepts, done with humor, similar to the Evil Dead series. The sense is that we co-exist with some other, more sinister dimension, parallel with our own. A house such as this provides occasional openings to and from this alternate dimension. Towards the end, there's somewhat of a revelation about who or what is actually causing all this weird stuff, but real explanations are few - almost anything can happen, anything goes. Is Roger simply psychotic, imagining all these things? Is someone trying to drive him crazy? Or is it all truly supernatural?

It's about friendship, how it's more important than anything else, and shouldn't be tampered with.Anyway, trying to analyse this would be to spoil what is a brilliantly played, very funny, and often touching movie. The four leads are magnificent, although Roberts takes the largest chunk of on-screen time. Whether she - or her character -deserves that is not important because she does do a great job. Personally I'd like to have seen more of Diaz, and maybe more of the excellent rapport between Roberts and Everett.What the heck. It's a warm, happy, beautifully directed story that will delight all but the stoniest-hearted. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously so neither will I.

About an hour & a half into it I realized that I was mesmerized. I was weary from not blinking while I watched silently and then realized that I'd not moved from the moment of that first long shot from the party atop the hotel, which wound through the crowd into a pool below.Somewhere during the cabal in the night-club where we watched a young woman dancing disconcertingly and harnessed, I became riveted. Then as we watched her being followed home through a ghetto by a man from the club I felt like a voyeur, which worked through the end of that story and melded seamlessly into the next.It is a story starting at night as a young woman is approached and intimidated by a bunch of US Sailors and another clean cut Cuban student comes to her aid. Still I was feeling like I was just inside a window somewhere watching these people who might turn and look up to spot me at any moment. So I remained still and quiet through almost the entire film, and continued following the student and watching his attempts at assassination and his friends' deaths because they doth protest too much.Then I'm standing just behind a farmer melancholy in his doorway remembering... thinking as his grown children sleep just nearby. They all wake to work the land with their father. The images are starkly bright whites sliced by black shards of shadows and shapes that make up the surrounding overgrown land, buildings, people and that lone horse. I realize my stillness when my hypnosis is broken by the landowner riding up to tell the crushed old man that the land has been sold. He feigns being OK by sending his kids off to town to enjoy some sodas and music, for all their hard work. Then he burns their home to the ground.I think it is here that I take my first breath in 90 minutes -I exhale. Then the next think you know, I'm hiding and watching again, this time in the mountains and a guerrilla, who at first seems lost, lands on the doorstep of a small rural family with at least one child running around bare bottom. Everyone here looks weary and dirty, the soldier also, who is invited in to eat. As he eats the wife crushes corn in the background like the rhythm of a snare to the smoky voice of a jazz singer as the soldier speaks of revolution. The father strangely can't take this kind of aggressive thinking and has the guerrilla to leave. Just as I try to inhale, a bomb hits just next to the little raggedy house in the hills and the family makes a hasty retreat, but father and son get separated from mother and children. It's dangerous and sad, serious and almost silent. The little naked boy who retreated with his agonizing father gets killed. Father is reunited with his family under a cave-side waterfall. Pain, loss, grief, anger - he goes to join the revolutionaries in a final act of leaving his little family behind.Now I've watched the entire film and I'm still not sure how I feel about it all, but I'm breathing again, and I continue to live with the images.That is a good film experience.

But it's not. It tells the story of FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), who in the late 1970s was hired to infiltrate the mafia. So, he got acquainted with hit-man Benjamin Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino). But lo and behold, Joe got too much into the mafia lifestyle, to the point where it dominated his life and kept him from his family. And no one ended up with a very good reward at the end.Both Depp and Pacino are about as intense as we expect them to be, with good support from Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, Anne Heche and Zeljko Ivanek. With his hair all greased back, Depp looks like the ultimate mafioso. I should identify that there are two scenes that will probably make your skin crawl the leg scene, and what they do to the Japanese waiter.But don't get me wrong. This is a really good movie. It's certainly a less glamorized view of mafia life than most of Al Pacino's movies, and Johnny Depp was certainly showing the same flair for acting that he has brought to the screen for the past 16 years.

He's delighted, as any boy would be, because of the gifts he may receive. But then a strange thing happens another Santa materializes out of the chimney. And another. And another. Soon, they're popping out from everywhere, rein-deers and all. The boy, terrified now, starts crying. And then he gets a good glimpse of who the man behind the Santa outfit is....This man is Krank, a scientist who could scare the bejesus out of anyone. He's screaming, too, but for a different reason he can't dream, even when he's sucked the life out of this little boy who he's kidnapped. As a matter of fact, he's in the habit of kidnapping little children and stealing their dreams in order to delay his own aging. One of the boys he decides to set his eyes on is Denree, the adopted brother of a circus strongman named One. Employing some sinister men who wear magnifying cameras as super-lenses, they kidnap the kid... only One wants him back and isn't about to sit still.But it won't be easy, not in this Paris of the future, perpetually smothered in a dank fog, with rivers of a stinking green color and an overall aura of desolation and despair. There are other interests as well, like the two Siamese twins who call themselves the Octopus and train children how to steal for their own benefit. Among these children is a girl, Miette, whose path crosses that of One, and who knows who's behind these kidnappings.CITY OF LOST CHILDREN moves with an uneven pacing and takes its time to get to where it wants to go because of the many intertwining story lines, one of them involving cloned henchmen played by Dominque Pinon who continually ask a brain which lives inside a fish tank if they are the one (unaware that the real man is out there, underwater, in a diver's suit). One of these henchmen have the task of telling Krank stories so he can fall asleep. Another storyline involves the Octopus' employment of a man who trains a flea to do some interesting things and create havoc.The movie looks gorgeous. Futuristic dystopias would relish the textured atmosphere as the city seems to drown itself in murk and dankness. In what I disagree strongly is to the need to film children crying as they're being literally tormented with the presence of Krank it's enough that this is a story about children's dreams being taken from them in horrible ways, but to see in a protracted scene that the six henchmen and Krank torment three children as they sing an upbeat tune -- and we see them not only crying but bawling their eyes out, reacting to whatever the director told them to -- is bad enough. It hints at a level of sadism in using children as bait to get an effect I'm not okay with.Another minor complaint is the use of comic relief when it's not needed. The Octopus go to the character played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus for his assistance. His dog, which plays an important part in his services, is shown on two occasions licking the actor's foot up close. The displacing technique has been done before for laughs -- here, it's just bad. I think that this is due to the fact that the filmmakers wanted to go for a 12 MONKEYS effect a lunatic, eccentric feel with quirky elements here and there. It's true that this film and Gilliam's film look a lot alike, but I prefer Gilliam's over this one.So overall, a good film, uneven, disturbing for the use of children in scenes involving torture, technically dazzling, but a little too convoluted, as would be ALIEN RESURRECTION for me to truly like.

It is almost impossible to believe that (as the vintage trailer claims) Time Magazine called this Hilarious and poignant, the New York Times Howlingly funny, and the New Yorker Brilliant. I don't mind watching dated comic techniques (such as speeding up the film and music for a few seconds) so long as I can push my mind's eye back the appropriate number of decades and *imagine* how I might have reacted in 1966, or '46, or '26. I can smile at the places where an audience howled themselves to tears in an Abbot and Costello comedy. But the lame attempts at wit and slapstick in Morgan just left me slack-jawed in disbelief. Was it ever actually funny to watch a man act like a mere retardate, grinning ecstatically as he operates an electric can opener, imitating a gorilla in a subway station, and breaking things? At no point does any of this come across as eccentric or childlike behavior. It is simply annoying, and doubly annoying when Morgan's ex-wife responds, yet again, as though she were witnessing his infantilism for the first time.But perhaps I am missing a point which was obvious forty years ago. You could also say that David Warner is doing a pretty good job of portraying the self-conscious and highly calculated intrusions of an offensive creep. He is less beefy than the Robert Mitchum character in Cape Fear, but is precisely the same personality type. You expect everyone around him to recoil in disgust. Instead, the most we get is a huffy, Oh, you are simply insufferable! reaction. And then his spectacularly beautiful and wealthy ex-wife suddenly makes goo-goo eyes, for absolutely no apparent reason, and goes to bed with him. Aha! I would have said in 1966. This criminal mind is merely masquerading as a dolt with delusions of becoming a Karl Marx-worshipping gorilla, a peaceful animal that merely blusters violence. Aha again! He is actually a Marxist guerilla, a dirty fighter in a class war...Now I am thinking too hard. I am filling in the gaps where I am not laughing. I have no way of gauging the authors' larger intentions because their smaller dramatic and comic beats are indecipherable. In the middle of this Satire no one around Morgan does anything as realistically simple as changing the locks on the house doors.Morgan's antics are supposed to be wacky and impish but ultimately aimless and poignant. Yes, there is some sort of structure of comic\/tragic insanity which is barely visible here. Unfortunately, that is all that is visible.I am so impressed by the un-funniness of this film that I would watch the whole thing again if it were shown split-screen alongside another movie showing a theater-full of people watching it in 1966. What, exactly, did they laugh at? At which gems of dialogue did they stroke their chins and nod their head to say, Fascinating point, and Very witty, indeed?

Well, there's no doubt that Holliday's win was an unjust upset, but that should only upset you if you don't consider the entire history of the Academy Awards to be one long, uninterrupted unjust upset. Let's not hold the fact that a dumbass awards group decided her's was the best female performance of the year against her.Given the roles Judy Holliday would become known for playing, Billie Dawn certainly doesn't appear to be much of a stretch for her, but there's no denying that she's captivatingly charming in this lightweight George Cukor comedy. Holliday plays a ding-bat blonde numbskull gangster moll who, tired of her boyfriend's (Broderick Crawford, made a star a year earlier by All the King's Men) constant dismissal of her as just a dumb broad, sets out on an odyssey of self improvement. To help her in her goal, she enlists intellectual and booky William Holden (we know he's intellectual because he wears glasses), who just happens to be drop-dead gorgeous as well (this is Hollywood, folks).This is a sweet movie. I've got a soft spot for any story in which someone identifies his\/her own limitations and sets out to improve them against the odds. There's a real excitement in seeing Holliday's character gradually begin to understand the satisfaction a good book can provide or become for the first time in her life legitimately engaged in a serious discussion and have opinions of her own. Holliday and Holden have sizzling chemistry, and even if Holliday isn't delivering Shakespeare, she's still awfully cute to watch.Melanie Griffith did a remake of this movie that I've never seen and never want to--I don't believe for a minute that it can be anything but worse than Cukor's version. Despite Hollywood's tired attempts to force remakes down our throats, send the studio suits a message and stick with the originals--they're always better.Grade A ","genre":null},{"date":"25 May 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" In Oscar lore, Judy Holliday is known as the actress who stole the Academy Award, undeservedly, one might add, right out from under either Bette Davis's (All About Eve) or Gloria Swanson's (Sunset Boulevard) nose (depending on which report you hear).

When the time came for a sequel, Paramount Pictures made the right decision to ditch series' creator Gene Roddenberry as producer (as much as I respect the late Roddenberry, he was simply not an competent film producer) and bring in Harve Bennett as executive producer. Bennett understood that it was the endearing character-driven aspects of the series that had been missing from the franchise's first theatrical outing, and the wise decision was made to simply update the central premise of the television series for the big screen. In other words, Bennett and director Nicholas Meyer returned the STAR TREK series back to its basic roots, which is why the film works as well as it does.The film's rather straightforward plot moves quickly and satisfyingly gives plenty of screen time to the characters we know and love as they face their own personal struggles in addition to the usual life-or-death space combat phenomena. Sadly a regular object of considerable ridicule, the then-middle aged William Shatner actually gets a chance to poke fun at his own reportedly vain image as he is now forced to confront the challenges of aging. Leonard Nimoy has arguably never been better as the Vulcan Spock (arguably the franchise's most enduringly popular character), and his character finally gets the chance to both reach his full assimilated potential as well as put his own philosophies into action. The chemistry between Nimoy and Shatner has never been stronger, which lends their usual rapport even more warmth and leaves the surprisingly moving finale with one heck of a wallop.First seen in the 1967 episode Space Seed, Ricardo Montalban's superhuman Kahn is one of the series' most dangerous and charismatic villains, and his reasons for wanting Kirk dead are certainly understandable (if not justifiable). In the supporting cast, TREK regulars Dr. Bones McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Cmdr. Scott (James Doohan), Chekov (Walter Koenig), Sulu (George Takei), and Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) all make their expected appearances, and the subplot introducing Kirk's former love (Bibi Besch) and her son (Merritt Butrick) is expertly handled and fits perfectly within the contours of the film. However, the very best of the supporting players, without question, is Kristie Alley (in her film debut) who is terrific as a surprisingly sexy Vulcan Lieutenant. Alley's performance is such great fun it remains a true shame that she did not return for any future installments.The film manages to successful walk that thin line between playing to their core audience and catering to TREK neophytes. In other words, the film can be vastly enjoyed by both longtime Trekkies and viewers who have never watched an episode of the series in their lives (in fact, the film is routinely cited as the favorite film in the Trek canon by both polar opposite groups of viewers). The film works in virtually all major areas, and builds to a surprising moving climax that may have even the most cynical of viewers reaching for their Kleenex. THE WRATH OF KAHN is easily the place to start if you ever wanted to find out what all of that STAR TREK fuss was about, as it presents the Enterprise crew at their very best.
