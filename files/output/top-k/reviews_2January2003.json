[{"date":"2 January 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have had this movie for a few months now, but I didn't really bother to watch it, because I just didn't think it'd be that good. Well, seems I was wrong, once again, and that Shrek simply blew me away.I see it as a fairy tale movie about fairy tales, but also about our life. You get all the so called elements of a fairy tale, like magic creatures and beautiful romance scenes...big castles and horrid dragons. Just that this movie is a parody of the fairy tale world. Of course, a parody that remains a fairy tale, but through this different vision we get the fun out of it.The story is quite simple, and yet it has more layers than you'd expect. We get three characters, Shrek the ogre, Donkey (the donkey heh) and Princess Fiona, the one with two faces and the dragon. All four are lonely, but in fact they form two pairs. Initially in both pairs we see some clear oppositesFiona beautiful, Shrek ugly; dragon huge, donkey small. But these differences come just from the aspect of these characters, and not from what they really are. Their meeting represents the end of their loneliness.There are a lot of scenes from other fairy tales, as this movie is actually based on them. It may lack in originality at times, if you really want to hear that. But it compensates through great humor. Also, there would be this nice town of lord Farquaad, named Duloc. It represents a town that seems perfect, but you just have to take a sharp look at it and notice how horrible life really is there. The people are being controlled by their small, yet horrible lord. Like the viewers that are present at a show - they see applaud they see laugh...it's what they see and what they do because others tell them. It's not something you can rely on. It's a manipulated society, something which does happen in our world too...much too often sometimes. It's not right to say we have a flawless film on our hands, still it is a movie which many will enjoy, and most important will probably make you feel better. Isn't that what movies are about?

When this film first hit the street I didn't think there would be anyway that it could be taken seriously. But it became a huge surprise hit and raked in big bucks at the box office. So now, years after its release I decided to see what all the fuss was about, I didn't find much. We open the film with a truly heart-breaking scene of Sara riding on a train while she flashes back to her mom's death when driving to her ballet addition. This scene hit me hard. It was very sad but yet had a sense of reality in it that couldn't be ignored. The rest was downhill from there. Sara then moves in with her dad. He lives in a run down neighbourhood full of sex, drugs and violence. I guess you could say it came from a scene right out of Boyz N' the Hood (easily the most powerful blacksplotion film ever made). This helps to unfold the rest of the film. If you think I have short changed you on the plot description I will certainly agree that I have. You may be interested in what happens to here once she moves, what kind of troubles does she meet up with along the way and mostly what does any of this have to do with dancing? I would love to answer all those questions in this review but that would be impossible. You see after that opening scene this film takes so many different turns and plot twists that it is almost impossible to follow and even harder to care about. There is something new presented in every scene and dropped just a quickly in the next. I criticized 8 Mile for doing this as well but the difference is that 8 Mile stayed to one basic story, it just didn't developed anything within the context of that story to be interesting. This film jumps all over the place and instead of having one solid message it tries to preach about to many different things. We hear about the bad relationship between a father, the shattered dreams, the blaming of ones self for the death of a loved one, teen parenting, reaching out to achieve your goals, not caring about what other people think about you, racial barriers and a message about gang violence. Still wondering what all this has to do with dancing? The answer is nothing. The dancing is only thrown in as a way to disguise the fact that this film never had a clue where it is going and has even less of one about where it will end up. Filmmakers knew this film was geared toward teenagers so it seems like all they are doing is throwing a story about dancing to cover up the fact that this film does not flow together at all. The best example is when Sara first sees Derek she thinks he is a complete jerk. The next time we see the two on screen together they have instantly fallen in love with each other. We are given no explanation as to their feeling for each other or how they grew to be this way, it just simple happened. Almost all the other subject matter presented follows this same pattern. But the film does work in talking about the racial barriers between blacks and whites. Even though the love story between Sara and Derek didn't do a thing for the film it was nice to see that it wasn't looked on as a conventional relationship and that a lot of people do look down on these types of things. Also the messages about violence and knowing when to walk away were very effective for me, the problem is that they weren't dealt upon enough or didn't fit into the story. If films makers wanted to make a film about violence they should have made one about violence and stick to that. There are so many things going on in here I found myself more interesting in what was going on in the world around them than the actual characters themselves. In fact I didn't feel for any characters in this film at all. Watching the characters in this film is like watching a horror film like the Candayman and seeing that very same hook handed killer in a slapstick comedy. Different characters are needed to suit different environments but. Sara and Derek always seem to be at the heart of everything that is going on. Their moods never change with the flow of the film. It seemed that whenever they would have a romantic moment the film would instantly switch into suspense mode but the audience is still left with the feeling of romance. Don't get me wrong, the acting is not bad. Julia Stiles is a very talented young actress who I can see big things for in the future. He holds this whole film together because she allows her emotions to change freely from scene to scene and is able to show all the pain she is going through but also allows us to get into the lighter side of her life. Sean Patrick Thomas on the other had is not suited for this role. The whole time I was watching him I could only think of how much this film could have benefited if that part was given to someone like Mekhi Phifer. Hey if he could keep 8 Mile from falling apart I'm sure he could do the same for this film. Another thing that bothers me about this film is its tag line  The Only Person You Need To Be Is Yourself. Nowhere in the film is that presented at all. Sara goes into her new environment as a smart intelligent type. She then conforms to the ways of her black friends in order for her to be accepted. The character we see at the start of this film is not the same one we see at the end and that bothered me, especially considering all the film trailers depicted a girl having to face her past in order to become her present. Maybe that is talked about in the film, and maybe teen girls will be able to buy into that. But after seeing plot hole after plot hole I found that message nowhere within the film (I guess whoever was in charge of marketing did a good job, it must have been the same people who did it for 8 Mile). I am yet again going to compare this film to 8 Mile because I feel both are sending out terrible messages. Both seem to be saying that in order to be excepted by the public you have to be someone\/something that you aren't. This is most notable in the last scene (the dance audition) but I am not going to give the ending away so you're going to have to figure that one out yourself. It is nice to see that MTV is trying to say something with the films they put out. I don't know about anyone else but I didn't find any deep, life changing messages in Joe's Apartment or Dead Man on Campus, but they are going about it totally wrong. They have tried to put a message from a film like Boyz... into a film that will be marketable to teens. Maybe if MTV were more worried about what is being into the film and not how they will sell it we may have had a winner on our hands, but because of its candy coated theories and watered down statements it doesn't come close to hitting the mark.

It even shows how the enemy are people too.I would like to make a personal editorial here, since I feel a great wrong has been posted about this movie by some people here... To all the people calling this flag waving propaganda, you obviously didn't watch the movie, hence I feel your votes should be removed for this film. If anything, it showed the horrors of war, how our men suffered for what was believed to be a noble mission, and how in spite of terrible odds they overcame, and the promise that No one will be left behind was kept. I know people who were there. They ended up having nightmares because it hit so close to home. This was REAL. If it were propaganda, everyone would get home and we would all be happy. You want to talk Propaganda, watch almost any John Wayne movie, or even Patton. This was not. Men died. Good Men. Family men - on both sides. Yes, the only way we survived that battle was superior technology, but it was the only reason. They were dropped into an ambush, yet they survived. Lt. Col. Morris didn't come back proud of what he did, he was just happy the mission was accomplished and they survived. Yet, he was hurt badly by every wasted life. Propaganda? You totally missed the point! Is propaganda showing how we killed our own men because of our mistakes? Lies? Tell me, were you there? I didn't think so. Unless you were there, stop with the misinformation. Your the ones spreading propaganda and lies, not the film! If you want to get picky, then I will cover one more thing. Was there some fictionalizing? Of course! they had to squeeze in over 40 characters into a few leads! Lots of stuff had to be cut, so things were glossed over and cut. I'm not saying it's perfect in character detail, but the overall story was left in tact. This was not a Hollywood story even with the changes. The plot did not deceive. That battle was as real as a recreation could be. Even Lt. Col. Hal Morris, who is retired and was there, says so. Even my ex-boss and a couple other friends, who were either at that battle or at Nam, said so. If anyone has a right to point out lies, it's our ignored and abused Nam veterans.My apologies to everyone else for that rant.

I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!Compared to most other films Amelie (and I will stick to Amelie since Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing Amelie criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time.

Acting kudoes should also have gone to Heath Ledger, Tom Wilkinson and Jason Isaacs, as well as numerous other character actors in the film. People have quibbled about the historical accuracy, but this was made as a fictional story about a family during the American Revolution, not a documentary. In little details they were scrupulous as to accuracy. Mel's fictional character was BASED ON a composite of three separate people in real life, including Frances Marion, The Swamp Fox. The battle at the end was BASED ON a composite of two different battles, one of them being Cowpens. I didn't expect to care much for this movie, ordinarily being more interested in the Civil War than the Revolutionary War, but found this story very compelling. In my humble opinion movies made today have to have unbelievable action in them to satisfy 95% of the movie-going public and they usually require a great leap of faith somewhere in the film during an action scene, sometimes more than once. (Well, that was impossible in real life, but we'll just ignore that and move on). I've heard and read complaints about scenes in this film that were sort of unbelievable, too, but I think that this film was no different in that respect from many others I've seen that are considered wonderful movies. Evidently because it's placed in an historical context they consider this a major flaw but again I feel they are expecting a documentary and not a movie. I went back to see this movie 3 or 4 times and dragged different friends and family every time who all went out afterwards raving about what a great movie it was. I got the DVD for Christmas. I have minor complaints, like some anachronistic phrases sprinkled throughout during humorous scenes. But these are so minor. I still think it's a fantastic movie.

I've heard and read complaints about scenes in this film that were sort of unbelievable, too, but I think that this film was no different in that respect from many others I've seen that are considered wonderful movies. Evidently because it's placed in an historical context they consider this a major flaw but again I feel they are expecting a documentary and not a movie. I went back to see this movie 3 or 4 times and dragged different friends and family every time who all went out afterwards raving about what a great movie it was. I got the DVD for Christmas. I have minor complaints, like some anachronistic phrases sprinkled throughout during humorous scenes. But these are so minor. I still think it's a fantastic movie.

This is brought to a test by the pressure of the Revolution finally appearing literally at his doorstep. I think he is wonderful in this film. Acting kudoes should also have gone to Heath Ledger, Tom Wilkinson and Jason Isaacs, as well as numerous other character actors in the film. People have quibbled about the historical accuracy, but this was made as a fictional story about a family during the American Revolution, not a documentary. In little details they were scrupulous as to accuracy. Mel's fictional character was BASED ON a composite of three separate people in real life, including Frances Marion, The Swamp Fox. The battle at the end was BASED ON a composite of two different battles, one of them being Cowpens. I didn't expect to care much for this movie, ordinarily being more interested in the Civil War than the Revolutionary War, but found this story very compelling.

Tsukamoto's cinema is filled with hyper fast editing, shaking camera, fast forwards and every imaginable things to shock the viewer senses and make the weakest faint. Tokyo Fist is not any exception.Director himself plays Tsuda, a nerdish Japanese insurance salesman who has a beautiful girlfriend Hizuru (Kahori Fujii) whom with he lives seemingly peacefully and in love. But still it looks like Tsuda has some problems in his life and seems to be on the edge of his sanity. Soon his high school time friend Kojima arrives (played by the director's brother, Kôji Tsukamoto) and he is a professional boxer and very fierce one. When he starts to be interested in Tsuda's girl, all physical and mental hell breaks loose as Tsuda gets an obsession to start to box himself, too, and Hizuru starts to have some very severe habits of body piercing and self mutilation. The infernal ride has begun and the viewer is not recommended to take it granted that he'll\/she'll stomach the ride till the end because this is Tsukamoto. That means incredible power and impact straight to your face.The film is perhaps even wilder at some points than the first Tetsuo (1988) as the message and imagery is really heavy this time and the film is in color, too. The fists, the punches and the mayhem is always aimed straight to the camera, the viewer and audience, so the viewer will be on the edge of the seat for the whole time, and it all is of course at its most powerful when seen on the big screen. Tsukamoto has the talent to hammer and force his things to the skull and spinal cord of the viewer and he does it all with the magic of editing and cinematography, and definitely not least of Chu Ishikawa's pounding and merciless soundtrack which is here as effective and wonderful as in Tetsuo.The visuals are impressive and every twisted camera angle has its purpose and meaning as well as every bit of mist and darkness that is shed during the ride. The effect when he shakes his camera is something truly unique and definitely much more powerful way to depict the feelings and mental states of the characters than any dialogue ever could. Fast edits and unconventional usage of camera can be very irritating and needless when used without any real reason or to make the film look stylish, but they can also be heart stoppingly effective when they have a cinematic meaning and the director could just simply write on the paper what the edit or camera angle means inside the film. Tetsuo is another great example of this and its black and white scenery is no less powerful than the colors in Tokyo Fist. Tokyo Fist is extremely menacing as there hardly are any peaceful moments and there's all the time some element there to make it clear that it is not peaceful even though it may look like it.The film's theme is about human nature and its jealous and weak sides as the characters can't live without taking or producing physical pain. The smashed faces and the scenes of surreal gore spurting at nightmarish anger are really something to make us ask why do the characters do it. Why cannot human nature solve things in other way than physical force and violence and how many of us dares to admit the brute sides of ourselves and accept them? And then of course keep them away and on the background. The final image is kind of optimistic but definitely no character gets out without the result and payment of their deeds. The film is also a good example for those who think that in Japanese cinema females are often on the background and weaker than men as the lead female in Tokyo Fist practically (and quite passively!) makes, at first so powerful and dominating, Kojima as her submissive slave.The film begins as in our familiar world in modern day Japan but it is not so long before Tsukamoto gives us the first glimpses of his surreal visions that are taken at their extremes in the incredible blood soaked nightmare finale in the ring, a finale that is so fierce, kinetic and merciless piece of film making it just makes me appreciate and love Japanese cinema even more with its many sides never or very rarely paralleled in other world cinema. The gore and violence is sudden and almost unbearably shocking at times but the blood geysirs are not realistic nor they're meant to be; they are from the film's own world and as symbolic and surreal as in the Japanese samurai classic The Baby Cart aka Lone Wolf & Cub series in the early seventies, the first two parts of that series edited also into one feature film as Shogun Assassin (1980). Still none of these films manages to give the kind of impact in their violence or any other element than Tokyo Fist, but the surreal depiction of physical violence is pretty similar with Tsukamoto and The Baby Cart pieces.Perhaps only negative point I can find in Tokyo Fist is that some of the characters seem to develop a little too fast and they should have been little more motivated and restrained. For example, Tsuda seems to be completely mad already and is capable to rape his girlfriend any time so these kind of things should be explained little more carefully in order to make the piece perfect and the characters more real. Still the characters are very good and the message and theme gets delivered very effectively through their acts and there's absolutely no question that the visual magic and impact of Tsukamoto's deserves nothing less than praising and moments of pure amazement.Shinya Tsukamoto is the kind of Master of Cinema that he really deserves his name in the thanks section of the end credits of every young film maker's film who has got inspiration from his work. His films have the ability to make people faint, shock, turn the head off the screen and stun in their power and it all is done practically by himself as he works as an editor, cinematographer, art director etc. in his own films and thus expresses his visions. His films would be totally unforgettable when seen at least once in the big screen but fortunately the effect is still very strong on television, too. Tokyo Fist is among the most fierce, angry and honest rides of cinema I've ever experienced and everytime I see something from its maker, I cannot help but feel confused and amazed in front of Japan and its invaluable gifts during the centuries to the world of cinema.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 January 2003","score":"17 out of 24 people found the following review useful","review":"  Japanese film maker genius and multi-talent Shinya Tsukamoto's Tokyo Fist (Tokyo-ken, 1995) is as stunning and incredible experience as can be expected after seeing his two Tetsuo films in which a human body and metal (machine) became one with a horrific results.

Tokyo Fist is extremely menacing as there hardly are any peaceful moments and there's all the time some element there to make it clear that it is not peaceful even though it may look like it.The film's theme is about human nature and its jealous and weak sides as the characters can't live without taking or producing physical pain. The smashed faces and the scenes of surreal gore spurting at nightmarish anger are really something to make us ask why do the characters do it. Why cannot human nature solve things in other way than physical force and violence and how many of us dares to admit the brute sides of ourselves and accept them? And then of course keep them away and on the background. The final image is kind of optimistic but definitely no character gets out without the result and payment of their deeds. The film is also a good example for those who think that in Japanese cinema females are often on the background and weaker than men as the lead female in Tokyo Fist practically (and quite passively!) makes, at first so powerful and dominating, Kojima as her submissive slave.The film begins as in our familiar world in modern day Japan but it is not so long before Tsukamoto gives us the first glimpses of his surreal visions that are taken at their extremes in the incredible blood soaked nightmare finale in the ring, a finale that is so fierce, kinetic and merciless piece of film making it just makes me appreciate and love Japanese cinema even more with its many sides never or very rarely paralleled in other world cinema. The gore and violence is sudden and almost unbearably shocking at times but the blood geysirs are not realistic nor they're meant to be; they are from the film's own world and as symbolic and surreal as in the Japanese samurai classic The Baby Cart aka Lone Wolf & Cub series in the early seventies, the first two parts of that series edited also into one feature film as Shogun Assassin (1980). Still none of these films manages to give the kind of impact in their violence or any other element than Tokyo Fist, but the surreal depiction of physical violence is pretty similar with Tsukamoto and The Baby Cart pieces.Perhaps only negative point I can find in Tokyo Fist is that some of the characters seem to develop a little too fast and they should have been little more motivated and restrained. For example, Tsuda seems to be completely mad already and is capable to rape his girlfriend any time so these kind of things should be explained little more carefully in order to make the piece perfect and the characters more real. Still the characters are very good and the message and theme gets delivered very effectively through their acts and there's absolutely no question that the visual magic and impact of Tsukamoto's deserves nothing less than praising and moments of pure amazement.Shinya Tsukamoto is the kind of Master of Cinema that he really deserves his name in the thanks section of the end credits of every young film maker's film who has got inspiration from his work. His films have the ability to make people faint, shock, turn the head off the screen and stun in their power and it all is done practically by himself as he works as an editor, cinematographer, art director etc. in his own films and thus expresses his visions. His films would be totally unforgettable when seen at least once in the big screen but fortunately the effect is still very strong on television, too. Tokyo Fist is among the most fierce, angry and honest rides of cinema I've ever experienced and everytime I see something from its maker, I cannot help but feel confused and amazed in front of Japan and its invaluable gifts during the centuries to the world of cinema.9\/10 ","genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"2 January 2003","score":"17 out of 24 people found the following review useful","review":"  Japanese film maker genius and multi-talent Shinya Tsukamoto's Tokyo Fist (Tokyo-ken, 1995) is as stunning and incredible experience as can be expected after seeing his two Tetsuo films in which a human body and metal (machine) became one with a horrific results. Tsukamoto's cinema is filled with hyper fast editing, shaking camera, fast forwards and every imaginable things to shock the viewer senses and make the weakest faint. Tokyo Fist is not any exception.Director himself plays Tsuda, a nerdish Japanese insurance salesman who has a beautiful girlfriend Hizuru (Kahori Fujii) whom with he lives seemingly peacefully and in love. But still it looks like Tsuda has some problems in his life and seems to be on the edge of his sanity. Soon his high school time friend Kojima arrives (played by the director's brother, Kôji Tsukamoto) and he is a professional boxer and very fierce one. When he starts to be interested in Tsuda's girl, all physical and mental hell breaks loose as Tsuda gets an obsession to start to box himself, too, and Hizuru starts to have some very severe habits of body piercing and self mutilation. The infernal ride has begun and the viewer is not recommended to take it granted that he'll\/she'll stomach the ride till the end because this is Tsukamoto. That means incredible power and impact straight to your face.The film is perhaps even wilder at some points than the first Tetsuo (1988) as the message and imagery is really heavy this time and the film is in color, too. The fists, the punches and the mayhem is always aimed straight to the camera, the viewer and audience, so the viewer will be on the edge of the seat for the whole time, and it all is of course at its most powerful when seen on the big screen. Tsukamoto has the talent to hammer and force his things to the skull and spinal cord of the viewer and he does it all with the magic of editing and cinematography, and definitely not least of Chu Ishikawa's pounding and merciless soundtrack which is here as effective and wonderful as in Tetsuo.The visuals are impressive and every twisted camera angle has its purpose and meaning as well as every bit of mist and darkness that is shed during the ride. The effect when he shakes his camera is something truly unique and definitely much more powerful way to depict the feelings and mental states of the characters than any dialogue ever could. Fast edits and unconventional usage of camera can be very irritating and needless when used without any real reason or to make the film look stylish, but they can also be heart stoppingly effective when they have a cinematic meaning and the director could just simply write on the paper what the edit or camera angle means inside the film.

Ben Affleck stars as Jack Ryan in this film, but is not able to capture the same power and effectiveness of Harrison Ford' or even Alec Baldwin's Ryan. I've heard a lot of people complain that Jack Ryan is younger in this film than he was in the last ones, and that this is somehow supposed to count against the film. Maybe this is a prequel. Maybe they wanted to give the series a boost with young actors. Maybe it took place earlier in Jack Ryan's career. Who cares? Did you not notice the lowly profession that Ryan was also given in this film? It doesn't matter even a tiny bit that Jack Ryan is younger here than he was in Clear and Present Danger. I would think that if you missed the plethora of ligitimate reasons to pick this movie apart and had to focus instead on Ryan's appearance, you would at least be more concerned about his strange ability to morph into completely different people from film to film. As far as being an involving and tense thriller, The Sum of All Fears delivers spectacularly. It has a brilliant story that involves a right-wing neo-Nazi with the idea that with the use of a nuclear weapon he could create a war between two of the most powerful nations in the world (America and Russia), and the Aryan fascists could take over in the radioactive aftermath. I was particularly impressed that the film has the guts to portray the Americans as the primary aggressors (although also as a country led by a lot of men capable of yelling at each other like high school kids at a time when their focus is more crucial than ever) and the Russians as the ones that are the first to agree to back down. The film starts to trip a little bit when it pits Ryan, now a lowly analyst with little to no say in the proceedings during the government meetings, as the only man capable of preventing World War III because of information that he has about the origin of the bomb that was detonated in Baltimore at the Super Bowl, killing thousands and thousands of people and infecting countless more with radiation (as well as providing the most shocking scene in the entire film). It's such a disappointment to see such a strong film brought down by so much cheesy Hollywood crap, it's almost like a Schwarzenegger movie or a Van Damme  movie or a Steven Seagal movie, where everything is up to one man to come in and save the day. If there is only one thing that The Sum of All Fears has more than it's share of, it is cheesy Hollywood crap. Aside from the hero-of-the-day structure, the film races along at a fever pitch as the tension between Russia and America comes to a head, with each country holding a twitchy finger over the big red button, but it is anchored down by a lumbering romantic subplot that, like just about every Jerry Bruckheimer movie ever made, does nothing but stop the film in its tracks and vainly attempt to attract a female audience. The film is weighed down by things like this, and by it's awkward attention to detail, which is tremendously informative about things like military tactics and national security, but glosses over things like a missing nuclear weapon (I would think that there would have been at least ONE person who casually mentioned at any point after the bomb went missing in 1973, Hey, what ever happened to that nuclear weapon that we sent up on that plane that no one ever saw again?). (spoilers)  I'm not even so concerned about the sudden installment of a girlfriend into Jack Ryan's life, but more with the fact that the movie is so reductive about the tragedy that occurred in Baltimore, and this goes on throughout the entire film. When William Cabot dies, for example, the last thing that he says is to ask if Ryan's girlfriend is okay. On the one hand, I can understand that in such an explosion, most people would be most concerned about people they knew who may have been hurt, but in the film, this is done so that when we see them having a cute little picnic on the White House lawn at the end of the film, it means that all ends happily and thousands and thousands of people were not really killed in that explosion we saw earlier. The end of the film is one of the most intensely disappointing endings I have ever seen, by far overshadowing the weighty drab of the romance and the hero plot and the fact that we never find out what that gift was that Ryan's fairy godfather gave him for his and his girlfriend's anniversary, which he mysteriously knew about. I am not saying that The Sum of All Fears is a trashy or bad movie, it is a capable thriller with an excellent story that is able to survive the characteristics that it has in common with the typical  Bruckheimer films, but it's weaknesses are emphasized by the juxtaposition of it's enormous potential and the goofy crap that was thrown in and which had such a massively negative impact on the film as a whole. Like Pearl Harbor, this movie could very easily have been a truly great film with real life meaning, but instead they chose to gloss it over and sugar-coat the painful content, making the audience look the other way at the cute couple at the end of the film and convince themselves that if such an event occurred in real life (an event which has been described as `inevitable'), a picnic on the White House lawn is how it would all end. Sadly, in real life, I think people would be a lot more concerned about the burning radioactive rubble that used to be Baltimore than they would be about that cute couple eating sandwiches in front of the White House.

I've heard a lot of people complain that Jack Ryan is younger in this film than he was in the last ones, and that this is somehow supposed to count against the film. Maybe this is a prequel.

The film starts to trip a little bit when it pits Ryan, now a lowly analyst with little to no say in the proceedings during the government meetings, as the only man capable of preventing World War III because of information that he has about the origin of the bomb that was detonated in Baltimore at the Super Bowl, killing thousands and thousands of people and infecting countless more with radiation (as well as providing the most shocking scene in the entire film). It's such a disappointment to see such a strong film brought down by so much cheesy Hollywood crap, it's almost like a Schwarzenegger movie or a Van Damme  movie or a Steven Seagal movie, where everything is up to one man to come in and save the day.

Wendigo is a very artsy little movie with a genuinely creepy feel to it. I had mixed feelings about Larry Fessenden's previous efforts.  No Telling was just a little bizarre for my taste and I thought that Habit had a lot going for it.  While we're on the subject of Habit, I thought he accomplished a lot with a tiny budget and the ambiguity was great. I also loved the main character and Fessenden's acting. My main qualm with it was a personal problem, but not being able to get past the fact that the lead female character too closely resembled my ex-girlfriend really marred my overall enjoyment of the the film (shivers).  Anyway, on with the review here  Wendigo starts off with a New York family heading for the hills in hopes of having a peaceful weekend getaway.  All chances of a peaceful weekend are shot to hell when they accidentally hit a deer with their volvo station wagon.  This upsets a trio of hunters who claim to have been tracking the deer for eighteen hours.  This event leads to a confrontation between the father, George, and redneck, Otis, which leaves George humiliated in front of his wife and young son, Miles.  This scene is pretty brilliant in its own right because it is seen mostly through the POV of Miles.  We get the same uneasy feeling that he does and it's the uncomfortable realization that Mommy and Daddy can't always protect him against everything.  It's an interesting technique and it works.  After parting with the unhappy three, George is positive that this won't be the last time he and Otis will cross each others' paths, and he's right.  The guy even uses the driveway of their vacation home as a shortcut to get to his own dump.  The first portion of the movie has the family at home, doing their thing, where we really get to know and care about them.  To say too much about them would give too much away but we learn that George is  somewhat of a workaholic and a big reason he's out here is to save his marriage and maybe spend a little quality time with the kid.  This is not the usual, run-of-the-mill, cookie-cutter family.  They're very convincing and it's easy to care about them.  I can't say I liked the kid very much, but then again, I usually don't like kids in movies.  Now with Otis, George was right.  The guy is bad news.  He's also somewhat of a Peeping-Tom and he has a gun fetish (don't all rednecks?).  The house that the family is staying in comes complete with bullet holes in the windows and it's no big mystery as to who put them there.  On a trip to town, Miles bumps into an old Indian who gives him a wooden figurine and explains to him the story of the Wendigo, a half-man, half-beast.  This bit gives the film a supernatural dimension and a certain ambiguity because nothing about the old man is fully explained and we don't know whether he is a ghost or not.  The rest of the film is mostly build-up for the riveting climax and if you've warmed up to the characters by now, you're in for a compelling ride.  Many have complained about the ending being somewhat of a let-down, but let me say that I would have been disappointed had it ended any other way.  The movie is loaded with style up the wazoo, featuring close-ups, slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze frames and even a Matrix-inspired (hate that term) shot that fit perfectly. The graniness, I thought, was well-used and there also seems to be an ongoing theme on guns (Am I the only one who noticed that?).   The music is appropriately moody and creepy and there's a great rock song over the end-credits.  If you like the movie, then the DVD belongs in your collection because it doesn't go short on the features.  Check it out. According to Fessenden, this is his third in a supposed trilogy following No Telling and Habit and it's also his best film to date.  It's a real shame that it won't be viewed by many, but one thing about him, he's not in it for the money.  He's a genuine film maker and it will be interesting to see what he does on his next outting.  10\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"2 January 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is a very different kind of horror movie that, much like the excellent Session 9, will not appeal to the masses but will be a real treat for patient viewers who don't mind a quiet, rewarding film.

Midway through the film, I already asked myself why Nickelodeon didn't put this on TV for free instead of milking it for short-term cash.The two biggest disappointments of the movie was the storyline development itself and the use of the series' characters.Amidst the rush of the storyline, the film actually does a decent job of building up the conflict between Arnold and the villain, Mr. Scheck.  But all of it goes to waste when the multimillionaire Scheck reveals his ridiculous motives.  It was very anticlimatic and I didn't take the movie very seriously after that; I thought of at least two alternate ways the movie could've ended (while taking away most of the excitement).The three main characters in the series (Arnold, Helga, & Gerald) take up most of the film's significance, as they should.

But all of it goes to waste when the multimillionaire Scheck reveals his ridiculous motives.  It was very anticlimatic and I didn't take the movie very seriously after that; I thought of at least two alternate ways the movie could've ended (while taking away most of the excitement).The three main characters in the series (Arnold, Helga, & Gerald) take up most of the film's significance, as they should.  But what of the secondary characters (Arnold's grandparents, Phoebe, Sid, Harold, Rhonda, Eugene, and a few others), most which have had at least two of the 100+ episodes based on them?  The ability to add depth to these other characters is what helps make the TV show interesting; but here they get shoehorned into this film without being able to help Arnold at all.  They remain likeable, but ultimately are not at all memorable.  Even the other characters made for this movie (Bridget, the coroner, and the one-legged man) get more of the face time.Part of the film does focus on the relationship between Arnold and Helga (who passionately loves Arnold even though she pretends to hate him), and the moment when she finally admits her love for him (and how he reacts to it) as the movie nears the final major scene.  It's one of the main concepts of the TV show, and the only valuable part of this movie.Otherwise, this was a very average film with a simplistic and uninspiring story, cluttered with useless characters.  This mediocre outing by the show's creators will likely mark the beginning of the end for a fine TV series.  Besides, when Nickelodeon still has the Rugrats, Spongebob, and a roster of new hit shows at its disposal, why continue to focus on a cartoon that failed miserably on the biggest stage?

The only reason I sat through the entire thing is that I wanted to compare it with Red Dragon and the other Hannibal films.This film reeks of the 80's...not the good parts. It has terrible acting, it's like all the actors were reading off cue cards. The plot didn't seen to exist in the end, so we really don't care about the characters at all.Brian Cox is a horrible Lecktor. He had no charisma, and it was impossible to believe this man could contain the knowledge of how to cook a human, he seemed more like a liquor store robber. He seemed like a reject from a Guy Richie film.The Toothfairy was even worse...how are we supposed to be afraid of something that looks like a mutant Bill Murray?Anytime the movie had a chance to be creepy or suspenseful, it ruined it with the music. Not like all 80's music is bad, just the songs Mann decided to put in the scenes...they kill the mood. In between the innapropriate songs was silence...dead, dull silence, which makes the film seem twice as long and twice as boring.To tell you how bad this film is, the only thing that amused me throughout this entire flick was the scene in the grocery store, where you could see boxes of Mr. T Cereal in the background.This is one of those products of the 80's that you look back on with shame...kinda like the mullet. Avoid this, go see Red Dragon.
