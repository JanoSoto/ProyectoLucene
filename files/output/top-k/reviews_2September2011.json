I had seen part of this movie on commercial television way back when old flicks were all chopped up with commercials. Hated it! Then, a few years go I saw it on TCM (probably) and was quite impressed. Tonight I watched it again and have reverted back to...well, not really hating it, but not seeing anything that special about it. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a great film? No. It's different, even for film noir, but I'm not finding exceptional.That's not to say there aren't a few things that I like here. Starting with the performance of Joseph Cotten. I've always like Cotten and feel he is a very underrated actor. I am not impressed with Cotten's character in the first half of the film. Would an American visiting Allied-occupied Vienna right after the war really be that aggressive in dealing with the authorities...particularly as an author? I doubt it. But, that's a problem caused by the screenwriter and director, not Joseph Cotten. Valli, whose only other film I remembered was The Miracle Of The Bells with Frank Sinatra, is also superb. I do not admire Trevor Howard here in the first half of the film, though he (or I should say his character) becomes a bit more multidimensional in the second half of the film. If you're an Orson Welles, you may be disappointed. Welles' scenes are top notch, but he is not in the first two-thirds of the film at all.The story is interesting, all the more so when the dilution of penicillin surfaces as a motive. The photography, stunning for a black and white film considering that it is filmed in Vienna. Many of the techniques I don't particularly like -- such as shooting at odd angles and the use of shadows -- worked well here. And the climax in the sewers of Vienna is stunning; and it's brilliant how they don't show the death of a main character, making it all the more haunting.You know, as I think back over the film, it's the first two-thirds of the film that disappoints me. Yawn. The final third of the film IS what all the fuss is about.

I always go in expecting something with pretty low standards, and then I always seem to come out pleasantly surprised. Such is the case with The American President. It stars Michael Douglas as Alex Shepard, President of the United States of America. The film tells the story about This widowed President who meets and falls in love with a lobbyist and how they make their relationship work amongst the political strife Shepard must deal with every day, being the President and all. It's a sappy love story on the surface, but a charming, intellectual, and expertly written film at its core.I was skeptical of what this movie would entail at first, but my hopes were lifted significantly when I saw Aaron Sorkin's name under the words Written by during the opening credits. The American President boasts very clever and witty dialogue from start to finish. I wouldn't call it Sorkin's greatest achievement, but it certainly doesn't smell of anything less than excellent. Being that Sorkin is a pretentious fellow there is some pretentious dialogue in here, with lines that more show off Sorkin's craft word play than further the plot, but overall it is astoundingly well structured dialogue that flows with the always recognizable Sorkin cadence, keeping this film moving at a rapid pace that snaps from scene to scene with the utmost professionalism.It also helps that Sorkin's dialogue was given the privilege of being delivered by an incredible cast. Michael Douglas and Annette Bening star in the film with radiant chemistry. Their separate performances are remarkable, but together they make an otherwise cheesy story compelling. The supporting cast includes fantastic performances from the likes of Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, and even Richard Dreyfuss. Every actor in this film does their part and they all work so well to bring this film together and lift if above it's clichéd and predictable shell.Without some key elements of this film it could have been pretty terrible, but the right people lined up in the right places to make this film actually work. It's a worthwhile watch that makes an effective use of two hours if you enjoy snappy dialogue and great performances. I wouldn't say that I was touched or moved by this film, but I can say that it kept me interested and it had enough intellect, charm, humor, and talent to make me enjoy it just enough to say good things about it and then move on.

Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man who is struggling to put his life back together after the brutal rape and murder of his wife. But Leonard's problems are different from those of most people in his situation; he was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; he is incapable of retaining any new information, and must resort to copious note-taking and Polaroid photographs in order to keep track of what happens to him over the course of a day (he's even tattooed himself with a few crucial bits of information he can't get along without). Leonard retains awareness that his wife was brutally murdered, however, and he's convinced that the culprit still walks the streets. Leonard is obsessed with the notion of taking revenge against the man who has ruined his life, and he sets out to find him, getting help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who appears to be a sympathetic barmaid, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who claims to be Leonard's friend, even though Leonard senses that he cannot be trusted.

After he's brutally beaten, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) makes an agreement to enter him in a tournament if the kids allow him time to train. If you read many reviews of THE KARATE KID, even the positive ones, you're probably going to see the word manipulative several times. There's no denying that this film is predictable and there's no denying the fact that every scene tries to manipulate the viewer into a certain emotion but who cares? THE KARATE KID is without question one of the best films of the decade and it's also one of the best of its type from any era. There are so many reasons why this film should have fallen flat on its face but a lot of credit has to go to director John G. Avildsen because he makes sure that things never get corny and he is so terrific at building up the characters and the drama that you can't help but get caught up in everything you're fed. I think most people will be able to connect with the Daniel character and Macchio does a terrific job at bringing him to life. Morita gets the role of his career and simply kills it and ends up becoming one of the most memorable good guys in the history of cinema. The two actors have such a warn chemistry that one can't help but feel their relationship grow and even more important is that it comes off real. The film has one of the greatest underdogs, one of the greatest good guys so we have to have a great villain and we get that in William Zabka and Martin Kove who play the main bully and his master. The two are such creeps that you can't help but hate them and want to see Daniel win against them. Elisabeth Shue also turns in a very strong performance as the love interest. It's really remarkable to see how terrific the cast is as all the leads and everyone down to the extras fit their roles perfectly. I'm sure many will see connections to ROCKY, which was also directed by Avildsen but I think this movie is even better. The drama is so real and the emotions that the characters go through are so dark and true to life that you really can't help but feel for them and what they're going through. The film is quite dark in spots but it's also got a terrific heart and message that really make it so memorable. There have been many imitators since (and a remake) but there's no question that THE KARATE KID is something special and something that really can't be touched.

After he's brutally beaten, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) makes an agreement to enter him in a tournament if the kids allow him time to train. If you read many reviews of THE KARATE KID, even the positive ones, you're probably going to see the word manipulative several times. There's no denying that this film is predictable and there's no denying the fact that every scene tries to manipulate the viewer into a certain emotion but who cares? THE KARATE KID is without question one of the best films of the decade and it's also one of the best of its type from any era. There are so many reasons why this film should have fallen flat on its face but a lot of credit has to go to director John G. Avildsen because he makes sure that things never get corny and he is so terrific at building up the characters and the drama that you can't help but get caught up in everything you're fed. I think most people will be able to connect with the Daniel character and Macchio does a terrific job at bringing him to life. Morita gets the role of his career and simply kills it and ends up becoming one of the most memorable good guys in the history of cinema. The two actors have such a warn chemistry that one can't help but feel their relationship grow and even more important is that it comes off real. The film has one of the greatest underdogs, one of the greatest good guys so we have to have a great villain and we get that in William Zabka and Martin Kove who play the main bully and his master.

Once there Miyagi runs into an old rival who wants to fight him to the death while Daniel falls for a new girl but also runs into someone who wants to kill him. THE KARATE KID PART II is far from a horrible movie but time certainly hasn't done it any favors but then again it was fairly weak when it was first released. It's obvious that no one really paid too much attention when it came time to come up with a good story and it's also quite clear that this was only made because the studio knew they could make money. As with most sequels, this one here is rather pointless and the story itself is pretty weak and forced. I'd say just about everything going on here is forced from the situation with Miyagi and his old rival to his relationship with the woman he left behind. Nothing with Daniel works either with the love story coming off silly and his new rival just comes off rather bland and a pale imitation of the one from the first film. I found Daniel's character to be really poorly written here and what really annoyed me was the constant questions that he would be asking. If you took away all of his questions or at least cut them in half then the movie could have shaved a good thirty-minutes off the running time. That too is a problem because the 113-minutes really drag in spots. With all of that said, there are still a few good things in the film including the performances by Macchio and Morita. Both men fit back nicely into their roles and that chemistry between them is once again on the mark. The supporting players don't come off as well but the majority of this can be blamed on the screenplay that makes the characters so unrealistic that the actors really don't have anything to work with. There's one nice sequence inside a gambling hall where Daniel must break some ice and of course there's the Peter Cetera song Glory of Love, which is put to good use. John G. Avildsen returns as director but there's very little energy throughout the production, which is a real shame.

After he wakes up we learn that he is being transported to a mental home around Camp Crystal Lake. After one patient murders another over something completely ridiculous, a series of murders begin happening across the area at the hands of a killer who is using Jason's old M.O.Indeed, this is not the greatest horror movie ever made and far from the best Friday the 13th film, but what A New Beginning does that what all the following ones do not is it retains the style of filmmaking that made the previous films so likable.

Part V stylistically remained the most true to its predecessors than any Friday the 13th film that followed it, but sadly it just doesn't do it quite as well as the previous horror classics.One thing I appreciate is the return of the character, Tommy Jarvis.

Especially the hillbilly characters who were simply just irritating and besides the scene where Tommy kicks the ass of one of them they should have been cut from the film.

Nothing, beyond, Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together.

Set in 1903-4, made in 1944, Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today, at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago, even in 1944, and in the depths of World War II, surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a full-blown modern movie musical, and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties, but much of the music was staged, performed by performers. Gradually, beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz, studios shifted over to free form musicals, where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical, you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis, and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945, the first Rodgers & Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair, passed around among the characters, but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier non-musical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two, the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line, and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters -- the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing, but much of it is tied to musical performances, so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand, The Trolley Song is great fun, but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line, and a more elaborate, expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan, during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light, escapist story, like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two, State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing, while St. Louis produces no such emotion, perhaps because it is so long ago, but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland, the charming Margaret O'Brien, demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue, and Marjorie Main, performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie, and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals, the color, dancing, music, even when there is little or no plot to hold it together.

He is, however, a day late and a dollar short he is informed that Lime was run over in the street the day before and killed.Shocked at the news, Holly naturally asks many questions, but it quickly becomes clear that no one wants to give him any answers. Everyone he talks to acts like they are being followed, and all he learns is that two men were with Lime when the accident happened and carried his body to the side of the street. Only the porter's account differs from this official version he insists that there was a third man there at the time, but try as he might, Holly can get nothing more out of him.Also mixed up in whatever is going on is Harry's mistress Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli, billed here only by her surname), a beautiful actress at a local theatre who, like everyone else Holly has encountered, seems reluctant to talk and gives a good many enigmatic answers.Torn between dissatisfaction at the lack of information he is getting yet at the same time drawn to Anna, Holly makes a few awkward attempts to court her, such as bringing her flowers. Unfortunately for both of them, he can't resist trying to find out what happened to Harry, and is shocked when Anna actually suggests that he is better dead.Meantime the local police want nothing more than for Holly to get on the next plane back to the States. Everybody in this film is either hiding something or afraid of something (or both), and Holly's attempts to find out the fate of his friend go nowhere for some time. Finally it is revealed that Harry Lime was involved in the black market distribution of diluted penicillin; the description of the effects of the watered-down medicine does not bear close scrutiny, but it does not matter. Holly is forced to come face-to-face with the truth that the boy he once knew became a man he did not know.Just when you think things can't get any more twisted, Harry (Orson Welles) turns up, very much alive and completely unrepentant with regard to his black market activities.This is a real roller-coaster-ride of a movie; it has the most unexpected twists and turns, including an unforgettable chase scene through the sewers of Vienna at night.One of the stunning things about this movie is how forcibly Welles's presence is felt despite the fact that he does not show up until the film has been running for a solid hour. In fact, probably the most remarkable thing about this movie is that it is about a man that we do not see until the movie is into its second hour and who is really neither the lead nor the title character although the story revolves around him (the third man of the title is not Harry but one of the men who carried him to the sidewalk after being run over in the street). and who dominates the film even though he appears in only a small handful of scenes. Welles is perfect here; he tones down his tendency to be hammy and underplays beautifully, probably so that he would not look a fool next to Joe Cotten, one of the greatest actors of his day, who delivers here one of his finest performances.And Valli makes three stunning, enigmatic, with an undertone of bitterness, she makes Anna an unforgettable character.I've given enough away, I think. The greatest movies are those that defy simple categorization. Reed may have set out to make a noir, but the end product is much, much more than the sum of its parts.

This is a film that boasts perfection from all quarters from the acting, the casting, the writing, the directing, the cinematography, to the scoring.Of course, its standout strength is the dialogue which is not only the best example of Coen dialogue but perhaps the most powerful use of dialogue in modern film. The main thrust of the film's quick and steady pace comes from the lyrical and relentless back and forth between the film's characters (and in typical Noir fashion, this is usually between Tom and someone else).As is the case in most films, the level of the writing raises the level of the acting. Each of the actors' performances are first rate and indeed there are many career bests given here. When I lament the fact that the likes of Pachino and De Niro don't consistently produce the quality they did in the 70's and early 80's, I remind myself that we just don't have the quality of writing as we did then and while films have become better in other respects they've never quite reached the same heights from the point of view of the writing. Joel and Ethan Coen are amongst a relatively small number of contemporary writers who are consistently working on that level and Miller's Crossing is the perfect example of great actors being fueled by great writing. Finney and Polita clearly revel in the expounding of their luscious lines while J.E. Freeman simply burns a whole in the screen. Of course, this is Byrne's film from start to finish and he carries it well with a distinct and unique brand of cool as he delivers immortal line after immortal line with pure gusto.Those who claim the violence in this film is gratuitous need to re-watch.

On top of that, speaking from a technical point of view, violence in Coen films is typically choreographed into the action scenes in a relatively artistic manner where it is used as a counterpoint or visual exclamation mark to augment and punctuate the action and\/or tension of a scene.

This is difficult to believe as the film is very much about thinking oneself out of problems and not loosing one's head and Tom himself explicitly equates thinking to hats during the film. But that's the great thing about symbolism in clever films - there's a lot one can make of even a hat.

However, the director's approach is through human emotions rather than political or economic commentary, giving a depth and a Shakespearean complexity to the movie. As Roger Ebert rightly observed, the film is sparse in dialogs and inconspicuous in showing direct emotions but it gives the viewer a chance to ponder and decipher the protagonist's emotions. The silences aren't too long but the viewer can sense the invisible rays coming from Binoche, for example when she enters her house after her husband and child's death, or when she sits at the cafeteria, and the camera focuses on her face. Juliette convincingly manages to underplay such scenes, and that gives more gravity to her emotions and performance.The plot is simple and revolves around Julie, the wife of a famous composer who along with his child dies in an car crash while Julie survives. Julie wakes up in the hospital, with the camera focusing on her pupils and the reflection of the doctor who informs her about the tragedy. The eyes shed no tear, though Julie's lips quiver and her heart is shattered. She tries committing suicide but cannot, but this results in prolonged psychological suffering as she suddenly decided to leave behind everything and start afresh. She remains cold and apathetic to everything and this disturbs her the most, and she shuns everyone around her, destroys her husband's possessions, makes love to her husband's friend and fellow composer and lives in a hotel. The only instrument she cannot obliterate is the music in her mind, which keeps confronting her to face reality and move on.Three Colors Blue is a highly polished film, clocking at one and half hours exactly. To me the movie was flawlessly paced like a symphony- maintaining the atmosphere while playing the notes continuously without stopping. I never found it to be too long or boring, because there is genuinity in the movie, which I found completely lacking in the recent claptrap 'Sucker Punch' which claimed to be complex and artsy, but to me was a hack. I was completely flabbergasted when some viewers were discussing the great art behind the pretentious and opaque 'Sucker Punch'. Blue on the other hand is sublime and realistic- did Julie ever seem pretentious or overbearing to me? No, in fact Juliette portrays her with such truthfulness that I felt a unbroken line in her performance that's seldom found in movies these days. Part of the credit goes to Krzysztov who uses the camera so effectively on her.The movie apart from its constant references to the title, also has the elements of red and white finely embedded in it. For example, when the prostitute friend of Julie thanks her for refusing to sign the list to throw the former our to 'keep the society clean', she brings white flowers, a symbol of equality. Also, one could find how the lady who requests Julie to sign the list was being deceived by her own licentious husband in the previous scene where he spends the night with the same prostitute (He was the lady's husband, right?). Also, when Julie helps the prostitute in the brothel, the screen becomes red, indicating kinship and sisterhood. Howeve, blue dominates the background whether its the pen used by Julie, or the curios, the swimming pool, the door, the prostitute friend Lucille's overcoat, Patrice's room etc. And never for a moment does it completely dominate the foreground, in fact it subtly rests in the background to reinforce the idea of liberty.In fact, Julie gets freedom but in order to continue her normal life, she has to rely on her past, as her past influences her. I feel that apart from liberty, the movie pays highlight to influence. I take my country's example. India got independence in 1947, yet it has its British influences. Even though Goa is now free from Portugal's rule over it, it cannot obliterate its past completely as its past keeps influencing it. Take the case of the pauper in the movie who plays his flute on the streets. When Julie places his flute case below his head, he says 'You always got to hold on to something'. In this case, its the music which Julie composed during happier times. Or her scene with the rats, where she is distraught to see the babies being killed, reminding her of her dear child.The only slight complaint I have with the movie is the final scene where Julie actually sheds a tear, or rather two. For some reason, after going through so much internal pain and struggle just to realize that husband was not faithful to her, and then getting her redemption towards the end, I felt that a stolid face with a tear trickling slowly down Julie's face didn't do much justice and made the scene rather distant. Krzysztof could have injected a trickle of positive melodrama by making her break down in tears. But that's my personal opinion.I have to disagree with the comment on the poster of the film saying that the movie is 'Mysterious... Sexy!'. To me, its relatable, touching, gritty, compelling and beautiful.

But when a film had so many natural predispositions for greatness, this isn't saying much.First, the strengths. The costume design and the restitution of the 30's Chicago is so authentic that some beautiful panoramic shots make you feel like traveling back to the prohibition years, on that level, the film is the triumph of meticulous perfectionism and sense of detail conceded even by the most virulent detractors. The direction works, though trying sometimes to impress with unnecessary dizzying shots. De Palma, after all, proved to be a great director for such intense films as Carrie or Scarface, with his unique ability to oscillate between calm and suspenseful moments to extraordinarily effective outburst of bloody violence, conveyed by the beautiful part-thrilling part-haunting score by Ennio Morricone. The movie was handled by professionals who knew their business and had everything to be one of the best.But it needed one thing a script, a kick-ass one with the guts and the energy that Oliver Stone masterfully injected in the veins of Scarface. The movie had the heart but not the passion, the instinct but not the soul. You know something is wrong when you can predict a line or a reaction, when the Mounty Police chief expressed his disagreement, I saw the You're not from Chicago coming, and even the last line, a damn good one, had the forced look on that journalist's face as if he was thinking God, what a bad-ass, that Elliott Ness! By the way, that journalist had a strange ability to point his nose at any convenient occasion until he became an annoying running gag. Still, despite some embarrassing wastes of good lines, it's easy to put that into perspective.In fact, the script sinned more on the characterization and storytelling department, it lacked that spicy something that elevates and develops both the characters and the story in a symbiotic manner. Take Elliott Ness, played by Kevin Costner, more than any inner quality, he certainly owes his appeal to his pretty boyish look and his belonging to the right side of the right side of the law at a time where most of Chicago's police officers were on Al Capone's pay-roll, and the scenes involving his wife and daughter didn't even help. His combat against Al Capone lacked this tormenting desire or internal conflict that would enrich Ness' personality and erases this 'civil servant'-type devotion to duty. At the end, he exuded a sort of naive vulnerability and 'boy-scouts' innocence, that I ended up rooting for him. He was like the kid who wanted to be the hero ... but I didn't snob the pleasure to root for him, especially the film made it clear that it didn't intend to be a masterpiece.Now, to the shadowy guy on the poster's top. The trailer starts with Robert De Niro is Al Capone, this sentence enough probably helped to guarantee half of the movie's success  one of the most respected and bas-ass actors at the peak of his career, portraying the most iconic gangster. De Niro was the 'AL'ibi for his antagonist's dull-Ness, but the trailer was still misleading. I love De Niro but he was too comical for such a serious film, and I can't think in all seriousness that he really expects us NOW to take this role seriously. I try to repress some aberrations my eyes witnessed, like a villainous grin in his face while reading the news of Ness' first flop. Though every actor is allowed to some mistakes, we can't blame everything on the script. But let's not be so severe, the movie had the villain and the hero it deserved, one over and one under the top, canceling out each other's negative effects through an improbably harmony. Both were interestingly nominated for AFI's Top 100 'Heroes and Villains' list, no need to mention that neither was selected.But these considerations hardly matter for despite all these technical faults, the movie kind of redeems itself once we mourned the masterpiece it could have been and start enjoying an innate greatness hidden beneath these campy elements. The pillar of The Untouchables is without a doubt the scene stealing performance of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone, and I don't even care of the accent. I'm not supposed to tell between Scottish and Irish accents (well I do, but he could as well have had a Cuban accent), I hate to kill my enjoyment of a film for such superficial and so-called purist issues, especially when it's not significant to the plot. Connery had the best lines, the best scenes, and was the true leader of the group. Honourable mention by the way to the other untouchables  Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace and Andy Garcia as 'George Stone.The other highlights of the film occur in many unforgettable scenes, one featuring a dinner table and the other, a train station, proving De Palma's directing ability to create suspenseful situations with the patience and talent of a craftsman. The film proved that for the depiction of cinematic violence, De Palma deserves more than a honorable mention. So I guess people went hard on his film because they expected much more, because he had everything to make a masterpiece out of the Prohibition, and avenge Once Upon a Time in America. I simply hope that those who criticize The Untouchables for being over the top, campy or laughable, start looking at Scarface with a more serious eye and realize its greatness in comparison.Anyway, if the movie is victim of the Costner syndrome, as becoming the cool-to-be-hated thing, it also became one of the most famous gangster films ever, despite or thanks to its flaws, who knows? Miller's Crossing is certainly better on every level, but I sure will watch The Untouchables instead, anytime.

The movie had the heart but not the passion, the instinct but not the soul. You know something is wrong when you can predict a line or a reaction, when the Mounty Police chief expressed his disagreement, I saw the You're not from Chicago coming, and even the last line, a damn good one, had the forced look on that journalist's face as if he was thinking God, what a bad-ass, that Elliott Ness! By the way, that journalist had a strange ability to point his nose at any convenient occasion until he became an annoying running gag. Still, despite some embarrassing wastes of good lines, it's easy to put that into perspective.In fact, the script sinned more on the characterization and storytelling department, it lacked that spicy something that elevates and develops both the characters and the story in a symbiotic manner. Take Elliott Ness, played by Kevin Costner, more than any inner quality, he certainly owes his appeal to his pretty boyish look and his belonging to the right side of the right side of the law at a time where most of Chicago's police officers were on Al Capone's pay-roll, and the scenes involving his wife and daughter didn't even help. His combat against Al Capone lacked this tormenting desire or internal conflict that would enrich Ness' personality and erases this 'civil servant'-type devotion to duty. At the end, he exuded a sort of naive vulnerability and 'boy-scouts' innocence, that I ended up rooting for him. He was like the kid who wanted to be the hero ... but I didn't snob the pleasure to root for him, especially the film made it clear that it didn't intend to be a masterpiece.Now, to the shadowy guy on the poster's top. The trailer starts with Robert De Niro is Al Capone, this sentence enough probably helped to guarantee half of the movie's success  one of the most respected and bas-ass actors at the peak of his career, portraying the most iconic gangster. De Niro was the 'AL'ibi for his antagonist's dull-Ness, but the trailer was still misleading. I love De Niro but he was too comical for such a serious film, and I can't think in all seriousness that he really expects us NOW to take this role seriously. I try to repress some aberrations my eyes witnessed, like a villainous grin in his face while reading the news of Ness' first flop. Though every actor is allowed to some mistakes, we can't blame everything on the script. But let's not be so severe, the movie had the villain and the hero it deserved, one over and one under the top, canceling out each other's negative effects through an improbably harmony. Both were interestingly nominated for AFI's Top 100 'Heroes and Villains' list, no need to mention that neither was selected.But these considerations hardly matter for despite all these technical faults, the movie kind of redeems itself once we mourned the masterpiece it could have been and start enjoying an innate greatness hidden beneath these campy elements. The pillar of The Untouchables is without a doubt the scene stealing performance of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone, and I don't even care of the accent. I'm not supposed to tell between Scottish and Irish accents (well I do, but he could as well have had a Cuban accent), I hate to kill my enjoyment of a film for such superficial and so-called purist issues, especially when it's not significant to the plot. Connery had the best lines, the best scenes, and was the true leader of the group. Honourable mention by the way to the other untouchables  Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace and Andy Garcia as 'George Stone.The other highlights of the film occur in many unforgettable scenes, one featuring a dinner table and the other, a train station, proving De Palma's directing ability to create suspenseful situations with the patience and talent of a craftsman. The film proved that for the depiction of cinematic violence, De Palma deserves more than a honorable mention. So I guess people went hard on his film because they expected much more, because he had everything to make a masterpiece out of the Prohibition, and avenge Once Upon a Time in America. I simply hope that those who criticize The Untouchables for being over the top, campy or laughable, start looking at Scarface with a more serious eye and realize its greatness in comparison.Anyway, if the movie is victim of the Costner syndrome, as becoming the cool-to-be-hated thing, it also became one of the most famous gangster films ever, despite or thanks to its flaws, who knows? Miller's Crossing is certainly better on every level, but I sure will watch The Untouchables instead, anytime.

It's setting is in the US but so have many of the War of the World movies been located in the US. Adaptations are just that. They are going to be the vision of the book by the screenwriter and associates. They definitely don't want to make it an up-scaled version of the first one. I am old enough I saw both of these movies at the theater. Both are equally good. The second movie is by no means garbage in any way. It is a good movie in its own right and should not be compared to the other one or the book since it is not trying to recreate the first movie nor the book on the screen and is an entirely different medium. I had a hard time getting used to Guy Pearce because frankly I had never heard of him before this movie and he is a little odd looking. He played a much more eccentric professor and wasn't portrayed as H.G. as in the first movie. I like the way they dealt with his fiancé's death. It showed that no one was at fault that it would have happened one way or another.When something is fiction, it doesn't have to relate to science fact. It is a fairytale of sorts. It extrapolates on truths. I don't try to pick apart what could or could not happen scientifically and if anyone does that, it ruins the movie. I liked that Jeremy Irons was a surprise at the ending. It was very dramatic in the way they showed him and unsuspected. This movie had much more depth to it than the first one in my opinion but it takes a few watches to really get into it. The librarian gave the movie the comedy relief it needed and I thought was a good touch to the story.As for the special effects they were outstanding to me and as just an average person I didn't notice any goofs, etc. Most wouldn't notice those types of things. I thought it was stunning and the musical score is what hit me. It is absolutely fantastic. One of the best I had heard in a long time. It should have gotten much more recognition. It takes my breath away but maybe because I majored in music. Anyone who didn't like this movie was going into the theater with their own expectations rather than just sitting back and enjoying a very entertaining movie.
