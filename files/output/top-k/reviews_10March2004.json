Maybe not his funniest but his best because there's so much more to it than the Keystone Kops kind of pratfalls that he so commonly used.Frankly I don't know how the guy did it, being so consistently humorous without using any words.  All of it depends on a story simple enough to be followed visually and on Chaplin's genius for mime and situation construction.  There ARE some words spoken on screen -- this was his last holdout against talking pictures -- but none of them involve people speaking directly to one another.  There is a song at the end with gibberish lyrics.  And the rest of the speaking is always filtered through some mechanical medium, a record player, a radio, a television set.  Charlie was accused of communism somewhere along the line and pretty much thrown out of the country, after which he lived in Switzerland.  You couldn't tell he was a Commie from this movie.  It comments on its time, of course, the Great Depression, and Charlie and Paulette Goddard are two poor people.  Management is shown as callus, playing with a jigsaw puzzle and reading newspapers while the workers slave away on the assembly line.  There is even a communist demonstration.  But it's all played for laughs.  One of those red warning flags falls off the back of a truck passing down an empty street.  Charlie picks up the flag and waves it, shouting after the truck.  As he begins to hurry after the truck, still shouting and waving, a horde of dissatisfied workers silently falls in behind him and he's arrested.  Poor people steal, but they only steal food.  If having sympathy for the unemployed is communism then roughly one American out of three was a communist, because that's roughly what the unemployment rate was.  Modern Times is no more communistic than, say, My Man Godfrey or Salt of the Earth or The Grapes of Wrath.  Besides that, Charlie is no classical Marxist.  Marxism posited a transition from false consciousness (the feeling that one's miserable poverty was due to personal failure or bad luck) to class consciousness (the realization that exploitation by the property owners was at fault).  Charlie is no activist.  He fumbles every job he gets.  The other workers are hardly sympathetic.  Charlie's not a working class hero but a black sheep.  The opening shot of the herd of sheep hurrying past the camera includes one black sheep in the middle of the flock and it's hard to imagine that this was accidental.Actually, Charlie had lost a lot of respect in America because he had an eye for young girls.  His second marriage resulted from a sixteen-year-old girl's (faked) pregnancy.  Paulette Goddard, who became his third wife, maybe and maybe not, was twenty when this movie was made, and Charlie was forty-three.  In any case -- boy, if you want to get Americans heated up just combine sex with politics.  A sure-fire winner for the puritans.  (It may have cost Goddard the part of Scarlet O'Hara in Gone With the Wind because she may have been living in sin with Charlie at the time.)I don't want to spell out too many of the gags because I don't want to spoil them but be alert for the feeding machine that goes berserk and shoves lug nuts down Charlie's throat and hits him in the face with a corn cob.  Charlie looks as if he's strapped helplessly into his seat, but his hands were free under the rotating table so that he could manipulate the fiendish devices himself.  The first time I saw this movie was in the Arts Theater on Springfield Avenue in Irvington, New Jersey.  When Paulette Goddard first appeared, the man on my right chuckled and said, Now that's a good-looking babe.  On my left, my marmorial ex laughed out loud during the feeding machine episode for perhaps the only time in her life.  There can be no higher recommendation.

Obviously, there's more to it than that but to tell more would make me a spoiler. Being French, I can't truthfully claim to understand every aspect of the story (I watched the subtitled version) and this makes writing a fair review difficult. Maybe it needs a second viewing but that might prove difficult, even without my awkward working hours.La Pianiste can be an uncomfortable film to watch at times.

Huppert's performance holds the film together, although Girardot is also very good as Erika's battle-axe mother. But for me, this film was way too slow. Very little happens for a long time and once the crunch scene appears, the film finally begins to tell its story.

Osment portrays Trevor McKinney, a seventh grader who turns a ordinary homework assignment into a mission to change the world. Kevin Spacey rebounds well from a disappointing American Beauty to take the role of Eugene Simmonette, Trevor's teacher. Spacey showed why he was the man for this role by taking the bull by the horns and tackling like it was just another day at the office. His performance screamed YES!!!!! this is the guy I want on my side because he was unafraid to to stand up for his beliefs and convictions as well as lend an ear to the problems that Trevor is facing.Osment was good in The Sixth Sense but he is deserving of an oscar for Pay It Forward because he not only touches the lives of the people he helps but those who are around him with the spirit and enthusiasm he exudes in Pay It Forward. Who would have thought a seventh grader would touch so many lives simply by completing his homework. Adding to this awesome movie is Jay Mohr, who plays the reporter following the story of this idea that Trevor has came up with. Pay It Forward is a movie that will stick in my mind for years to come because it contains the message that there are people places and ideas you can change to make the world a better place. This film also delivers hope that maybe if one does a good deed for someone they will in turn do one for someone else and may discontinue the violent acts. Pay It Forward is a credit to all the writers and director because the actors were able to deliver top performances with an outstanding script and direction.

Harley Jane Kozak is very charming as his wife and Julian Sands looks as creepy as ever in his role. Surely recommend! You can either look at it as a nice change in horror tales or you could use it to get over your own fear of spiders, maybe.

They killed off batman and now they are in the process of killing Tomb Raider with just one film. At least in Batman it took two horrible sequels to do it. Angelina Jolie stars in this film as Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones who raids tombs and jetsets around the world. Physically Angelina is perfect for the part but she can't carry this movie riddled with a bad script, campy acting, and bad directing. i don't know why Simon West was chosen to direct this because he has no experience in directing an action scene. The movie has some potential but in the end too many characters linked to Lara (Dad, and her two sidekicks, also her ex bf) ruin the movie, it should have been just a one woman show. Special effects are decents but with a bigger budget they could have been spectacular.Pros Jolie is hot.Cons Directing, Special effects, script.Bottom line Maybe sequel will improve? Potentially paramount may have killed a good franchise.

The british humor is so awful and was unappreciated. Everything was being blown to bits and yet somehow they seemed unphased. I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. It is way too unbelievable and moronic. Kids are not happy when their schools get blown up, especially when they are inside of it! Also this movie portrays little boys of being demonic little brats and teenage girls as whores. I just can't see this as nonfiction. I am not British, so maybe I am missing something here? Or maybe this movie is just plain awful. The title is really bad too, i see no hope or glory in this movie. BLAH. If someone actually liked this movie, please help me understand HOW?!
