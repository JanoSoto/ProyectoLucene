Wild Things stars Matt Dillon as Sam Lombardo, a guidance counselor at some school of some sorts (although I've never been to a school where you can learn how to sail). One of his students (Denise Richards) accuses him of rape, and his life is turned upside down. And when a second student (Neve Campbell) comes forward with a similar story, all hell breaks loose. But this is just the beginning. I have never seen a movie with so many twists and turns before. Just when you think you've got it figured out, they throw something else at you. Here's the problem. It's just too damn far-fetched. You know what I was thinking when I finished watching it? I was thinking about the O.J. trial. If you believe that O.J. was innocent, you'd have to believe that there was this huge conspiracy between the police, the District Attorney, and everyone else involved. If you believe what happens in Wild Things, then chances are you too believe O.J. is innocent. You remember The Usual Suspects? Now that was a good movie. There were twists and turns, but the story somehow seemed believable, because the people seemed believable. And the ending, although shocking at first, made sense and I at least, turned it off thinking it was the best script I'd seen in a long time. I left Wild Things thinking that the director must have known something was wrong, because I'd never seen a movie where they had to explain to you what happened during the closing credits.   Everyone is back stabbing everyone else. Cops are not who they seem to be, students aren't who they seem to be. Lawyers are never who they seem to be. Now for the good things. I love Neve Campbell (as I'm sure most men my age do), and you get to see a lot of Denise Richards, if you know what I mean. And the ladies aren't left out either, because you get to see all, and I mean all, of Kevin Bacon (he's a cop). The performances weren't all that spectacular. I never believed a word Matt Dillon was saying, and the rest of the cast just sort of phoned in their work. I did like the background music. Although the movie took place in Florida, the music made me feel like I was in New Orleans for some reason. Anyway, if you enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I certainly do, go ahead and check out Wild Things but don't expect to really like the story, because while it started out OK, by the time you get to the last 20 minutes, it all just falls apart.

I'm not so sure about the story. Not that I don't believe it was based on reality, just that there really wasn't a strong plot. It was basically a testosterone flick that went from action scene to action scene with a thread of plot to help it along. I think if there had been a little more investment in the characters and the dialogue, this would have been a great movie. As it is, it's just a really good movie.Matthew McConaughey plays Lt. Andrew Tyler. Apparently he was supposed to be commander of his own sub, but because of a lack of recommendation from his superior officer Captain Dahlgren (Bill Paxton), he will not get his own sub. It's at this point that you can tell that dialogue was not taken into consideration a lot in this script. We get the old you need to have the heart to do something you don't want to do speech that I've heard before. This means of course that this exact thing will come into play later on in the film, and something bad is going to happen to someone we're supposed to care about. Anyway, they get informed that they are going on a secret mission. A Nazi U-boat is stranded at sea, and the Americans are supposed to head out to the sub before the Germans get there, and steal an important German encoding machine known as the Enigma. With this machine the Allies will be able to intercept and understand German secret messages. However, at the end of the movie you find out something that had you known it before seeing the movie, may have slightly changed your opinion of what they were doing, and how important it really was. Anyway, it's not giving away too much to say that when they arrive at the U-boat, things go very wrong. The Americans end up on the U-boat, and need to find a way to save themselves before the Germans find out what happened.  Along with McConaughey and Paxton, Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi also star in this film. I generally am not a big fan of Harvey Keitel, but I didn't hate him in this movie. Most people probably won't even recognize Bon Jovi in the movie, but he did a good job. Overall the acting was very good in this movie. Now I have never seen the highly acclaimed film Das Boot but I understand that it's the benchmark for claustrophobic submarine films. I can say that U-571 accomplished the same goal. I felt like I was trapped inside that sub right along with the actors. It makes for a very disturbing and scary feeling while you're watching. Every time there was an explosion, I swear I could feel it in my seat (which may be more of the sound in the theater than anything else). The director, Jonathan Mostow, did a very good job of making you feel like you were part of the action. The camera movements were very first person NYPD Blue-ish with a lot of shaking cameras and close up of the sweat on the faces of the actors. I thought that some of the scenes were very tense which was exactly how you were supposed to feel.So I guess the biggest problem I had was with the plot. Yes I realize that getting the Enigma was important, but that occurred early on, and it then became a fight for survival. But I got lost trying to figure out where exactly there were, and how much danger they were actually in. At one point they say they're headed straight for Nazi waters, and then all of a sudden the movie ends. And early on they say they can't destroy the Nazi ship that's headed towards them, and then all of a sudden they think they can. Weapons seemed to come from nowhere on the ship. I felt there were a few too many holes in the story to make this a truly great film.Overall I thought for what it was, a guy film, it was really good.

Instead of trying to make the characters and backgrounds as realistic as possible they tried to give the movie more the style of a classic cartoon, at which they succeeded, so don't expect to see Manfred the Mammoth's hair move in the wind like donkey's does in Shrek. But you can expect a movie that has a great use of colours and will give you the feeling of the old cartoons from fifteen years ago.The children will love all the characters (and so will adults), especially Sid the Sloth. I have never seen a cartoon character so adorable as Sid.The story is a little too sweet and predictable but the good humour makes up for that. The many jokes the movie is rich are great, as well for the little ones as for the more mature people under us, the more adult humour is brought to us very subtle and some of the jokes will never be understood by children or the less intelligent living among us. Especially the side story of the acorn-adventures of the little saber-tooth squirrel Scrat is a lot of fun and makes sure that even in the more serious parts of the movie there is humour present.To conclude this is a great movie for everyone, the humour is as much fun for adults as it is for children.

Adam Sandler plays Bobby Boucher, a waterboy for a college football team. He's a little, well, slow and the guys on the team make fun of him for it. The hard ass coach finally fires him, and Bobby is left without his favorite thing. Water. His mama (Kathy Bates) doesn't want Bobby anywhere but at home with her, but being 31, Bobby kind of doesn't want that anymore. So he heads to the worst college football team in the area, and the coach there, Coach Kline (Henry Winkler) hires him. Mind you, Coach Kline also talks to himself, but that's another story. While on the practice field, this new team starts picking on Bobby. Coach Kline tells him he needs to stick up for himself. To focus on his anger and fight back. And we all know what happens. Bobby almost kills the quarterback by spearing him in the open field. Coach Kline tells Bobby he needs to join the team. But Mrs. Boucher forbids Bobby to play football, so Bobby has to lie to her to play. So of course Bobby's team meets his old team in the big bowl game, and I think you can guess what happens. The plot is straight forward. Nice guy gets picked on, makes some new friends with his gift of being able to play football, his new friends who were once losers now become winners, and they all make it to the championship game. Sort of reminds me of The Mighty Ducks. The reason this movie is so funny, is Adam Sandler. I remember watching him when he first started his stand-up years ago, but I never thought he'd click with the country as well as he has. He has this childish charm about him, and you can't help but laugh when he's on screen. During the movie, whenever he'd let out his little scream before pummeling the opposing player, I'd start to laugh. I also laughed out loud at Henry Winkler's ass, but I'd have to say, the funniest scene to me was the one with Lawrence Taylor. LT is running a football camp, and he has Bobby come and speak. Bobby is still a little slow, and what he basically says is to tackle the guy with the ball. So LT looks at the kids, and says something like, and kids, this is another reason why you shouldn't smoke crack! I almost fell out of my chair laughing. Lawrence Taylor telling someone not to smoke crack. I don't think Sandler could have picked a better time to release this movie, seeing as how Taylor was arrested a couple weeks before for possession of Crack. Oh mercy... Anyway, the real key to this movie was Adam Sandler. Henry Winkler had a few funny scenes, but the rest of the cast didn't do much but set up Sandler. Kathy Bates as Mrs. Boucher was just a little annoying if nothing else. And Fairuza Balk (God bless her) as Bobby's love interest didn't do much for me either. Like I said before, the plot of the movie wasn't original, so it was the performances that would help this film along. And the performances weren't all that special either, it's just the way Adam Sandler is that makes the movie funny. So overall, I found The Waterboy laugh out loud funny. But if you don't like Adam Sandler, you're not going to like this movie.

Nice guy gets picked on, makes some new friends with his gift of being able to play football, his new friends who were once losers now become winners, and they all make it to the championship game. Sort of reminds me of The Mighty Ducks. The reason this movie is so funny, is Adam Sandler. I remember watching him when he first started his stand-up years ago, but I never thought he'd click with the country as well as he has. He has this childish charm about him, and you can't help but laugh when he's on screen. During the movie, whenever he'd let out his little scream before pummeling the opposing player, I'd start to laugh. I also laughed out loud at Henry Winkler's ass, but I'd have to say, the funniest scene to me was the one with Lawrence Taylor. LT is running a football camp, and he has Bobby come and speak. Bobby is still a little slow, and what he basically says is to tackle the guy with the ball. So LT looks at the kids, and says something like, and kids, this is another reason why you shouldn't smoke crack! I almost fell out of my chair laughing. Lawrence Taylor telling someone not to smoke crack. I don't think Sandler could have picked a better time to release this movie, seeing as how Taylor was arrested a couple weeks before for possession of Crack. Oh mercy... Anyway, the real key to this movie was Adam Sandler. Henry Winkler had a few funny scenes, but the rest of the cast didn't do much but set up Sandler. Kathy Bates as Mrs. Boucher was just a little annoying if nothing else. And Fairuza Balk (God bless her) as Bobby's love interest didn't do much for me either. Like I said before, the plot of the movie wasn't original, so it was the performances that would help this film along. And the performances weren't all that special either, it's just the way Adam Sandler is that makes the movie funny. So overall, I found The Waterboy laugh out loud funny.

","genre":"Comedy, Sport"},{"date":"19 June 2002","score":"","review":"  There were a couple of slow moments, the humor was sophmoric at best, and the plot was simplistic, but it had me laughing almost all the way through. Adam Sandler plays Bobby Boucher, a waterboy for a college football team. He's a little, well, slow and the guys on the team make fun of him for it. The hard ass coach finally fires him, and Bobby is left without his favorite thing. Water. His mama (Kathy Bates) doesn't want Bobby anywhere but at home with her, but being 31, Bobby kind of doesn't want that anymore. So he heads to the worst college football team in the area, and the coach there, Coach Kline (Henry Winkler) hires him. Mind you, Coach Kline also talks to himself, but that's another story. While on the practice field, this new team starts picking on Bobby. Coach Kline tells him he needs to stick up for himself. To focus on his anger and fight back. And we all know what happens. Bobby almost kills the quarterback by spearing him in the open field. Coach Kline tells Bobby he needs to join the team. But Mrs. Boucher forbids Bobby to play football, so Bobby has to lie to her to play. So of course Bobby's team meets his old team in the big bowl game, and I think you can guess what happens.

The special effects and CGI images were very cool. John Leguizamo (who played The Clown) was funny; in fact he was the best part of the film. And the entire look of the film I liked, it reminded me of The Crow, which is one of my favorite movies. Now the bad things about Spawn. First the plot didn't make any sense to me. Spawn is a man named Al Simmons who, when alive, killed people for the U.S. government. One day he decides he wants to quit, his boss (Martin Sheen) say ok, but then doubles crosses him and kills him. Five years later Simmons comes back to life. This is where it gets a little strange. Did he come back to life? Is he dead but back on Earth for revenge? Where exactly is he? It seems like he's right around the corner from where he used to live, but it never gets explained.

When the job he thinks he's supposed to get, ends up going to a woman named Darcy (Hunt), he gets a little annoyed. That night he ends up almost killing himself by electrocution in a bathtub, but instead ends up with the amazing ability to read women's minds. This of course freaks him out, but after a trip to a family psychologist (Bette Midler) he realizes the possibilities. He decides to try and undermine his new boss Darcy and get her kicked out so he can take her job. Along the way he starts to find out what everyone really thinks about it, and he finds out he's not as well-liked as he thought. From co-workers to his own daughter, people see him as a male chauvinist among other things, and women generally don't like him. He starts to become more in tune with what women want, and starts to change and care more about the women he used to just sleep with and kick out. Soon he realizes that he's in love with Darcy, but it may be too late. He nailed a big account, but he used what was in Darcy's thoughts to get it, and she might be out of a job, unless Nick can come in and save the day.What Women Want had a lot of potential for some great comedic scenes, but instead sort of floundered between comedy and drama. Mel Gibson is a very engaging personality (as well as being my favorite actor) and could have easily made this into a very funny movie, but instead the plot went dramatic. There was a story line that dealt with one woman feeling un-wanted and considering suicide. I'm not sure what role that played in the movie, other than helping to make the film much too long. If I (or any other man) had the ability to read women's minds, I don't think my first thought would be to undermine my new boss and try and take her job. I'm not sure what my first thought would be, but it probably would include the removal of women's clothes or something.  There were a lot of things that weren't very necessary, like the scene with Marisa Tomei (who by the way has never looked worse) where Nick admits to something that isn't true. Scenes like that seemed just thrown in there, and weren't needed. The movie clocked in at over 2 hours, and could have easily been made in an hour and a half and still hit all the points it needed to hit. As much as I enjoy Mel Gibson, after a while I just kept waiting for a point to be made. As I said, Gibson is one of my favorite actors, so any movie he's in immediately gets a thumbs up. In this role he was able to use his charm and likeability well. Helen Hunt manages to play her role well enough, but I'm starting to notice that every character she plays is almost the same. Same quirky smile, same hmm, same looks. She needs to start branching out a bit more as an actress before she starts to get stale. The supporting cast was good, but not a huge part of the movie. The soundtrack was great, where else can you get Frank Sinatra, Christina Aguilera and a song named Bitch all in one movie? The idea behind the movie was a good one, but not used as well as it could have been. Had the writer and director decided exactly what they wanted the movie to be, a comedy, drama or dramedy, maybe it would have been better, but it went back and forth too much and lacked focus.   If you like Mel Gibson (even if you don't like him as much as I do), you'll like What Women Want. He's got charm to spare, and carries the entire movie on his back. It's got some funny moments, but also some serious ones. The story jumps back and forth and needed to be centered a bit more, but in the end, I thought it was enjoyable.

He starts to become more in tune with what women want, and starts to change and care more about the women he used to just sleep with and kick out. Soon he realizes that he's in love with Darcy, but it may be too late. He nailed a big account, but he used what was in Darcy's thoughts to get it, and she might be out of a job, unless Nick can come in and save the day.What Women Want had a lot of potential for some great comedic scenes, but instead sort of floundered between comedy and drama. Mel Gibson is a very engaging personality (as well as being my favorite actor) and could have easily made this into a very funny movie, but instead the plot went dramatic. There was a story line that dealt with one woman feeling un-wanted and considering suicide. I'm not sure what role that played in the movie, other than helping to make the film much too long. If I (or any other man) had the ability to read women's minds, I don't think my first thought would be to undermine my new boss and try and take her job. I'm not sure what my first thought would be, but it probably would include the removal of women's clothes or something.  There were a lot of things that weren't very necessary, like the scene with Marisa Tomei (who by the way has never looked worse) where Nick admits to something that isn't true. Scenes like that seemed just thrown in there, and weren't needed. The movie clocked in at over 2 hours, and could have easily been made in an hour and a half and still hit all the points it needed to hit. As much as I enjoy Mel Gibson, after a while I just kept waiting for a point to be made. As I said, Gibson is one of my favorite actors, so any movie he's in immediately gets a thumbs up. In this role he was able to use his charm and likeability well. Helen Hunt manages to play her role well enough, but I'm starting to notice that every character she plays is almost the same. Same quirky smile, same hmm, same looks. She needs to start branching out a bit more as an actress before she starts to get stale. The supporting cast was good, but not a huge part of the movie. The soundtrack was great, where else can you get Frank Sinatra, Christina Aguilera and a song named Bitch all in one movie? The idea behind the movie was a good one, but not used as well as it could have been. Had the writer and director decided exactly what they wanted the movie to be, a comedy, drama or dramedy, maybe it would have been better, but it went back and forth too much and lacked focus.   If you like Mel Gibson (even if you don't like him as much as I do), you'll like What Women Want. He's got charm to spare, and carries the entire movie on his back. It's got some funny moments, but also some serious ones. The story jumps back and forth and needed to be centered a bit more, but in the end, I thought it was enjoyable.

When the job he thinks he's supposed to get, ends up going to a woman named Darcy (Hunt), he gets a little annoyed. That night he ends up almost killing himself by electrocution in a bathtub, but instead ends up with the amazing ability to read women's minds. This of course freaks him out, but after a trip to a family psychologist (Bette Midler) he realizes the possibilities. He decides to try and undermine his new boss Darcy and get her kicked out so he can take her job.
