They are all dressed as Elvis as it is Elvis week. The problem is, once they get out of there... they can't trust each other as they all want the money.The story was not very original... It was similar to other robbery movies I have seen, but it was entertaining. It kept me glued to the screen. What I liked most about it was, you could not trust anyone... just when you think you trust a character, they do something that you don't really expect. I don't want to rip off a famous saying from a classic TV show... but in this case this phrase is true... Trust no-one!The casting was not great... there were some great choices, but also some mistakes. Kurt Russell is the main character. He did a fantastic job. I think he is such a great actor. He has made so many classic films. But he will never beat Big Trouble in Little China in my opinion. I love that movie. Kevin Costner is the other main character. This was a bad choice. Kevin has always been a very hit and miss actor for me. He has made some great movies and he clearly can act... but in some movies the characters just do not suit his style of acting. Unfortunately, this is one of those characters. Half of the movie he did well. He was believable in his role, but then there would be quite a few scenes where he seemed very out of place and you could tell he was acting... badly. Courtney Cox was also cast in this movie... she was a great choice. She made this just after Scream 3 and whilst she was in the middle of filming Friends. She is a good actress, and she has proved she can play straight roles as well as comedy. This was a very good performance from her. Other cast members were David Arquette, Christian Slater, Kevin Pollak & Jon Lovitz. There was also a little cameo by Ice-T... but this was another mistake. This role was not good for him. I don't really rate him as an actor anyway, but this is a film he should have stayed away from.The movie had a few comedy moments in there, but they were not laugh out loud funny. There was scene in particular which was just out of place. It did not belong in the film because it was just silly. Kevin Costner pretended to be a baseball fan... but he was dressed in this stupid costume which just didn't fit in the film at all.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Entertaining, unpredictable and fun. It is worth watching if you want a good crime chase film.Either quit smoking, or get a new lighter!For more movie reviews, please check out my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":null},{"date":"16 July 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 3000 MILES TO GRACELANDIt was quite good.I wasn't expecting too much because I had not heard much about it... even when it was first released.The film is about a gang of criminals that does an armed robbery at a casino in Vegas.

And it amazes me that I sat through a movie that long without much fuss. It was pretty nice. The LA which many outsiders never see or hear about. The east LA, the gang wars, the drugs, inmates running the prisons and rape attempt on a white prisoner. And thirteen years of twist and turns in the fortune of the three brothers and their familias as tragedy and happiness went hand in hand of a community which just wanted to live and work with dignity as some of their own went the wrong way and destroyed their careers and lives. And with much of the second half happening in the prison it needed a good genuine drama which thankfully is delivered. The prison and the stories feel real. And you feel destroyed as you see criminals getting criminalized in an institution made to reform them. Gay cooks and prisoners and racially segregated groups which ran their business from the inside in lieu of money. Attacks being planned and committed on fellow prisoners. Its all there as it takes a lot out of you to watch and absorb all this and more for more three hours. But all said and done it engrosses you for most the time and its only in the middle when not much is happening when you look at the time remaining.

Grease 2 is very ingratiating, just like Grease, but in a different vibe. The sequel just never has any chance at being as good as Grease, but still Grease 2 is such a guilty pleasure of mine. It's really not that bad. It's playful, very decent mild-mannered merriment. The songs are...so worse than the songs of Grease...let's not say that, let's say they're catchy good. I love the songs of Grease 2 even though they're not all that good, or on second thought, maybe they are good, I dunno, I do love them, I mean.....no...no they're definitely, definitely not that good. My favorite Grease 2 tunes are Back To School Again, Score Tonight, and Cool Rider. I love, love, love Michelle Pfeiffer starring and singing and performing in Grease 2. Without the worthwhile Michelle Pfeiffer there's really no telling how bad it might have got. Grease 2 is enjoyable at times though it is consistently bad, but it isn't too unsavory and it tries so good. It earns a good 5 rating wholly on its fun, lighthearted goodness, and for the presence of Pfeiffer.

It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added industry humor. It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is.A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on Old Hollywood and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something new? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd.

I watched Goodfellas and admired it but I didn't love it like other people I know do. Which is why it took me some time to get around to watching what many IMDb users consider the second best movie of all time. Personally, I wouldn't go that far but this remains an iconic movie both in terms of subject, film-making and legacy. Few movies ever achieve the same levels of influence and adoration as this movie and while I respect it enormously, I'm struggling to love it with as much enthusiasm but frankly, that's a matter of personal taste.The Godfather, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, opens with a big wedding scene in New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the family, granting his friends special favours in return for their loyalty and respect. But after an attempt on his life, Vito's eldest son Sonny (James Caan) begins to run things his way while young Michael (Al Pacino) struggles to separate his desire to remain outside his father's shadowy world and the promise of a normal life with his beloved Kay (Diane Keaton). But as things come to a violent head, Michael's loyalty to Kay is tested and he soon finds himself becoming the very thing he hoped to avoid.You don't need me to tell you how brilliantly made The Godfather is but for a newbie like me, it's a stunning film to watch. Each frame has a level of care and attention that you rarely see imbued in movies today and the extensive running time gives the film the luxury to take its time to tell the tale of a fading crime boss and his son's descent into the business. The Godfather occupies a unique world on many levels - the film never mentions the word 'mafia' although that is plainly what it is showing and with horrible authenticity as well. But there remains honour among these various criminals and by the end, Vito has gone from being a ruthless crime boss to a loving family man who'd do anything for his children and grandchildren. Performances are also faultless across the board - Brando is unforgettable as Vito but for me, Pacino delivers a masterpiece of acting. The pain and anger as he begins to embrace his father's lifestyle is etched clearly on his face and you never doubt him for an instant. He also looks really young in this (which, of course, he was) to the point of almost becoming a distraction - a bit like Robert Duvall with a full head of hair. But Coppola's direction is every bit as good - take the moment at his son's baptism with Michael renouncing Satan, knowing full well that his enemies were being gunned down elsewhere at that very moment or the assassination attempt on Vito's life, again a wonderful moment of cinema.Even the soundtrack, fuelled by mournful trumpets that emphasise the tragedy on screen, is perfect for The Godfather and there is no doubt that this is one of the best and most imitated movies of all time. So why don't I love it? Minor quibbles really - I struggled to remember who characters were, which side they were on and why they were killing other people. I also felt that the running time was slightly excessive but I can forgive Coppola for that. I doubt that I will wait as long to watch the other two films (which are ready and waiting on my Sky+ box) but for all the wonderful work in front and behind the camera, I just wish that it appealed to me more than it does. Put it down to personal tastes but if you're looking for a gangster flick then this should always be your first point of call. Ground-breaking, trend-setting movie making at its finest.

If you aren't willing to consider the youth revolution and the hippie movement of the 60s then this film isn't for you. You will just be confused and offended. This film is simply a commentary and criticism of the 'flower power' movement of the 1960s. This film compares humans to the animal kingdom. White people are cats, dogs and rabbits; the police are pigs; and the black people are depicted as crows, oppressed by everyone over years. To me the most prominent theme of the film is criticising white middle class students and the flower power movement. The young people who are anti-establishment, but when they get 30+ years old will become the establishment they are rebelling against.First off, I love how New York City is depicted in this. It depicts it as a grimy metropolis full of drugs, murder, racism, robbery, segregation, sex and police brutality. Regardless of the characters being animals and some of the violence being animated It is all so in your face that sometimes it can get too much. It is a depiction which many can argue is realistic to this date. Fritz himself is a character who is simply confused about what he actually stands for, but is disillusioned with academia and believes that real life experience is more valuable and rewarding. This quote from the film really sums up his character and the young people being criticisedYou think learning is a really big thing an' you become this big *** intellectual and sit around trying to out-intellectual all the other big ***intellectuals&#x85;One thing Fritz definitely knows he wants is as much sex and drugs as possible. Fritz indeed does live a really hedonistic lifestyle. The film is full of animated sex. The film opens with Fritz trying to get girls by playing his guitar, but then managing to 'pull' a group of them by pretending to be an intellectual. What then proceeds is an orgy in the bathtub. This definitely isn't a movie to watch with kids. Fritz really does also believe that he understands the black (crow) struggle and problems in the black (crow) community, but when his adventures take him to a black (crow) neighbourhood, Duke (a crow who befriends him) rightfully tells him that he will never fully understand the problem of racism from a black (crow) perspective as he himself is not black (a crow). Indeed Fritz is himself a criticism of white young people of the flower power movement as in the film he also starts a riot screaming 'we shall overcome' but at the end runs away when things get heated and doesn't even get involved, while his crow buddies get all the violence from police. What a douche. I reckon after this the film kinda looses its impact and gets less interesting and exciting. It's a pity they killed off Duke so quick as well, as the character had so much potential. There are also so many ideas in this film, that as a result the end product is messy and unorganised, like an overstuffed sandwich. They should have stuck to one theme and explored this in detail, though I read this film was like this due to budgetary restraints. This film as said can be argued to be as offencive as ever, especially as many who watch this probably won't 'get it'. Issues of sexuality and race are still relevant issues today, but Fritz the Cat, like many in its era explains these in a different way. I think this movie is good and historically significant, but cartoons like South Park and The Boondocks really have outdone this film now. I say this film is an important watch for anyone who is really interested and passionate about cartoons, anime, etc and wants to see a piece of history, but for regular members of the Joe public, I can't say the same.

King Creole has a great cast, great acting, a solid script and many interesting musical numbers, not to mention excellent cinematography. Without all this, it might have just been another Elvis vehicle. Look at the list of Curtiz' movies -- Yankee Doodle Dandee, Casablanca, Mission to Moscow, to name three in a row -- can you find a more versatile director? I don't think there is any Curtiz style; each is unique, in each he fits the movie to the material. His work begins in the silent era, 1912, yet King Creole epitomizes the 1950s. And Curtiz, 72, knows how to showcase the talent and energy of Elvis, presenting him as an artist. Yes, Elvis can act. There isn't a wrong note anywhere, and it is a relatively complex role. I suppose the next question the studios would have asked is whether he had the depth to play a wide range of characters. Could Elvis transform himself into someone else? That is great acting. I'm thinking of someone like Paul Newman -- or Walter Matthau. Elvis never got a chance to find out. Perhaps the studios looked at King Creole and decided not to push their luck and stick to the Elvis persona?To do good acting you need a good cast to react off of, and he had it here. We see some real chemistry and sparks flying as they interact with Elvis. Here is Matthau at his finest. This is no mobster don caricature; we see cruelty and cunning, but also rays of kindness and genuine appreciation for Elvis' talent. And who would guess that Ronnie -- Carolyn Jones -- was also Morticia in the Addams Family or Julie Rawlings in How the West was Won? I am not a big Elvis fan, though I do respect the emotional energy of his style. Those who are not familiar with Elvis should watch King Creole to understand why he was so influential.At first I was disappointed that there wasn't a broader range of musical styles displayed, given the title King Creole and the fact that Elvis's musical roots are in the black jazz and blues of Memphis, Tennessee. It appeared to be all all high octane Elvis. But then I looked closer and realized that Elvis' musical roots are, indeed, on display in the movie. Even in the slower numbers, the Elvis intensity just made them seem high octane.The only Creole influence is seen in the opening number of street vendors calling out their wares, Crawfish, similar to the Street Cries number in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. But it does set up the musical environment.The first performance number, Trouble, shows Elvis singing with a Dixieland group, but it is actually a solid blues number in a style similar to T-Bone Walker (Stormy Monday). Now this is Elvis' roots. The closest to a slow love ballad is Lover Doll in the Five and Dime, accompanied only by a bass. The closest to jazz is New Orleans, which starts slow like W.C. Handy, and shows a connection between Elvis' style and jazz, including a banjo and some Dixieland riffs. In the number King Creole, the only connection to the movie's title aside from the club's name, we see typical Elvis energy and tempo, but also some of the blues and jazz roots we saw more clearly in earlier numbers. Later, we have a somewhat gratuitous Dixieland Rock, which sounds a lot like Jailhouse Rock, and is closer to pure Elvis than most numbers here. The distinctive double clapping by Elvis that sets up the number, echoed by the band, corresponds to the sound of a car driving over a loose manhole cover. If you'd ever lived with one outside your window, you would recognize it. Don't Ask Me Why is a slow number in the style of many Fifties pop songs, and a takeoff of O Sole Mio, an old Italian song that's seen many permutations, including Elvis' later It's Now or Never.What stands out, at least to the modern listener, is the high energy, fast beat Elvis style that became so famous. But actually Curtiz does a good job of mixing styles and tempos, and of providing a sort of chronology of musical influences on Elvis in the various numbers. The range could have been a bit broader, but this was 1958 and the movie was helping to establish Elvis' musical identity. The influence of black jazz and blues is there to the observant viewer, but not fully highlighted. This was the Fifties, and displaying too much black influence would have been risky. What we do see was a actually a bold move (though setting it in New Orleans makes it more acceptable), and probably enhanced Elvis' edgy, bad boy image with the teenagers and James Dean crowd. (Now, if they had made Elvis' role truly Creole, part black and part French, that would have been ballsy for the time.)I suppose you could say the best Elvis movie is the one that was never made, the mature actor singing in a broad range of styles rock, jazz, blues, creole and ballads. It's too bad he didn't return to his musical roots in later years, as well as acting. But King Creole comes surprisingly close to providing Elvis' musical testament. In the end, Curtiz delivers not only fine acting and a fine script, but also some fine music in an assortment of Elvis' style. Once again, Curtiz fitted the movie to the material.

The range could have been a bit broader, but this was 1958 and the movie was helping to establish Elvis' musical identity. The influence of black jazz and blues is there to the observant viewer, but not fully highlighted. This was the Fifties, and displaying too much black influence would have been risky. What we do see was a actually a bold move (though setting it in New Orleans makes it more acceptable), and probably enhanced Elvis' edgy, bad boy image with the teenagers and James Dean crowd. (Now, if they had made Elvis' role truly Creole, part black and part French, that would have been ballsy for the time.)I suppose you could say the best Elvis movie is the one that was never made, the mature actor singing in a broad range of styles rock, jazz, blues, creole and ballads. It's too bad he didn't return to his musical roots in later years, as well as acting. But King Creole comes surprisingly close to providing Elvis' musical testament.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"16 July 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Sure, Elvis is the star, but the real force making it a great movie is Michael Curtiz. King Creole has a great cast, great acting, a solid script and many interesting musical numbers, not to mention excellent cinematography. Without all this, it might have just been another Elvis vehicle. Look at the list of Curtiz' movies -- Yankee Doodle Dandee, Casablanca, Mission to Moscow, to name three in a row -- can you find a more versatile director? I don't think there is any Curtiz style; each is unique, in each he fits the movie to the material. His work begins in the silent era, 1912, yet King Creole epitomizes the 1950s. And Curtiz, 72, knows how to showcase the talent and energy of Elvis, presenting him as an artist. Yes, Elvis can act. There isn't a wrong note anywhere, and it is a relatively complex role. I suppose the next question the studios would have asked is whether he had the depth to play a wide range of characters. Could Elvis transform himself into someone else? That is great acting. I'm thinking of someone like Paul Newman -- or Walter Matthau. Elvis never got a chance to find out. Perhaps the studios looked at King Creole and decided not to push their luck and stick to the Elvis persona?To do good acting you need a good cast to react off of, and he had it here. We see some real chemistry and sparks flying as they interact with Elvis. Here is Matthau at his finest. This is no mobster don caricature; we see cruelty and cunning, but also rays of kindness and genuine appreciation for Elvis' talent. And who would guess that Ronnie -- Carolyn Jones -- was also Morticia in the Addams Family or Julie Rawlings in How the West was Won? I am not a big Elvis fan, though I do respect the emotional energy of his style. Those who are not familiar with Elvis should watch King Creole to understand why he was so influential.At first I was disappointed that there wasn't a broader range of musical styles displayed, given the title King Creole and the fact that Elvis's musical roots are in the black jazz and blues of Memphis, Tennessee. It appeared to be all all high octane Elvis. But then I looked closer and realized that Elvis' musical roots are, indeed, on display in the movie. Even in the slower numbers, the Elvis intensity just made them seem high octane.The only Creole influence is seen in the opening number of street vendors calling out their wares, Crawfish, similar to the Street Cries number in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. But it does set up the musical environment.The first performance number, Trouble, shows Elvis singing with a Dixieland group, but it is actually a solid blues number in a style similar to T-Bone Walker (Stormy Monday). Now this is Elvis' roots. The closest to a slow love ballad is Lover Doll in the Five and Dime, accompanied only by a bass. The closest to jazz is New Orleans, which starts slow like W.C. Handy, and shows a connection between Elvis' style and jazz, including a banjo and some Dixieland riffs. In the number King Creole, the only connection to the movie's title aside from the club's name, we see typical Elvis energy and tempo, but also some of the blues and jazz roots we saw more clearly in earlier numbers. Later, we have a somewhat gratuitous Dixieland Rock, which sounds a lot like Jailhouse Rock, and is closer to pure Elvis than most numbers here. The distinctive double clapping by Elvis that sets up the number, echoed by the band, corresponds to the sound of a car driving over a loose manhole cover.

A complete triumph -Richard Roeper I have to admit I'm not a fan of Harry Potter films. I haven't read any of the books either and I tend to avoid films that cause a huge fan phenomenon. My friend was telling me I have been too critical towards Harry Potter and I should give it a new try and watch it again. So that's what I did. I find the atmosphere in the movie from the very beginning to the end is the best thing in entire movie. Some scenes indeed contain the same kind of magical feeling and same kind visual details as Victor Fleming's Wizard of Oz. Also the music fits into the movie very well. The first 1\/3 of the movie, where Harry Potter prepares his journey to Hogwarts, is very amusing to watch. The very detailed world and its unique, interesting characters owes very much to Wizard of Oz without a doubt. The amount of small details, like moving paintings and newspaper pictures are a joy for an eye.But then there are the downsides of the movie. The runtime of 152 minutes is just way too long. On the half way the movie made me to yawn and hope for something to happen. Also second downside is the way how all students and teachers, excluding the main characters of course, in the school feel totally unimportant. They are less alive than the moving paintings on the walls. The final and the biggest downside of the film is it's plot full of holes. It seems that teachers in the school got no interest to find out anything what what going on the school. When the killer troll breaks into the school, teachers are unable to do anything about it. Afterwards life continues like nothing ever happened. Nobody cares to wonder where did the troll come from. The same happens with unicorn scene too. It seems the teachers in the most secured school in the world wish that someone would get hurt. I guess things are more explained in the book and the book covers up the main plot holes that remain in the movie but it is still not an excuse to forgive them.Overall I find the creation of the magical world and the atmosphere are the greatest things that save the movie. I can understand the phenomenon this movie has caused in the world and I can understand calling this film as new Wizard of Oz although I do not agree with that by myself. Although this movie is not something that would touch me into the heart, it was still a pleasant movie to watch and I managed to the ending credits with a happy, good feeling.

But Gibson's hands were everywhere, the film not only serves as a biography of the character and the human hero that Wallace was but thanks to the influence of Gibson the film manages to bring out a powerful message of freedom and what it means to be free. We see it from several good dialogs between the characters throughout the film and also the powerful speech that Wallace gives before the battle of Stirling (that wasn't actually very historically accurate but was Awesome as hell).Not only in the script that Gibson put his hands and gave a beautiful message of freedom but also its magnificent direction that leaves all simply superb. His camera movements that show beautiful Scottish landscapes and scenes filmed beautifully leaving the film purely epic.Not only landscapes and scenes that its direction stands out but mainly in the excellent battle scenes. Mel Gibson can leave all the battle scenes made with a great realistic feel without overrating it, by that I mean that when the battle starts and the armies collide we really feel that we are watching true humans smashing each other.Braveheart not only manages to be the masterpiece of Mel Gibson in both direction and acting (PERFECT), but happens to be one of the most beautiful epics ever made. With a superb realistic feel without exaggeration and a beautiful message of freedom through a good writing and with a beautiful cast with terrific characters and a memorable soundtrack, Braveheart is far from perfect, but it is a magnificent epic to be remembered.

If it had of been color that detail would have been lost which would of had a huge negative impact upon the storyline. The atmosphere wouldn't feel\/appear so intense! Also the storyline is that of which cannot be matched or compared. It was a lower budget film, which was set in one room with the occasional court room or outside steps but other than that no other setting. It is mainly based on very complex yet strangely understood characters (12 angry men, 1 teenage boy) that is it and we only see the teenage boy at the beginning of the scene placement. Yet as simple as it may be it is a classic must watch film of the past century. Any film buff must see it to understand how intense old movies used to be.
