From Hell is a project that takes both of those truisms and tosses them completely out the window.  Based on an ambitious graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Eddie Campbell, From Hell (named for the signature on the Jack the Ripper letters written to the police), is one man's carefully researched theory into the eternal mystery surrounding the Whitechapel murders of 1888.   This is not a factual display of guilt or innocence, as many of the answers behind these crimes will never be known, but as theory mixed with fact, it creates with chilling detail the mood of lower-class London in the late nineteenth century, where life was cheap, bloody and oftentimes short.The Hughes brothers, noted for their stylish direction, do a very good job of creating the mood here, involving all the grunginess and hopelessness of the streets, and combining the more mystical elements of Moore's story into the crime tale.  Johnny Depp is Inspector Abberline - an opium-smoking criminal investigator that often follows up on hunches he receives during moments of hallucinatory revelation.The style of the film - dripping with violent murder of prostitutes in alleyways - leaves more to the imagination than it reveals, although the gore level is by no means light.  The vicious throat-slashes and bloody crime scenes are definitely grotesque, but most of the time we are shown the crime after the fact, letting the viewer decide how horrible the murder itself was.

The main problem I found was to follow the actions of the game football is not very easy to understand for me, as I am italian and as I had never seen an american football match in my life. The only thing I got is that the QUARTER-BACK is a main figure in the game, and a lot depends on his action... But, because of the cast, because of the director, I thought it was worthwhile to take a look and... well, I anjoyed it. The plot is very involving, the techno music is pumping in the ears, the actions (although, as said, quite difficult to follow for a beginner) are incredible, and yet beautiful to see. Adrenaline is quite high for the most duration of the movie, and, as a matter of fact, Al Pacino is dubbed by a great italian actor, Giancarlo Giannini who had a pivotal part in Hannibal with Anthony Hopkins. The matter of all this is is really America like this? Do really players hope just for as lot of money, drugs, girls, big houses and so on? Do doctors (James Woods) want to participate in such a business? What about the Hyppocratic Oath? OK, money is essential, but what about the real health of players? I admit that similar (or identical) facts may happen for italian football\/soccer, but, is this real life? Why don't they care a bit more about their future? You cannot play a dangerous sport for a lifetime, so why not store some money for a better (and much secure) future? In short is really all business? Al Pacino, in a scene, says to a player something like have fun, while you play!... That's the point, on my very opinion. Being hit and punched and so on JUST for money and for fame, is that all? Is it worthwhile? A movie is much more important when it raises some questions in the spectator's mind; Any Given Sunday also gave me some answers when in business, there are no friends, no family, no other principles that may be followed. Business is finalized to itself the more you're in it, the more you've got to take advantage from it, and continue, until you're laying down, with no power in your body and in your soul anymore. I anjoyed so much the lots of songs (not only the spoken ones, like rap, which is almost uncomprehensible for me) played during the movie, the actions in quite total silence were great, the playing of the actors very intense. It's difficult to explain my thoughts in english, but I gave a vote of 7\/10 to this movie; this should explain itself my opinion... A masterpiece for people who do not understand anything about football, who don't understand a single word of rap songs, who don't understand anything about getting into business, but like the great actions, the great actors, the great directors and the good music. I am happy I've watched this one! One more thing if you liked this movie, I strongly recommend to take a look at Remember the Titans with Denzel Washington.

I know that sounds obsessive, but I've been quite fascinated with this film and besides, I have plenty of spare time on my hands. On the basis of his first 2 films Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, Wes Anderson has become the only 90's-bred filmmaker to really earn my devotion. He's more prolific than Tarentino, more original than Guy Ritchie and more interesting than PT Anderson, so that made Royal my must-see film this year. I am not going to go into a long analyzation or critique of this film as I am sure plenty of other users on here are doing that already. Instead, I will simply say that I adore this film and give some of the reasons why. First off, the cast is magnificent. Gene Hackman carries every scene he's in with vibrance, energy and realism. Likewise, Anjelica Houston is marvelous as she makes her character endearing through her subtle performance. Then there are the two I was most skeptical of Ben Stiller and Gwynth Paltrow. Although I have always found them to be immensely talented performers, I didn't know if the could convey the depth and quirkiness that a director like Anderson would probably demand without it coming off as nothing more than insincere mugging. I was totally wrong. Stiller plays the straight man-an uptight big brother with a deep streak of loneliness that he can't seem to hide. As for Ms. Paltrow, her performance may be her best yet-with her raccoon eyes, fur coats and Izon dresses, she's equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious. But I must say that I think the movie's secret weapon (and surprise breakout performance) is Luke Wilson's Richie Tennenbaum. He finds the perfect balance of sadness, isolation and loss that made him so endearing I never felt I was watching an actor perform. And of course, Bill Murray and Danny Glover can do no wrong. Likewise, the music was perfect and this is the first (and probably only) film to feature music by 4 of my all time favorite bands, the Rolling Stones, Ramones, The Clash and the Beatles. Actually, the latter was a muzak version of Hey Jude, but it's still a Beatles song! I am not sure if I can place this film above Rushmore, but it's certainly on par with that classic. At any rate, hats off to Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson for creating what is instantly one of the most memorable films of the new century.

Actually, the latter was a muzak version of Hey Jude, but it's still a Beatles song! I am not sure if I can place this film above Rushmore, but it's certainly on par with that classic. At any rate, hats off to Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson for creating what is instantly one of the most memorable films of the new century.

Norton takes the acting honors in this one, particularly when assumes the guise of the simple-minded janitor. Angela Bassett is basically wasted here. She is a very fine actress and could have more than held her own against such formidable talent had her part been bigger. This film is also noteworthy in that there is no sex or violence to speak of and no glitzy special effects. The acting carries the film and the direction by Frank Oz keeps things moving along nicely. Imagine the challenge of directing BOTH DeNiro and Brando. The Score, although predictable, is still a very entertaining film. It's great to see Marlon Brando again. It's a pity that he deprived us of his considerable talents for so long.

We see in the film that both Batman (Michael Keaton) and the Joker (Jack Nicholson) have suffered life-changing events that effectively cause them to take on the attitudes they do.  Director Tim Burton clearly shows the moments that changed each of the character's lives. After Bruce Wayne's parents die, Wayne focuses his anger towards preventing and helping victims of violent crime.  As Batman, Wayne takes revenge on all those who commit evil to others while at the same time applying a healing balm to his own emotional wounds.  We see in Batman the idea of justice for the oppressed, an idea often expressed in the Hebrew Scriptures. Jack Napier's transformation comes after being betrayed by his boss.  The betrayal was so damaging because Napier believed he was respected and trusted by his boss.  So after Napier becomes the Joker, we see that his anger becomes his very nature.  He lives his life so that others will experience his pain. The movie is very much about coping with hurt.  In a fallen world there is pain and injustice.  Although understanding is often never found, it is important to know how to continue to live.

Much like Jed and Matt Eckert do to the invading Soviets in this movie, these two teenage brothers led their guerrilla force (which included a number of other teenagers) in wreaking havoc on the Union Army, and became legendary among the local population. Unfortunately, Frank and Jesse James are remembered less for being teenage guerrilla leaders than for the fact that after their side lost the war, their guerrilla force became the most notorious bank-and-train-robbing outlaw gang of the post-Civil War era.The second instance took place more recently on a much larger scale, when 116,000 square miles of sovereign United States territory was attacked without warning, occupied, and its 17 million people subjugated by an invading totalitarian foreign army. While I'm not aware of any teenagers commanding guerrilla forces in this instance, there were many teenagers among the thousands from the local civilian population who took up arms, and joined guerrilla units which were formed around the nucleus of survivors from the regular US armed forces which had been decimated in the initial attack. These guerrillas wreaked havoc on the occupying invaders for 3 years and kept them tied up, preventing the enemy from further conquest of other US territory, and paving the way for an eventual counterinvasion and liberation by the main US forces.I was born in what had once been that invaded US territory, where these guerrillas are still remembered and revered as great heroes; a few of my relatives were among these guerrillas. John Wayne and Tyrone Power each made movies about this period of guerrilla warfare, where they played leaders from the regular US military survivors. Apart from a pitiful general deficiency in historical knowledge among the American public, the main reason today's American public doesn't remember this invasion of its territory is that on July 4, 1946, less than a year after the Japanese invaders were defeated, that territory and its 17 million people became the independent Republic of the Philippines.Some may see RED DAWN as a right-wing fantasy.
