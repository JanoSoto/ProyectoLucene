[{"date":"7 January 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" W\/d Minghella takes Patricia Highsmith's thriller about a small-time trickster who gets a chance at a big score, and turns it into a bright, loud, Felliniesque entertainment with lots of Italian sun and glittering blue water. He adds a few extra characters, tinkers with the storyline a bit, and it plays very well for a while. Some of the tinkering seems inspired (Dickie Greenleaf, the object of Ripley's obsession, is a musician instead of a painter, which leads to a great scene in an underground jazz club), and the setup is quite involving as long as it stays open-ended. After Ripley makes his move, however, the film starts to lose momentum, and pretty soon, in the words of a great director, you've got a dead shark on your hands&#x85; Minghella doesn't do much with the psychological aspects of Highsmith's novel&#x97;sociopath, psychopath, homeopath, seems like it's all the same to him. There's one last brilliant sequence, worthy of Hitchcock, in which Ripley turns up twice at the same café, once as himself, once as Dickie G., within the space of a couple of minutes. After that, I'd suggest watching with one finger poised above the Stop button. We stayed with it to the end, and we were sorry we did. The Italian locations have rarely looked lovelier; performances are all first rate; Gwyneth's big scene toward the end doesn't really work, but I don't think that's her fault.

Don't get me wrong. The full uncut doesn't mean that gore was left out in other versions because there isn't any which is normal for a flick from that era but the flick had a few problems when it was released in 1922.But first before watching this cult classic you have to know something about F. W. Murnau, the director. He was chosen because he had an occult background. The producer Albin Grau was an occultist and both added some occult to spot throughout this flick. Just watch the symbols on the papers which were filled with Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols. Or the use of shadows to be believed that they brought you to another dimension. In fact, they made a company alive Prana to bring out this rip-off of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Although the critics adored this flick it became a big failure at the box office and resulted in bankruptcy. The reason was that no money came in but that the wife of Stoker sued Prana for using the script of Dracula as base of Nosferatu. It resulted in the fact that all copies had to be destroyed in which they did but luckily for us, some copies were already out of Germany in private hands but not all in good shape. So different version popped up after years until a few years ago when they discovered scene's on a French film. They restored the flick in full glory with the original soundtrack and German intertitles, upscaled in 1080p and 5.1 score and I must say, it looks great.The flick itself is a bit slow in some parts but is still worth watching to see the effects used. Back then it wasn't that easy to do editing effects but they did and it works out fine. Just watch Nosferatu coming out of his grave. It still looks eery. It's not only the atmosphere that makes it a classic but also the performance by Max Schreck. Rumours wer all around that in real life Max was a vampire. A classic and a must see for all horror buffs.Gore 0\/5 Nudity 0\/5 Effects 5\/5 Story 3\/5 Comedy 0\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 January 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have seen this one a few times but now that it is out on Blu Ray it is finally out full uncut.
