Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn and Ethan Embry are all great. The story itself is the best part of this film and really says a lot about being in a band. Ain't no way to keep a band together, bands come and go. You gotta keep on playin', no matter with who. This movie is great.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the story of Eddie Valiant, a detective who was once famous for tackling 'toon cases along with Teddy, his brother and partner. However, he slips into a life of alcoholism and odd PI jobs after Teddy dies at the hands of a 'toon. But everything changes for Eddie when he is hired by R.K. Maroon, a cartoon studio executive, to investigate some funny business (no pun intended) involving 'toon star Roger Rabbit and his wife Jessica.This film is a marvel, both artistically and technologically. Its special effects still hold up today, 20 years after the film's initial release. If this were all Who Framed Roger Rabbit had going for it, that would be pretty amazing. However, the film also has spot-on performances and a great story and script. A film with such artistic *and* technical merits is really something special.For me, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is also amazing because of how differently I have been able to see it over the years. When my 5-year-old self first saw it on its initial home video release, I loved the colorful world of Toontown, Roger's antics, and seeing my favorite cartoon stars side-by-side in the same movie. (Donald and Daffy in the same scene? That was heaven!) I did, however, run and hide from certain scenes later in the movie that I do not want to spoil for those lucky souls who still have yet to see this. As an adult now, I still love the movie as entertainment, but I can also appreciate all the work that went into its creation. It only takes a viewing of the DVD's special features to see that making this film was a painstaking process. Not to mention, in this age of computer animation, realizing that all the animation in this film was done by hand! Wow! Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a technological marvel, an artistic triumph, and an extremely entertaining film. Highly recommended, especially for animation lovers.

It is a strong story with American financial backing, yet still a very Japanese film.Kagemusha is a Japanese word meaning both Shadow Warrior or the Double this tell you a lot about the plot before you start. The film starts with the recruitment of a kagemusha to a leading Japanese warlord. He was a theft who was about to be cruifixed when the brother, Nobukado, of the warlord saves him and trains him to be like Lord Shingen. It then gives you a brief synopsis of the situation in Japan in 1573, where three warring clans were verging for power and trying to rule of the whole of the nation. Lord Shingen's factor was the strongest and was in the middle of siege of Kyoto, the capital at the time. But during the siege Shingen is fatally shot and his dying wish was to retreat, forget the dream of ruling Japan and hide his death from the public for three years. This is when the Kagemusha is brought into play, but even he doesn't know that Shingen had died. He only finds out when he goes back to his old ways. But he still offers himself, to help protect the domain. When they return to Shingen's castle the Kagemusha has to fool the people, and even Shingen's grandson and mistresses. Nobukado has to cover for the Kagemusha saying he suffered an illness and teaches him how the court works and act like the dead warlord. In the middle of this the rival factors attack the domain, wondering what was happening in the court because they were confused about whether Shingen was dead or not and why his army retreated. There are also enemies within the court with Katsuyori, Shingen's son, who was no longer the heir, and was replaced by Shingen's grandson. He still lives under his father's shadow and wants to prove himself. He is also not happy that he has to call a theft father.The basic plot isn't new, but Kurosawa has the great ability of making it well. It has a strong script behind it with some excellent dialogue, it doesn't not matter that it's in Japanese. The acting is superb, especially from Tatsuya Nakadai who played Shingen\/Kagemusha. They was also an interesting look at the court of a Japanese warlord and the politics of the time. The power-plays were interesting and it added some complexities to the plot. Kurosawa knows how to do it. Kurosawa is also an excellent visual director and they were some truly great shots. One shot that I really liked was the army marching during the sunset and all you get to see is the silhouettes of the soldiers. They are some nice shots as well in the Japanese mountains, showing the beauty, but also the harness of terrain. My only real criticism is that the war scene could have been better. They was well done, and the troops did look authentic, but at times it was a little hard to follow (espeically the night scenes) and the film could have shown more. But they are some gems within those scenes.I recommend this film.

That is the tag line on the DVD cover that Disney put on the cover of 'The Happy Millionaire' to try and entice potential viewers. What's wrong with that?I got this film from the library expecting a regular normal comedy. But instead I got a musical. I like musicals but was surprised because I wasn't expecting it. What's wrong with that? It is not a musical classic and a minor Disney classic if it is at all. It has the same type off charm that 'High School Musical' has. The songs aren't all that memorable but the characters have such fun singing them, that it is at least fun to watch. What's wrong with that? The dancing is fun to watch to. There is something always fun about watching people break out into song when they could just as easily said what they wanted to say without singing. It is so unlike real life where boring people just talk to one another with out music coming from nowhere to liven up their lives. This is the type of picture that if you watched often enough you would grow to really like it. It's likable as it is, but maybe not enough to watch it again. The film has some fun things in it, such as Fred MacMurray. He is amusing as a 'happy millionaire', the founder of Biddle Boxing and Bible School, who owns of all things, pet alligators.

James Bond. Then bang!, straight into the credits and one of the coolest and most exciting theme tunes of the series.Daylights is perhaps the quintessential Bond movie, as it contains elements of everything; the serious, Cold War espionage thrills of the 60's movies; the silliness and comedic set-pieces of the 70's movies; the John Glen-ness of the 80's obviously; the larger-than-usual emphasis on romance and romantic atmosphere of On Her Majesty's Secret Service; and the beginnings of the fleshing out of Bond's character which continued into the Brosnan and Craig movies.And it executes all of this with hardly a misstep. Dalton hasn't the way with witticisms Moore provided, but the suggestion that he is merely a miserable, broody Bond is misplaced. His Bond does glower and seethe with resentment at times, he also displays happiness and every other emotion. Dalton's Bond also smiles more than any other Bond. And most of the other actors simply smiled ironically at suggestion of a sexual conquest, Dalton's Bond is far more genuine with his emotion.The movie does very little wrong, but although very story-based, lacks a strong forward momentum. It's quite leisurely, even the final act feels like, Well, where shall we go next? The film also lacks the strong sense of danger that the best entries do. Henchman Necros is more believable than your Jaws or Oddjob, but completely lacks the threat they provided. It also doesn't help that he is set up as a super-assassin in the first fifteen minutes, then does nothing until his fight with Bond in the finale.As for the other bad guys, though they have been criticised as weak and forgettable, I quite like them on this viewing. They are smart, scheming criminals, independent of any country or criminal organisation, it makes them quite unique. Brad Whitaker with his plan, ultimately, is most comparable to Auric Goldinger. His obsession with war is a Fleming-worthy character trait, and the waxworks of himself as major historical warriors was clever suggestion of an unbalanced mental state. Also great is the way he rips the legs off his lobster with a complete lack of self-awareness or grace. He's a greedy, childish brat in a man's body. Koskov is annoying, a semi-comedic foil who one senses at the end was intended to appear in the series again.Bond girl Kara is perhaps a little lightweight in the sexy stakes, but she is a more rounded character than usual, and Maryam d'Abo comes across very sweet and genuine. Unfortunately some old-fashioned, this girl is useless at everything, humour of the early 70's Bond movies creeps in, but it's forgivable. Her swift rise from being a member of the orchestra to having a world tour is somewhat naive and unnecessary, especially as there seems to be no reason for it. Nevertheless, one of the better Bond girls.TLD has some of the best action of the series, including a perfectly executed opening sequence on a jeep, the gadget-laden Aston Martin chase, the battle hanging out of the aeroplane (which is still jaw-dropping), and the final shoot-out with Whitaker. Glen's action direction has less punch than in his first effort, For Your Eyes Only, but his skill with tension and sudden shocks (the monkey, the dove, Bond almost getting shot after killing Whitaker) is evident as always.Mention must also go to one of John Barry's most evocative scores, and the cinematography which really captures the exotic feel of the numerous locations involved. TLD feels like one of the most globe-trotting and global Bond movies, especially compared to the following movie, which was centred in the Americas.As Licence to Kill took a different turn for the series, The Living Daylights feels like the last 'classic' Bond movie (partly due to the fact that John Barry did not contribute again).

However, truth is, it really isn't that great of a movie (but is by no means as bad as many other sci-fi films of the era).The plot is routine giant bug - strange things happen, lots of talking with a few quick shots of the creature thrown in, and the last act which is all monster (and pretty short in length).Only thing is, in Tarantula there is a LOT of talk. A REAL lot. And almost all of it is dull.They throw in a very pretty girl scientist to try to make viewers not fall asleep, as well as a few deformed people. But truthfully the entire first hour of this movie is almost nothing but gabbing.When the giant monster finally does his thing in the film's last act, there are some genuinely cool FX shots. But the final destruction of the creature (not really a spoiler, you had to know they are going to kill it) happens so fast towards the end, you can't help but feel very disappointed.There are a few unintentionally funny moments, such as when the music swells to a bombastic level when a deformed character lifts his head and you see his face. You also can't help but laugh as the bug peers through a window at the girl getting ready for bed. Who knew Tarantulas were so horny? The tarantula itself is pretty cool though, although the ending, however quick, is brutal and you end up feeling sorry for the thing. After all, it's not his fault. And the filmmakers give him a cool roar to help him out.Best way to watch this one is to fast forward all the non-spider scenes, because they really don't matter.

I made a point of viewing it again recently to see if my first impression held up.The bad news is that the actual plot of BEST YEARS veers a bit into soap opera territory. The story is a little mechanical in its attempts to cover as much of the post-WWII experience as possible (and somehow work Hoagy Carmichael into the mix). The good news is that the characters are so damn good that the semi-hokey plot doesn't matter.This is a great American movie, remarkable for its realism and lack of sentimentality. Particularly remarkable was Harold Russell, whose portrayal of double-amputee Homer Parrish was believable and very moving. One of my favorite scenes in this movie is the one where Homer is headed to bed, and needs his father to help take off his prosthetic hands and button his pajama top. There is almost no dialogue, and no dramatic swell of the music, just a quiet, honest, matter-of-fact scene.Some of the details intrigued me. The Stephensons slept together in a double bed--a big no-no in those Hayes-code days--but you never actually saw Mrs. Stephenson there. Other commenters have mentioned here the themes of divorce and domestic discord that were all-but-unheard of at the time.I love that Myrna Loy played a great supporting role in this drama as Millie Stephenson, AND had played Nora Charles in THE THIN MAN, among my favorite comedies. Clearly, a versatile talent.Other films have tried to capture the experience of the returning American veteran, but this is probably still the best.

Caeser is involved with the mob, and is laundering the huge sum of money for them. The money belongs to the mob, and Caeser must turn it over to them, after laundering it.Their neighbor, named Corky (played with flinty perfection by Gina Gershon), is a lesbian ex-con. Corky is a plumber. She's doing some repairs in an apartment, which is right next to Violet and Caeser's place.Tired of the violent, criminal world that she's been a part of through Caeser, Violet wants a fresh start. She soon winds-up seducing Corky, and enlists Corky's help in a scheme to steal the millions in cash from Caeser. Having fallen for Violet, Corky agrees to help her steal the cash from Caeser, then set him up to make him appear to be the culprit. Corky tells Violet how dangerous it is to risk stealing from the mob, and that their plan has to be fool-proof. Their brilliant plan goes well-at first. But it starts to unravel, and then the thrills really begin. From then on, the film features harrowing plot-twists, and plenty of nail-biting suspense.The acting in this film, was top-notch.

When this film was made, lesbian characters were beginning to turn-up in mainstream movies, in larger numbers than ever before.

The stupidity of the characters in general brings many of the laughs, though I mostly laugh at the ridiculous and absurd situations, such as building a phony replica of the town, the singing of a bogus hymn in church, or the gathering of all the great warriors for battle toward the end. The scenes on the various movie sets, which I won't give away by describing in detail, are some of the funniest ten minutes I've ever seen on film. Cleavon Little is perfectly cast as the sheriff, and Gene Wilder is nearly as good as he was in Young Frankenstein. Madeline Kahn, in her Oscar-nominated role, is very funny as usual.
