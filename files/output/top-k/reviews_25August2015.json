[{"date":"25 August 2015","score":"","review":" There are two ways you can watch this. You either expect a spooky film with cannibals or a film with the embodiment of courage, fear, and bravery. There is definitely a stronger, deeper meaning to it that most people overlook... If you're expecting a war film or a horror, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. It's so unique and distinct... it's just a fresh dose of...something. I adore the film so much and the nostalgia it holds, I have a quote from it tattoo'd on me. If you want to know the quote, I will put it at the very end of my review with a spoiler warning. Back on topic...If you allow yourself be absorbed, there are some scenes that definitely arouse panic and curiosity... I don't think there could have been any better actors for this film. Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle collide in this movie like PB&J! Another thing, the soundtrack is absolutely ASTOUNDING. A mixture of folk, bluegrass, and classical. Some songs are triumphant and it always brings a tear to my eye. The music FOR SURE enhances the experience. (NON SPOILER) For the negative things I have to say, there are a good amount blunders and factual errors. I won't give any spoilers out, you'll have to watch it yourself (maybe multiple times to notice the mistakes). It would be a 10\/10 but I give this a film a 8\/10 because of it's mistakes and because I personally feel it would have been better if it was a Spaghetti Western AND because I feel like some of the actors (David Arquette, Guy Pearce, and Jeffrey Jones to be specific) could have done a better job... I know earlier, I stated, I don't think there could have been any better actors, ...That still rings true, but the acting itself... these men performed exceptionally well, but don't act vicariously in their roles as authoritative figures... If that didn't make sense, here's another way to explain... MINOR SPOILERS...I don't believe a realistic colonel would act as goofy\/lighthearted as Colonel Hart did. And I don't believe a realistic private would act like a jerk fresh out of boot camp (Private Reich). Other than that, I am emotionally attached to this dainty film... It's very precious to me... SPOILER...Morality; the last bastion of a coward. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 August 2015","score":"","review":" There are two ways you can watch this.
