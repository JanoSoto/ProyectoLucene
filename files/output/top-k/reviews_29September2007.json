I must confess, I'm not too familiar with the cartoon. I did see it a bit during my childhood (reruns in the '90s), but have very little memory of it. I had never heard of this movie until a couple years ago, as my last year of high school was drawing to an end. I got to see the first little bit of it in one of my classes, when we had no work to do. Eventually, it was interrupted by a fire drill, and by the time we were allowed back inside, the class was over. Two years later, out of curiosity, I have finally watched the whole thing, but it wasn't much fun.Officer John Brown is a security guard who is severely injured in an explosion, after a failed attempt to catch the evil Sanford Scolex! Fortunately, Dr. Brenda Bradford, who specializes in robotics, manages to save him by inserting cybernetic components into his body. This is how he gets the name, Inspector Gadget, and with his new robotic functions, he becomes a police officer, which is a dream come true for him! However, many problems ensue for Inspector Gadget with his new functions and job. He must now battle Sanford Scolex (or The Claw), and stop him from carrying out his evil plans with stolen cybernetic components, but this will obviously be a challenging for Gadget, and sometimes, it may seem hopeless! In addition to that, the cybernetic cop finds that his gadgets don't always work! Many criticise this movie for how much it differs from the animated series that preceded it. Like I said, I'm not that familiar with the cartoon, so I can't point out any major differences, apart the one you obviously already know, one is animated and the other is live action. However, knowing how people have complained about many differences, I can't deny it, and can see why a fan or former fan of the show wouldn't be too pleased about it. Basically, I'm just going to have to focus on 1999's Inspector Gadget as a film. As a comedy, it's not very funny at all, in my opinion (I didn't laugh, or ever smile once). No horrendous gags, but no remotely funny ones, either, and some of them might be just a tad annoying, such as Gadget reaching out and accidentally grabbing the guru in a VERY uncomfortable place while blindfolded (in fact, as a guy, I found this a tad disturbing), and the scenes with RoboBrenda. Unfortunately, there's nothing to make up for this.This 1999 adaptation of the popular '80s cartoon show is, by definition, a kids' movie, and as such, I guess it's not so bad. However, for anything else other than a kids' movie, I suggest you forget about this version of Inspector Gadget, regardless of what you may think of the cartoon series, or how familiar you are with that show. In my opinion, Gadget grabbing the guru in the most uncomfortable place is the most memorable part, but in a bad way. I doubt too many of us guys could forget that scene, as much as I'm sure many of us would want to! Apart from that, most of the movie is forgettable. If you want a Disney flick that can captivate many kids and adults alike, there are lots of those, but this is not one of them.

I can miss some of it on a fridge run, come back to it, and still follow it. In fact, if I don't finish the movie, it doesn't seem to matter. However, it is charming, so I usually do.The movie pokes fun at the super rich on a superficial level, but that's all right. I'll save the harshly critical movies for a different mood. There's some lovely views of the Biltmore estate. There's light ribbing of the corporate world. Oh dear, I'm falling asleep. I'll miss the end of the movie. Too many brewskies.

Yes, he likes planes, but how many kids, in the middle of a crowd hysteria scene are gonna be playing with a toy plane rather than trying to escape like everyone else?

The monster is dead now, and so is his creator, Dr. Frankenstein. Frankenstein's son Wolf (Basil Rathbone) comes to town to claim his legacy, but it is a more involved legacy than he knows, as the troublemaking Ygor (Bela Lugosi) makes clear. Ygor knows more about the fate of the monster (Boris Karloff) than anyone else, but sharing this knowledge with Wolf comes at a steep price.I almost titled this review Bela Basil and Boris Oh My until I realized that shortchanges the best performance in the film, Lionel Atwill's as Inspector Krogh. Atwill is at the heart of what makes Son Of Frankenstein a good film, his Krogh a figure of both menace and warmth who makes us care a little more about the victims of the monster's crimes than the more cynical if stylish earlier installments did.Son Of Frankenstein has style, and sparks of humor, but it also tells a story. Director Rowland V. Lee lacks the polish of the man behind the earlier Frankenstein films, James Whale, but he at least takes the horror more seriously than Whale did in Bride of Frankenstein, a legendary film that doesn't hold up to inspection.Son, however, does; working the mood of overwhelming dread from the first moments in. Wolf sits with his wife on a train passing a countryside of barren trees enfolded with fog, wondering where his noble father went wrong.Why nine out of ten people call that misshapen creature of my father's experiments... Frankenstein! calls out a conductor, announcing that the town of Frankenstein is the next spot.Like other posters here, I'm impressed by Lugosi's subtlety and humor, playing Ygor not as a diabolical maniac so much as twisted by his own isolation, not to mention the hanging that broke his neck but left him curiously alive. They died...dead! he cackles, regarding the men who sentenced him to die. I died...live! Rathbone is by turns hammy and effective, but the real loss here is Karloff, playing the Monster for the last time. Except for one scene where he catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror, and another near the end where he menaces Wolf's young son, Boris is very much a third wheel in the proceedings. It's good he doesn't repeat the mistake of talking from Bride, but he seems to lose a spark of his otherworldly light in the transition back to the hulking brute of Frankenstein.There is also patness at the heart of the story, involving unsolved murders in the village of Frankenstein. We never really rekindle the existential menace of the original Frankenstein, but in its place we do get a story of real human warmth, between Wolf and his family, Wolf and Krogh, even the Monster and Ygor. While not a classic, Son is a singular treat, combining storyline, atmosphere, and characterization in such a way as to make it a model for classic monster movie making.Just ask Mel and Gene.

Maybe it would be a different perspective had I seen it when I was little- frankly I'm not sure why I missed it, as I liked the cartoons and liked Robin Williams- but now as an adult Popeye is one crazy kind of movie. It's a work that is all its own, even as it looks way too derivative of bad kids musicals and second rate slapstick. But there's 'something' to Popeye, I can't quite put my finger on it, and it's due more than likely to Robert Altman. Some have said the film's a masterpiece (I wouldn't go that far), while some say it's a travesty (I wouldn't go there either). One thing is for certain under a different director, either more mainstream or of a more high-velocity action-movie kind of filmmaker, Popeye wouldn't look and feel this way. Yet Popeye turns out to be satisfying because Altman does what any of the exceptional directors- Sam Raimi, Tim Burton, Guillermo Del-Toro, Richard Donner- who've adapted comic books do, as he captures the spirit of the source in a specific style suitable for the director. It's far from being any great work of art, but I'd dare anyone else to make a Popeye film as joyful and buoyantly crazy as this.And maybe such an idiosyncratic director like Altman- who as Gary Trudeau once said is a great director of 'scenes'- could translate such simple little diddies like Popeye stories. There are no big arcs to follow or a whole host of villains that Popeye must thwart; the only story is that Popeye (Robin Williams) comes to Sweet Haven looking for his Pappy, only to find that he's something of an outsider among the town's multiple eccentrics, meets and sort of falls for Olive Oyl (Shelly Duvall), and gets into hot water with Bluto (Paul L. Smith) while trying to protect a baby named Swee'pea. The rest of the picture is like a big ball of impressions taken from the original strip, and a little from the cartoon (sorry, folks, not much spinach until the climax). But what Altman also goes for is the manic side of Sweet Haven, how many rules there are with the guy who fines you for every little thing (unless you're Olive Oyl for some reason), and bullies seem to be right at the Burger joint on the mark. Luckily there's not too much overlapping dialog like in his other films, otherwise it might get cluttered- that is, if it isn't already.Did I mention it's a musical? And not a great musical by any stretch. I'd imagine it wasn't Altman's intention- maybe more Robert Evans, or whomever, maybe Disney- to make this film a musical, least of all like this, where the ratio is split down the side half the songs are actually pretty catchy, or at least performed well (He Needs Me, which Olive Oyl sings and was used in Punch-Drunk Love recently, is probably my favorite after the original theme song), and the others are just bad, dead weight (the song that Popeye sings as he writes a letter to Swee'Pea and brightly hued images of Swee'Pea pop up, is atrocious, as is Pappy's number when he's tied up). Yet somehow the songs don't detract a whole lot from the rambunctious attitude to comedy. Sometimes it might be something unintentional, like a line from Williams as he mutters a throwaway jab or observation that's a riot. Or the physical pratfalls, mostly expected like Olive's clumsiness or Bruto's BIG anger in the house enraged at waiting for Olive, that do connect.It's this cheerfully mad attitude that keeps Popeye from becoming a total warp of a kids movie, where watching Popeye go to work on a Oxblood Oxheart in a boxing match is beautifully choreographed to the wacky comic-book mentality. The only danger in all of this then is to consider whether much of this is funny because it genuinely is, for a family movie anyway, or if it's just so corny that you can't help but laugh. It's not a Howard the Duck scenario, of course, but there are times when it is, frankly, stupid stuff Altman's dealing with here, and ironically photographed in mostly great compositions from Giuseppe Rotuno (yes, of 8 1\/2 fame) and with wonderful production\/costume designs. Where else will I see an animatronic pelican and (a totally spot-on) Shelly Duvall getting dragged underwater by a rubber octopus, least in an Altman film? Or Robin Williams with fore-arms larger than his head? Could it be a guilty pleasure? If it is, then damned if it isn't one of the sunniest and most delirious of the 80s. Well, blow me down!

I'd imagine it wasn't Altman's intention- maybe more Robert Evans, or whomever, maybe Disney- to make this film a musical, least of all like this, where the ratio is split down the side half the songs are actually pretty catchy, or at least performed well (He Needs Me, which Olive Oyl sings and was used in Punch-Drunk Love recently, is probably my favorite after the original theme song), and the others are just bad, dead weight (the song that Popeye sings as he writes a letter to Swee'Pea and brightly hued images of Swee'Pea pop up, is atrocious, as is Pappy's number when he's tied up). Yet somehow the songs don't detract a whole lot from the rambunctious attitude to comedy. Sometimes it might be something unintentional, like a line from Williams as he mutters a throwaway jab or observation that's a riot. Or the physical pratfalls, mostly expected like Olive's clumsiness or Bruto's BIG anger in the house enraged at waiting for Olive, that do connect.It's this cheerfully mad attitude that keeps Popeye from becoming a total warp of a kids movie, where watching Popeye go to work on a Oxblood Oxheart in a boxing match is beautifully choreographed to the wacky comic-book mentality. The only danger in all of this then is to consider whether much of this is funny because it genuinely is, for a family movie anyway, or if it's just so corny that you can't help but laugh. It's not a Howard the Duck scenario, of course, but there are times when it is, frankly, stupid stuff Altman's dealing with here, and ironically photographed in mostly great compositions from Giuseppe Rotuno (yes, of 8 1\/2 fame) and with wonderful production\/costume designs. Where else will I see an animatronic pelican and (a totally spot-on) Shelly Duvall getting dragged underwater by a rubber octopus, least in an Altman film? Or Robin Williams with fore-arms larger than his head? Could it be a guilty pleasure? If it is, then damned if it isn't one of the sunniest and most delirious of the 80s. Well, blow me down!

Maybe it would be a different perspective had I seen it when I was little- frankly I'm not sure why I missed it, as I liked the cartoons and liked Robin Williams- but now as an adult Popeye is one crazy kind of movie. It's a work that is all its own, even as it looks way too derivative of bad kids musicals and second rate slapstick. But there's 'something' to Popeye, I can't quite put my finger on it, and it's due more than likely to Robert Altman. Some have said the film's a masterpiece (I wouldn't go that far), while some say it's a travesty (I wouldn't go there either). One thing is for certain under a different director, either more mainstream or of a more high-velocity action-movie kind of filmmaker, Popeye wouldn't look and feel this way. Yet Popeye turns out to be satisfying because Altman does what any of the exceptional directors- Sam Raimi, Tim Burton, Guillermo Del-Toro, Richard Donner- who've adapted comic books do, as he captures the spirit of the source in a specific style suitable for the director. It's far from being any great work of art, but I'd dare anyone else to make a Popeye film as joyful and buoyantly crazy as this.And maybe such an idiosyncratic director like Altman- who as Gary Trudeau once said is a great director of 'scenes'- could translate such simple little diddies like Popeye stories. There are no big arcs to follow or a whole host of villains that Popeye must thwart; the only story is that Popeye (Robin Williams) comes to Sweet Haven looking for his Pappy, only to find that he's something of an outsider among the town's multiple eccentrics, meets and sort of falls for Olive Oyl (Shelly Duvall), and gets into hot water with Bluto (Paul L. Smith) while trying to protect a baby named Swee'pea. The rest of the picture is like a big ball of impressions taken from the original strip, and a little from the cartoon (sorry, folks, not much spinach until the climax). But what Altman also goes for is the manic side of Sweet Haven, how many rules there are with the guy who fines you for every little thing (unless you're Olive Oyl for some reason), and bullies seem to be right at the Burger joint on the mark. Luckily there's not too much overlapping dialog like in his other films, otherwise it might get cluttered- that is, if it isn't already.Did I mention it's a musical?

The result isn't as disappointing as Part 2, but it does have quite a few dumb moments which unfortunately mar what could have been a very enjoyable dinosaur romp.Jurassic Park III sees Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) returning to real live dinosaur territory after a couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leone) convince him to be their guide on a flyover of Isla Sorna. However, the sightseers have a hidden agenda they are really on a mission to find their son, who was lost in the area a couple of months earlier, and they are determined to land on the island...This simple set up means that it doesn't take long before everyone is running for their lives, pursued by raptors, T-Rex, and new lizard-on-the-block, Spinosaurus.As you would expect from a Spielberg produced flick, this one features top-notch digital and animatronic effects, coupled with plenty of impressive action set-pieces. The film sure looks great, but one can't help but wish that as much attention had been paid to the script as to the visuals.Sometimes it's hard to keep a straight face try not to roll your eyes in disbelief as Grant goes Dr. Dolittle on us and speaks 'raptor' using a 3D model of their 'voicebox'; attempt not to smirk when a ringing telephone swallowed by the Spinosaurus warns the survivors of the creature's impending appearance; and I guarantee you'll laugh when a boy is snatched away from hungry baby pteranodons in the nick of time... by a base-jumping paleontologist in a hastily packed parachute (which he found hanging from a tree!).Before you know it, the whole film is over, wrapped up with a silly rushed ending that seems plucked out of nowhere.However, because my expectations were much lower with Johnston behind the camera than with Spielberg, I actually didn't feel quite so let down by JP3 as I did with The Lost World. In fact, at times I was able to just switch off my brain and enjoy it for the above-average dumb monster packed spectacle that it is.6.5\/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.
