[{"date":"13 February 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" By 1930, the silent era was coming to a rapid end. All doubters thinking that the 'talkie' craze would not last were having a wake-up call, and silent geniuses such as Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin, were potentially seeing their highly successful careers melting away. Chaplin began work on City Lights back in 1928, yet a troubled and stressful shoot caused production to run until 1931, when Hollywood had all but given itself over to the new talkie era. Refusing to let go of his most famous creation, The Tramp, Chaplin endured with his vision and kept City Lights silent, seeing no hope for his beloved character in sound pictures. Chaplin shot sporadically, seemingly around one central, and very simple, idea, and managed to create his greatest work, and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time.After a chance encounter with a poor, blind and humble flower girl (Virginia Cherrill), The Tramp falls in love. Smitten, he sits down by the sea where a drunk and eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers) is trying to commit suicide. The Tramp opens the millionaire's eyes to life's simple wonders, so the millionaire treats him to life's luxuries, getting him extremely drunk in the process. After a memorable night, the millionaire sobers up and throws the Tramp out, where he spies the flower girl being visited by a doctor. Desperate to make money for her, he takes a job a street sweeper and gets involved in a winner-takes-all boxing match. Yet everywhere he goes, the drunk millionaire is there ready to whisk him off on another wild night.The juxtaposition of the two central stories in City Nights is relatively strange in terms of relevance to the narrative. The film is clearly a romantic one, which makes it peculiar when it repeatedly cuts to the Tramp's escapades with the millionaire. But Chaplin seems to have incorporated this for two reasons, and two aspects that Chaplin is remembered and adored for - comedy and social commentary. This is Chaplin's most laugh-out-loud film, with the standout being the scene in which the Tramp and millionaire, both highly intoxicated, arrive at a formal party. The Tramp walks across the dance floor, slipping in unfamiliar shoes, trying desperately to stay on his feet. It's a five- second gag, but for me it incorporated all of Chaplin's breathtaking physical ability and subtle energy. Every moment seems like an endless maze of possibilities for Chaplin, squeezing instants of virtuoso out of simple things like lighting a cigar or eating spaghetti.The Great Depression had recently struck the country, and Chaplin uses City Lights as a gloomy insight to the lives of the people hit by poverty. The blind flower girl seems to have nothing, yet is rich in soul and spirit that the Tramp is uncontrollably drawn to. The millionaire is emotionally vacated - miserable, angry and intolerable when sober, yet boisterous and care-free when drunk. By contrasting the poor girl with the empty millionaire in his lonely mansion, Chaplin is championing the human spirit over material wealth, a beautiful sentiment brought to life by some fine scenes of comedy, and a profound statement given the harsh, demoralising times. This no doubt was one of the key factors that led to the film's surprising commercial success, with a hungry and unemployed audience given a sense of hope through Chaplin's magic.It is the most satisfying cinematic experience I've ever had - frequently hilarious, awe-inspiring and exquisitely moving. Although Chaplin would carry on making movies and make another masterpiece in Modern Times (1936), this is the last great 'true' Chaplin, his farewell to the era that served him so well. The final scene is the work of a true craftsman, a moment of sheer beauty. Without ruining anything for those who haven't seen it, the close-up of the Tramp's face overcome with emotion is one of the finest displays of acting I've ever come across, and it is easy to see why this scene is now so widely celebrated.

When first learning of this film, back at the start of '87, I thought it was just about some psycho getting his kicks, raping women. Little did I know. Our rapist, Joe has already raped a score of women and disposed of em'. Only his latest, Marjorie (Fawcett in a great dramatic performance) has managed to escape when first car jacked and driven to a deserted underpass. Marjorie explains her situation to the police, none too helpful, where the police woman tells her straight, there's a chance he could get off. Farrah's even mistaken for a hooker by a young cop, who interrupts the not so progressing well conversation. She leaves, irate, and by not signing this certain form, the cops can't take action. The rapist has got her wallet with her id, so we know what's gonna ensue. We too see Joe, has a family where he has been kept pretty faceless up to this point. When he's in his little shed, examining Farrah's id, his cute little daughter knocks on the glass, informing him, dinner's almost ready. So now with Farrah, it's a waiting game. Her two housemates, Patti and Terri, have been informed of the situation. Even when the pizza guy, comes delivering a meal, Farrah is rather surly, when he asks if the three of them live together, which is understandable. Then days later, low and behold, a man freely enters her house, asking after a Joe. And from here, the real drama and suspense begins, claustrophobic, one would say, as Russo, great here, gets quite physical and cruel, at one point almost threatening to toss a pan of burnt bacon onto her. He also examines her particulars, even making opportunity to indulge in some forced sex, cause in reality, there's no way in hell, she'd go out with this creep of low class status. Keeping with the stage play, she finally turns the tables on the attacker, after luring him on, when on top of her, falsely. She then sprays his eyes with insecticide, cracks a hot glass kettle of coffee over his head, before strangling him and barricading him in a fireplace, from which there is no escape. Not much sooner does her two friends return from work and cross this scene of madness. The two do not agree with her illogical plan of murder, which too could be seen as logical, if this madman gets off. We do weigh these real life options. Scarwid, a great character actress, brings an effervescent, quirky and sexy character as Terri, while the more mature Woodard, gives a very humane and real performance, I liked. She's the only one showing compassion to the not so healthy looking Russo. Farrah at one point, who's taken enough of her, says Why don't you just f..k him. That'll make him feel better. Extremities is a real film of real situations and choices. Even near the end, Scarwid chooses to stay with Russo, when Farrah and co, get the cops, warming up to him some, as hearing his reasons. One particular moment with Farrah running her knife down Russo's lower region, may make you flinch. This is a great dramatic film, that I wouldn't suggest a rape victim should watch. It's all too real, as are the performances, and I'm not just talking the mains. You will feel pretty washed out at the end of this, too, as in these claustrophobic movies. The up tempo music score, at it's opening is all so unfitting though, even though I liked it a lot, so.

It almost seemed as if it were making fun of the rich depicting the family as dramatic and dim witted but the movie also showed a class struggle and the morals to overcome it. Godfrey was just a poor man living in a dump and would not even catch a second glance from a wealthier person because it was beneath them to talk to him, that's why after Irene brought Godfrey to the scavenger hunt her mother insisted that she send him away as if he were some mongrel not worth anyone's time. However Irene demonstrated kindness and politeness towards Godfrey by giving him a job as their family butler which depicts the overall moral of the story that everyone, no matter who they are or where they come from, deserves the same amount of respect as any higher class citizen in society. Once hired Godfrey went through hell and back with the families crazy antics but he still demonstrated respect towards the family and gratefulness for giving him a temporary home and a job, he pays back his respects by giving the father of the family his stock back so they would not go bankrupt and have to live on the streets themselves. This demonstrates the same basic respects that everyone should owe to everyone. Godfrey even shows his respects towards the other gentlemen living in the dump by helping them towards the end, which I will not give away. Overall this movie demonstrated a form of comedy which was very enjoyable and made me laugh throughout the whole thing but also showed a main point or moral to the story. Another thing that I found interesting regarding the camera work was that while Godfrey was walking up the steps to give everyone their morning breakfast the camera slowly moved up with him to show a smooth transition to the next scene rather than simply cutting out then cutting back in. There were also quite a few moments where it faded out and faded back in which made it feel like time had elapsed and that we fast forwarded into the future a little bit, perhaps the next day or a few days later. Overall this was a great movie that I enjoyed and would not hesitate to watch again, I'd actually like to watch more screwball comedies like this one.

Why do we need to zoom in on his forehead twice? The scene where the monster plays with the girl is rather heartwarming...until he throws her into the lake. The last shot of the monster has him flailing around trapped in a burning windmill, an odd shot. We're supposed to assume he's dead. People sometimes forget that Frankenstein is the name of the doctor, not the monster. A creative film, despite some(really) quirky moments.

It started with buying the rights to remaking Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and continued with director John Sturges casting top actors who were already stars or right on the verge. From there, it squeezed into its destiny as the final hurrah for the classic Hollywood Western.The premise of Magnificent Seven is so simple that the first half of the movie teeters on total boredom. A tiny Mexican village is tired of being preyed upon by the bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach), so it approaches a well-known gun for hire, Chris (Yul Brynner), in order to purchase guns. Chris insists that hiring more gunslingers will be a cheaper move and more effective, even if it means a team of a few against a whole armed gang.One by one, Chris convinces seven guns to offer their services to defend the town. As men with nothing else to live for in need of money, they easily agree. The first is Vin (Steve McQueen), a cool cat who lives on the edge. In his first major film role, McQueen shows all the suave that made him a star in the '60s.The other five are Bernardo (Charles Bronson), a burly half-Mexican half-Irish loner, Britt (James Coburn), the skilled knifeman, Lee (Robert Vaughn) the professional past his prime, Harry (Brad Dexter) the money-obsessed gambler and Chico (Horst Buchholz), the proud and impetuous kid. It's Buchholz whom Sturges fixates on the most despite the many other stars at his disposal. A German pretty boy, it's a little strange with both he and Brynner starring in the film as Europeans trying to talk like authentic cowboys. It's easy enough to warm up to them both over time, but at first you really don't feel like there's anything authentically Mexican about the film even though it was filmed there.William Roberts, the writer lone credited writer who crafted the film's final draft, constructs the film almost entirely on one-liners and other whip-smart dialogue. Consequently, Magnificent Seven leaves a much better impression than the experience of the film itself. Watching the film is an average experience at best given the obvious trajectory of the film &#x97; Calvera's return and a final standoff &#x97; but somehow after we see the end title card, it gets that much better. It's a strange phenomenon, perhaps best explained by the aura created by the stars and the nature of the Western in general. Westerns are legends in the most basic story sense, so to have so many great legends of cinema on screen at once in a Western amplifies the effect.Sturges supplies some lasting images in the action scenes and frames his shots in a way that definitely evokes the classic John Ford Westerns, but a lot of it comes down to how he captures his stars. Nobody really gets dwarfed in this film, though it is noted according to people in and close to the film that they were all jockeying for the spotlight, especially McQueen.McQueen would go on to become an icon in this decade, but arguably the film's most valuable contribution to the genre was the spontaneously inspired casting of Wallach as Calvera. Wallach left his imprint on film history in Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, but his casting as Tuco would never have happened without Seven, and ultimately neither would his entire 60-year career as a character actor.The on-screen talent really helps you buy into the simplistic plot devices and character arcs for each of the seven. The actors pique your interest in the characters in a way the script never does. Who can really say how much of the credit the film's many clever lines belongs to the writers compared to the fame-craving actors? Truth is, no one really thinks about the writing when they think about The Magnificent Seven.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Some of the performances (Doris Day, in particularly) aren't exact replicas of the original performer, but the story is so perfectly interwoven with the songs that it doesn't matter. In the case of the wonderful Sissy Spacek as Loretta (Webb) Lynn in Coal Miner's Daughter, you think you are actually watching Ms. Lynn act out her own story. Listen to Spacek singing, then switch to a CD with Ms. Lynn performing, and you can barely tell the difference. That goes double here, because you also have the wonderful Beverly D'Angelo giving a heartfelt performance as another country legend, the still much missed Patsy Cline.The first quarter of the movie shows Loretta's hardship in the mountains of Kentucky, a child bride at 14, and an expectant mother soon afterwards. Married to the much more mature Doolittle (Tommy Lee Jones in his star-making role), Loretta sings to her babies, and finally he goes out and buys her a guitar and pushes her to perform live. Ending up on the Grand Old Opry (introduced by none other than Ernest Tubb with Minnie Pearl standing in the background), she is an instant success, and when she is introduced to the legendary Patsy, the two become like sisters. It is Patsy's tragic death in a car accident that sets the stage for Loretta's ultimate nervous breakdown, as well as Doolittle's inability to stay in the background as Mr. Lynn. Unlike Norman Maine in A Star is Born, however, Doolittle won't take the noble coward's way out, and you see him grow up himself as he takes her success in stride and leads her to the path of recovery, a story that itself could become a legendary country song like the title song Spacek breaks into at the end.Breaking away forever from the Carrie mold, Spacek proved herself to be a multi-talented star, and one of the shining lights of the 1980's. Her friendly freckle faced real looks made her appealing in all sorts of roles, and here, Spacek does not appear to be acting. She IS Loretta Lynn, and even when up against the powerhouse performance of Mary Tyler Moore in Ordinary People, deserved the Oscar she received. Her breakdown scene should be interwoven with the greatest individual scenes on celluloid when clips of cinema at its best is put together. Jessica Lange deservedly won praise for her later performance as Cline in Sweet Dreams (and got her own Oscar Nomination), but D'Angelo is just as memorable. Ironically, Lange and Spacek co-starred right after that in Crimes of the Heart, along with another powerhouse, Diane Keaton. Levon Helm and Phyllis Boyens are memorable as the Webbs, Loretta's hard-working parents both strict and loving, and filled with the earthly spirit of country folk. They are not stereotypical Ma and Pa Kettle hicks, just real people in a real location making the most out of a little.The music is sensational, and the CD gives full versions of the sometimes abridged songs in the movie. When Loretta's first audience gets to hear her sing in public for the first time (the song There He Goes), you can see in their eyes that they realize that they are present to an unforgettable moment in country music history. Spacek adds humor to her first appearance on radio, telling off the DJ who lied about playing her record, and later misinterpreting a certain word which offends a radio station owner. Be warned; You will feel shudders down your back as D'Angelo breaks into Sweet Dreams, and when it is repeated on the radio as Spacek and Jones sleep, make sure you have Kleenex handy. Back in Baby's Arms, Spacek and D'Angelo's duet, shows two powerhouse actresses playing two powerhouse singers, and a lesson in how women in the same industry don't have to be competitors, but can bring out the best in each other.The clichés of these types of biographies are definitely there, but that really doesn't matter. Only once does the film seem awkward as it moves from one sequence to another, but for the most part, the screenplay flows beautifully, making this the surprise hit of 1980, the type of film that today would sadly end up on cable and be forgotten by tomorrow.

The acting is also very convincing and interesting to watch as their characters develop, save for the over-the-top excessive performance from the stalker's wife.

The camera-work is also simply perfect, creating many memorable and unique mixture of tracking and still shots.Now onto the negative points. The film is extremely slow paced which at times was quite compelling as it created a great deal of tension but at some points, certain scenes and shots went on for too long needlessly or became slightly dull. 2001 A Space Odyssey had a similar pace yet it never ceased to be interesting for a moment; the same cannot be said for Stalker.

I may be mistaken and may see something new in Stalker if I ever re- watch it when I'm older but for now, all I can say is it's a very well made film in many aspects but it lacks good pacing, can become often too slow and most importantly doesn't have a true point or purpose to the journey of the characters or the story itself overall. Throughout I was often compelled though but from the last part of the film and by the end I found myself going ''Was that it?'' Although I am still interested to see Tarkovsky's other work. This one - worth watching but didn't see the masterpiece that I've heard so much about. 7.5-8\/10.

While there the five students unintentionally bring back evil demons from the dead that wants to possess the students one by one. Now,it's all up to Ash(Bruce Campbell)who has to fight off the demons and survive...The Evil Dead.I think one of the reasons The Evil Dead is a Horror classic was because when the film came out in the early 80s slasher films were all the rage at the time,but The Evil Dead was a different animal. Instead of making another slasher film,director Sam Raimi,decided to make a movie about demonic possession and give viewers a scary,horrifying and original experience. One of the reasons ED is such a scary and frightening film is because like some of the best Horror films you never know what to expect and don't know what's coming,with the scary situations in the film are insane,wild,creepy and frightening. The scares in the film are done with great timing,imagination and effect,using creepy sound effects for the demons and strange noises outside in the woods giving viewers an uneasy feeling because with ED there is great build up to the to the Horror and once the Horror starts it never ever stops and for 85 minutes you are put on a terrifying and scary thrill ride that doesn't quit until the very end. The atmosphere in the film is excellent,showing the woods not as a beautiful place you want to be at for a vacation,but a place that's ugly and evil filled with fog and smoke and pulsating with darkness and dread. What also makes the atmosphere in ED scary and excellent is the POV shots of the demons and the unique camera angles smartly not showing the faces of the demons when they're chasing and stalking the main characters but showing the faces of the main characters when they're being chased. The camera angles and shots from Raimi are unique and stylish with tilted angles and over the head shots adding to ED's brilliance and making the film rise above most low budget Horror films. Ash in this film is a character we can relate to because while Ash is the hero of the film Ash goes through a lot of pain and terror that most human beings can stand to bear. Although Ash isn't the tough guy(he's still scared in the other films)he became in the sequels Ash still finds a way to fight the evil demons but still realizes he's in way over his head and that's one of the things that makes Ash an iconic character The violence and gore in the film is not for the weak at heart,it's effective,bloody, gory and disgusting and when the blood and gore comes into the film the blood flows and never stops. ED is one of the most politically incorrect and craziest Horror films ever made and I don't know if it was intentional or not,but the film has a dark sense of Humor about itself because while the film is pure Horror there are some things in the film that are so over the top you can't help but laugh whether it's the demons taunting the main characters or the slapstick suffering the characters go through. The dark Comedy and Humor were pushed even further in the sequels Evil Dead 2Dead By Dawn and Army Of Darkness and it's one of the things that makes this series great and unique. The ending of the film is insane,bloody,twisted and full of energy and will be something you'll never forget and is one of the great things that makes ED a Horror classic.The cast does a good job with their roles. Bruce Campbell does a wonderful job as Ash,the hero of the film,bringing sympathy and likability to the role. Ash isn't the tough-talking shotgun using hero he became in the sequels,but Ash still does heroic things in the film. Ellen Sandweiss does a good job as Cheryl,Ash's frightened sister. Hal Delrich does a fine job Scott,Ash's friend. Betsy Baker is good as Linda,Ash's girlfriend. Sarah York does a fine job as Shelly,Scott's girlfriend.The direction from Sam Raimi is just excellent and stylish,using great angles,POV shots,intense close-ups and also does well in the scary scenes. Great direction from Raimi.The score by Joe Doluca is scary,effective,frightening and fits in with the film's creepy tone. A great score.The special effects by Tom Sullivan is amazing,disgusting,frightening and unforgettable and are well done for a low budget.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Cult Films,Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell or cinema in general,you'll love The Evil Dead,a brilliant Horror classic from beginning to end that will stand the test of time.

Hard to believe this movie is 30 years old.The situation is classic (and is based on Mark Twain stories)--a rich person and a poor person are made to trade places. They not only learn from being in the other person's shoes, they change to fit the role they now occupy. So Murphy is lifted from the streets and becomes a successful businessman, and his counter part Dan Aykroyd is made to fall from his cushy privilege to a life of minor crime.Of course this only happens with the dishonest help of two aging businessmen who make money manipulating commodities markets. They get their comeuppance and by the end everyone is sort of where they deserve to be.And in the end you may have forgotten how really slow the beginning is, and how some of the moments are campy and a little clunky. It's another case where you need to watch for the best of the movie, not the totality. Murphy is very funny--though we're so used to his brand of humor it might seem like you've been there often before. Aykroyd wears thinner every time I see him in a movie, so that might just be my taste. The old men, including a perfectly cast Ralph Bellamy, are good enough as caricatures. The butler is his own kind of sublime reserve the way movie butlers are. And the one woman, who is fun but a bit of a farce, too, is Jamie Lee Curtis, not quite over the top enough to fit the movie.I think if you are already a fan this will remain a hoot.

The other way to look at the situation would be Stanley's force compels Blanch to face her crimes and gives her an opportunity to live a normal life sometime in the future. 'A Streetcar named Desire' veers between Blanch's attempts at ridding herself of guilt through ignorance and delusion and Stanley's will to expose Blanch's past and force her to admit and punish herself for her sins. Its playwright Tennessee Williams gives us a harrowing example of the difficulties faced by women who have stained their characters, and the cruelty with which men chastise them while they themselves take little notice of the sins they commit every day. Elia Kazan brings the play to screen experimenting little with editing and instead allows his actors to take charge, and boy do they bring tragedy to life! It is Marlon Brando's intense heat that allows Vivien Leigh's character to have a terrifying meltdown and the actress delivers one of the finest and most iconic performances in film history by nailing a highly complex and extremely interesting character. She may not have done it so well without Brando and we should give credit to Brando for helping her, but if you ask me who performed better, I'd unhesitatingly choose Leigh.A Streetcar Named Desire gained popularity on stage because of the quality of the story itself and Brando's acclaimed performance. When it was reproduced on screen, director Kazan roped in method-maharaja Marlon Brando and classical-chanteuse Vivien Leigh for the roles of Stanley and Blanche respectively. The rest of the cast were filled by talented actors like Kim Hunter for the role of Stella Kowalski and Karl Malden for Mitch. The controversial nature of the play made it difficult for bringing it on screen without certain cuts, but the restoration version released years later fortunately retains the deleted scenes. The story begins with Blanche Dubois' character arriving from Auriol to New Orleans by train, and taking the streetcar named Desire to Cemeteries and finally Elysian fields where her sister Stella lives with her husband Stanley. Blanche is extremely secretive about her past and only discloses to Stella that she had lost possession to their old home in Belle-Reve and was asked by the higher authority, in the school where Blanche taught English, to 'take some rest'. Blanche moves in temporarily with her sister and quickly shows displeasure at Stella's bourgeois existence and her attraction towards a violent man like Stanley. Blanche's prime desire is to begin a new life using an idealistic approach where 'magic and art' play a preeminent role and she pursues this by charming her brother-in-law's close friend and co-worker Mitch; her main obstacle comes in the form of Stanley, who does not entertain her whims, and finding loopholes in her claims, begins digging her past to break the spell Blanche wants to put everyone under. While he is instrumental in ripping her past apart, it seems like Blanche herself gives everyone an opportunity to scrutinize her past; it is as though she planted the seeds of her own destruction which were nurtured by Stanley.William's astonishing work should have been adapted to screen without altering anything because it is perfectly penned. Unfortunately, the film version alters the ending which makes Stanley looks like a complete jerk who is not only crass with Blanch but also not empathetic towards his own wife's grief. It goes against Stanley's motive of living happily with his wife and child without any de trop to disturb the 'wild peace' at home. Barring that scene, every other moment is brilliantly told and played on screen. Kazan hardly tries experimenting with the camera and in the process creates a work that is sharp and subtle. The most effective moments are when the camera abruptly cuts to or zooms into Blanche's face whenever anyone broaches the subject of her husband. Most of the effort is left to the actors who have terrific chemistry with each other, mainly because a majority of them have reprised the roles from stage. Hunter looks a lot like Debra Winger and the manner in which she spoke reminded me of young Debra from the movie 'Terms of Endearment' (of course, Debra came years later). While Debra Winger played a rich young rebellious girl who marries a simpleton, Hunter's Stella marries a commoner like Stanley because she is partly fascinated by his often violent and callous bravado. The actress convincingly plays Stella in a manner that makes us understand the character's choice, in a difficult role where she not only has to show love towards a violent man like Stanley, but also concern for her sister Blanch and slight contempt and reproach towards her husband for his treatment of Blanch. The other supporting role of Stan's friend Mitch is taken up by Malden; his character reminded me of J. Edgar Hoover who too lived alone with his sick mother and was very much concerned about her. Malden does his job well, especially in the confrontation scene between Mitch and Blanch where Mitch begins kissing her only because he then considers her a use-and-throw woman.However it is Brando and Leigh that make the day.

'A Streetcar named Desire' veers between Blanch's attempts at ridding herself of guilt through ignorance and delusion and Stanley's will to expose Blanch's past and force her to admit and punish herself for her sins. Its playwright Tennessee Williams gives us a harrowing example of the difficulties faced by women who have stained their characters, and the cruelty with which men chastise them while they themselves take little notice of the sins they commit every day. Elia Kazan brings the play to screen experimenting little with editing and instead allows his actors to take charge, and boy do they bring tragedy to life! It is Marlon Brando's intense heat that allows Vivien Leigh's character to have a terrifying meltdown and the actress delivers one of the finest and most iconic performances in film history by nailing a highly complex and extremely interesting character. She may not have done it so well without Brando and we should give credit to Brando for helping her, but if you ask me who performed better, I'd unhesitatingly choose Leigh.A Streetcar Named Desire gained popularity on stage because of the quality of the story itself and Brando's acclaimed performance. When it was reproduced on screen, director Kazan roped in method-maharaja Marlon Brando and classical-chanteuse Vivien Leigh for the roles of Stanley and Blanche respectively. The rest of the cast were filled by talented actors like Kim Hunter for the role of Stella Kowalski and Karl Malden for Mitch. The controversial nature of the play made it difficult for bringing it on screen without certain cuts, but the restoration version released years later fortunately retains the deleted scenes. The story begins with Blanche Dubois' character arriving from Auriol to New Orleans by train, and taking the streetcar named Desire to Cemeteries and finally Elysian fields where her sister Stella lives with her husband Stanley. Blanche is extremely secretive about her past and only discloses to Stella that she had lost possession to their old home in Belle-Reve and was asked by the higher authority, in the school where Blanche taught English, to 'take some rest'. Blanche moves in temporarily with her sister and quickly shows displeasure at Stella's bourgeois existence and her attraction towards a violent man like Stanley. Blanche's prime desire is to begin a new life using an idealistic approach where 'magic and art' play a preeminent role and she pursues this by charming her brother-in-law's close friend and co-worker Mitch; her main obstacle comes in the form of Stanley, who does not entertain her whims, and finding loopholes in her claims, begins digging her past to break the spell Blanche wants to put everyone under. While he is instrumental in ripping her past apart, it seems like Blanche herself gives everyone an opportunity to scrutinize her past; it is as though she planted the seeds of her own destruction which were nurtured by Stanley.William's astonishing work should have been adapted to screen without altering anything because it is perfectly penned. Unfortunately, the film version alters the ending which makes Stanley looks like a complete jerk who is not only crass with Blanch but also not empathetic towards his own wife's grief. It goes against Stanley's motive of living happily with his wife and child without any de trop to disturb the 'wild peace' at home. Barring that scene, every other moment is brilliantly told and played on screen. Kazan hardly tries experimenting with the camera and in the process creates a work that is sharp and subtle. The most effective moments are when the camera abruptly cuts to or zooms into Blanche's face whenever anyone broaches the subject of her husband. Most of the effort is left to the actors who have terrific chemistry with each other, mainly because a majority of them have reprised the roles from stage.

It's a very touching a true account of how one dedicated and selfless parent can make a huge difference in a child's life.

However, 33 years later, as I watch this beautiful character piece again through the eyes of a proud and loving father, it's messages and emotionally compelling performances touched my heart and leave a lasting impression.Everything about this movie is near perfection. From the writing, to the directing, acting and cinematography, as the incredible Dustin Hoffman said in his Oscar acceptance speech after winning Best Actor for Kramer vs. Kramer, everyone that worked on this film is part of the artistic family that made it the success it was.Without giving too much away and ruining the discovery of Ted Kramer, to put it as simply as possible, this movie is about one thing... a man who discovers that his love for his child exceeds any and all self needs and wants, and is willing to make any sacrifice to ensure that his child never feels abandoned again.

Our main characters go to the forest moon of Endor to deactivate the shield generator of a second Death Star where the Emperor himself is on, giving a chance for the rebel fleet to destroy it however the Emperor has plans for Luke and wishes to make him his apprentice.The special effects and sets are, once again, fantastic. I've already praised them enough before so I won't bother repeating the same praise but expect the same attention to detail and high-quality found in the last two films. The action scenes are also very well done and epic, probably the most exciting battles in the entire series are in this movie. John Williams score is, as always, wonderful, and my personal favourite out of all the 'Star Wars' films.However, what I don't like about this film are the Ewoks, the native race of the forest moon who help the rebels. I'm not going to get into the whole debate on the Empire's best soldiers being defeated by a race of teddy bears (I actually think it makes sense since the Empire probably were not expecting them to attack and they have been likely using guerrilla warfare tactics for quite some time) but I do find them very annoying. They are suppose to be cute and funny, but the comedy just feels really out of place with random cutaways to them doing something really stupid and, to be honest, some of the costumes are really ugly but I don't really mind them as much as most people seem to do. I just wish the creators made them a little less comical.Overall, just like any of the original 'Star Wars' films, I find this to be a near masterpiece with very few flaws. Although not as mature as 'Empire' it is still very good and worth it if you like the first two films, although by this point you probably already have seen it.

It's all okay, though, because all men are brutes anyway and deserve what they get. The climax has Thelma and Louise sailing off into the cerulean sky above the Grand Canyon, laughing gaily all the way.Demi Moore and Glenne Headly are pals too, and it has its comic moments, but it's not a cartoon but rather a reasonably well thought-out narrative of friendship, love, hypocrisy, marriage, betrayal, morality, and community. I don't mean to make it sound more complicated and pretentious than it is. It really boils down to a murder mystery.Moore is being questioned by the police and she tells the story in a series of flashbacks. Her girlhood friend, Headly, is married to the most abusive and obnoxious man you could ever hope to meet (Willis) and one night apparently cuts his throat and kills him. Moore helps Headly out, dumping Willis's body, getting rid of evidence, lying to the cops, and so forth. The murder is blamed on car jackers.Here's an example of what I meant before when I referred to comic moments. At Willis's wake, Moore's father, an old-fashioned, working-class, urban type, blames the killing on black kids, going into this extravagantly angry, hand-waving rant about how they should take all of them, line them up against a wall, and shoot them. Then immediately he asks about Willis, Did he rent or own? All the writing, comic or otherwise, is pretty clever and convincing. And the dialog coach should get a medal. Bayonne, New Jersey, is an ugly little industrial town but it's just across the Hudson from Manhattan and has a grand view of the city's majestic skyline.I don't think I'll reveal the ending because it comes as something of a surprise. Maybe a little too much of a surprise, like an Alfred Hitchcock television episode with a twist at the end. The director, Alan Rudolph, sometimes lapses into self indulgence with split-second flashbacks, mirror shots, and that sort of thing, but not often enough to distract the viewer. It may be Demi Moore's best performance in an adult movie; Glenne Headly has the most curious epicanthic folds; fascinating to see Bruce Willis as a thoroughly rotten villain; Harvey Keitel (who also tried to reason with Thelma and Louise) pronounces the name of Joyce as Jerse.
