(With The Godfather coming in at a distant second) The art direction, set design, sound quality, cinematography, and visually stunning special effects are all flawlessly perfect.2001 A Space Odyssey, is nothing shy of a miraculous movie. It is the only film to explore certain areas that no other film director has even attempted. The main theme of this film explores the knowledge of mankind from the past 4 million years, and through certain symbolic objects in the film, such as the flying bone, the monolith, and the star child, which all display what man has discovered about his universe.I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film (even the credits), but the greatest parts were during the second half of this film, which involve the American spacecraft Discovery I, on its way to Jupiter to trace a signal made by this mysterious extra terrestrial monolith. Astronauts Keir Dullea, and Gary Lockwood, have it out with the HAL 9000 computer who controls the ship, when he has a mental breakdown. To this day I agree with the late Gene Siskel who said that HAL 9000 was the best villainous character in film history. Doug Rain's slow, calm, and monotonous voice make HAL the most intriguing character in this film. The scene where HAL refuses to let Keir Dullea re-enter the ship for fear of being shut down, is my favorite scene in film history, because it clearly shows the rivalry of computers and mankind.It took several viewings of 2001 before I fully understood and appreciated this film, but for a movie this good it was well worth it. It is one of the few films I can watch 100 times and never ever get sick of it. I loved this film so much that I own the box set for it, and I'm amazed how well 2001 has stood up over time even after 30 years. There are only a few other films that I would consider to be on the same level as 2001, such as some of my other all time favorite films. (The Godfather, Star Wars, Amadeus Saving Private Ryan) just to name a few. But excellent as those films are they still can't compare to such a visual masterpiece like 2001.After such a colossal amount of praise, I can't even go into the complex but extremely fastinating plot. If there was only one film that truly deserved a 5-star rating this would be it. It is a film that every person should see because this is the most unique film that has been created or will be created. A one of a kind must see masterpiece.

From begining to end, from the very first scene to the very last, I laughed harder than I almost ever have at any other movie. Some of the gags were taken from the original, but many were new and just as inventive. It seemed to me as if Myers expanded on the old gags because he didn't have time to put them into the old one and then added the new gags, which were even more inventive. The gag about the penis is hysterical.(you'll know what I mean when you see the movie)Myers, as usual, is amazingly diverse, playing three characters this time; Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard. The script is wonderfully written, andthere is quite honestly never a dull moment. Rob Lowe does a very good job as the young Number 2, and the actor who plays Scotty, Dr. Evil's son, has a much bigger role in this movie and plays it to perfection.Heather Graham is amazing. Liz Hurley is one of the most beautiful women in the world, but Heather, with her sensual looks and actions, has her beat in this movie. Everytime she looked at Austin with that  Lets go and Shag look I found myself wanting to be the bad tooth English spy more and more. She would have been one of the best Bond girls ever, if she ever went that route, but I would much rather see her with Austin.Overall, the movie is honestly non stop laughs. Everytime I found myself thinking I was laughed out, Myers would plug something into the story that make me erupt, with the rest of the audience, again. This movie is going to have a lot of second and third comers because the audience is so loud at times, and because you will be laughing so loud at times, I am sure there were many jokes that I missed. Myers has solidified himself as maybe the best comic out there right now with this movie.Go to the movies. See this film. So far, with Star Wars and now this, it has been a DAMN GOOD YEAR for films. It's about time there were movies out there that leave you feeling great when you the theatre. This one will leave laughing long after you leave the theatre. Definitely Shagadelic Baby, Yeah.

But the thing I didn't get were the references to many things between 1970 and the late 80s (I wasn't born until the mid-1980s), for example Moon Unit Zappa was a reference to some girl's name, and the reference to The Exorcist when Dr. Evil was spinning around in his chair in the movie.

Sorry, but I prefer my aliens to look like something out of this world, not someone in a costume.No plot? This movie is one of three, so Lucas took the chance to use Episode 1 largely as a set up for the next two movies.  It's not really meant as a stand-alone.  It's supposed to leave unanswered questions, like who the REAL menace is (note the title, PHANTOM Menace, for those who haven't figured out that the Trade Federation was not the enemy and who the enemy really is).  I also find it strange that some complain about no plot while others complain the plot is too complex- so which is it? Formulaic plot and characters? Of course.  But what was Star Wars, if not the ultimate formula movie? Polarized good versus evil, bad guy all in black, good guy in white, scoundrel-with-a-heart-of-gold, etc.  Star Wars was not original in any of its individual elements, only in the way it strung them together.

Well, there was a movie that was supposed to be about characters and dialogue and it was awful.  All they did was create characters I cared nothing about and even disdained.  The acting was good, but the plot lacked originality, and the dialogue clearly failed in making me feel for the characters.  Yet few say these things about a movie they liked.

This is demonstrated in this movie, because virtually all of the characters are basically sex objects, or the people lusting after them.  It's a bad sign in a movie when its two most interesting characters spend the duration locked in the bathroom.The movie is basically about the kind of party thrown by teenagers in the movies; it follows on the heels of high school graduation and requires all the necessary players to appear on the scene and have contrived, predictable experiences that change their lives.  The players usually fall into the categories of 1)The hero, who is smitten with the prettiest girl in school, 2) the hero's friend, usually female, who sees past his clunky attempts to win the girl to his innate goodness, 3) the jock, who is a jerk and dates the prettiest girl in school, 4) the prettiest girl in school, who is deep down an intelligent, strong, interesting person who is seen by everyone else just as the jock's girlfriend, 5) the nerd, who has been tormented by the jock and plots revenge.  Add to this mix the character played effectively by Seth Green, who is seems to take his inspiration from the late Tupac Shakur.None of these characters ever really break out of the contrivances of their roles in this scenario.  It comes as no surprise, for instance, that the nerd gets drunk for the first time in his life and gets down to a rendition of Paradise City.  Jennifer Love Hewitt plays the girl with what little skill the role involves but is trapped in a paper-thin character.  I think she is a talented actress and would like to see her in a good movie with an interesting character, someday.  Since right now her resume includes I Know What You Did Last Summer and its sequel, I Still Know, etc, I think it may be a while.The only two characters I could identify with were the hero's friend, played by Denise Fleming, and the Seth Green character.  They are the ones locked in the bathroom, but the writer couldn't think of anything interesting for them to talk about.Is this what people think teenagers are all about?  Talk to most teenagers today and you will find, I think, that they are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who are scared about the future and not sure about what they want to do in life.  Look at them as an adult and you will likely see yourself.  It is sad, and insulting, that the filmmakers here have viewed them mainly as walking hormones.  It's almost like a throwback to the 80's when these kind of movies appeared every week.  Ironically, the 80's were also when movies that really explored the teenage world, such as The Breakfast Club and Real Genius were also peaking.  Strange that we have come so far and yet fallen so low, all at the same time.

It's a bad sign in a movie when its two most interesting characters spend the duration locked in the bathroom.The movie is basically about the kind of party thrown by teenagers in the movies; it follows on the heels of high school graduation and requires all the necessary players to appear on the scene and have contrived, predictable experiences that change their lives.  The players usually fall into the categories of 1)The hero, who is smitten with the prettiest girl in school, 2) the hero's friend, usually female, who sees past his clunky attempts to win the girl to his innate goodness, 3) the jock, who is a jerk and dates the prettiest girl in school, 4) the prettiest girl in school, who is deep down an intelligent, strong, interesting person who is seen by everyone else just as the jock's girlfriend, 5) the nerd, who has been tormented by the jock and plots revenge.  Add to this mix the character played effectively by Seth Green, who is seems to take his inspiration from the late Tupac Shakur.None of these characters ever really break out of the contrivances of their roles in this scenario.  It comes as no surprise, for instance, that the nerd gets drunk for the first time in his life and gets down to a rendition of Paradise City.  Jennifer Love Hewitt plays the girl with what little skill the role involves but is trapped in a paper-thin character.  I think she is a talented actress and would like to see her in a good movie with an interesting character, someday.  Since right now her resume includes I Know What You Did Last Summer and its sequel, I Still Know, etc, I think it may be a while.The only two characters I could identify with were the hero's friend, played by Denise Fleming, and the Seth Green character.  They are the ones locked in the bathroom, but the writer couldn't think of anything interesting for them to talk about.Is this what people think teenagers are all about?  Talk to most teenagers today and you will find, I think, that they are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who are scared about the future and not sure about what they want to do in life.  Look at them as an adult and you will likely see yourself.  It is sad, and insulting, that the filmmakers here have viewed them mainly as walking hormones.  It's almost like a throwback to the 80's when these kind of movies appeared every week.  Ironically, the 80's were also when movies that really explored the teenage world, such as The Breakfast Club and Real Genius were also peaking.  Strange that we have come so far and yet fallen so low, all at the same time.

It's costume drama, if you fancy PBS Masterpiece Theater productions, you'll definitely enjoy it.Simply Perfect. It's perfection to a tea (high tea at four). It's so comfortable and relaxing to watch a Mamet film even when it's a story of intrigue and suspense.Without stress of anticipation or worrying how the film might turn out, I entered the theater already satisfied -- I am seeing a Mamet film (a relieve from the Hollywood blockbusters!)  I totally trusted the writer\/director, serenely sat there knowing I will have a pleasant film experience, and immensely enjoyable it truly was!Every character is well acted by a perfect cast! Nigel Hawthorne as the senior Winslow, Arthur, head of the family. Gemma Jones as the matron of the house, Mrs. Winslow, Grace. Rebecca Pidgeon (Catherine Kate Winslow the daughter who works for her cause in women suffrage) flawlessly matches Jeremy Northam (Sir Robert Morton the renowned lawyer who has his influence on the House of Commons). What a fine pair opposite each other. Northam is impeccable and as handsome as he is. Pidgeon is no less brilliant and shines reflectively. There are the other two sons in the Winslow family the key role of the Winslow boy in question, Ronnie, played by Guy Edwards, and the older son Dickie played by Rebecca's brother Matthew Pidgeon. Also Sarah Flind as the twenty-four years faithful family servant Violet, Colin Stinton as cousin Desmond and Aden Gillett as fiancé John (the two men who keenly pursue Kate) just about do the job for this faultlessly put together story on film.Mamet's screenplay once again superbly presented. Every line, every word in every scene came across so befitting for the moment -- such timing and delivery. This is a politically conscious film subjects include family unit value, honor and honesty, class structure, influence of a well-known lawyer, along with father and son relationship, father and daughter, husband and wife, and romantic notions being tossed about around Kate -- all integrally paced yet seemingly choreographed together so effortlessly.Mind you the case is not the only central interest, the tension (and subtle tender friendship) between Kate Winslow and Sir Robert Morton is fascinating to watch, as they grow to observe each other closely and exchange banters. Kate, with her seemingly restrained manners, is holding back her feelings, while Sir Robert is opening up steadily and showing (obvious to us viewers) interest in getting to talk to Kate more often than he would a man of his stature.For me, there are four key scenes of exceptional energy, be it in high or low-key delivery. 1) Arthur Winslow (Nigel Hawthorne) talking initially with Ronnie (Guy Edwards). 2) When Kate (Rebecca Pidgeon) first entered Sir Robert's office, our very first glimpse of Sir Robert (Jeremy Northam) and his initial reaction. 3) Sir Robert interrogating Ronnie in his office. 4) The last verbal exchange between Pidgeon and Northam, as Kate and Sir Robert bid goodbye -- miss not a single word of this as you will be satisfied (probably more music to a woman's ears when Northam speaks!)Music score by Alaric Jans complements the film effectively, so do the costume design by Consolata Boyle and photography by Benoit Delhomme. All in all, I repeat, a perfectly satisfying and enjoyable film. Bravo to Mamet, once again.Other gems (screenplay-director) by Mamet besides The Spanish Prisoner 1998, are his first film House of Games 1987 and Things Change 1988. They both have the unique energy of Joe Mantegna, and fascinating strong lead performances from Lindsay Crouse in the former and Don Ameche in the latter -- perfect casting they were, with music score both by Alaric Jans.

No lie, if you get the chance to rent this..don't avoid it!!  57 years after the first movie, Ripley   (Sigourney Weaver...in her academy award-nominated role) is awaken from her sleep chamber on the escape ship from the first movie and is asked for a favor. The alien planet which they landed on in the first movie has been in habited by colonies for humans to live there...but, communication has been lost with the planet and they must send a rescue team to investigate. They need Ripley's knowledge of the creatures to help their voyage...that's when the suspense begins. This is a great movie. Oh yeah, watch for Bill Paxton as Lt. Hudson...he is so funny. I give this movie a  9 1\/2 out of 10!!!  Don't miss it!!

I usually avoid films that have hoards of lemmings camping out to see it (read SW Episode One). Pvt. Ryan had been on the video shelves for a few weeks before I picked it up. I wasn't really looking forward to YAAWF (Yet Another American War Film).This film is absolutely brilliant filmmaking. If Speilberg had not made ET and Indiana Jones, he would not have had the creative control to make a masterpiece like this. He reminds me of Hitchcock at the height of his powers in the late 50's early 60's.This film is riveting from beginning to end. Every scene, every shot, every sound has meaning and is seamlessly integrated with the overall artistic vision of the film. I have a degree in Film Criticism and have seen a lot of film. You quickly become jaded by formula after formula.Speilberg has created a fresh approach to what could be considered a tired genre. The hand-held, chaotic filming of the Omaha Beach landing along with the sizzling soundscape make this sequence one of the best in cinema history. The point, however, is not to bombard the viewer with gory war scenes for shock purposes. It is a setup for the rest of the film. You are never at ease at any time for the rest of the movie. They payoff for this setup is the sequence towards the end of the film in the battle to hold the bridge.One beautifully crafted sequence (of many) is setup in the opening sequence crossfade from the old man's blue eyes to Tom Hank's shaking hand at the Omaha landing. That crossfade is a film convention that Speilberg subverts for dramatic effect. When you see the final crossfade from Pvt. Ryan's face to the old man's face (beautifully done) it comes full circle. This subversion of a typical film convention is what makes Tom Hank's final scene so incredibly moving. You'll know what I mean when you've seen it.Speilberg has gone beyond technical mastery of film, he has become a consumate artist, using his film making skills with intelligence, sensitivity and confidence.
