As it turns out one of the lousy ones won, while one of the best pictures made that year unaccountably failed to even make the nominees list. I am referring to Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant, no-holds-barred, and unflinchingly frank look at a family of pornographers (everyone from the producer to the stars to the film crew gets face time here) from the days when adult films were made with actual film and often financed by organized crime to the legal but undoubtedly cheesier days of direct-to-video movies.While this is mostly an ensemble piece, the central figure is Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, sensational here), a slightly dim-witted young man with a huge endowment who attracts the attention of porn producer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in perhaps his best performance since DELIVERANCE) and is soon a member of Horner's company, renamed Dirk Diggler and bearing more than a passing resemblance to the late John Holmes.Anderson makes big movies, and they tend to run long; this one takes a little over two-and-a-half hours to tell its story, but there isn't a frame of wasted film here; this is an exciting, involving, and utterly fascinating film from start to finish. Even if you find the subject matter objectionable, you will not be able to deny the power Anderson brings to every moment of this film.The ensemble deserves mention here as well, because this is a film loaded with some of the best character actors in the business and every performance has greatness in it. One of my particular favorite scenes is a cocaine-fueled stream-of-consciousness dialogue between porn actresses Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) that is as harrowing as a train wreck and quite as impossible to avoid looking at.There is a lot of other great talent on hand here Luis Guzm√°n as an aspiring producer; Don Cheadle as an aspiring porn actor with the peculiar quirk of dressing in cowboy outfits that make him look more like BLAZING SADDLES material than a porn star; William H Macy as a member of the crew whose wife (Nina Hartley) enjoys doing it with every available male whether or not the cameras are turning, and a slightly stereotypical but nonetheless compelling turn by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a gofer with a major crush on both Dirk and his sidekick and frequent costar Reed Rothchild (John C Reilly); and two brilliant cameos Joanna Gleason as Eddie\/Dirk's hateful mother, and Alfred Molina as a highly-placed drug dealer whom Dirk and Reed make an abortive attempt to rob, nearly losing their lives in the process.This is a great film, rich in both form and content. There isn't a bad performance or a single scene that fails to hit the mark in the entire movie, and if you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to get it. It is proof that great movies are still possible even in this day and age when we are drowning in remakes and silly action pictures.Final note the most interesting and compelling thing about this film is that Anderson makes no judgment calls about his characters. He shows them for who they are, the good, the bad, and the in-between, giving the film a depth that is rare in Hollywood.A work of genius.

Sure UNDER SIEGE is slicker and more expensive, ABOVE THE LAW has a more serious and compelling story, and OUT FOR JUSTICE has Seagal at his self-righteously most over the top, but none of those are half as fun as this little gem.Admittedly the plot to this film is on the simplistic side and it takes itself quite seriously for the most part. Seagal here is an originally unwilling crusader against drug gangs and violence but of course kills more people and causes more mayhem and property damage than any cartel ever did. Already at this point was he starting to exhibit some of his quirky mannerisms (obvious stunt doubles and enigmatic heroes who disappear to let their lackies do the boring stuff) which turned into B-action tropes over the years. He also starts to find his own identity as a bonafide 80's era action star with snappy post-mortem one-liners and creative almost artfully balletic corpse-kills.A lot of the fun comes from the ethnocentrism at hand in the form of the ridiculousness assigned to the antagonistic Jamaican cartel. Their heavily accented dialog and Basil Wallace's performance as their leader makes it feel as though Seagal is up against a gang of cartoon characters. The movie casts aside any shred of realism and treats us to seeing Seagal cathartically and unemotionally taking down multiple adversaries at once without even breaking a sweat. This was the only film I think Seagal did for 20th Century Fox so perhaps that's why it breaks a mold a little bit and allows the villains to land a few punches on our mighty hero (not that it makes any difference).One cannot talk about this movie without mentioning Basil Wallace's delirious portrayal of perhaps the most emotionally unbalanced villain of any action movie, and that includes anything Vernon Wells has ever done. He enthusiastically incantates voodoo and mysticism with wild-eyed abandon in an effort to intimidate his posse, but it largely comes across as quite comical. He's the polar opposite of the wooden and inexpressive Seagal, who just sort of drifts around and looks annoyed when there's no more baddies to murder.Pathetically the film tries to go the PC route and with the casting of Jamaican Tom Wright as a vindictive Island cop and American black character actor Keith David as Seagal's buddy vigilante. Amazingly, David's character is the close-minded one and no chance is spared to teach him how Jamaica as a tough but unfortunate breeding ground for vermin, though mostly populated by mostly good people. I don't know if it was out of PC-ness or in keeping with the tone of the villainy in the film, but the soundtrack contains a lot of great reggae tracks, largely by the one and only Jimmy Cliff who even appears in the film as himself singing about the upcoming death of the film's villain (!). The film ends on a high note with a nonstop action spectacular and immediately rolls into one of the most unforgettable reggae songs of all time. I really don't know who John Crow was or what he had to do with anything (perhaps they changed Hatcher's name at some point during production?) but at least we got a great song out of it.

Much like gimmicky camera tricks or abuse of slow-motion (I'm looking at you John Woo) can ruin a movie, the overly dark nature of so many shots just leaves you sitting there wish you could tell what the hell was going on.I will say, possibly watching it on a larger screen, or a better quality television (mine is a 32 Sony LCD, nothing fancy) might mitigate lighting issues a bit, I don't know.Overall, its an OK movie for the genre that is partially ruined by not being able to tell what the hell is going on.

I understand, keep the settings dim to create fear (and realism, the power is out most of the time though why everyone in the museum works in near total darkness 99% of the time is a bit mind-boggling) but I can't be scared if I can't see what's happening when I'm supposed to!Dark, extremely dark shots keep the viewer in the (I can't do it), keep the viewer confused in many scenes. It was bad enough that a moderate length movie (109m) seemed MUCH longer and not in a good way. Much like gimmicky camera tricks or abuse of slow-motion (I'm looking at you John Woo) can ruin a movie, the overly dark nature of so many shots just leaves you sitting there wish you could tell what the hell was going on.I will say, possibly watching it on a larger screen, or a better quality television (mine is a 32 Sony LCD, nothing fancy) might mitigate lighting issues a bit, I don't know.Overall, its an OK movie for the genre that is partially ruined by not being able to tell what the hell is going on.

I saw it was on Netflix instant and gave it a whirl...I'm not going to rip into this movie because it was full of clich√©s, its a monster movie for goodness sake. As far as the ancient idol\/horrible monster\/kill everyone around genre goes, its not bad at all. I enjoy Tom Sizemore as an actor and while the script was what one would expect of 4 credited (and lord knows how many uncredited) screenwriters, I felt he did a good job as his character. Honestly for a movie of this type, the acting was just fine. They weren't required to do much, but that was OK.However, if you watch this movie, get used to entire scenes where you have no idea what is happening because its so dark.
