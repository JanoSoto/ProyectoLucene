Even if it was pointed an attempt to highlight the corruption of the electoral process and those in pursuit of power, it obviously didn't work in the year of its release. Or, at least, it wasn't shown in Florida.So it's s high school matinée and a perfectly competent, affecting one at that. Reese Witherspoon was still waiting for Legally Blonde for her royal road to superstrdom but her performance is nothing less than assured. Broderickseems to want to make amends for all that Ferris Bueller put his own high school principal through, throwing himself into a self-perpetuating litany of self-assassinating sight gags.
