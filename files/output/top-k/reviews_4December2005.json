Subverting the usual fairy tale concepts, it's a milestone in adult animation, thanks to its intelligent plot, awesome characters and great movie references, especially the VERY subtle jokes about Disney films.The movie is a perfect mix of satire, action, comedy and romance that keeps delighting the audience even after the, say, twenty-fifth viewing. A lot of its charm is linked to the politically incorrect story and characters, which are voiced by some amazing people Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and, most of all, Eddie Murphy are the perfect vocal choices for the titular ogre, princess Fiona and Donkey, who is one of the best sidekicks (not just animated) in movie history, the motormouth animal having the same appeal and comic potential as Aladdin's Genie. This is one of those movies where you can sayEddie Murphy is a gas. And the supporting creatures are incredibly good too pick any fairy tale character you've heard of, and you'll find it in this movie (or the sequel), only totally different from what you expected (Pinocchio, Robin Hood, the Gingerbread Man, Snow White and the Dwarfs, everyone is included in one way or another and with a completely unexpected Dreamworks update that would make Walt Disney himself blush).Making the classic stories fresh and innovative for the new century (and millennium as well), Shrek demands to be seen by every kid, teenager and adult on the planet.Don't miss any chance to watch it!8,5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 December 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Four years on, Shrek still is a brilliant, original, charming and very funny animated feature.

The movie chronicles his experiences in four particular rooms...The first two episodes (written and directed by Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell), in which the protagonist is involved in a bizarre ritual and subsequently held hostage by a psycho, are decently acted by Lili Taylor and Jennifer Beals, but apart from that there's no particular reason to watch them, in fact after the first viewing they're totally skippable; the other two, on the other hand, are good in The Misbehavers (by Robert Rodriguez), the absolute best of the four stories, Ted has to deal with Antonio Banderas'nightmarish children, while in The Man from Hollywood (by Quentin Tarantino) he helps Chester Rusch (QT himself, who's enjoyable, but outacted by everyone else in the room) with a macabre bet...Rodriguez and Tarantino's segments are stuffed with black humor, extreme characters and ace acting (Tim Roth is terrific as the increasingly hysterical Ted) which make Four Rooms a very interesting film.

I found out you don't even have to be a fan of Hugh Grant (although I am personally) to really get the charm of this movie. Grant goes through all his usual stutters and silly manners but that's a thing he does very well. But Notting Hill doesn't have to rely on Hugh Grant alone, it's simply got a very witty and intelligent script by Richard Curtis (who later went on to write and direct Love Actually), fantastic British director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral), Julia Roberts at her most charming and best and a bundle of supporting actors who are quite simply excellent.Despite a 2 hour running time the film's never overlong. Full of sentiment to go along with the humor the 2 hours plus go by very fast.Highly recommended.

Roth is brave enough to show love among the hate, and to assign a limited degree of complicit guilt to the apparent victim the film gains greatly from both of these decisions. He also has interesting visual ideas the film is full of lonely, widescreen images in which the central subjects appear almost lost; and homely Devon has never looked wilder and less civilised than it does here, depicted in winter and at night. Roth also gets great performances from all his cast in what is essentially a four-hander, Tilda Swinton is good in a limited part, Ray Winstone shows (not for the first time) that he has talents beyond those required for his customary hard-man roles, but it's the young actors who are most outstanding Freddie Cunliffe as the troubled boy who discovers dark secrets, and especially the beautiful, opaque Laura Belmont who is simply tremendous as his sexually aware, not-as-cool-as-she-seems sister. At time the soundtrack seems a bit generic, and I'm not entirely convinced by the open ending, but this is still a better film than many directors make in their careers. On the strength of this movie, Roth should enjoy a long career behind the camera.
