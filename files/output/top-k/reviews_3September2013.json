I have loved all of his movies that i have seen him in so far. and do I like him in this film?Well I suppose - This movie is about love and all its complications dealing with Sam \/ Annie and Jonah. The Three of them are trying to find  magic  in a relationship - I personally have not yet felt magic in a relationship - I have not even dated at all so I do not relate to  magic  but I can somehow imagine the delightful feeling in ones heart when you see the difference in Annie as the movie goes on and she learns what magic feels like. The movie seemed just a little slow in the beginning in my opinion but after a bit it has a certain pace to it that is enjoying. The movie reminds me of a few other films yet Hanks and Ryan are charming and The Kid also helps out the movie go forward \/ I also believe that Hanks other films success kind of help \/ Hurt this one in away - I mean Im not comparing it to his other roles but this one seems specifically about love - and I would say its like 70 % romantic and 30 % comedy but again I liked the movie for what it set up and Tom \/ Meg and the kid did a good job in this film - also a little note I feel that Rob Reiner and Rosie O' Donnell were just alright in there supporting roles but in my opinion they would be under minor roles for this movie. I have to mention a scene that I liked was Annie watching Sam and Jonah goofing around on the beach - thats were it seemed to click for Annie to realize she was in love with both them from just watching them goof around - being themselves , I believe from then on she felt deep down  magic for Sam and even in away Jonah. That moment was something I would call a  spark  were it just was beautiful for what it was. That moment you could tell what her heart said to her. Final thoughts ? well Toms Hanks did an amazing job plays such likable and relatable characters ( including this one ) Meg did a decent job -Pullman who played Walter did alright the role kinda fell short - Like your about to marry her and you let her walk away ? He could have developed more. Also i would say like 2 or 3 slow bits that could have been tweaked. Other then that its a cute movie about love and Magic. Its worth watching once in your life.

This was the film that Walt Disney dedicated most of his life and career to get made. He and his exceptional team of geniuses lifted the characters and some story from P.L. Travers' decent books and transformed it into something that will stand the test of time.The story is about the dysfunctional Banks family in Edwardian London. The children Jane and Michael are rambunctious and keep annoying nannies out of the house. The parents, George and Winifred, are good people but are way too focused on their profession and causes to notice that the kids just want their love. Then comes Mary Poppins on her flying umbrella. She is a sweet but still stern lady who takes the kids on these whimsical adventures and sings catchy songs. But she's there for more than that (something way deeper), she is there to help mend the broken family.What makes great characters is a great cast, and that movie has it all. Julie Andrews (in her film debut) gives one of the best heroines ever put to screen. it is interesting how her character is never quite clear in her motivations, but that is also a great trait of her character. Andrews is practically perfect in every way. Dick Van Dyke gives a very funny and at times touching performance as her jack-of-all-trades cockney companion Bert. David Tomlinson gives possibly one of my favorite performances in any movie as Mr. Banks. You see his journey over the course of the film and the moment is beautiful when he realizes that his kids and his wife are more important than what his bosses (played memorably by Arthur Malet and Dick van Dyke in heavy makeup) at the bank tell him and what he thought was important. And Glynis Johns gives a funny performance as the chipper suffragette Mrs. Banks.The story and score are something to behold. This is one of the best thought out of any Disney movie before or since (except Beauty and the Beast) Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi concocted a story full of whimsy, sweetness, and surprisingly, very good drama. And then the Sherman Brother's score adds to the timeless quality of the film. There are showstoppers (Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious and A Spoonful of Sugar) but the ones I like are either subtle or just fun to watch and listen to, Step in Time, A Man has Dreams, and the best song of the movie Feed the Birds (which features a great cameo by the great Jane Darwell) The song gives away Mary Poppins' message, which is that the small things in life are important, and family love is the ultimate gift for any person young or old. The man who also held this all together and mixed them in a beautiful way was long time Disney director Robert Stevenson, knowing just when to blend lightness and whimsy with pathos and drama.Then there are the special effects. This is one of the first movies I saw where I was blown away (even as a little kid) because i thought it was all real. It's one of those films that uses special effects to tell the story, not to distract the viewer. Nowhere is this more evident than artist Peter Ellenshaw's masterpiece matte paintings. They are warm and nostalgic, and also thoroughly convincing. The animated sequence is fun too, with the waiter penguins being the best part of that whole adventureThis is Walt Disney's best film, and was hailed as such when it premiered in August 1964. His fingerprints were all over this film too, as he made really good contributions to the story and characters (he was the one who made the animated waiters Penguins, Brilliant!) The reviews and box office numbers were all outstanding. Then it was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews. Regrettably it did not win Best Picture, but it still has endured forever in the hearts and minds of children and adults who have seen it.Like the title of my review suggests, this is one of my all time favorite movies.

The movie indeed delivers. The story centers around Vietnam veteran Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins), whose experiences both prior and during the war have resulted in abnormal flashbacks and haunting hallucinations to the point where he can't tell which reality is and which is fantasy. In his ordeal, he becomes worse, living in what might be call hell on earth for him. Jacob must desperately try to figure out the truth about what had happened during his service in Vietnam and what is happening to him now. The movie drew from several inspirations for its story and effects, from such works as 1962's short film An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and the paintings of Francis Bacon. There are a number of familiar themes and symbolism in this film that makes the movie a thinking man's film. This is a story with many possible interpretations, each valid. The movie's setting can most closely be associated with purgatory, but another facet of this masterpiece is that it should be seen in within a Christian context. The film's title refers to the biblical story of Jacob's Ladder or the dream of a meeting place between Heaven and Earth in the Book of Genesis. Its little-known alternate title is Dante's Inferno, in a reference to the painting Inferno by Dante Alighieri. Surprising, one of the biggest influences for the film came from the Tibetan Book of the Dead where the writer spent two years in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal before writing this film. It can also be interpretation as Marxist to some. A marxist could say that Jacobs role as a postman was a bourgeois attempt to control proletarians by making them imagine they are leading a surreal life. When Jacob was hanging around the subway and hallucinating, he could have been coming to terms with the grief of being proletarian. That would explain why he saw deformed human figures on a train. I also see Gestalt psychology in this film. Gestalt dream interpretation upholds the principle that everything in a dream somehow is an aspect of the dreamer himself\/herself. This is one reason why I support the idea that everybody is a personification of Jacob himself dealing with guilt over what he thinks he's done to his Army buddies. Still, I have no idea about the interpretations of this movie, it's just a few ideas out there. The movie can be a bit confusing as it shifts back and forth between Jacob's chaotic memories of Vietnam, to this prior war memories, and then back to his present life as a mailman. Half of the time, you don't know what is going on. There is so many different sub-plots that it is hard to figure things out. You don't know if the army is out to get him, or if he is insane, or he's been dead the whole time. About the drug 'Ladder'. There are some theories that Jacob create the drug as he was a doctor before the war. In my opinion, there is no real drug in the movie. The drug is a metaphor of what triggers wars throughout history greed, anger, hatred. The more you go down the ladder, the more you come close to your primal state anger, fear, aggression for survival. Jezzy (Elizabeth Pena) is a depiction of his life temptations and his refusal to die. I just wish they explain more about this character and make clearer. The movie can be a bit of a twist, but honestly, it's pretty predictable. The movie is just creepy to the point that it influence other horror movies. It even did influence the Silent Hill video games series. One of the scariest scenes in the film is the hospital ride from hell with all those shaking bodies. It give me goose bumps. The film was too overwhelming to some audience, that about 20 minutes of disturbing scenes, mostly from the last third of the film, were removed from the final cut. Watch the director cut version that have all these scenes add to it, it's one of the few films that the director cut was better than the original. There are moments of nonsensical over the top horror clichés that the movie added. I do have to say it's better than the original screenplay. It was just too explicit and too obvious. In a sense, I think the movie was more 'realistic'. The out of place things can be explain if you think about it. Through this spiritual journey, he encounters the spirits of his friends. All the actors did pretty well in their roles Elizabeth Peña as Jezebel Jezzie Pipkin, Danny Aiello as Louis Denardo and even Macaulay Culkin as Gabe Singer. In my opinion, Macaulay looks out of place in this film. Tim Robbins was great in the film. He was just amazing. Just watch his reaction in the 'dream on' scene. Very heart breaking.

If you haven't seen the movie and do not want the major plot twists told beforehand you should avoid this review.I must admit I was one of those guys who went on a hunt for this movie just because it is the highest rated movie on this website. It was second place on general public top 250 when I decided I had to see it. Not to mention most recent high-rated films I am familiar with to a point of remembering, or hearing about; this one wasn't the case.To tell the truth I watched the movie three times now and I still haven't seen anything resembling greatness to be the highest acclaimed film in the most important website about cinema in the planet.It's not bad, but I found overshadowed by the immense hype surrounding it. It's certainly 7\/10 material in my book, but the idiotic fanboys along with the constant praise for it being superior film-making just slides it down a notch or two.The story about a guy that is innocently convicted and how his life develops inside the prison with a friend named Red and a few surprises here and there is well told. The so-called message it carries? Well, it seems people are all about that hope thing since he indeed is innocent of the crime he's in for, and how eventually he escapes prison leaving behind a hostile environment that never really believed in him, a warden that exploited his dry as much as he could, and of course beating the error of the system in his own game.He loses his whole life while at it though, but who cares, it's all about hope. It's hard to relate anything to real life since even the finale seems too wonderful to be true. The guy just goes to an obscure island and lives happily ever after. Even Red drops by when he's finally out on parole. Great deal.After 30 years digging a tunnel with a miniature pickaxe after being wrongly convicted for a crime he did not commit and stealing from the corrupt warden in the process sounds the absolute catharsis for some, I thought it was sad, sad that he lost his whole life in a prison, sad that he had to put up with all that crap for so long, sad that he must have been reintegrated after a while if somehow his story went on. Call me a pessimist, but that's not hope.I sometimes wonder what so many people saw in this movie that I was the only one on planet earth who did not quite get it. The only thing this movie taught me more than anything else is that democracy is not always the best regime. What did every one suddenly see that back in 1994 people did not?

The so-called message it carries? Well, it seems people are all about that hope thing since he indeed is innocent of the crime he's in for, and how eventually he escapes prison leaving behind a hostile environment that never really believed in him, a warden that exploited his dry as much as he could, and of course beating the error of the system in his own game.He loses his whole life while at it though, but who cares, it's all about hope. It's hard to relate anything to real life since even the finale seems too wonderful to be true. The guy just goes to an obscure island and lives happily ever after. Even Red drops by when he's finally out on parole. Great deal.After 30 years digging a tunnel with a miniature pickaxe after being wrongly convicted for a crime he did not commit and stealing from the corrupt warden in the process sounds the absolute catharsis for some, I thought it was sad, sad that he lost his whole life in a prison, sad that he had to put up with all that crap for so long, sad that he must have been reintegrated after a while if somehow his story went on. Call me a pessimist, but that's not hope.I sometimes wonder what so many people saw in this movie that I was the only one on planet earth who did not quite get it.

The acting was superb, from all characters, reminded me of Micheal Clark Duncan and the green mile, once i started watching i could not take my eyes away. there should be more movies like this more love for the art of film, to really give what it takes to create a wonderful masterpiece such as this. I am hoping that something will be created soon that will be able to live up to the legend of this movie.

It could have been more bold or daring, but it is just sentimental and nostalgic in a strange way I got the impression that the movie doesn't fully respect it's characters or their actions, which is not a problem if it creates a feeling of objective distance, but such detachment is broken by the sentimentalism should we miss glam rock or laugh at it? The movie is about glam rock as a musical and a social movement, as an attitude, but the general tone is closer to an elegy than to a defense without actually being neither.I liked the movie, though, specially Ewan McGregor and the performances by bands highly influenced by glam rock.

It had always made me cry. And still does. I admit at the age of 26 I still love this film. I hate Elizabeth's mother, she is controlling.I was happy when I saw this on DVD in a store near me, and although it was cheap I wondered if I should get it. No regrets, now I can watch it over and over. And cry at the end. I have just finished watching it and some tears were streaming. You have to watch it till the end to understand. I have watched Rik Mayall in Bottom-a British comedy. I didn't know he had broken out in America, well I was young. I love his look in the film, and thought he and Elizabeth were good for each other (I know he wasn't real). My niece who aged 5 likes this film, although she hasn't watched it all, I will gladly show her. I know she will enjoy it.

Worthy message, but film, despite some moments of insight, is really superficial. The Judd Nelson character(the angry rebel) is such an obnoxious jerk, that you don't want to see him end up with Ringwald(the princess) It is an unintended irony that the Paul Gleason character(not deemed worthy of sympathy it seems...) is more often than not right.And I doubt they remained friends during school hours for long, though film was at least wise enough to pose the question.

Acting is as usual awesome by all the actors, eg. Neo's body language is a novelty. Dialogues has become part of daily parlance, like My way or highway etc. which are work of literature.

The idea that we are in a matrix(mayajaal) from Indian philosophy. & this is where it triumphs . Neo is a seeker of truth. Morpheus being his rightful guide(spiritual Guru). Agents being different form negativities which will try to block your spiritual ascent. The computer generated world is what we see in our daily life but would never understand till we'r self-realized, as Neo in last lines says to get connected i.e. to the all pervading superpower & only then we will know our real powers surely we will may not start flying like superman, but may be it's a possibility. But surely one's perception will change a lot, (symbolically Neo sees the code going through matrix). So, i would wish the ardent fans who have really understood the essence of the movie will do something practical(Yoga please, check the right meaning). This will be right tribute to Matrix makers.
