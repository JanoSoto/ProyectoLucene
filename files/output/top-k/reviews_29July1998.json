In far too many respects, I get the feeling that plot elements, dialogue, or settings are inserted because of their mass appeal, and how they will look in 30-second TV spots. This is to action films what Moonraker was to the James Bond series an utter contrivance, in which characters and logic are sacrificed in order to set up an unlikely but visually spectacular situation. Just as Bond was returned to his roots in subsequent films, we can only hope that those responsible for this film realize that they've pushed the envelope (and their luck) far enough. Now that we've narrowly avoided extinction from an incoming Texas-sized cliché, one hopes that the next film from Bruckheimer features a better plot and more intelligence, not a bigger disaster with a dumber redneck hero. If we keep going along this path, we'll have a high-school dropout garage mechanic preventing a supernova by swallowing a nuclear weapon and belching the national anthem at the sun.

I don't consider myself critical of date movies per se, but this one changed my  entire perception of the chick flick genre.  It's one of those films which, for me, don't seem that profound until a few days after you've seen them.   Then you start thinking about certain scenes or feelings those scenes provoked in you.  The more I watch this film, the more I enjoy it.  The famous scene  (anyone familiar at all with this movie knows the one I am referring to) inspired me to do the same thing for my ex-girlfriend when, in May of 1998, she left me because she hadn't grown up to want what we had.  This film holds a special place in my heart, as does its love theme (which broke through the night air  at 1230am when I stood outside re-enacting the sweetest, simplest, most heart-tearing demonstration of love I have ever seen in a motion picture).  I am not  writing this review to comment on one scene, however, but rather on the brilliance of it as a whole and that of its director, Cameron Crowe.  He never  forgets that life is made up of moments and as such includes scenes which, while they don't necessarily advance the plot, stay in your mind and your heart  long after you've forgotten the film's title and story years afterwards.  Say Anything... is one of my favorite movies because it explores things that have  always been close to my heart (the possibility that adults, though older, may not be able to understand certain places of love when they've never had  anything so intimate to relate to, the insecurity and mixed emotions that go with being your own person, and the kind of selflessness, spontaneity, and  tenderness that define what real love is all about).  This was one of the best films of 1989.
