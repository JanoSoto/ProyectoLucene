Of all Quentin's films this has the keenest attention to character, as unlike a lot of movies that have hardly one dimension to the main role, this gives a past, a present, and a future to almost the entire line up, as this is as much Ordell's (Jackson) or Max's (Forster) movie as it is Jackie's (Grier). I can understand why there's a few people out there that don't really like this entry as after the tough and memorable Reservoir dogs, and the brilliant vibrancy of Pulp fiction many movie goers were expecting yet more again, and what they got was a hugely talky, slower paced piece that didn't feel like it was getting anywhere soon. But this is something that grows on you the more you watch it, as I must have seen it about four times now and I pick up new things I hadn't even noticed because there's just so much to it. It really is something you can watch every 18-20 months on a cycle. Performance wise this is quite brilliant, nobody is making up the numbers, everyone is on top form, and even though Grier is known as an exploitation star she has always been a good actress, and here she is faultlessly natural.

The second Home Alone didn't make as much money as the first Home Alone, and while neither of these movies are bad I'm surprised they made as much money as they did. It seems like movies that have tried to copy off the slapstick humor or even Home Alone theme haven't done as well since the first two. I mean one movie I like more than Home Alone and feel like it has more of a plot, is Blank Check. If you watch Blank Check, you'll notice numerous similarities. While I believe you can find the first two movies on TV all year around, you'll most definitely find them on TV during the Holiday Season on channels like ABC Family. I even have a friend who called the Holiday Season The Home Alone Season, as these films are on TV then and seem like the most popular Christmas films. When movie rental stores were open it was hard to rent Home Alone around Christmas. These Home Alone movies show a somewhat wealthy family getting ready for a vacation. I mean a family that is going on vacation with their extended family to Paris in the first film and Florida in the second. In both movies, the youngest Kevin doesn't get on the plane with them. They're movies that will put you in the Holiday Season spirit. I mean, I'm sure most of us have watched both Home Alone movies more than once. I always enjoy watching them during the Holiday Season as they get you into the Christmas Spirit, and you'll probably really remember the movie from past Holiday Seasons. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie outside the Holiday Season, because just like you likely wouldn't listen to Christmas music outside the Holiday Season, this movie makes the Holiday Season special, just gives you a feeling of it. But, what I like better about the second movie than first. I watched the first movie like six months ago and didn't enjoy it as much. Yeah, I'm sure I'll see it again especially during the holiday season, but I've noticed the first one seems somewhat dark, quiet, it seems mostly about Kevin, and there aren't many exciting scenes until the climax which we mostly remember the movie for. I like the 2nd one, because it is less quiet, I mean Kevin is around more people while in the first movie he was just in his quiet neighborhood that all his neighbors seemed to leave. In this one, he's in NYC the City that never sleeps, and NYC is really exciting and fun to be at during the Holiday Season as this movie clearly shows, and it shows Florida as not being as exciting to be at during the Holiday Season as like whenever they show his family in Florida, it's raining. Kevin has more excitement, as rather than just being left at home he is having his own vacation in a really nice hotel along with getting a limousine. It shows a toy store Duncan's Toy Chest, which is supposed to be off of FAO Schwartz. The traps in this movie are more funny and violent, I mean I crack up every time I watch this movie, and a lot of the traps would have left the burglars dead. So, it will likely keep you laughing as we see a face off between Kevin and the burglars. It's also a great movie to watch if you want to see the excitement of NYC during the holiday season. While this movie isn't like my favorite movie I give it a 10\/10 because I think it is well done.

Probably no one expected a sequel to be made, let alone so soon. And, as far as sequels go, it's quite good, even if it is a mixed bag.It takes places literally straight after the events of the first film and we see the original film's hero (Charlton Heston's 'Taylor') riding off with his new girlfriend, only to run into some - unseen - trouble. But, hot on his heels, is another astronaut who has been sent to rescue him. This is where the story gets a bit odd. It's hard to put your finger on it, but you're given your original hero, only to have him taken away from you minutes into the film and replaced with someone who looks and acts a lot like him, but isn't him.So we follow 'Taylor Mk II' as he too journeys into the kingdom of the apes (and all the trouble that comes with it). Then, it sort of glides from a sequel (i.e. new story) into a kind of rehash of the last one. 'New Taylor' meets up with the same apes and gets chased again then imprisoned (as Charlton did previously). However, the second half picks up. And, when I say 'picks up' I mean takes on an 'original flavour' while at the same time completely going in a different direction which doesn't feel like an 'apes' movie and more.In case you haven't already seen it, I won't go into detail about what Taylor and his mate find 'below' the planet, but, even though it is a little weird sometimes, it is quite fun. It was certainly inventive for the time.All in all, Beneath the Planet of the Apes is an enjoyable ride that falls victim of being a little uneven sometimes. Plus it would never entirely live up to the original due to being unable to match its predecessor's shock ending. Part 2 ends, in some people's opinions, unsatisfactory.

This movie falls into the film genre under action thriller. This movie fits well into the typical crime drama that we all know so well. This movie has two hit men, a boxer, his girlfriend, and a gangster's wife. The main point of the story is the two hit mean Vincent Vega and Jules are on a mission to retrieve a briefcase that has something mysterious insides that leaves the audience guessing. While the two men are on their quest, they encounter some problems like a restaurant robbery, a dead body in the back of their car, and a boxer on the run. The editing and the transition in this film were amazing and had perfect timing to make the movie flow smooth. There were perfect establishing shots that set up the scenes and give you an idea of what the story line was going to look like. The sound of music throughout the movie had good synchronous sound. The music fits into the background and the scenes really pop and fit together with the sound effects that were chosen. Some of those scenes would not have been as intense if the right music was not put into the correct places. This movie is hard not to get emotionally involved in. As stated above, the music or score elicit plays a major part in making scenes related to the audience. For example, the car scene where the gun goes off accidentally and the sound effect off the gun going off has a huge impact on someone's feeling and the way they react to it. This is not the only scene where music comes into play and makes an impact on the viewers. Cinematography is another art of film making that supports the tone of the movie. The camera perspective, the positions, and the camera distances. Pulp Fiction uses a variety of zoom shots and deep focus shots that you have eye level shots that really focus in on the characters and capture their facial expressions. The angels and the position of the camera really allows the audience to be involved in the film. Everything that it takes to make this film happen works through the magic of cinematography. After watching this film for the first time, I can't say I can pin point the meaning of the movie. There are three different story's that happened within this film and they are tied together to make the film a true thriller. I believe every movie has a story behind each one and something to tell the audience about morals and everyday decisions with the impact of real life situations. Being a first time viewer and not knowing what to expect I had no personal influences or any biases that made my decision regarding this film. I loved everything about the movie, the plot, and the characters. Pulp Fiction was well written and directed and I loved it. This movie was enjoyable to me because it had twists and turns and it kept me guessing about the briefcase. I was able to follow the dialog and stay interested throughout the entire movie without missing any key points.After everything is said and done I would 100% recommend this movie to anyone looking for a new action thriller. The actors are mind blowing and the movie is so different in a way that's hard to explain without viewing it for yourself. Nothing about this film will disappoint you and it will leave you wanting more.

Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Is about a young high school student, named Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), living in Hill Valley, who is friends with the, genius with a little bit of crazy, scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who to travels back from the year 1985, to November 5th 1955, in a time travelling DeLorean. He gets stuck in 1955 and runs into his future parents when they were in high school, the only way for Marty to find a way back to 1985 is with the help of his friend Dr. Brown. First thing that came to my mind after I had watched the movie was the fact that the whole McFly family's lives got better after the crazy adventure Marty had been through in 1955. In the beginning you see how Biff (Wilson), basically bullies and dominates over, Marty's father, George (Glover). Then when Marty goes back to the future he tries to encourage his father to stand up for himself and ask Marty's mother, Lorraine (Thompson), out, even though she's in love with Marty. In the end Marty and George make a plan to make her fall in love with George instead of Marty. The plan is that Marty parks with Lorraine, he argues with her, then George comes and fights Marty to show that he can stand up for himself. Then it ends up by Biff being in the car grabbing Lorraine and trying to seduce her, while Marty is carried away, then George goes to the car opens up the door, and gets two options, either he really stands up for himself and saves Lorraine from Biff, or he just walks away like nothing happened. George chooses to stand up for Lorraine, and punches Biff in the face and he goes right down on the ground. This broke the whole pattern that had lead George to get held back by bad self-confidence and spent time doing Biff's homework for him and being bullied by him. So not only does personal life and his children's lives get improved, by them getting better jobs, but also his career takes off and he publishes a book on science fiction stories that he's been writing since high school.Second thing that came to my mind is that the story of how Lorraine and George fell in love changes, after Marty's trip to the 50s. At first the story is that, Lorraine's father hits George with the car, then George gets brought into the house and Lorraine falls in love with him, then they go together to the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance where they first kiss. When Marty goes to 1955, he sees his father almost get hit by the car, but then he pushes his father out of the way and gets hit by the car himself and gets brought into Lorraine's house. Then Lorraine falls in love with Marty, which will change the whole story of how Lorraine and George will fall in love. As earlier mentioned, George won Lorraine over by standing up for her and himself, against Biff. Hence their love story goes from her just pitying him, to her actually feeling safe with him and loving him for a better reason. The story doesn't only sound better if they tell it to people, but it has also had a great effect on how their future together looks. In the beginning you see Lorraine, drinking, looking pretty unhealthy etc. you also get to see how George is not paying so much attention to her or showing any form of affection for her or even communicating well with her. Then after, you see how much healthier Lorraine is, and also how much George shows his affection for her, by i.e. walking with her and having his arm over her shoulder constantly, and teases her like they're still teenagers. Overall the transition of the McFly family's lives is what struck me the most in this adventurous and exciting movie. The transition of how the family went from unconsciously unhappy to a great successful family, not only career wise due to their father having an improvement in confidence, but also relationship wise, especially the parents.

OK, let's toss in Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Ed Begley, Jr. And of course there's also Guest himself as a key part of the ensemble. These are hilariously funny people. Which makes the fact that this is not a hilariously funny movie a little puzzling. Best in Show is funny but not outrageously so. A funny idea, certainly a funny cast, but not a consistently funny movie. There are a few really funny moments. But the movie ends up producing more wry smiles than big laughs. It leaves you wanting more.The movie takes place in the rather bizarre dog show world. We focus on five dogs, and their inevitably strange owners, as they make the trek to and ultimately compete in the big dog show in Philadelphia. There's a guy who literally has two left feet and whose wife apparently has slept with every man on the planet. There's a campy gay couple and a neurotic yuppie couple. A trophy wife, married to an oblivious elderly man, and her lesbian dog handler. And an aspiring ventriloquist. All in all a weird bunch. At times perhaps a little too weird for the movie's good. A lot of strange things happen to these strange people. Some of these things are funny but there are a bunch of gags and jokes which fall flat. The movie perks up a bit when we finally get to the dog show itself. That is thanks largely to the presence of Willard who plays perhaps the world's worst television color commentator. He's clearly the funniest thing this movie has going for it. All the other performers do reasonably well but there are times where things just seem a bit off. Maybe the story doesn't quite work, maybe the characters aren't really developed properly. With all these great comic stars you expect hilarity and you don't really get that. The stars do the best they can with the material but you feel that the material let them down a bit. They all have their moments. Posey in particular does really well. And even in a film chock-full of performers with such notable reputations there's room for some lesser-known actors, such as Michael Hitchcock and John Michael Higgins, to turn in good work as well. There's just the sense that director Guest didn't quite pull it all together. This is a movie with such a great cast. That cast could have been put to a little bit better use.

For some reason, I immediately compared the film to Predator &#x96; 'I thought the surroundings in Predator were good, but Deliverance beats it by far with the beautiful untouched countryside and the Cahulawassee River that runs through it.' I continued, saying that Deliverance is a 'masterful portrayal of each man's change of character under stress'. I was initially surprised by the maturity of that comment, but I'm fairly sure I copied it from the DVD case. I rounded the review off by naming it a 'real treat' and a 'top notch thriller'. Despite its plagiarism and mere 110 word length, I agree with the little I wrote 9 years ago. The film was 33 at the time; it is now 42 and as good as ever.The film, which is based on the book by James Dickey, follows Ed (Jon Voight), Drew (Ronny Cox), Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Lewis (Burt Reynolds). The three men are contented, middle-class executives who would gladly play golf in lieu of hunting, climbing and rafting. The only reason the trip happened was because of Lewis, a competitive, playground bully and some sort of survivalist. Unlike the others, he has no time for humour in the Georgia wilderness; he takes himself and the trip very seriously, appearing to consider it a spiritual exercise akin to the Aboriginal tradition of walkabout.The unlikable Lewis almost immediately takes a churlish disliking to Bobby, addressing him as 'chubby', barking orders at him and interrupting him with smug, portentous monologues about his ostensible understanding of their majestic, harsh surroundings. Before the relationships between the four men can be explored in a normal fashion, they are thrown into an extraordinary situation in a scene that has since become infamous for its line 'squeal like a piggy'. What follows is a thriller that achieves an uncommon resonance because of the everyday, almost banal qualities of its characters; they are real people in a real situation rather than stock characters being assailed by monstrous caricatures.Like I said in 2005, it is indeed a beautifully verdant film. The 'Cahulawasse River' isn't a real river, the turbulent rapids and beautiful surrounding forests that we see are that of the Chattooga River in Georgia. The landscape and their traversing of it is well captured; I shared the four men's expressions of wired engrossment as they negotiated the dangerous rapids with the utmost concentration, and I felt their elation too when they reached the tranquillity of the calmer waters. The excellent Blu-Ray surround sound places you there, it enveloped me with the interminable sounds of buzzing insects and rushing water. Despite everything that happens in Deliverance, the film certainly makes me want to travel.The wild local people were well cast, they were seemingly picked from some West Virginia backwood, providing the film with a morbid authenticity. Perhaps the most memorable villager is the teenage banjo virtuoso played by Billy Redden in the famous Duelling Banjos sequence. He was picked from a school in the local area and isn't actually playing the banjo, the arms and fingers we see actually belong to a musician sitting behind the bench with his arms through Redden's sleeves. While the film is best known for its plucking banjos, it makes great use of a synthesiser in a few instances, producing this chilling monotone hum that works particularly well when Ed become entangled underwater.The performances are good, but they aren't given that much dramatic range as there isn't much dialogue, for large portions of the film the performances rely on physicality. I am nit- picking here and not entirely decided, but with his wide-eyed expressions and animated ungainly movements, I felt that Voight was at times rather exaggerated in his conveyance of being a city slicker unused to the rugged Appalachian terrain. It is perhaps Ned Beatty's assailant Bill McKinney who deserves the most praise, because as Burt Reynolds points out during the 40th anniversary reunion of the four men, he kept his eyes open without fault for a quite remarkable length of time, anyone who's been locked in a bitter staring competition can attest that it's no small feat!I haven't read James Dickey's novel, I have found it quite a difficult book to find, but I have heard that, unsurprisingly, the characters are given a more detailed backstory. I would have welcomed a longer film with greater character development, but it works admirably as a stripped down survivalist thriller.Deliverance is one of those films that I will always be fond of.

I am nit- picking here and not entirely decided, but with his wide-eyed expressions and animated ungainly movements, I felt that Voight was at times rather exaggerated in his conveyance of being a city slicker unused to the rugged Appalachian terrain. It is perhaps Ned Beatty's assailant Bill McKinney who deserves the most praise, because as Burt Reynolds points out during the 40th anniversary reunion of the four men, he kept his eyes open without fault for a quite remarkable length of time, anyone who's been locked in a bitter staring competition can attest that it's no small feat!I haven't read James Dickey's novel, I have found it quite a difficult book to find, but I have heard that, unsurprisingly, the characters are given a more detailed backstory. I would have welcomed a longer film with greater character development, but it works admirably as a stripped down survivalist thriller.Deliverance is one of those films that I will always be fond of. My first viewing came at a time when my cinematic horizons were rapidly broadening along with my prized DVD collection, which I proudly ordered and compartmentalised in rectangular shelves across my bedroom walls. I'm glad that I can say without reservation that one of my favourite films still holds up.92%www.hawkensian.com ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"25 September 2014","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Watched one of All time Favorite Ridley Scott Films thats Gladiator one of my favorite Revenge\/Sword & Sandals flick Films Featured an Amazing Performance from a Stellar Lead By Russell Crowe(L.A.

The impact, the delivery, the timing, and the overall stamp it has placed in cinema history can never be duplicated. See, there are bad movies, good movies, great movies, and trailblazers. The trailblazers are films that jump-start a movement, revolutionize the industry, change the landscape of motion pictures, and delivers an impact whether immediate (Star Wars) or down the road (Fight Club) that never exits the general consensus.Wizard of Oz, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Psycho, Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Graduate, and Goodfellas are all examples of films that are trailblazers. None of these films have any contemporaries, they are their own category and all films of similar genres become compared to them. Pulp Fiction is a 90s indie trailblazer that absolutely altered the entire culture of movies by crafting what at the time was easily one of the most jarring, unexpected, stylish, and wholesome cinematic experiences ever witnessed.Pulp Fiction was a low-budget flick with such high aspirations that 1994 didn't know how to handle it. The soundtrack (among the best in film history), the unexpected blend of violence, drugs, and realistic dialogue, the surprises, the utter lack of chronological order, the style, the tone, and the overall look of Pulp Fiction made it stand out not just among the films of the 90s, but everything preceding it. It talks like a Scorsese movie, moves like a 1950s Italian neorealism flick, paces like a spaghetti western, and breathes like an underground comic book come to life. Pulp Fiction is tasty cinematic soup.Pulp Fiction knew it was cool before the viewer did. Pulp Fiction knew that its audience was going to put up with the 150 minutes of dialogue because the characters were so strong, the story lines were unique, and there were so many details (explained and unexplained) that it required multiple viewings to catch it all, and jump-started urban legends and mysteries that remain unsolved to this day. It was a movie that created its own culture and fanbase that would follow madman Quinten Tarantino for the entirety of his career---through the bad (Death Proof) and the good (Django Unchained).Everything in this movie works. The cast was downright phenomenal and nearly miraculous considering the budget (Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, AND Christopher Walken in one movie??!!). The dialogue was sharp, witty, brutal, and breathes life into each character you see within the pulp-influenced saga. The directing by Tarantino was practically flawless as he makes transforms the camera into a curious witness by mixing in a barrage of close-ups, long shots, and spastic movement that never feels like its framing a shot but more so just following the story along where ever the action was going.This movie literally has it all sex, violence, drugs, rock n' roll, dancing, singing, crime, morality issues, romance, revenge, monologues, potential miracles, shootouts, dark humor, dozens of film references, and even a couple glimpses of the California underworld that most people would rather not know about. And all this was accomplished without a Hollywood budget. There was a slight sense of amateurism that gave the movie an edge, like a black sheep in the meadows of the film industry. This would inspire an entire wave of budding, ambitious, and hopeful filmmakers that also had their stories to tell and didn't want to cater to the typical Hollywood output or abide by its rules. Pulp Fiction is a B-Movie setup executed like an underground masterpiece from the dialogue-heavy start to the sudden finish.You can't duplicate this. I couldn't duplicate this. Tarantino could never duplicate this. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films ever made, and a perfect storm of innovative filmmaking that lifted 1994 into one of the best years of film that has ever existed---and launched an entire era of indie filmmaking that still has its effects on the industry today.

A lot of them have to do with not following King's novel all that closely, but it's been so long since I read it that it doesn't make much difference to me now. The one thing I remember though has to do with the baseball card; in the book I think it was Koufax, not Mantle. I could be wrong, but when the scene came up I was expecting a Sandy Koufax card, so maybe my memory is playing tricks on me, maybe not. Perhaps some day I'll check it out to be sure.The interesting thing about this story was the way old Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) got all the folks in Castle Rock to turn on each other by not pitting likely adversaries against one another. Sort of like a domino effect where one unsuspecting citizen tripped up the next one in line with more and more disastrous results. The backdrop of the curiosity shop was a cool one for me because I like antiques and old things myself. The collecting urge isn't there any more though, so chances are I would have been a casual observer with all the insanity going on.There was some good casting here besides Sydow who appeared to be having a devil of a time. I enjoy Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia in most any other movie I've seen them in, but I have to say, Amanda Plummer as Nettie and Valri Bromfield as Wilma were perfect for their roles. Their vicious tete a tete with the strains of 'Ave Maria' in the background was an inspired piece of work. Even old Raider managed to do a good job with his limited involvement.

There always seems like something isn't quite right. The only issue for me is, you never quite place what the movies' theme is. There bit's and pieces you can interpret and figure out, but the overall theme seems a bit lost on me. What made these boys so obsessed? Their looks? Does this mean the theme is about looks? I really don't know, and if it had been more clear, I would have loved this movie, but because of my confusion, I only liked it.The movie felt like a mix of American Beauty and Donnie Darko. I think that's a pretty good way of putting it. It has a lot of odd things going on. Some of these weird scenes work well, but others... Not as much. Perhaps it's because Sofia Coppola was just starting her directing career and she was trying to figure out her own style. That's what this movie feels like. There are pieces of Sofias style that is present in her later movies, but there's a lot that feels out of her comfort zone. I think the film shows her potential that she eventually expanded upon. One thing I loved was the soundtrack. Both the score and the 70's music used worked really well, and it was cool to hear some of those great 70's classics. Also a lot of the visual style of the flashback-esque scenes of Lux look really great and establish her and the girls as beautiful and dream like. Overall I think it's an interesting movie that has potential, but I don't think it quite delivered 100%. Perhaps the the book that this film was based on is more clear with it's themes and ideas, but this film just wasn't clear enough for me.

Christmas Vacation, released in 1989, was brilliantly written by John Hughes and directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. This laugh out loud comedy promises to have everyone entertained throughout its 97 minute runtime with performers such as Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, and Randy Quaid. Christmas Vacation is bound to entertain the whole family through its many big name performers, its surprise plot twists, and its relatability to many families. Christmas Vacation is filled with many surprises beginning to end. Chevy Chase (Clark Griswold) and Bevery D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold) want to get the whole extended family over for one big Griswold family Christmas. A family dinner is planned with a highly anticipated summer surprise announcement for the Griswold family. Little do the Griswolds know though, the Christmas weekend will be a lot more work than they originally thought. The Griswold family Christmas is filled with frozen eyes, burning trees, a surprise visit from Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), a police raid, and much much more. Can the Griswolds overcome their holiday troubles and salvage a pleasant family get-together? Christmas Vacation makes a very good connection to the viewing audience because many people can relate to the Griswold Family. This movie is a classic example of how family get-togethers, especially around the holiday season, cannot be all they are cracked up to be. Even though the Griswolds have a lot of hardships in the movie, they show how family can come together to make the best of poor decisions. Clark and Ellen Griswold make one of the most relatable husband and wife duos in the film industry. Bickering goes on between Clark and Ellen throughout the movie due to their lack of wise decisions\/ ideas. However, they always end up supporting each other in the end no matter the outcome. Randy Quaid serves as the perfect example of that one annoying family member that everyone has. Pretty much everything he does in the movie ends up being a giant failure. Even though Quaid's character is not the sharpest tool in the shed though, he definitely wins the award for having the biggest heart. The director did an excellent job at making this movie relatable to all viewers through the various personalities each character possesses and through the many events that occur throughout the Griswold family Christmas.If you are looking for a good movie to watch with the entire family this holiday season, look no further than National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. The cast and director have come together to make a perfect movie that relates to everyone who ever has had or attempted to have a family holiday party. This film will make you laugh and say wow, our family is kind of like the Griswolds! This year be sure to deck the halls by watching the one of a kind Christmas special - National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.
