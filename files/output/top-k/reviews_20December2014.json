Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, The Godfather, and many more would easily fit into that category, and certainly those movies along with your favorite that I'm leaving out all should be in the discussion whenever we talk about the best movie ever made.But whenever I'm asked that question, be it now (five days before Christmas in 2014) or in mid June or July, the movie that I always come back to time and again is the iconic Christmas movie, It's a Wonderful Life. This movie is the greatest film ever made.The film features James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who dreams of seeing the world only to be a victim of fate that finds him staying in his hometown and running the family business, the Bailey Savings & Loan Company in the fictional town of Bedford Falls. James Stewart turns out the performance of his career (barring no other role, including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). The tale sees him fall in love with Mary (Donna Reed, who offers a similarly strong performance as supporting actress). The two are wed and life goes well for a while, until a fateful day when George's world comes crashing down on him, prompting him to wish he had never been born...only to eventually realize what a wonderful life he has.The story is of course much more complex than that brief summary, but it's the story itself that is the most prevalent star in this movie. The script is a masterpiece in the art of conveying an entertaining and emotional narrative, taking the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Over the course of two hours you grow to love George Bailey for his character and his perseverance in standing up for the little guy against the tyrannical Mr. Potter, the film's antagonist. When George is elated, you feel it with him. When the frustration of life overwhelms him, you sympathize with him. When he finds himself in the midst of great despair, your heart breaks. And when his grief turns to joy, your heart swells....along with your eyes. I cannot watch this film without crying time and again in its final minutes.Along with the acting and the script, the other major contributing factor to this movie being such a wonderful film is its cinematography. I have seen this movie pop up on film noir lists from time to time, and I'm not sure that I would agree with that categorization at all, given that film noir movies tend to be more tragic in nature. That said, though, there are a few scenes in which the film uses strong shadow effect in a similar way that noir films are known to do. In at least two scenes, Stewart is shown staring prominently into the camera as he realizes the gravity of certain situations he finds himself in. Those scenes become impressed in your memory after you've seen the film a time or two, and overall the film is well produced with good scenes and settings, and good camera work.All of this makes It's a Wonderful Life my pick for the Greatest Film Ever Made. We may not always think of it immediately when we're sitting around the picnic table in the summertime thinking about great movies, but it's nevertheless a top notch movie that stands out for its artistic and cinematic value in a way that makes it much more than just a Christmas movie. The wonderful story and well constructed script, the tremendous acting, and the excellent camera-work and film production all make this movie the cream of the crop.10 out of 10 stars!

The main reason it is enjoyable is because it is more of a comedy than anything else. Most sports movies attempt to be inspirational by having an underdog team win the championship against insurmountable odds, usually with some kind of emotional conflict in it (e.g. Remember the Titans, Miracle, Rudy, The Perfect Game, The Express, Brian's Song). While Cool Runnings does feature an underdog team and has some amount of emotion in it, there is a much different feel to it than the aforementioned films. This is likely because it is not base on a true story, or at least very loosely, has no overriding emotional subplot, and has lots of humor mixed in with it. It also helps that the team is good evidently pretty good, but metaphorically crashes and burns due to unfortunate circumstances at the end. However, there is still an air of inspiration to the end sequence as the world recognizes their feats. The main characters are each easy to root for and likable in their own way. Their personalities are well developed and plausible as well as their relationships with each other. Derice and Sanka are friends already, so they obviously have pretty good character chemistry right from the start, though Derice has relatively little personality. Junior gets along well enough with the other four guys by being moderately outgoing. Yul is obviously averse to his teammates, but gradually pushes his emotions and pride aside to relate and collaborate with his teammates while retaining his cold personality. Irv is the only character that I have seen portrayed by John Candy who is not cheerful. However, Candy pulls off being a secluded and sorrowed guy. He does not contribute very much humor to the plot, but is nonetheless a good character. We can clearly see that the team sort of gives him hope, even if he tries to hide it.The sports element of the movie doesn't really kick in until after about forty-five minutes when the team gets to Calgary for the Olympics. Here, the emotional conflict is kicked up a notch in terms of Irv's dispute with the board and Junior standing up to his dad. There are only a few bobsled runs that are shown, and some of them are done for comical purposes. The front-runner Swiss team are kind of put in the villain position here, and we have a couple of encounters between the Jamaican and the Swiss athletes. Apart from that, we see some training scenes throughout.Finally we have the comedy element. The humorous moments come at a pretty constant rate with the same feel to the gags and lines. Some of the humor comes simply because of the absurd idea of a Jamaican bobsled team. Sanka contributes the most laughs out of anyone from his antics on the ice, to his three pump-up songs that he composes throughout, and other various jokes. The one scene that is devoted purely to comedy is the scene where the team tries to raise enough money to get them to Calgary. The technical execution is nothing special, but the acting and scripting is fine for the most part. One could maybe argue that it discriminates against Jamaicans, but I don't know enough about Jamaica to discuss this. The story is not award-winning by any means, but in a movie that is just sort of suppose to be fun, a strong story is not entirely necessary. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a good kid friendly comedy that isn't geared too strongly towards kids. I will caution prospective viewers not to be misguided into thinking this is a stereotypical inspirational sports film, because it isn't. It's not something I would recommend you rush out to buy, but if you happen to come across it, it's worth a try.

These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.Right movie from the beginning of the movie, the music is haunting.

I never ask for a second favor when I have been refused the first. Don't tell me you're innocent, because it exhausts my intelligence. Don't ever take sides with anyone against your family. Women and children can be careless but not men. The distress look on Brandon's face when he finds out his war hero son is invariably pulled into the underworld business, the silent tears of acknowledgement when he hears the news of his other son's murder and simply says I want no acts of vengeance shows that some actors don't need big dialogues to act.The final stages between father and son are beautifully portrayed. A concerned father advising his son, the last person he thought would be his successor. And the dutiful son consoling his dad that We'll get there.The music is not just background score but also underlines the essence of the movie.

I never ask for a second favor when I have been refused the first. Don't tell me you're innocent, because it exhausts my intelligence. Don't ever take sides with anyone against your family. Women and children can be careless but not men. The distress look on Brandon's face when he finds out his war hero son is invariably pulled into the underworld business, the silent tears of acknowledgement when he hears the news of his other son's murder and simply says I want no acts of vengeance shows that some actors don't need big dialogues to act.The final stages between father and son are beautifully portrayed. A concerned father advising his son, the last person he thought would be his successor. And the dutiful son consoling his dad that We'll get there.The music is not just background score but also underlines the essence of the movie. Attentions to details like the steady flow of water, chirping of the birds, are hard to ignore.The climax of the movie where he lies with so much conviction to his beloved wife completes the transformation of Al from a civilian to the head of the Corleone family.

I cannot imagine The War Zone being better directed by anyone else, even though Ingmar Bergman and Ken Loach come to mind. Roth and his actors, and Stuart's screenplay, understand these people and their situation down to the final nuance, and are willing to let silence, timing and visuals reveal what dialogue would cheapen.

Basic gist, a diplomat (Irons) is obsessed with the local opera in 1940s China, and falls head over heels for a lead singer (Lone), believing him to be a woman due to ignorance of the gender roles in Chinese theatre. However, this 'Butterfly' uses this to squeeze French Government secrets out of the hopeless diplomat for the 'Reds'.Perhaps a little condensed from its original form, and not as visceral as Cronenburg's more famous works, 'M.

The key driving force of the film is really our two leads, with Irons being predictably solid as the typical middle class man of the era, though Lone is easily the bigger revelation. He is able to play both genders rather convincingly, and if I held up a picture of him to you without telling you who it is, you'd swear it was a woman. It's a combination of great make-up work and Lone's rather underrated skill to fully embrace the mannerisms of his role (see my praise of his work on 'Iceman' for more), playing up the submissive and ethereal qualities often tied to Oriental women, that make this performance so effective.Everything else is par for the course Cronenburg is a slick director and keeps the film trundling along at a good pace, the production values are lovely and give you the full scope of a changing China, and Howard Shore's score is suitably moving yet also enigmatic and does incorporate Puccini's 'Madam Butterfly' in at points, mainly towards the end. However, it's the script itself that does fall a little short it's paced a little too quickly, and some scenes feel really condensed and choppy just to accommodate a film runtime, especially with regards to the relationship between our two leads, as well as the bigger changes in China.

For kids raised on WWII films like saving private Ryan and Band of Brothers with those films you get a good Technicolour look at WWII and a modern feel. But what people forget is back in 1945 there were severe limits placed on what you could see in a movie. This film captures the feel and the essence of what it was like to be a G.I .Joe. Robert Mitchum was made a superstar in his star making role here. The scene that made him a star in which Captain Walker talks about the New ones is perfect and heartfelt. And Ernie Pyle's spirit comes thru as much as his love and affection for the fighting man. with that perfect last line. For those beneath the wooden crosses there is nothing we can do except pause..and murmur thanks pal thanks . that sums it up perfectly. Incredible film and a eye opener of what it was like to be a G.I. Joe.

This is still a good movie just not as good as M or Metropolis. Chris Cross (Edward G Robinson) is a middle aged man who is unhappily married to his wife Adele Cross (Rosalind Ivan). One night Chris befriends a girl named Kitty March (Joan Bennett) who is under the control of her brutal boyfriend Johnny Prince (Dan Duryea). Kitty is under the false impression that Chris is rich from the avid painting that he does and Prince wants Kitty to con the seemingly naive man out of his money. Really she's a greedy person and gains Chris's trust only to eventually ruin him at the end. Even though this isn't as good as Lang's German movies it's still god. The acting here is all good.

The story is about a slave in Italy who starts an uprising that eventually rises up to fight against Rome itself. Douglas portrays the main character with passion and a performance where the camera just placed on his face tells his character's story. Jean Simmons portrays another slave that tweaks his romantic interests at a gladiator training facility, which he is transferred to after being bought by Peter Ustinov's character, that trains slaves and treats them like Gods until they are transferred to another facility where they have to fight to their death's for entertainment purposes for Roman citizens. Laurence Olivier's character, who is a wealthy influential person, visits the facility and forces the caretaker to prematurely do a couple of fights to the death including Spartacus. He survives, of course, but then starts the uprising upon hearing that Simmon's character is being sent to another location. This is where the film doesn't do a good job, in my opinion, because it makes it look like it all started over a lover's spat when obviously Spartacus had a bigger idea in mind. Douglas and Simmons carry on a very powerful screen romance but this overpowers the bigger story. He then commands the slave army to try and accomplish the task of freeing all the slaves in the whole of Italy. The political complexities in Rome and the conflict between the Roman characters actually slows down the movie. Olivier's character's motivations are never explored so the conflict between him and Spartacus is not a watchable piece of entertainment.

To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.The first scene of the movie, the traditional kissing of the hand of the Don, shows Michael taking over his father's place. Subsequent scenes show you that though he has taken over his father's seat, he is nothing like the old Don. The charismatic supremo is replaced by an angry, impatient man.The movie touches upon the life of immigrants to the new blooming world America wherein begins our former godfather's story. The story of young Vito Corleone runs parallel to the present day Don. The story of the great man is unfolded beautifully and entwined well with the present.In one scene, the relationship with present Don and his kid is intercepted by the young Vito Corleone, a young and handsome R. De Niro, playing with his little son, which enhances the contrast lifestyle of the two leading men.Attention to detail has been given the utmost importance and the scene in which the lead actor watches a play, which though irrelevant to the story is heart touching, is a proof for this.There are times when you just can't take your eyes off the well chiseled face of Robert De Niro and long for him to come back on screen.As the movie unfolds, we see how the Don junior tries hard to keep his personal life & business in place, something which the senior had done with ease. In one scene, the new don's anger at his wife for having aborted their to be boy child vis-à-vis the distress troubled look on old don's face while seeing his young son treated by a nurse shows the disparity in the way the two men handled their families.While Don Vito was as much a family man as he was a Godfather, his son, Michael fails to keep his family together. Like the icy cold winter snow, the relationship between the husband and wife is harsh and dry. True to his words, the Times were changing .As the movie progresses, we see how the once well built, tightly held family by De Niro is slowly losing its strength and grip under his son.The love for his wife and kids in Niro's eyes in contrast to the anger in Michael's eyes for his wife underlines the entire movie.The story ends similar to the first movie, where all the Don's enemies are killed, whether they are part of family or not.Climax of movie sums up the life of Michael and the drastic changes over the years about his views and relationship he had with his father.

True to his words, the Times were changing .As the movie progresses, we see how the once well built, tightly held family by De Niro is slowly losing its strength and grip under his son.The love for his wife and kids in Niro's eyes in contrast to the anger in Michael's eyes for his wife underlines the entire movie.The story ends similar to the first movie, where all the Don's enemies are killed, whether they are part of family or not.Climax of movie sums up the life of Michael and the drastic changes over the years about his views and relationship he had with his father. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"20 December 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" As stated in my review of Godfather 1 , There are some movies which cannot be reviewed. We can all have our opinions, but we cannot rate them. These are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. The Godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.The first scene of the movie, the traditional kissing of the hand of the Don, shows Michael taking over his father's place. Subsequent scenes show you that though he has taken over his father's seat, he is nothing like the old Don. The charismatic supremo is replaced by an angry, impatient man.The movie touches upon the life of immigrants to the new blooming world America wherein begins our former godfather's story. The story of young Vito Corleone runs parallel to the present day Don. The story of the great man is unfolded beautifully and entwined well with the present.In one scene, the relationship with present Don and his kid is intercepted by the young Vito Corleone, a young and handsome R. De Niro, playing with his little son, which enhances the contrast lifestyle of the two leading men.Attention to detail has been given the utmost importance and the scene in which the lead actor watches a play, which though irrelevant to the story is heart touching, is a proof for this.There are times when you just can't take your eyes off the well chiseled face of Robert De Niro and long for him to come back on screen.As the movie unfolds, we see how the Don junior tries hard to keep his personal life & business in place, something which the senior had done with ease. In one scene, the new don's anger at his wife for having aborted their to be boy child vis-à-vis the distress troubled look on old don's face while seeing his young son treated by a nurse shows the disparity in the way the two men handled their families.While Don Vito was as much a family man as he was a Godfather, his son, Michael fails to keep his family together.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"20 December 2014","score":"","review":" Because this movie has dark shadows and the action takes place at night many reviewers have classified this film as 'noir' but I'm not so sure.Here we have no protagonist caught up in an inexorable series of circumstances leading him towards his doom. Here we have no real femme fatale influencing the outcome. Instead we have a murder story, with a Columbo-type narrative where the detective has to provoke or trick the murderer into giving himself\/herself away.Robert Ryan is the main man here, giving a very good performance as a two-faced bigot. Gloria Grahame is watchable as the bar girl. Other supporting characters have more to do than Robert Mitchum here but his role has its weight in the drama as a whole.Most memorable for me is the quirky character who appears at Grahame's flat and talks to the young soldier. The scriptwriters must have had fun working on his lines! He says stuff that you don't get much in mainstream films from this period but would be perfectly at home in those indie films of the seventies. In fact I could imagine Harry Dean Stanton playing that role.All in all an enjoyable crime story which I watched when I was very tired, which is my excuse why I didn't suss out where the detective's trick (with a very slow build-up) was leading until he finally played his trump card. It was a good example of 'softly softly catchee monkey'.

Roger Ebert wrote, Play Misty for Me is not the artistic equal of Psycho, but in the business of collecting an audience into the palm of its hand and then squeezing hard, it is supreme. He also wrote, The movie revolves around a character played with an unnerving effectiveness by Jessica Walter. She is something like flypaper; the more you struggle against her personality, the more tightly you're held. Clint Eastwood, in directing himself, shows that he understands his unique movie personality. He is strong but somehow passive; he possesses strength but keeps it coiled inside. And so the movie, by refusing to release any emotion at all until the very end, absolutely wrings us dry. There is no purpose to a suspense thriller, I suppose, except to involve us, scare us, to give us moments of vicarious terror. Play Misty for Me does that with an almost cruel efficiency. Play Misty for Me is a superbly well-crafted shocker.
