But it was this one I found right. I still do. I am sure that this is the absolutely greatest adventure movie of all time. Of all Star Wars movies. Of the Indiana Jones movies. And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series.

It's never going to be revived as a midnight cult film, it's not going to be remembered as an innovative groundbreaker and, quite frankly, I'll be surprised to see its DVD release.  But when Hell Night is held up alongside the other slasher flicks that came out around the same time (or even the mindless, neverending deluge of cruddy sequels to really GOOD slasher movies that plagued us throughout the 80s, i.e. Friday the 13th , Halloween & A Nightmare on Elm Street) Hell Night still manages to stand on its own.  It's well made, it's tense and scary and the characters are lifelike and likable.Hell Night takes a tired premise and, to be quite honest, doesn't do much with it.  Drunken college students make four pledges (2 boys and 2 girls, how convenient) spend the night at Haunted Garth Manor, where 12 years earlier, Old Man Garth allegedly killed his wife and four children and then killed himself.  The storyline trips a few times; like, I had to wonder why Old Man Garth and his son Andrew did not come out and kill prior to this night, if they've been running around Garth Manor for the last 12 years.  Were they hibernating? But if you can manage to forget about clumsy plots and hastily thrown together details and simply sit back and enjoy the film, Hell Night is more than halfway decent.  Of course, a small group of frat brothers and sorority sisters (an insufferable lot that you won't be sorry to see go) attempt to scare our heroes and heroines with some cleverly rigged sound effects and projection equipment.  Slowly, the scares become real and one by one, the cast shrinks.  Soon, only Linda Blair remains, and since she's obviously a good girl, a virgin and has a boys name (Marti) she simply has to live, right?  Right.  Sure, she runs, she screams, she falls down in her absurdly long dress, but she also knows how to fix a car that won't start and does so without too much panic, and she viciously dispatches the film's villain in a brutally satisfying ending that will make you wince.

We've of course remember them, but how many of us have really seen one? I happen to love them though, my film appreciation class made me run out and get as many silent films as possible, one of the most memorable silent films of all time is Nosferatu. A film that still to this day remains one of the most harrowing movies of all time. Say what you will about how far special effects have come into today's movies, but the silent film really made this movie into the true horror story that has memorable images and still gives me nightmares.Thomas Hutter is an employee at a real estate firm in a city called Wisborg, living with Ellen, his wife. His employer, Knock, receives a mysterious letter. Knock decides to send him to visit Count Orlok in the Carpathian Mountains to finalize the sale of a house. Hutter leaves his wife with his good friend Harding, and Harding's sister Ruth, before embarking on his multiple-month journey. He goes on the trip and he is soon picked up by Count Orlok's coach, which is driven by a strange specter that hides its face, and moves at an unnatural speed. At his arrival at the castle, whose doors open by themselves, he is welcomed by Count Orlok. His grotesque facial features hidden at this stage by his hat, Orlok initially appears to be a mere eccentric gentleman. Hutter has dinner at the castle; Orlok refuses to eat and silently reads a letter. A bell rings at midnight and a startled Hutter cuts his thumb. Count Orlok tries to suck the blood out of the wound, but stops at Hutter's horror, who then falls asleep in the parlor after a conversation with Orlok. Hutter wakes up to an empty castle with fresh wounds on his neck, he's oh so doomed at this point.The very first vampire movie of all time, when F.W. Murnau couldn't get the rights to Dracula, he created actually one of the most memorable horror movies of all time. Seriously, if you have never seen this movie, try to find it, and if you dare say that the image of Orlok waking up and rising out of his coffin doesn't scare the ever loving daylight out of you, I'm going to go all Clockwork Orange on you, tape you to a chair put toothpicks in your eye lids to keep them open and you're going to watch this in the dark.

Given that, you might expect it to be a fabulous film. Unfortunately, it falls short of that distinction.It's difficult to pinpoint why this is. Partly it may be the frequent use of unbridled screaming to build and sustain tension, when at times a restrained approach using chill, taut tones would have served better.

This reviewer had no clue as to why before watching the film, and even now after having seen it with her own eyes this reviewer still does not know why it is so famous.  Like every movie it has its impressive areas and it's I just don't want to pay attention to this areas.  Citizen Kane is a film with little entertainment value.  Entertainment is an important factor in holding an audience's attention.  It did have some rather, dare I say it, boring parts. But there were a few scenes that made up for the lack of entertainment value throughout the film.I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.  That quote was the best line in the whole film.  It, itself, provided a great deal of laughter and entertainment for the watching audience.  If there was one thing about Citizen Kane that should never be forgotten, it is definitely that line. In this film, there is a scene that takes place at the Inquirer.  It is very busy and noisy.  Kane (Orson Welles), Leland (Joseph Cotten), and the Inquirer's Editor-in-Chief (Erskine Sanford) are all trying to talk at the same exact time and it gets rather confusing.  It is really very interesting.  A viewer could go from a sleepy pose to a wide awake pose just from watching this scene.  It certainly grabbed this reviewer's attention.The acting in Citizen Kane was actually very believable and realistic. It didn't seem like the actors\/actresses had a movie camera stuck in their faces and were talking on cue.  It seemed like you could be looking in through a window and just see everyday life being carried out.  This reviewer was very impressed by the acting jobs.  The actors\/actresses were not half-bad, except for one.  Susan Alexander Kane, Kane's second wife, was being pressured by her husband to be an opera singer.  Well, she got bad reviews on her singing and I'm afraid that Dorothy Comingore, the actress who played her, would have to get bad reviews on her acting from this reviewer.  She was overly-dramatic and just plain annoying.  She was constantly screaming at her husband and this reviewer just wished the noise would stop!  If Comingore's character was meant to come across as loud and obnoxious then she did a wonderful job portraying that! But if the character was meant to be anything else then maybe the casting director should have found another actress to play the part.Special Effects!  When people these days think of special effects they think of things blowing up constantly or even things that you see in The Matrix trilogy, like time just stopping or people flying through the air.  That is what special effects are in the year 2003.  But back in the 1940's that wasn't.  Citizen Kane was probably full of special effects, but since they aren't anything really noticeable or unusual for our time period, most of them probably wouldn't be noticed.  This reviewer caught two types of special effects used in the movie, and actually one of them was probably over-used.   Fading from scene to scene or from picture to picture was a brand new thing back then.  These days it's used all the time and it's hardly even noticed, but when Citizen Kane was made fading was huge! That's probably why it was used so much throughout the film.  It's like when you get something brand new and you use it over and over again until it's worn out.  That's what this film did with fading.  It used it so much it started to become over-used.   Although, this reviewer will admit, it is pretty nifty, and Citizen Kane used it well.  Another special effect this film used was pretty awesome.  In some scenes when one character was meant to be the focus of the scene that character would be lit up so you could see them perfectly, and the other characters would be in the shadows, so the viewer wouldn't want to pay attention to them.  This reviewer thought that was pretty cool.The costumes in this film were fitting to the time period.  The men mostly wore suits and hats and the ladies mostly wore modest dresses.  Unless, of course, they were a dancer, then they were wearing short dresses that drew lots of attention to the women wearing them.There was a great deal of music in this film.  There was music in the background, music that you could hear playing on a radio in the scene, music being played by a band, and music being played on the piano.  There was opera singing and just regular singing too.  This reviewer loves music and seeing that much of it in one film is great!Overall, Citizen Kane is a good film.  Not great, but good.  This reviewer wouldn't say it was the number one all time best film ever, but then again, this reviewer's understanding of the film doesn't reach as far as others. If a viewer of my age was given the chance to buy this film, they most likely wouldn't jump at the opportunity.  If a viewer of an older age who fully appreciates these types of films were offered that same chance they probably would.  Citizen Kane was a film not to be easily forgotten.

This is a man that either you love him or you hate him. You see him as a brilliant and courageous director or a hack just out for a buck. Stone served in Vietnam and directed a brilliant trilogy of films about the war Platoon, Heaven and Earth and Born On The Fourth Of July. One thing you have to say about this man and his films, he is never boring and he is very original! He always keeps you on the edge of your seat. Natural Born Killers is unlike any other film you will ever see. I think the best version to get is the directors uncut one, it comes in two tapes. This film is about so many things, its a crime drama, a chase thriller, a semi-horror film and a sort of biting social satire that addresses some very important questions about our society and our mores. For example, they have some mock interviews with people talking about how cool Mickey and Mallory Knox are. They did for murder what Manson did, someone says. They show them as celebrities on magazine covers. It is a shocking statement about our society that we glamorize serial killers, but we do. There are serial killer groupies who write to these men in prison and even marry them. There are serial killer trading cards and sites on the web dedicated to these men. Its like someone said the best way to get on the cover of Time is to kill a bunch of people. Stone gets great performances from Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis as the lovers from hell. Harrelson is best remembered for his comic roles, but he plays a good dramatic part here. Harrelson's father is a convicted hit man who is serving a life sentence for killing a federal judge. It is almost like Harrelson has his own personal demons on display in playing this movie madman. Juliette Lewis is a fine young actress who had been nominated for an Oscar at 17 for Cape Fear. She proves her that it is no fluke. Her personal strangeness aside, she really delivers. Rodney Dangerfield, one of our comic legends, is anything but funny as her abusive father. His character reminds me of the one that Dennis Hopper played in Blue Velvet. He should have gotten an Academy Award for best supporting actor as Mallory's evil dad. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as the whimpy reporter who dramatizes Mickey and Mallory's exploits and gets more then he bargained for. I think the funniest performance in this film is Tommy Lee Jones as the warden of the prison they are being held at. He is hilarious and hammy! Its almost like Stone told his actors, just relax and have a good time. This is a viewing experience unlike any you will ever have, but there have been a couple real life tragedies this film inspired. It is said that the Columbine killers were fascinated by Natural Born Killers and even quoted its dialogue. In 1998, there was the most shocking school shooting that I have ever heard of. Two children (11 and 13) named Andrew Golden and Mitchell Johnson opened fire in their schoolyard and killed four little girls and a pregnant teacher and wounded ten others.

Before the ceremony, Denton said that Jane Fonda says I am a liar, I want her to meet me in public, I want to show her my scars from where I was horribly tortured. Denton showed up at the ceremony, Jane Fonda didn't. This woman makes me sick!

The Chaplin style takes its share too. Continental Europeans are more sensitive to cultural and social changes in their countries. This movie was made in 1994, as the end roller reads. It was not the beginning of the hit of learning Mandarin but the number of learning is increasing. I feel so happy to see that the Chinese words used in the film carry meaning. In the old days, when Asia has not yet been in the spotlight or internationalism was not yet the buzzword, in movies, written words of Hindi, Chinese, Korean, Japanese carried no meaning because the western viewers didn't bother to know. Now that people got to know more about Asia, film-makers do reasearch more before they shoot the film. I love modern productions with high cultural awareness.Movie is a good tool to show social, cultural or international changes. In the movie, the Chinese actors though only appeared a few minutes but they had their share like lines, The candidate is able to write pretty good Chinese., Let's give him a question, not very difficult, not very easy. In the past, in most movies, no matter big or small, Asian got no line. Thanks, how I like the change. However, if their names are put in the end roller of this français-italiano production, which posed to be rather international, that would be even better. Interesting that there are more than ten examiners in the exam center. I was completely floored with laughter when I saw that scene. Anyone who has sat for HSK (Mandarin Chinese Proficiency Test) would know that was not true. The exam room in the movie is rather like a Politburo meeting.I like the setting, a new developing district near Roma, Lazio. An interesting movie about a man (a suspect of serial killer 18 women) looking for a job and so is learning Mandarin, somehow a novel language to the Europeans and living in a new area. New is the word I can think of when I was watching this hilarious movie. Just lots of fun and amusement in low expense (US$1.29 VCD).Superb, bravo, buonissimo, magnifique, zhen peng!

I dare say no other film, video, and even documentary came close to the sheer magnitude in terms of production values, publicity as well as commercial and critical success. Nor does any other &#145;attempts' on making &#145;Malcolm X' came close in terms of the controversy generated. &#145;Malcolm X' by Spike Lee is a fine piece of work, but I'm sure many will agree that it is not without it's flaws. Warning Spoilers ahead\tSpike Lee had said that he wanted to target the young audience, especially black youths; that is why he wanted the film to be rated PG 13. But I'm not sure whether that intention has led to some of the problems that I have with the film. For example, I personally think that the first act in reenacting the story of young Malcolm, with all the &#145;Jitterbug' dancing, the love scene on the beach, and supporting characters like &#145;Shorty' (played by Spike Lee himself), felt some what contrived. I was lost in the midst of all the colors, music and dancing. It makes me feel like I'm watching a Broadway show rather than a Bio pic, and no amount of suspension of disbelief is going to convince me that this is even remotely close to the recreation and depiction of young Malcolm's life. Despite a high-spirited performance by Denzel Washington, it is simply unconvincing to see a middle aged man (Denzel was about 38 then) playing a juvenile delinquent.\tHaving prior knowledge about Malcolm X before watching the film didn't help either. For instance, the autobiography, which the film is based on, did not confirm that Clansmen murder Malcolm's father, but the film seems to portray that as a fact. I have doubts as to whether other facts have been manipulated by the film to tell the story, especially towards the more ambiguous early history on Malcolm's life. \tHowever, I do find the stylized gangster treatment on Malcolm's hustling days to be tasteful, with a very noir look and feel to it. The period when Malcolm was incarcerated, although falling somewhat short in length, is adequate in serving as a transition between the different periods and getting it's messages across. The second stretch of the film, documenting Malcolm's rise as a Minister in the Nation of Islam, was impressive, mainly due to the great performance of Denzel Washington in portraying the Malcolm of this middle period. I take for granted many of the quotes and things said by Denzel are verbatim of the real Malcolm, which all the more accentuate the effects that you are watching the real Malcolm in action.\tThe last act of the film, which Malcolm X went through great turmoil after realizing the truths behind the deceptions that he had been living upon, his subsequent religious and spiritual redemption, and the final scene of the inevitable assassination all happen in quick succession within the film. Contrary to what many critics feel about this act in not deliberating long enough, I think it is again the choice of the filmmaker to cater to the film's target audience. Already stretching beyond 3 hours, it is hard to expect young people to remain seated and captivated if the story of Malcolm X is not condensed. I also feel that the quick pacing towards the end somewhat mirrors the real life of Malcolm X, because he did not stay alive for more than 100 days after his return from his pilgrimage to Mecca. The focus is more on his internal struggles, contrasting with the escalating events surrounding him, and I feel that the film deserves credit for its chosen treatment on the subject. Lastly, I was incredibly overwhelmed by the juxtaposition of the archival images of the real Malcolm X with the eulogy recited by Ozzie Davis at the end of the film. It has been quite a long time since cinema had such a cathartic effect on me, especially with simple words like `How can you judge a man like Malcolm X? Do you know him&#133;Have you spoken with him?' The finishing coda that follows, with a surprise entry of Nelson Mandela giving one of Malcolm's X speech which bears the infamous `by all means necessary', and the kids unanimous responses, again was overdone and portentous.

If it is looked at by a somewhat different view, and acceptance of the time period, its classic aspect shows through. Beginning and ending at the final scene, the movie explores themes of love, loneliness, greed, and an outspoken man from the perspectives of those around him.The intensity of the piece is displayed with a single word and shown in its significance at Xanadu, Kane's mansion, lonely and unfinished.  Married, yet still alone, Kane may be perceived as a man who just had a lot of money, with no real place to put it.  Truth being that Kane's wealth overlooks the longing for compassion.  By giving away bought material, and longing for actual feeling in return, Kane finds himself in near desperation.The movie shows a boys with anticipating potential, turned suddenly and against his will into a man with little talents other than stealing coworkers and accepting a bad reputation.  After ridiculously spontaneous engagements, and empty friendships, Kane is even more reduced to an unfinished Xanadu and impartial servants. Citizen Kane is a man who claimed himself to be an American.

Every aspect of the movie is flawless and no other movie (except the first, and Citizen Kane) comes close to its quality.This is by far Al Pacino's best role and which he, nor any other actor, will eclipse. The Godfather Part II is also the best acted movie of all time containing career making or establishing roles for Dianne Keaton, Robert De Niro and John Cazale.Just talking about what an accomplishment this movie was is making me want to put everything I am doing down and watch the movie again.Easily a perfect 10 out of 10!

That plot framework will be familiar to most, but Gladiator combats its cliched roots well, offering dizzying action, political intrigue, and powerful visuals.Perhaps the most stunning thing on display in this film is its all-around superb acting. Russell Crowe's turn here as Maximus earned him an Academy Award that solidified his stardom. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance as the complex and disturbed Commodus. And the late Richard Harris is notable as the great, aging, philosophical Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed (here is his last performance) and just about everyone else are also outstanding.The title, `Gladiator,' brings to mind bloody arena contests, and the battle scenes don't disappoint - they are well-choreographed and filmed with creativity and intensity. (The graphic portrayals may be disturbing to some. If you don't like films that show blood and gore, don't see this one).The Academy Award-winning special effects that resurrect ancient Rome and restore the Coliseum to its former greatness are triumphs, and the Academy Award-nominated score, courtesy of Hans Zimmer, is riveting.Some of the film is historically accurate, but most of it isn't - expect to be entertained, not informed. Plus, there are a few distracting goofs - such as the clearly breathing corpse in the foreground of several scenes, and another presumably dead man who blinks when a woman lowers her hand to close his eyes.But these few blunders pale in comparison with Gladiator's many strengths. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy a good dramatic\/action film that is also worthy of being called an epic. Gladiator is an astounding experience.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 November 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  At its barest bones, Gladiator is the tale of a wronged man seeking revenge.
