To be fair, though, I probably was more offended (but not surprised) by many of the comments on this page than the movie itself.   Admittedly, `Boys Don't Cry' was a competent movie with fine directing and performances by the actors.  Hillary Swank certainly delivered a performance worthy of a best actress award.

What I find disturbing are some of the viewer comments that suggest this movie is about `tolerance' (probably the single most politically abused word in the English vocabulary in the last five years) and that it *shockingly* revealed how cruel people were to a young girl *just because she was gay*.But in this movie, Teena Brandon was not just a girl who `happened to be gay', but who pretended to be a boy and *tricked heterosexual girls into being involved in a homosexual romance.*  In the first ten minutes of this movie, Teena lures a young, unwitting, heterosexual woman into a brief, romantic fling.  The girl was obviously upset upon finding out that Brandon' (Teena) was a girl.

And I thought that the gay community was trying to convince the rest of us that it is not within their agenda to impose their lifestyle onto others?Had Teena Brandon disclosed her sexuality to her would-be partners before any intimate encounters, I would have felt far more sympathy for her. But the fact that she was brutally raped and murdered does not make her actions in this movie any less irresponsible or immoral.  Hence, this movie is in no position to preach tolerance for a character that does not deserve to be a martyr any more than she deserved to be killed.  The `Hate' police can have their say now.

I've seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the directing. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a movie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted.

It was an overly cryptic, gritty tale that seemed more tedious and frustrating than it was worth.  Requiem for a Dream is his newest outing. It's definitely not a pretty picture either, but it's certainly better and more effective. During the course of its running time, it's guaranteed to produce a cringe or a wince in almost any viewer. It's the kind of film with the capacity to disturb and produce a sense of relief when it ends, even though one is glad to have seen it. Ellen Burstyn is at her frumpy and neurotic best as a television-enslaved, middle-aged woman who gets caught in a drug-addicted frenzy of compulsive behavior. Greatly adding to the intensity and momentum of the story is a similar downfall her son (played by Jared Leto) also experiences.A lot of what makes Requiem work lies in the film's breakneck pacing,  structure and cinematography as the two lead characters race toward simultaneous self destruction in different, but equally frightening ways. Depictions of old apartments, bad areas of the city and wasted lives from the ravages of abuse have rarely been more harrowing. In fact, as the film's climax of final scenes unraveled, I was really beginning to squirm; I even toyed with the idea of leaving the theater. Yet like the characters, I was compelled to go all the way. Requiem for a Dream may be many things, and you may not want to see it again very soon.

Once you poison your fan-base, they'll wait for all sequels to hit video, thereby greatly reducing the boxoffice profit and the likelihood of further sequels.At twenty minutes till the end of the movie I was drumming on my kneecaps waiting for it to be over. At times I felt like leaping from my seat and running from the theater. The only redeeming qualities of the whole movie were the locations and sets.

You knew that Hanks would be right back, then a crash landing left him on a desert island for several years; you knew he would be declared dead and that Hunt's memory would keep him alive; you knew he would make it back; you knew that Hunt would be married when he did; and you knew going in that it was going to be a shameless commercial for FedEx and Wilson sporting goods -- to the point that you kept asking, why?Having said that, you really DO think that Tom Hanks has been stranded on a remote island with little or no clue as to how to survive.  You really DO think that he is losing his mind.  He's a fine actor, and the long stretches of tedium highlight the fact that life on a desert island is anything but glamorous.When I was in line for tickets, the woman in front of me asked for tickets for The Castaways.

I was too, too young to see it when it came out. But when it did come out, it was rated X. At that time X meant adult content, not what it would come to be known for with the release of Deep Throat only a mere four years later. Midnight Cowboy was a wonderful piece of film making...disturbing, horrific and yes, sad. To me it was one of the only films about friendship that didn't show lovely colors, vibrant fields and everyone singing happy songs. New York City is not like this any more but if you ever want a piece of New York City history before Disney got hold of it, Midnight Cowboy is it. Jon Voight was wonderful as Joe Buck (and in history it was actually another named actor who had the part but had another part so the Producers couldn't wait for him!) and Dustin Hoffman as slimy Ratso Rizzo was just perfect. We know why these actors are great in their craft just from this film. It's not pretty. You have to reach deep down as an actor to develop the adult content as such in this movie. (I did get to read the book so there's much more I know about this than what is in the movie).It's not going to be a palatable story for most, and for its time, it was pretty revealing. Quite a rough lesson for a youngster to an adult transition, not fully knowing the world, but expecting much out of it for all the wrong expectations. How does one 'grow up' with such horrid experiences in a small town to move into big City life? Here he gets the world....to experience being dead broke, finding humanity, accepting friendship (on MANY levels) and finally being left alone in this world to learn from it all. Great, great film.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"28 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Ang Lee's brilliant film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is quite unlike anything I've ever seen.  It's being called a martial arts film by many people, but it's not, really.  In most martial arts movies (and indeed all action movies), the plot is generally just a way to produce fight scenes, car chases, explosions, whatever.  Crouching Tiger is just the opposite; in this movie drama comes first, and the action is simply a logical extension of that drama.  This is an intelligent, moving drama that is filled with thrilling and spectacular action.The acting in Tiger is impeccable.  Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh headline the cast, and both turn in excellent performances.  Chow Yun Fat is particularly good at conveying complex emotions without saying very much at all.  The best performance in the movie, I think, is from Zhang Ziyi, who plays Jen Yu, the most prominent character (even though Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh get higher billing).It's hard to evaluate the writing of the movie after it's been translated from Chinese to English.  As one would expect, it seems that the script lost a little something in the translation, and subtitles never work as well as spoken dialogue.  The movie is not dialogue-heavy to begin with, though, and all in all it doesn't suffer much in the translation.Perhaps the most incredible element of Crouching Tiger is the cinematography and visual effects.  Ang Lee, the director, has a prodigious talent for capturing the inherent beauty of a landscape, be it barren desert or bamboo forest.  The fight sequences are flawless impeccable choreography and brilliant camera work combine for some of the best action footage ever.  The choreographer also did The Matrix, but his work on Tiger trumps even that paragon of martial artistry; there is a genuine beauty to the fights in this movie, while The Matrix, is still just another action flick.One part in particular of the fight scenes has particular resonance, and that is that the lead characters can, for lack of a better word, fly.  The flight is done in such a way -- it seems rather like an exceptionally long running stride more than it does a swooping bird -- that after a few moments, the audience believes in it as much as they do in air or water.All the action sequences are quite marvelous in every respect, they are captivating and wonderful to look at.  Rather than the pounding crescendo of violence seen in American action movies, Crouching Tiger makes the fights seem more like a work of fine art.The cinematography remains excellent throughout, not just in the fight sequences.  A wide variety of landscapes were used, and Ang Lee uses each one to great advantage.  Everything in this film just looks _beautiful_.  I don't know how else to put it, but I think if you see it you'll understand what I mean.Another element that makes Crouching Tiger unique is that it does not take place in any particular time period.  It can be placed around the early eighteenth century, but only when one specifically considers the setting.  While watching the movie, no time period is set and none is needed.  Indeed, the lack of a fixed time aids the aura of mysticism and magic that pervades the film.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a one-of-a-kind film experience and easily one of the best movies of the year.
