Why?!). I watch it routinely (it's on TV a lot, especially USA network). Two things I like about it are the pacing, and the deeper story that plays in the background.First, the pacing this movie hits the deck running and never stops moving, it just keeps rolling right along, from one nutty event to the next, but it is all carefully intertwined and everything works in   symmetry to bring the viewer to the (admittedly schmaltzy) happy ending. Anyway, I like it when a movie maintains a good pace or a rhythm, never letting itself get too bogged down. Tommy Boy is one of those.Second, the deeper story in the background all the times I've watched this movie, I've never lost sight of the fact that the story didn't just revolve around some big dumb guy who couldn't seem to find his way out of a wet paper bag.

Shawshank Redemption is considered by some critics as one of the best movies in the story of American film (listed as #2 by the Internet Movie Data Base,http\/\/www.imdb.com). For many other people the film is considered as one of those films which theme is universal and that transcends throughout the ages and decades. And this is because topics like freedom, justice and injustice, greed and honesty, and perseverance are mixed in a manner that specifies what the human condition is and will be.The performances given by Tim Robbins and the always acclaimed Morgan Freeman give the film the emotional touch that is easy to get as a viewer. The story is centered in a person called Andy Dufrense who was convicted for the murder of his wife, him, being a young and intelligent banker was one of the most promising persons in his category, but all his potential was brought down with his conviction, undoubtely unfair since it is obvious a person like Dufrense wouldn´t be capable of such a thing like murdering the person he loved with all his heart. Also the story of the institutionalized Ellis Boyd Red Redding played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman, a man who lost all hope of ever going out even if he had already payed more than he had ever expected for his crime, until he met Dufrense, who as anyone could see teaches Red the meaning of what to have a dream is, even if it takes you 20 years to accomplish it.Greed comes in form of Captain Byron Hadley played by lancy Brown, an unscrupulous man, who ironicly although he directed the place were the bad element of society is reformed he was no better than the ones he subdued. Hadley since he first met Dufrense sought in him his golden egg gouse and used him to fulfill a fraud becoming Dufrense now into a real criminal, which he wasn´t until he got to jail. When the opportunity to prove Dufrense´s innocence comes, Hadley makes everything as possible to avoid that even though the assesination of a young person was in the middle. At the end, Dufrense escapes from jail through a hole he had dug for 20 years covering the evidence with several posters from the hollywood divas from those times from Rita Hayworth to Jane Fonda.But, let´s talk about Andy Dufresne for a while, let´s take the scene at the roof of the building in which Andy gets beers for his coworkers in exchange for work. At the end of the scene we can see the smile of Andy, a happy man, who was happy with small little accomplishments. Andy was someone who was talented and yet, all he wanted was a yat in Puerto Vallarta near by the beach and that would be the heaven for him. In a world full of intelligent people who use their talents to get to the top, andy was one who needed little to be happy.Of course the success of this film is based on what most of the famous films do, an utopic idea of society or how the human being should have been. Andy is the prototype of how all of us should be, never loose the sense of hope, always fight for what you want, greed and money is not good, and of course, being like this you will always succeed.

Each of the characters will become you at some time of every day and you'll feel their power, greed and confusion for at least an hour each day. It's such an amazing thing to be another person, and that is what is like to watch this dark, amazing drama that is surely one of the best films of 1999. Brad Pitt is stunning as Tyler, literally blowing you away with a performance that is a small fraction away from perfect and is played to an Oscar-worthy status. Edward Norton is also very plausible, capturing his character's misery with a differently funny\/dramatic type of power. David Fincher once again proves when he puts himself behind the camera; he also has an eerie presence in front of it, and that is the feeling of a true director emerging once again with a fantastic, unbelievably good film. This movie is not for the faint-hearted,  and if you are one of those squirmy people, if you can get over the fights, blood and see through this film to the morals and brilliance it beholds, you'll come out extremely satisfied.

However, I wanted to stop this movie many times after about the first 30 minutes. It's really difficult to put into words what a terrible movie this was. It's a shame that this money and opportunity was wasted on bad directing, writing, and acting. If you're gonna make a fantasy movie, at least read the cream of the fantasy novel crop.

Of course I enjoyed it.  It's impossible not to.  But it's an entertaining trifle rather than ... I don't know, rather than whatever it was trying to be.  Luhrmann's earlier Strictly Ballroom is probably more the thing Moulin Rouge was reaching towards.  It has the same unbridled cinematic hedonism, but with more depth, more coherence, certainly more sincerity.  We're told more than once that this is a story of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all, love.  But the film has little to say about freedom and nothing whatever to say about truth and beauty - those three were thrown in simply to make up the numbers.  Besides, what does the slogan MEAN?  When the Bohemians announce that truth is one of their ideals, are they saying that one ought to tell the truth, or discover the truth, or face the truth, or are they speaking aesthetics, and saying something about art being true to life?  Your guess is as good as mine.As for the editing - did Luhrmann HAVE to disfigure his fine creative work so much?  A lot of the art direction is fantastic, but we can only find out that it's fantastic by a process akin to forensic science.  We never get an uninterrupted look at anything.  And even WITHIN the rare uncut shots, there's the appearance too much frantic cut-and-paste.  This is exactly what people feared would happen when editors started to use laptops rather than scissors.
