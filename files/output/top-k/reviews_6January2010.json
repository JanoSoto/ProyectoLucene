[{"date":"6 January 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ron Howard is one of the finest filmmakers Filmdom has witnessed, his body of work goes down as a LEGEND. He has made awesome films, while some have been disappointing. Unfortunately, 1999 flick 'EDtv' is one of those disappointments from the accomplished filmmaker.The problem with 'EDtv' is clearly it's writing, it's shoddy. The film lacks the bite, it had the potential to become a cult, but that magic is clearly missing. 'EDtv's tragic box office returns just proves the fact. Howard surely would agree, with what I am trying to say! 'Edtv' has 2 prominent pluses 1. The Idea is really interesting. 2. The performances Matthew McConaughey is excellent as ED, he carries the film on his shoulders. Woody Harrelson is, as always, superb. Jenna Elfman is first-rate. Martin Landau, Sally Kirkland, Rob Reiner, Adam Goldberg & Dennis Hopper are perfect in their parts. Elizabeth Hurley is the best thing about this film, she looks like a goddess. Ellen DeGeneres stands out.Overall, a 5 on 10 rating. A film that could've been much more, giving a better a script. A correct example for the well-known Fraze; Body Beautiful Of Minus Soul.
