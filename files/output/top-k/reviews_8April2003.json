I think 'Reign of Fire' is an original twist on an old storyline, but it is original if nothing else (how many post-apocalyptic dragon movies can you think of?).This film is what they call a 'popcorn' film, because it's pure entertainment and because of that some people simply can't enjoy it.  If you're looking for deep meaning, go see a over-acted, stiff and uptight British film with tons (or sorry... kilograms) of deep meaning and an emotionless void you can swim in for three hours (sometimes four).  Yawwwwnnnnn.....  'Reign of Fire' will never live up to some peoples expectations, but who the hell cares?Back to the dragons.... Sorry if there's only two (I actually think there's more), but the main story is about survival of the fittest and not necessarily how many dragons can fill the screen.  The acting is hammy for the most part, but again I haven't seen a post-apocalyptic film with anything else (sorry Mad Max.. of which I'm a big fan).  So, the Americans roll in to save the day (kind of brings back memories of WWII) and some very cheeseball machismo pours off Matthew M. like melted butter on a stack of nice, American pancakes, it all adds to the experience.

I thought all in all it was a good film for the genre, par for the acting and some excellent special effects, so unlike some others out there who think a good film is one that has subtitles, click the 'subtitle' button on your DVD remote and choose either French, Spanish or Portugese and watch it that way if it will make it more enjoyable.

I have a strange habit of watching it every now and then although I've seen it so many times I already know it by heart. I can't really tell why I've chosen this film as my personal Carrey favorite because for example the ingenious The Truman show was certainly even better as a movie. The Cable guy is just some sort of a perfection as a wacky Carrey film and it's impossible to grow tired of it. Every time I'm feeling a little blue...well you know where I'm getting at here.The fascination of Carrey's most famous comedic character Ace Ventura is based on a fact that he's totally unpredictable and basically able of doing anything. Audience will never know what kind of lovable stupidity pops out of his mouth when he opens it next time. Even though Carrey isn't quite as over-energetic in The Cable guy his performance is just marvelous. All of his mannerisms are luckily still there. This film has so many classic moments it's improbable for me to say I've seen them way too often. The basketball game, duel at Medieval times, karaoke-scene, porno-password and even the tiny little details like Owen Wilson's hilarious small visit as Robin's vexatious date (You're sexy. You heard me. I love that line, the bloke is so corny!)I can't understand those old school Jim Carrey freaks who feel that The Cable guy shows too dark side of Jimmy. What do they mean, have they really seen the same movie as me? Of course The Cable guy is darker than Dumb and dumber but it's also a whole lot of smarter. This is a funny piece of entertainment that puts me in a good mood and even if it is a slightly blacker Carrey comedy it's safe to say it isn't exactly The Exorcist. So if this happens to be the only Jim Carrey movie you haven't seen do something about it. The Cable guy might just be the laugh riot you've been looking for all of your life.

I have a strange habit of watching it every now and then although I've seen it so many times I already know it by heart. I can't really tell why I've chosen this film as my personal Carrey favorite because for example the ingenious The Truman show was certainly even better as a movie. The Cable guy is just some sort of a perfection as a wacky Carrey film and it's impossible to grow tired of it. Every time I'm feeling a little blue...well you know where I'm getting at here.The fascination of Carrey's most famous comedic character Ace Ventura is based on a fact that he's totally unpredictable and basically able of doing anything. Audience will never know what kind of lovable stupidity pops out of his mouth when he opens it next time. Even though Carrey isn't quite as over-energetic in The Cable guy his performance is just marvelous. All of his mannerisms are luckily still there. This film has so many classic moments it's improbable for me to say I've seen them way too often. The basketball game, duel at Medieval times, karaoke-scene, porno-password and even the tiny little details like Owen Wilson's hilarious small visit as Robin's vexatious date (You're sexy. You heard me. I love that line, the bloke is so corny!)I can't understand those old school Jim Carrey freaks who feel that The Cable guy shows too dark side of Jimmy. What do they mean, have they really seen the same movie as me? Of course The Cable guy is darker than Dumb and dumber but it's also a whole lot of smarter. This is a funny piece of entertainment that puts me in a good mood and even if it is a slightly blacker Carrey comedy it's safe to say it isn't exactly The Exorcist. So if this happens to be the only Jim Carrey movie you haven't seen do something about it. The Cable guy might just be the laugh riot you've been looking for all of your life.

I'm not going to go into the plot details, since they've all been well rehashed in previous reviews. I recently saw it on AMC after having not seen it in about 30 years, and I was absolutely riveted in my seat. Mitchum was superb -- chilling in his portrayal of an ex-con with his mind set on one goal -- revenge. Having worked as a corrections officer, I can assure you that there are many people like him in the corrections system. They are real, they are in prison, and they are biding their time for release, just as Max Cady did in the film. I know Mitchum did a little jail time for marijuana, but I don't know how he got the mannerisms of a con down so well. Just watch the scene when he first gets released, and checks out a woman walking down the street. Those sleepy old eyes of his ain't missing a thing. And when he's watching Gregory Peck's daughter on the dock, he looks like an alligator examining his next meal. I'll buy the comparisons with Night of the Hunter (another classic, and God help the S.O.B. who tries a remake of that one). When it comes to playing stone-cold psychotics, Mitchum dusts all the imitators. Who needs Hannibal Lecter? To wrap it all up, a great story from John MacDonald, strong direction, superb cinematography and a solid cast. Watch this one on the all-night movie channel and you won't be going to sleep.
