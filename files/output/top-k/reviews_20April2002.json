Yet now trouble is nigh, with not only the hot new kid on the block Hansel (Owen Wilson) threatening to steal his thunder and a Time reporter (Christine Taylor) making him look like an idiot in an article but also evil designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) who brainwashes him into assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia to stop him from stopping child labor and henceforth putting clothes factories into jeopardy.Written like that, it sounds as if ZOOLANDER is quite a complex story, but all these plot-lines merely feel like afterthoughts. The spin on the Manchurian Candidate premise, for instance, is little more than an excuse to move from a more-or-less-comic set piece to another. It's based on a 5 minute bit Ben Stiller did for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards which satirically confirmed the general impression that models are vain, stupid and incredibly self-centered. The character of Derek Zoolander epitomizes these traits, and it's funny enough... for a while. But when that single joke is stretched to 90 minutes, it gets mighty tedious. Less than halfway though I was checking my watch in boredom and wondering how if there was much more to go.Stiller, who co-wrote the screenplay and directed, is no hack (I thought his previous THE CABLE GUY was a vastly underrated dark comedy), but his film is nonetheless generic, uneven and self-indulgent. Stiller gives way too much screen time to his wife Christine Taylor, who has the thankless role of the serious chick reporter always conveniently around to handle the plot exposition and serve as a love interest out of the blue. Ben also cast his dad Jerry Stiller to more success, as the old guy scores a couple of big laughs with some dubious material. Also shining through is Will Ferrell, who always manages to make me laugh. He's been the best thing about Saturday Night Life for the past decade, and he's hilarious here as a maniacal Bond villain of a designer with goofy white curls akin to his pet poodle's. Owen Wilson also has his moments as another variation on the neo-hippie\/surfer dude he's been playing in every movie lately. As for Stiller himself, he's not bad, but this is just such a one note performance... Derek's vain, stupid and incredibly self-centered, all right, we get it, enough already!All in all, I can't recommend ZOOLANDER. I enjoyed a few parts of it, but they're lost in an endless string of dumb & dumber jokes, pointless cameos (I don't think Vince Vaughn has a single line), 80s pop montages and half-clever spoofs (2001, The Godfather...).

The acting is wonderful with subtle looks and mannerisms that make the characters so engaging.I watched it on DVD with surround sound and this movie shows off the format. Such a change from looking for bullets and car chases to immerse you in the spectacle of home cinema. It is shot so well, such colour and wonderful camera views.  This, along with the inventive use of special effects and the wonderful soundtrack just make this a film to envelope you.  Again, this holds your attention and concern for the characters and the story.'Amelie' is a feel good movie with plenty of laughs.  It's all the more so because of the theme of various characters withdrawing from life, being too shy, too scared to relate to others or do the things that they enjoy.  For all of it's magical, surreal moments it is made all the more touching because of it's embracing of the real, the mundane and unglamorous aspects of life.  There is resolution and romance in this film that can be identified with, none of it seems artificial.I like a broad range of movies, and this has broad appeal, as long as you look past the fact that it's a foreign film with subtitles.

The movie basically follows the same storyline, but it's obviously greatly opened up with the addition of additional characters and actors playing them.I'm assuming the movie is semi-autobiographical, because in real life Nia Vardalos (the author and star) is married to a man named Ian, just like in the movie; however, her real-life Ian is Ian Gomez, the guy who plays the movie Ian's (Ian Miller--played by John Corbett) best friend, Mike.  (He's also on The Drew Carey Show, Felicity and the late Norm.)  I seem to recall that the Ian in the one-woman show\/play was British, but I could be mistaken.  In any event, it seems unlikely that Ian GOMEZ's family could be as whitebread\/WASPy as Ian Miller's in the movie!  In fact, Ian Gomez's IMDB listing says he's of Puerto Rican, Jewish and GREEK extraction, so I'd assume the real-life romance wasn't quite the culture shock that the movie presents. Anyway, that said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  It's full of ethnic stereotypes, and I don't mean just stereotyping of Greeks and Greek-Americans.  As I said above, Ian Miller's family is about as uptighty-whitey as they come!

Now this, I have to say, is probably THE single most useless scene I have seen for some time. Not to mention the fact that it was utterly irrelevant. What this scene showed could have, and was, said in one line in the movie.Following this there was a scene where the 'main character' wrote a list, but it was hacked and changed by someone \/ thing.

And a quote from the movie sums it up entirely, No one saw it though.That's right, nor does anyone get it.

In the end, it didn't matter, they still died.

Even saying it sounds confusing.What was the writer thinking? This entire stretch of film made absolutely no sense.Then along comes this shadow thing. This is where the film just collapses.

In the moments before it, you almost know what is happening, and when it appears, you don't, but this isn't the mysterious kind of confusing, it just the scratching the head kind of confusion. Suddenly the shadow is there, and the viewer has absolutely no idea why it is there.Then the surviving characters run around a bit, and then the film finishes.This is a finish that doesn't even really deserved to be mentioned, it somehow transcends badness.On the bright side, some of the acting work is good, and the actual sets are decent.Conclusion - if you're looking for a horror movie with a plot - or even horror in your horror movie - don't come here.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"20 April 2002","score":"","review":"  (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)By the end of this movie, there was one question that stuck in my head, What?In short, this is a film that tries to be a comedy and a horror, but succeeds in being neither. It is more like a whole lot of bad 'horror sketches' put together, with a link between them that is so tenuous, it is almost impossible to see.At the start there is a dark, rather gruesome showing of the history of the 'House on Haunted Hill'. This scene is pointless, as it is quite clear in the main section of the movie what happened in this place, so, in actual fact, the movie probably would've been better off without this scene.Next came a scene about the 'main character' of sorts, where he was talking to a news reporter about his horror theme parks. Now this, I have to say, is probably THE single most useless scene I have seen for some time. Not to mention the fact that it was utterly irrelevant. What this scene showed could have, and was, said in one line in the movie.Following this there was a scene where the 'main character' wrote a list, but it was hacked and changed by someone \/ thing. Nice, but, once again, pointless. Once again, this need not have been shown at all, it was mentioned in the main section of the movie anyway.Then we get to the House on Haunted Hill.And what happens in this main section of the movie?Well, in a typically cliched horror vein, the characters split up, in order to find a way out, rather than all going together, in a place where any other normal person would have realised that the place was quite dangerous...sigh.Then one of the characters died. And a quote from the movie sums it up entirely, No one saw it though.That's right, nor does anyone get it. I mean if this woman was stupid enough to walk around in this place by herself, she DESERVED to die.Also there was this computer guy who dies.That's it. He is there, does virtually nothing, before being killed.?Also typically, the characters don't trust each other. Now you'd think that'd have some bearing on the film.Nope. In the end, it didn't matter, they still died. And the characters' relationships changed anyway.?Then there was a stretch where it seemed the scriptwriter or director couldn't make their mind up who had committed the murder, and\/or who was the villain of the piece.With characters appearing to die, but the viewer then finding they actually didn't, but then watching them die again, the film was quickly becoming confusing. Even saying it sounds confusing.What was the writer thinking? This entire stretch of film made absolutely no sense.Then along comes this shadow thing. This is where the film just collapses. For this shadow, there are so many questions, only one of which is half answered (what it is), but even in the answering, it creates more questions.For instance, (1) What is it doing there? (2) Why is it doing what it's doing? (3) What is it's motivation for doing what its doing? (4) How did it come into being? (5) Why did it come into being? (6) What is it's point?And the list goes on...This is because there is no lead up to the introduction of this 'character'. In the moments before it, you almost know what is happening, and when it appears, you don't, but this isn't the mysterious kind of confusing, it just the scratching the head kind of confusion. Suddenly the shadow is there, and the viewer has absolutely no idea why it is there.Then the surviving characters run around a bit, and then the film finishes.This is a finish that doesn't even really deserved to be mentioned, it somehow transcends badness.On the bright side, some of the acting work is good, and the actual sets are decent.Conclusion - if you're looking for a horror movie with a plot - or even horror in your horror movie - don't come here.

I'd seen the trailers and heard the acclaim, now it was time to watch, what I thought, would be an exemplary piece of film-making.  But I was sorely disappointed.  For the most part the Pledge amounts to nothing more than a slow burning character study, with some nice photography.  But besides Nicholson's Jerry Black, none of the characters are all that interesting, and come off simply as plot devises, despite the work of the amazing cast of diverse acting talent. The vital flaw with the film is the plot, which is never as interesting as the film-makers would like you to think it is, with far too much emphasis on Black coming to terms with his retirement, instead of focusing on the detective story, which at the end of the day, is why the audience is watching the film in the first place.  Nicholson may be a senior citizen now, but I was not expecting to see a cross between Grumpy Old Men and Se7en, which is what this film comes across as.  The film does have some strong acting from most concerned, notably Helen Mirren, Harry Dean Stanton, Tom Noonan, Benicio Del Torro and Mickey Rourke, but this endless line up of, what amounts to nothing more than celebrity cameos are ultimately distracting. The film should however be commended for having the guts to give us a twist ending that no one in a million years will ever guess, because it's the kind of ending that will either have you staring at the screen thinking `wow' or staring in to space laughing hysterically in disbelief.  The Pledge is not the masterpiece some critics hailed it as, however the main performance of Jack Nicholson is perhaps his best, and most restrained since his pre-shinning days, giving us the only fully developed character, a character more about maturity than wild out-bursts, which is enough to make any serious film fan want to watch, but considering the talent on display, The Pledge should have been something so much more.
