I wouldn't say it's the greatest movie ever made, nor would I venture to say it's the greatest Disney movie ever made, but it certainly holds such a special place in so many people's hearts.  Even if you HATE the movie, you have to respect the work these kids put into their dancing, singing and acting.  First they had to learn the music, then record it, then learn the dances, block them, and practice.  Above all that, they had to learn their lines and blocking just like any other movie.  The choreography has so many different elements, so do the fight scenes, especially the riot.The plot is very simple good conquers evil, the little guy beats the big, mean, tycoon and the main characters live happily ever after, it's a very Disney type of film.  If you desire a movie with a little more depth and complexity, then don't see this film.  If you want a depressing plot where nothing goes the way it should and things just keep getting worse and worse for the characters and only evil people come out on top, don't waste your time.  If you want a realistic movie about poor boys living on the streets of New York City circa 1900, starving, without food, and ultimately curling up in little balls just to die, go on to the next film in the database. This movie is not realistic(how many people do you know that randomly break out into choreographed song and dance when the mood is right?) but it is incredibly entertaining with great songs, terrific choreography, and a cast of wonderful kids with plenty of charisma, great ability as dancers, and wonderful voices.I love this movie.  As a dancer and a singer, I think it's wonderful to see so many boys dedicating so much time and effort to an art that is not as macho as some people take it to be.  It takes guts to do that and I give all of the guys in this movie a huge thumbs-up for taking this challenge and making it into a wonderful film.By the way, some of you don't seem to realize that the movie was not entitled Jack Kelley and the Newsies and the whole film should not be critiqued on the basis that Christian Bale is a good-looking person.  I have to admit, I think he's wonderful in this movie, his acting, dancing, and singing tie the whole thing together and I think he's absolutely adorable in this film, but the movie could still suck even with a cute headliner.  Make your criticisms with a bit more depth than Oh My God, Christian Bale is so HOT! because it gives no insight into the movie and is incredibly childish.Please don't dissuade people from writing their comments even though they are negative.  Not everyone liked this movie and that's ok.  Everyone is entitled to their opinions and everyone is entitled to write their opinions here (freedom of speech, remember that one?).  That is why this feature was created to let people who haven't seen the movie listen to other people's thoughts and decide whether it's worth the three bucks to go rent it. Personally, I would skip the renting and BUY the movie, but that's just me.Overall, if you're looking for a fun, entertaining movie that will make you laugh, sing, and dance along with these boys as they conquer New York, look into it, but make your own decisions after you watch it.

If only one of these aspects had been at fault I could have looked past it but unfortunately nothing was handled well. Firstly in an age of digital effects like those seen in Lord of the rings and Spider-man audiences have come to expect good effects not Zombies created with a bit of green make-up and dogs covered in tinned spaghetti the one digital effect they did spend any money on looked like it was created on an etchasketch, I was more impressed with the graphics in the game than the film. I understand the budget was fairly low but even low-budget horror movies have still managed to produce genuinely scaring looking effects, one only has to watch From Dusk 'til Dawn or The Evil Dead to see that.The plot's only good point was that it was an original piece of work with nothing I could see taken from the game apart from some of the names and monsters, but if you took away the dogs, the licker, the umbrella corporation and racoon city and called the virus the U-virus or something similar then nothing would remind you even slightly of the game, which can sometimes be a good thing if the writer can come up with an original story better than the one in the game, but he can't, it's predictable (you know who the bad guy is after the first 15 minutes) there is no suspense other than that created by the overly loud sound-track which accompanies ever scare so you can hear the surprise coming every time. In an age of self-knowing films like Scream it's hard to believe that it takes the characters the entire length of the film to realize their in trouble and I'm pretty sure the word Zombie isn't mentioned once. This may have been a conscious decision to avoid getting called a typical zombie movie but that is exactly what the film is so why try and disguise it, there are gaping plot holes that the dialogue tries to cover over but fails, such as how the virus goes from an airborne virus, which would presumably affect the squad, to a contact transmitted one even though the virus clearly needs to be injected into rabbits and it would surely make sense to stay as an airborne virus to reach as many hosts as possible or to engineer it so that it couldn't become airborne from a safety point of view not change from one to the other as it felt like it. The dialogue could have been written by a child it was that simple and very stupid there was no wit, which is a well established feature of this type of movie and of life in general, but none of the characters display this laugh in the face of danger attitude audiences have come to expect and enjoy. I have read the George Romero Script on the net (although there is no guarantee it was actually written by Romero) and whoever actually did write it isn't important as it is much better than the film, even in it's first draft stage. The numerous characters are all given enough dialogue to give you a 3-dimensional feel to them and all are dealt with in a fitting way, the story is close to the game but still entertaining and suspenseful, the creatures are well used and fit in to the story aptly and while it would have required a much bigger budget it would have saved me the 2hrs of boredom sitting through the filmed version gave. Maybe it is unfair to criticize the acting considering the material they had but nobody made the most of it and there was never any sense that they were real people but instead objects to be dispatched by various badly conceived monsters and awful special effects. I can only imagine all the actors involved pleading to be killed off. How Mila Jovovich gets away with showing so much flesh in her movies including this one is a question I'd like answered especially when it is so unnecessary. I wasn't the only person in the audience who laughed out loud at some of the terrible scenes in this film and I can only hope that Paul Anderson isn't allowed to make any more films although with him already signed on for Resident Evil 2 it seems the movie going public will be bored by his awful movies for many years to come.

I understand the budget was fairly low but even low-budget horror movies have still managed to produce genuinely scaring looking effects, one only has to watch From Dusk 'til Dawn or The Evil Dead to see that.The plot's only good point was that it was an original piece of work with nothing I could see taken from the game apart from some of the names and monsters, but if you took away the dogs, the licker, the umbrella corporation and racoon city and called the virus the U-virus or something similar then nothing would remind you even slightly of the game, which can sometimes be a good thing if the writer can come up with an original story better than the one in the game, but he can't, it's predictable (you know who the bad guy is after the first 15 minutes) there is no suspense other than that created by the overly loud sound-track which accompanies ever scare so you can hear the surprise coming every time. In an age of self-knowing films like Scream it's hard to believe that it takes the characters the entire length of the film to realize their in trouble and I'm pretty sure the word Zombie isn't mentioned once. This may have been a conscious decision to avoid getting called a typical zombie movie but that is exactly what the film is so why try and disguise it, there are gaping plot holes that the dialogue tries to cover over but fails, such as how the virus goes from an airborne virus, which would presumably affect the squad, to a contact transmitted one even though the virus clearly needs to be injected into rabbits and it would surely make sense to stay as an airborne virus to reach as many hosts as possible or to engineer it so that it couldn't become airborne from a safety point of view not change from one to the other as it felt like it. The dialogue could have been written by a child it was that simple and very stupid there was no wit, which is a well established feature of this type of movie and of life in general, but none of the characters display this laugh in the face of danger attitude audiences have come to expect and enjoy. I have read the George Romero Script on the net (although there is no guarantee it was actually written by Romero) and whoever actually did write it isn't important as it is much better than the film, even in it's first draft stage. The numerous characters are all given enough dialogue to give you a 3-dimensional feel to them and all are dealt with in a fitting way, the story is close to the game but still entertaining and suspenseful, the creatures are well used and fit in to the story aptly and while it would have required a much bigger budget it would have saved me the 2hrs of boredom sitting through the filmed version gave. Maybe it is unfair to criticize the acting considering the material they had but nobody made the most of it and there was never any sense that they were real people but instead objects to be dispatched by various badly conceived monsters and awful special effects. I can only imagine all the actors involved pleading to be killed off. How Mila Jovovich gets away with showing so much flesh in her movies including this one is a question I'd like answered especially when it is so unnecessary. I wasn't the only person in the audience who laughed out loud at some of the terrible scenes in this film and I can only hope that Paul Anderson isn't allowed to make any more films although with him already signed on for Resident Evil 2 it seems the movie going public will be bored by his awful movies for many years to come. An man sitting behind me in the cinema commented, once the film had finished, that it was The best film I've ever seen I can only assume this was the first film this person had ever seen.

It is a completely recycled version of the age-old sport film plot, with a hero at the top of his game who becomes injured just enough to allow an underdog to come in and become a hero himself, but not quite enough to prevent him from retaining some hero status by coaching the team to victory. I'll go ahead and give the obligatory spoilers warning now, although Varsity Blues is one of those movies where you really know what's going to happen from the beginning. Given that, we should concentrate more on the way that we're told a story that we already essentially know, but even that is not very interesting. We get to see plenty of actors in their mid twenties pretend like they're high school kids doing freaky high school things, but we are never for a second able to look away from the fact that these are actors. Nothing is real in the film because none of the actors are fit to play the roles of high school kids. Let's consider a few ages, James Van Der Beek was about 22 years old when he took on the role of Jonathon Moxon. Amy Smart is 23 years old in the film, Ron Lester, the charmer who played Billy Bob, was 24, Scott Caan was also about 23, as was Ali Larter when she donned the infamous whipped cream bikini, and for crying out loud, Paul Walker was freaking 26!!  It's easy to see that they wanted to cast more well known actors to play the roles of these kids in the movie because they wanted to guarantee a certain box-office value, but these actors ended up removing any sense of believability from the movie. It should be kept in mind that often the greatest films are the ones that go out on a limb and cast unknown actors in extraordinary situations. It's too bad that familiarity was deemed more important than believability in this movie, because with only a little bit of plot work, Varsity Blues could have been an enormously better film. The movie is peppered with frustrating situations that don't fit with the rest of the movie. Jonathon Moxon is a high school kid who is more mature than any high school kid in the world. I guess they wanted to deliver a message about getting a real education rather than just focusing on something like football at the expense of your grades, but no high school kid on the planet would hesitate for a second to be the starting quarterback on the school football team, especially when the football team is the biggest thing in the town, just so he can concentrate on his grades or his girlfriend or anything else. I played high school football, and being one of the best players on the football team in high school is like being a rock star (although I don't know this from personal experience!). In general, although I am definitely a red-blooded American male, I tend to frown on unnecessary nudity in the movies. There is a place for unnecessary nudity &#150; hell, there's a whole friggin' genre for it! &#150; but the problem is that there are way too many movies released these days that use nudity to pull along a weak script, and the script of Varsity Blues is so weak that it's pretty much a guarantee that this is why we saw so much nudity in the film. I can't say that it was entirely unappreciated, but it was obvious that there was a whipped cream bikini and a stolen cop car full of naked high school girls and a stripping teacher in the film because the story and plot were little more than recycled garbage. Besides that, the movie doesn't even seem to want to have nudity in it. It's like it wants to show just enough to keep our eyelids from drooping, but not enough to allow us to notice that it knows how weakly written it is. Any scene involving nudity is accompanied simultaneously with awkward discomfort, hinting that the movie doesn't know what to do with nudity or that it doesn't really want it to be there at all. There's nothing new presented in Varsity Blues, it is yet another presentation of the same old thing that we've seen in countless football movies before, and in this case, it is even acted universally by actors who don't fit their roles. The only person who pulls any weight in the film is John Voigt, which is rather unfortunate because of the person he plays. Voigt is one of the better actors working today, and he is amazingly good at playing people that are wonderfully hate-able, it's just too bad that the only person that is at all convincing in the entire movie is a character that is meant to be disliked. Leaves you with a bad aftertaste, which is unfortunate for the staying power of the film, but not exactly unfitting with its quality.

We never see the faces of adults particularly, and the faces of the children that we saw (such as Andy, the vicious Sid, and his pathetic little sister) are obviously animated and do not fit in with the level of reality achieved by the rest of the film. In Toy Story 2, we see a lot more faces, and while they're still never done quite right, it's good to see that they have made a significant improvement in this area.  In the original Toy Story, we were so fascinated to see a presentation of the real life that we all imagined that our toys had when we were away that that was enough to make a great story for a great film, while in the sequel we are taken a lot deeper into the lives of our toys, which possess a lot more than even the extensive amount of emotion seen in the first film. The toys seem to possess a much deeper sense of neglect than was made clear by their competition over who is the favorite toy in the first movie, and we are even treated to an overly emotional and altogether unnecessary song called `When She Loved Me,' which really only serves to sadden the entire film and slow it down.  There is an entirely new antagonist presented in the character of Big Al, the toy baron who desperately seeks Woody as the last toy to complete a classic collector set which he is planning on selling for some huge amount of money. We learn about Woody's past in this way, and he is faced with the conflict of staying with his friends (Andy's toys, as well as Andy himself), or returning to what I guess would be called his family, with the unfortunate addition that if he decides to do that, he will remain in a box and be looked at the rest of his existence, never to be played with or loved by a child again. The characters, thankfully, have all returned for the second movie, and we are again treated to a great show of hilarious adventure with them all, including a wonderful scene in which Buzz Lightyear finally encounters the evil Emperor Zurg, which results in a great toy battle scene that plays respectfully (note that, Kevin Smith, RESPECTFULLY) off of the battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back.  The movie is yet another marvel of animation from the people at Pixar, and it does not fail in the least to generate laughs (see, for example, the ultimate result of the battle between Zurg and Buzz).

It's a comedy with a little too much heart, which makes it a little lop-sided, but the adventure is undeniably strong.

I stumbled across it at the public library; I have never seen it in a theater, in any video store or on cable. It belongs in that small but distinguished genre of Movies About Food. Its structure most resembles Babette's Feast, where the dramatic climax of the film is a sumptuous yet exuberant banquet. Despite the characters' constant bickering and occasional fighting, this is a film of refreshing gentleness, an independent film of the type Hollywood seems incapable of even imagining, much less making. It is circa 1958 in what I take to be a Jersey shore town, although it could be anywhere from Maine to Maryland. Two brothers, immigrants from Italy, run Il Paradiso, a restaurant that is about to go under after two years. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the Bobby Fischer of chefs Of superlative genius and creativity but impractical, difficult, a purist, disdainful of commercialism in any form. He is a dysphoric, dedicated Puck compared to Emeril Lagasse's Bottom (a metaphor, not a pun). Secundo (Stanley Tucci) is the younger brother, a good chef himself but trying to succeed mainly as the restaurant manager. The restaurant's impending failure is probably for several reasons but a big one is Primo's steadfast refusal to compromise his vision, to 'give people what they want,' unlike the tremendously successful Italian restaurant down the street run by Pascal (Ian Holm). Although Secundo is in constant chagrin about Primo's stiff-necked refusal to cater to public taste, he also recognizes that his brother's talent is rare and precious and hesitates to force the restaurant menu in a more popular and profitable direction. Eventually Pascal, who claims to know everyone, offers to help out by delivering bandleader Louis Prima to Il Paradiso so that they will profit from the publicity. But the film, though sweet, also establishes an undertone of such mournfulness that the viewer is not surprised when Prima never shows up, in fact, was never going to show up; it was a brutal trick by Pascal, who recognizes the brothers' abilities, so that they would be forced to close the restaurant and, he hopes, go to work for him. But that is not where the impact of the denouement lies, and there is no neat Hollywood-style resolution at the end, just an affirmation of the two brothers' love for each other and their dedication to good cuisine.Stanley Tucci's endeavors in independent film-making aren't always successful (viz., The Impostors), but this one is one of his triumphs. He and the Wisconsin Lebanese Tony Shalhoub speak what sounds like very convincing Italian to each other. When Shalhoub played Antonio Scarpacci in 'Wings,' his faux Italian accent was comical, but it sounds real in 'Big Night.' Minnie Driver shows up in a supporting role, with hair dyed a sort of carrot color, again doing her perfect American accent. Allison Janney, as Primo's romantic interest, gets more screen time than her supporting billing would suggest. Isabella Rossellini has a small but crucial role. Watch her switch between English and her native Italian In Italian, all of her linguistic mannerisms change, and she suddenly becomes much more natural and animated. The production designer chose mostly pastels for this film, which work very well. One unconvincing detail in the film is that, although it appears to be the 'on' season from the weather, the street the restaurant is on is always nearly deserted despite being only a couple of blocks from the beach. There should be more people walking to and from the beach. Perhaps the budget didn't permit hiring, dressing or directing the extras you'd need to populate the street with summer beachgoers, or perhaps the absence of people on the street is a deliberate metaphor for the poor business the restaurant is doing.

NO ONE, no matter what cracks in the sistem he's aware of, can get REAL documents like those BY MAIL. You have to actually show up for the process to begin. And Andy never says anything about someone doing this for him. He's no carrer criminal, so he can't know people willing to commit a felony (impersonating someone else to get license and S.S. number is a felony), no legit guy would ever risk end up in jail. And THEIR picture would end up on the license, so Andy not only would have to supply them with bogus ID (he required all that to a specific name) to get license and S.S. number, he would have to forge the license (place his own picture), and he don't look like a forge artist to me, nor has such connections.4.- He gets gang-raped many times and doesn't end up traumatized.

Scorsese's Goodfellas and Casino, Scarface, and the Godfather series are all what I consider to be some of the best Mob\/Gangster movies out there.  I'd heard that Road to Perdition was going to be the new best Gangster and knowing of the amazing cast I had to see it.My first thought after the movie was that I wouldn't necessarily call this a Gangster movie in the caliber of Godfather or Goodfellas.  This movie (to me) is more a movie about the undeniable relationship between a father and son.  Yes, of course this movie is about the mob, but to me what stood out more than Tom Hanks looks so bad-ass with a tommy gun is how Tom Hanks reminds me of my dad, or The way the little boy will always love is father reminds me of the way I will always feel about my dad.  This movie is a near perfect encapsulation of the previously un-definable and intangible relationship between a father and his son.In my opinion, this movie's greatest strength lies in those who bring it to life.  Sam Mendes is as gifted as they come in terms of directing and cinematography.  There are things done from a directors standpoint in this movie that I have never seen done before, as well as takes already existing directing techniques to new levels.  Just like in American Beauty, Sam Mendes holds absolutely nothing back in Road to Perdition.  He chooses not to censor anything to the detriment of the movie.  During the scene where a woman and child are killed, Sam chooses not to directly film them. Instead, we hear the screams of the mother, we see charaters walk into the room where they lay dead and come out horrified.  He communicates this scene to us without pulling a B-movie death scene.I've alread heard some criticize this movie for being too brutal.  To their credit, it is brutal.  But its tasteful brutality.  As I previously said, Mendes communicates that this woman and child were killed, we know its brutal by the scremes of the father who discovers it and by the disconnection experienced by the womans son; we dont' need to see bulletfilled bleeding bodies.Finally (well, not really, but its all I can talk about, less saying GO SEE IT.) there is the acting.  Not a single actor or actress in this movie feels out of place or anything short of one-hundred convincing.  Everyone acts to the best of their abilities and once the movie was over I was struggling to find anyone's performance anything less than flawless.  Jude Law is an outstanding actor on his own and in this movie he shines as well. Everyone remembers his haunting voice attached to his sickly grinning face and devious persona.  Paul Newman is simply oustanding.  Every line he delivers is done as if he is the person he's portraying.  Hes convincing, powerful, rich and solid in a mobster\/godfather role and yet original as well, not appearing as though he's trying to emulate Marlon Brando or Robert De Nero.  Tyler Hoechlin, who plays Hank's son, also does an outstanding job as the troubled, confused and saddened child.  Simply put, one of the best performances in a big name movie by a young child (much unlike StarWarsEpisode1).  And finally Tom Hanks. Surprisingly, Tom Hanks actually has very few lines.  One of the greatest acheivements in this movie is Sam Mendes's flawless direction of Tom Hanks's acting ability.  Hanks communicates volumes with so few words.  This whole movie could be considered a How-To to communicate so much with almost no words.  Facial expressions, camera angles, body language, presperation, ambient noise its all used to perfection to create an amazing atmosphere, similar to what Coppola did in The Godfather.To me, this movie is so much more than just a mobster movie.  Lets face it, no matter how much we loved ScarFace and Goodfellas, we didn't necessarily cry or re-realize some emotional facet of life.  This movie teaches everyone not only about the relationship between a father and a son but also about some of the less focused on topics in gangster movies trust, loyalty, self-perception.  Many mob or gangster movies tend to focus too much on the killing and Hollywood-esque topics of gangster movies, Road to Perdition comes as a refreshing look at some of the other aspects of the Mob lifestyle.  All of this combined with a monument to some of the best acting ability in Hollywood today and you have one excellent movie.  Its very hard to find a thing that I disliked about this movie, possibly because of the amazing acting performances delivered by its incredible cast.  Its such an amazingly powerful movie, I can't think of someone I would not reccomend this movie to.  Go see it, go call you father or son afterwards.  He'll be crying too.

A laughable idea surely, and a desperate one at that.  After much delay though, I finally got to see the movie on July 20th 2002 at a UK cinema no less, the first time a Friday The 13th movie has been released on the big screen here since the pretty awful Part V A New Beginning back in 1985.  So, first of all, hats off to New Line and Entertainment Film for having the guts to give a tenth film in a slasher series a cinema run in the UK!To say director Jim Issac overcomes the shortcomings of the initial idea, is a bit of an understatement.  Thanks largely to Todd Farmer's competent and sometimes witty script, Issac is able to keep things moving at a good tempo, utilising the larger scope of Jason in space to come up with some superb set pieces, and a visual style that is far more impressive than anybody has really given it credit for.  A knowing, but mostly controlled sense of humour helps too, preventing the film from being swallowed up by its own outlandish storyline, meaning the final barrage of over the top action during the last 20 minutes work a treat.  Sure, it all becomes rather laughable, but then the film makers are in on the joke too.I can't really understand why so many have attacked the acting either.  I mean, what were we all expecting?  Laurence Olivier or Anthony Hopkins to pop up?  Or maybe, Al Pacino as Jason?  Come on people.  This is a low budget movie, with a young mostly unknown cast, and to be honest it's one of the best collected casts of the entire series (probably the best since Joseph Zito's The Final Chapter).  Indeed, the cost of the film doesn't seem to hinder Issac's ambitions.  Apart from the expected top class prothestics, the use of CGI for the space scenes is very impressive indeed ,particularly for a $15 million movie.Finally, a word for Kane Hodder.  Playing Jason for the fourth consectitive time, he's as imposing and serious as ever.  Whilst Farmer's script has fun with the trappings of the series (the jokes about premarital sex etc), never does he make fun of Jason, and Hodder's performance emphasisis this with some magnitude.  This must be the most screen time Jason has been allowed, and to Hodder's credit that despite his frequent on-screen time, he never looses his sense of menace - not once.  The film may not be that scary, but Hodder's Jason always had me glued to the screen.To be honest, Jason X is everything I hoped it would be, and more.  The only real damaging aspect of the film is Harry Manfredini's cheap sounding music score, which threatens to kill any menace Jason has.  If there is a Jason XI, I just hope another composer is hired, because as good as Manfredini's early Friday scores were, his last two, for Jason Goes To Hell, and now Jason X, have in all honesty been pretty dreadful.Placing it in with the rest of the series, it would probably be 3rd on the list, after the awesome The Final Chapter, and the under-rated if flawed Jason Takes Manhattan.  Great fun, just don't, as some people seem to be doing, expect Shakespeare.  Besides, Shakespeare was never this much fun.

After much delay though, I finally got to see the movie on July 20th 2002 at a UK cinema no less, the first time a Friday The 13th movie has been released on the big screen here since the pretty awful Part V A New Beginning back in 1985.  So, first of all, hats off to New Line and Entertainment Film for having the guts to give a tenth film in a slasher series a cinema run in the UK!To say director Jim Issac overcomes the shortcomings of the initial idea, is a bit of an understatement.  Thanks largely to Todd Farmer's competent and sometimes witty script, Issac is able to keep things moving at a good tempo, utilising the larger scope of Jason in space to come up with some superb set pieces, and a visual style that is far more impressive than anybody has really given it credit for.  A knowing, but mostly controlled sense of humour helps too, preventing the film from being swallowed up by its own outlandish storyline, meaning the final barrage of over the top action during the last 20 minutes work a treat.  Sure, it all becomes rather laughable, but then the film makers are in on the joke too.I can't really understand why so many have attacked the acting either.  I mean, what were we all expecting?  Laurence Olivier or Anthony Hopkins to pop up?  Or maybe, Al Pacino as Jason?  Come on people.  This is a low budget movie, with a young mostly unknown cast, and to be honest it's one of the best collected casts of the entire series (probably the best since Joseph Zito's The Final Chapter).  Indeed, the cost of the film doesn't seem to hinder Issac's ambitions.  Apart from the expected top class prothestics, the use of CGI for the space scenes is very impressive indeed ,particularly for a $15 million movie.Finally, a word for Kane Hodder.  Playing Jason for the fourth consectitive time, he's as imposing and serious as ever.  Whilst Farmer's script has fun with the trappings of the series (the jokes about premarital sex etc), never does he make fun of Jason, and Hodder's performance emphasisis this with some magnitude.  This must be the most screen time Jason has been allowed, and to Hodder's credit that despite his frequent on-screen time, he never looses his sense of menace - not once.  The film may not be that scary, but Hodder's Jason always had me glued to the screen.To be honest, Jason X is everything I hoped it would be, and more.  The only real damaging aspect of the film is Harry Manfredini's cheap sounding music score, which threatens to kill any menace Jason has.  If there is a Jason XI, I just hope another composer is hired, because as good as Manfredini's early Friday scores were, his last two, for Jason Goes To Hell, and now Jason X, have in all honesty been pretty dreadful.Placing it in with the rest of the series, it would probably be 3rd on the list, after the awesome The Final Chapter, and the under-rated if flawed Jason Takes Manhattan.  Great fun, just don't, as some people seem to be doing, expect Shakespeare.  Besides, Shakespeare was never this much fun.

It is chock full of one-liners and sight gags that come fast and furious.  So much so, that I'm sure some viewers will miss things the first time around.Val Kilmer is indeed underrated the guy can act, sing, and dance!  You don't see many actors these days that are that well trained in the film industry.  How many of you were smart enough to buy the five-track vinyl EP of Val singing the songs from Top Secret all those years ago?  It's one of my most prized possessions.  When listening to Nick Rivers sing you too will scream NEEK!The spoofs of Elvis and spy movies are the main focus, but you'll be treated to plenty more references from The Wizard Of Oz to The Blue Lagoon, and everything is interwoven with brilliance. After all, in what universe or time did this East Germany exist? This concept for Top Secret is so bizarre and I think it just can't be topped. The cheesy pizzas at Der Pizza Haus had me laughing so hard I was crying.  Undoubtedly it would receive a PG-13 if released today, this film had a lot of great adult humor in it for a PG.  I was gasping and laughing so hard at the introduction of the Anal Intruder product -- as with that scene, everything was played so sincerely that you just couldn't believe what you were seeing.  Of course, the Swedish bookshop has to be considered one of the funniest, most clever, and complicated sequences in film history.  Frankly, I enjoy this film a lot more than Airplane (a classic too of course), as it touches on things that I relate to more.  Yes, I GOT the Pinto joke....our family owned one of those cars. Speaking of cars, seeing Omar Sharif crunched up in a car cube was astonishing!  There's so much attention to detail in EVERY frame of this film, down to even the choice of backing singers for Nick Rivers when he performs.  Simply amazing.There's no need for me to go on and on about this film, as I'm sure many have read all there is to know about the plot and what people consider the funniest moments.  I primarily wanted to get my two cents worth in and say that Top Secret is a true classic, deserves a lot more respect, and maybe Paramount will some day put out a MORE special edition of the DVD than the one that's available now -- this is the one movie I have been waiting for on DVD more than any other besides the release of Eraserhead in 2002.Top Secret is a real treat and will have you singing Skeet Surfin' for days!  Say, where can I get one of those giant telephones?

NYPD cop John McClane(Bruce Willis) goes to LA to be re-united with his wife Holly(Bonnie Bedelia). There's a party thrown in the Nakatomi building with 40 floors and the party is organized on the 30th floor. Once John is there to celebrate Christmas with his wife, 10 min later the building is taken over by terrorists. They got everyone as a hostage except for John McClane, who now has to defeat the terrorists.'Die Hard' is definitely the best action movie ever. Here are the reasons1) The plot is really great. A cop has to defeat terrorists on his own. He finds out that these are really professional terrorists who are very intelligent and he realizes that his wife is in danger, the only 2 things he can do is to use all of his brains, and to confront the terrorists. This story is really original and many movies have copied this story, for example 'Air Force One', 'Sudden Death', 'Under Siege' and many more.2) Suspense combined with non-stop action and a little sense of humor and that on every floor of the building. Explosions, stunts, guns, helicopters, tanks, violence,... it has everything it needs.3) Good cast Bruce Willis as the cop, Bonnie Bedelia as his wife, Alan Rickman as the bad guy, Reginald VelJohnson as the police man, who helps John from the outside of the building. I have to say that all the characters did a excellent job. The acting skills are very good with no silly dialogues. Alan Rickman surprised me the most with his role as the cold-blooded terrorist. I'd give him an Oscar for that. I'm not joking. And Reginald VelJohnson and Bonnie Bedelia fit right in this work of art. And Bruce Willis just rules as the unbeatable cop, the savior of Christmas. He carries together with Alan Rockman the whole movie and this is definitely his best performance in his career, he's just amazing and became very famous with lines like 'Yippi-Ka-Yee, motherf***er! and 'Jerk-weed'. He's simply the best as the hero who saves the hostages and his wife and after all that, he surely deserved a nice Christmas.4) The reality If you see this, this could happen in reality, it's a believable film, maybe that's why this movie has a lot of suspense. I bet that the people who saw it in the cinema were jammed to their seats.5) John McTiernan A very good director who has much experience with action movies, for example 'Predator', 'Last Action Hero', 'The Hunt for the Red October' and 'Die Hard With A Vengeance'. He really made a worth seeing spectacle who's really the mother of the action movies.So get your ass off that seat and see 'Die Hard' and his sequels now. You won't regret it.
