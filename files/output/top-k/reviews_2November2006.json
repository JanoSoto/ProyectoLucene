I prefer the original because I think the story is really about obsession. Raymond and Rex share this quality and the ending of the original speaks to this obsession. Rex meets his end out of his complete and utter obsession with finding out what happened to Saskia. Raymond's meticulous pursuit of murder results from a philosophical obsession. With the remake, Keifer selling the story rights to Hollywood is fitting for the films mundane ending, not to mention the perfect metaphor for a sell-out ending. To me, Rex in the box, flicking his lighter and screaming for Saskia is a truly frightening moment. It's classic horror with no blood, guts or severed limbs.

Coming into the film I had not clue of what it was about other than the fact that it had something to do with shoes.All around this was a good film, although there are things that keep it from greatness. Every aspect of the film was adequate, but I think that every aspect was missing something. The actors were good but at times, Ali revealed that he was acting to a camera and not living through the character, though I thought that the actress who played Zahra did very good. I felt that the camera work in the film was simply adequate, it didn't move enough and the compositions were not exceptional enough to make me forget about the camera's lack of movement. Of course there were exceptions in the film, moments of magic, but most of the time it lacked that certain spark. Also the plotting of the film, and some of the montage sequences don't work very well. The sequence where Ali goes with his father on a side job is one. I don't mind that this entire sequence, including the bad-luck ending, really had nothing to do with anything else that would seem to happen in the story; but the way it was put together just made it seem uninteresting most of the time, especially when Ali and the other boy are supposed to be 'playing' and having fun with each other, it just seemed so stale. I require more from my films. A good film with good moments, but not great.SPOILERSAlso, I'm not really sure what this film says to me. Ali, the main character lies throughout the film, and he never really suffers because of it-even when he was sent home he never gets in trouble and we never see if he has to bring his father to school with him, so he is never really confronted with having to tell the truth or accept a real punishment or beating for being late all of the time and being sent home. He is afraid to tell the truth for fear of punishment, and or hurting his own pride. Instead he cries and gets off easy. Another thing, I know that this film was not made for a western audience, but some things are hard to understand fully. I wish I could have at least had a subtitle for the song being sung in the mosque while the father was making tea and began to weep. I want to better understand why he is weeping, is he full of joy in the power of God, or is he thinking about how bad his life is and is sad? I know that Iran is a very religious country, so I guess it is just understood that he would be very religious, but I wish that I could have seen more of that aspect of their lives.Also, one last complaint\/question. I have no clue how the school systems work in Iran, but I did not understand how Zahra could go to school for a while, and then come home and trade off shoes with Ali, and then when he came home it still seemed like it was the middle of the day. How long\/short is a school day in Iran? Do different grades go in the morning while other grades go i the afternoon(even though he was in third grade, and she was in 4th or 5th-pretty close grades to be splitting like that). That part didn't make sense to me, and it was an integral part of the story, and it just confuses me to how this would work.

Wyman plays a rather young widow existing somewhat blandly in an upper middle class neighborhood while her two children are off at school. One day, when her pal Moorehead isn't able to stay for lunch as planned, she invites her handsome gardener to share some rolls and coffee. Hudson, the gardener, clearly looks at life from a different perspective and, try as she might, Wyman eventually finds herself becoming captivated with him. (The fact that he's a gorgeous, tan hunk with a warm, gentle voice doesn't exactly help prevent her from falling under his spell!) The two begin a tentative, but comfortable, relationship, egged on by Hudson's plain-living friends Drake and Grey. However, when Wyman breaks the news to Moorehead and, especially to her children Talbott and Reynolds, she is greeted by waves of concern and disapproval. De Wit, as the town gossip, sprays lighter fluid all over the situation at every opportunity. Wyman's reprehensibly selfish children stomp their feet until she is forced to give up her chance at a happy existence and resign herself to life in front of the television. Soon, however, she is forced to examine her feelings once more and must decide whether to sink or swim as a nonconformist. The rigid, stifling world of the country club set is given a kick in the pants. (Sadly, places like this still exist, though the outfits and furnishings are different and, just as sadly, many a widow still rides out her remaining life in front of the TV.) Wyman and Hudson had previously been paired by director Sirk in the massive hit Magnificent Obsession, so placing them in another hand-wringing love story was a no-brainer. Wyman has a somewhat softer persona in this one and, not being blind as she was in the earlier film, is permitted to give a more intuitive and nuanced performance facially. Her hair is longer and less helmet-like and she sports some chic fashion ensembles (as well as some delicately tatted head scarves.) Hudson is unspectacular acting-wise, but very easy on the eyes and quite appealing. It's very easy to see why Wyman's character falls for him. Less so on his end, but presumably the 1955 audience took their Magnificent memories into the theatre with them and easily bought the attraction between the couple. Moorehead (another co-star from the prior film) is solid as Wyman's sounding board and ally. Interestingly, she seems unable to keep her hands off Wyman. Nagel pops up as a stodgy, older man who everyone would like to marry Wyman, thus keeping her securely in the enclave. Talbott spouts a lot of psycho-babble which is meant to be amusing. Much of it is amusing now for the wrong reasons. In a brief role, Janssen turns up as her boyfriend. Reynolds is beautiful physically, but downright offensive emotionally and socially. Both kids needed to be spanked, and often. The film is bathed in an assortment of special lighting and is dotted with splashes of intense color. The lush score is stirring. The settings are eye-catching. All ingredients work together to create a splendid viewing experience. Term papers could be written about the symbolic and ironic touches sprinkled throughout the movie. What better place to set a story about a woman whose love life is the object of scorn than Stoningham? A broken piece of china that Hudson wants left where it fell suggests turmoil in his family's past (no mention is ever made of his mother, which may account for his affection for a woman 15 years his senior.) Sirk, who had no great love for this material (or for that of a few others he was handed) took the opportunity to spin art out of dross and now his films are regarded as unique, fascinating works.

My sister and I were jumping up and down, dying to see it... we were both about 11...And, I was impressed. But I look at the movie now, and I must say, although there are a number of flaws, the movie adaptation of the novel brings out the true spirit of Harry Potter that JK Rowling intended.The movie basically walked off the pages for me, and every character was as I pictured them to be. First things first- the acting. Richard Harris was, and still remains to this day, the greatest Dumbledore I have ever seen. Micheal Gambton, although good, cannot match the perfection that Richard Harris achieved when he played his character as Dumbledore.Daniel Radcliffe, although new to movies, still did an excellent job, and played his part well. Indeed, his character really was what I visualized. All the way down from how he talks to how he walks, still gets me as to how good of an actor Daniel Radcliffe is.Emma Watson, my personal favorite actress up to date, definitely perfected her character as Hermione. Bossy, know it all Hermione... and she did an amazing job at it...

It's not a classic and on occasions it comes over as crude and stilted, but it also has many fine things going for it. Although he never really opens it out, Mankiewicz gives it a fluency that isn't at all theatrical and although he often films scenes intimately and between only two characters, he ensures it is photographed and cut in a very cinematic fashion.Unfortunately, one of the two people on screen during these 'cinematic' sequences is Montgomery Clift who is at his worst here. It was after his accident and he looks as if he's in pain. When he walks it's as if there is a board up his back and he talks as if out of the side of his mouth. Luckily, with him in these scenes is either Elizabeth Taylor or Katharine Hepburn or both and when they are on screen you don't pay too much attention to Clift.Dilys Powell said Elizabeth Taylor was born to play Tennessee Williams and she was right. Indeed this may be her best performance after Virginia Woolf. Catherine's lines don't have the kind of poetry in them that Violet Venable's does but Taylor finds a poetry of her own in her readings. She builds on her long speech at the end and is very moving, even if Mankiewicz can't resist 'showing' us, in flashbacks, what Taylor is telling us, as if he doesn't trust an audience to sit still and just listen to Taylor. (They would have to in the theatre).As Violet, Hepburn has the showier part and she milks it for all it's worth. It's a great piece of acting because Violet never seems to be acting, though she tends to think of her life as a kind of performance, something she has passed on to her homosexual son, Sebastian. (If the old adage, 'my mother made me a homosexual', has any validity you don't have to look any further than here). She enters from above, descending in her small baroque lift, and Hepburn can see the comic potential in such an entrance. Moments later, however, she is recounting how the sea-turtles were devoured by flesh-eating birds in the Galapogos, and you can see just how dangerously unstable this woman really is.Any film that has acting of this calibre automatically qualifies as worth seeking out, (you forgive the lame work of Clift and Gary Raymond and draw a blind over Mercedes McCambridge, though Albert Dekker is very fine), but this qualifies on other grounds; as one of the better Tennessee Williams adaptations, (he co-wrote it with Gore Vidal), as a flawed, dated but strangely fascinating example of how Hollywood viewed homosexuality at the time, (negatively, naturally, but any face, no matter how horribly distorted, so long as it was in the public gaze, was better than no face at all), and as a serious addition to the Joe Mankiewicz canon.

She's just great. Such a pent up neurotic would steer one inch and she would become a caricature. Instead, every gesture is perfect, every fit of hysteria just has to be there. Like every note in a Bach sonata. Her icy, statuesque beauty, allure and hairdo (!) make it all come together. The scene in an unexpected sexy white night gown asking for love from his estranged husband is a small, very small gem ).Cinematography is BEAUTIFUL, I want to live in this house! (Unocuppied if possible )). To all of us who have read The castle of Otranto in loony early teens, this was what Walpole was talking about )!Horror is the contrary to gore. It's atmosphere, not ketchup. This is more of a psychological study (and a lesson in acting, let us not forget Fionnula Flanagan and Grace's bratty daughter. By the way, I LOVE everybody's English usage, and how it reveals class differences between Master and servant. Body language too!This is a MENTAL drama, the plot wisely gives us SOME keys to keep us engaged, but never enough to foresee what's coming. At least not me! kate_hartshorn (Irvine, CA) is right this could well be a practical case of a psychology of perception course. And I agree with Mr. Kleinman from Portland (also on Amazon) that one should better NOT read much before the film. I was lucky enough this time to only watch the pictures and a general look at the cast. Had I read even Amazon's plot keywords would have basically spoilt all the fun (as it has, many times before).I didn't really FEEL much for the characters, although I confess I suffered with poor troubled Grace.

Dark, depressing, and often grainy-looking and washed out. Marathon Man fits that description. It's good, of course - very good - but it's not exactly a good time. Know what I mean?William Goldman, one of Hollywood's few celebrity screenwriters, wrote both the original novel and the script for this film version. I find him a bit overrated, but here he does a good job of elevating hack-level thriller material into a sort of art form. The beginning of the film is particularly well-written and intriguing, since it's full of creepy and cryptic events that are not immediately explained. But, alas, I find the ultimate explanation of these events to be rather prosaic and disappointing.So, I think the movie's strengths lie in the acting and directing, more so than the story. Olivier and Scheider give particularly great performances, and Marthe Keller comes across as appropriately sweet and sexy (her big secret, though, should be really easy for anyone to guess!) I'm a little less enamored of Dustin Hoffman, whose character is inexplicably nicknamed Babe. He's just way too old to be a typical graduate student (almost forty years old, to be precise), and he simply doesn't have much charisma to me. Usually I like normal-looking, non-glamorous actors, but somehow Hoffman doesn't float my boat.Still, it's hard not to sympathize with the poor guy while he's being pursued, beaten, tortured etc. The dental horror scene is still quite effective, though it's rather short; I was more impressed by the subsequent chase through the dark streets of NYC. (The city, by the way, looks like a hellish, crime-infested, debris-strewn pit in this movie - like it does in most 1970s productions!)In the end, Marathon Man isn't quite another French Connection, but it's got more than enough suspense to crush a lot of the dross that infests theaters today. It's worth watching just for the terrifying scene when the bad guys start tearing Hoffman's door off its hinges - it's good stuff.

I think his ego is so enormous that it almost always oozes out of his performances making them dripping with sarcasm and over acted scenes. He has done some good films both recently and in the past but overall he thinks he is far better than he is. However it wasn't until the credits rolled on The Crossing Guard that I knew Mr. Sean Penn himself had directed and wrote this powerful film and kudos to him because he did an incredible job. The Crossing Guard is gritty, dark, bleak, a sad and depressing look into grief and death that will not bring you to tears but rather horror at how deep grief can take someone. That someone that we see gives such a powerful performance that I might go so far as to say that it is one of his best performances if not THEE best to date. Penn must known something about grief and the dark place a human can go because he captures the emotion like no other film I have ever seen and perhaps he owes a big part of that to his cast. I am still completely confused by the title...I mean I get that The Crossing Guard watches Nicholson's character as he almost makes his kill but other than that I don't make the connection. But title aside this is a must see film!! Jack Nicholson plays Freddy Gale, the completely distraught, hopelessly depressed and lost father of a young girl killed by a drunk driver that spiraled his life into hopelessness. He lost his wife, his two sons who now know his ex-wife's new husband as Dad. He's got questionable business practices running a seed Jewellery store, and his only friends and hang out are in a strip joint. Gale is such an intriguing and incredibly depthy and emotional character. I have never seen Nicholson embrace a character like this and take the film goer on such an incredible ride of emotions. This is a Nicholson MUST SEE performance and he should have been praised to no end for this role. It's under rated and his best and he's done some incredible work. The role of Freddie Gale is like this fragile bomb that is falling apart and ready to explode at any moment which is a suspenseful character to say the least. Anjelica Huston brilliantly plays Freddie's ex-wife Mary whom still cares for her ex-husband but has tried to piece her life back together after the death of their daughter. Huston and Nicholson's scenes together are stunning and her character is a showing of grief from a completely different perspective but just as interesting. She is very good in this performance and Golden Globe nominated which is deserved but a sham considering Nicholson was shut out. The incredible David Morse rounds out the main cast as the man who killed their daughter John Booth. Booth has now just been released from prison and must try to fit into society all the while dealing with his own guilt and grief for the murder he committed. He is equally as emotional and depthy as any of the other characters and once again shows another side of grief to the story.I can't speak enough about the absolute brilliance of this film. It captures pain and emotion like no other film I've ever seen and brilliantly and perfectly shows it from three very different angles and each one just as powerful as the next although we are seeing the story through the eyes of the completely devastated and angry Freddy Gale. The tone of the film is so depressing and brings you through such a range of emotions it's almost hard to bear. I definitely don't recommend this film to anyone who has lost someone recently because it's a tough film to watch but important and so powerful. An absolute classic that is not treated like one...a rare and stunning piece of cinema. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 November 2006","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Now I must start by saying that personally I vehemently dislike Sean Penn. I think his ego is so enormous that it almost always oozes out of his performances making them dripping with sarcasm and over acted scenes. He has done some good films both recently and in the past but overall he thinks he is far better than he is. However it wasn't until the credits rolled on The Crossing Guard that I knew Mr. Sean Penn himself had directed and wrote this powerful film and kudos to him because he did an incredible job. The Crossing Guard is gritty, dark, bleak, a sad and depressing look into grief and death that will not bring you to tears but rather horror at how deep grief can take someone. That someone that we see gives such a powerful performance that I might go so far as to say that it is one of his best performances if not THEE best to date. Penn must known something about grief and the dark place a human can go because he captures the emotion like no other film I have ever seen and perhaps he owes a big part of that to his cast. I am still completely confused by the title...I mean I get that The Crossing Guard watches Nicholson's character as he almost makes his kill but other than that I don't make the connection. But title aside this is a must see film!! Jack Nicholson plays Freddy Gale, the completely distraught, hopelessly depressed and lost father of a young girl killed by a drunk driver that spiraled his life into hopelessness. He lost his wife, his two sons who now know his ex-wife's new husband as Dad. He's got questionable business practices running a seed Jewellery store, and his only friends and hang out are in a strip joint. Gale is such an intriguing and incredibly depthy and emotional character. I have never seen Nicholson embrace a character like this and take the film goer on such an incredible ride of emotions.
