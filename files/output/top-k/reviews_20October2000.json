This was the one that sparked classics like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Dick Tracy, The Neverending Story and , of course, the other Indiana Jones movies. It is both a satire and a tribute to the old adventure serials shown on TV that Steven Spielberg hated and George Lucas loved. It is a very politically incorrect film with cartoony visuals (that I hope never get changed!) and a brilliant musical score.I have seen this movie a million times and find it just as entertaining as when I first watched it on a Saturday afternoon in place of a matinee film. It truly is unlike any film I had seen before. Who on earth would have dreamed up an archaeologist as an adventurer? That is the basis for many things to come.It is a strange sensation trying to put this film into words. It is dry, silly, nutty, constantly loaded with action and yet it remains one of the greatest films of all time. I'll see what I can do in describing itRaiders of the Lost Ark is set in Pre-World War II times when the Nazis, apparantly, were obbsessed with religious artefacts and tried to take possession of the fabled Ark of the Covenant which contains some vast power. It really exists in a universe of its own (think Being John Malkovich) and not ours which is what makes it such great escapism. The man who has been assigned by the U.S. government to track the Nazis down is an archaeologist named Indiana Jones. What follows is an epic set in several locales of weird beauty and surprisingly good places for chase scenes and fight scenes.This movie is set in South America, North America, Nepal, Egypt, Tunisia (I think), the Atlantic Ocean and some unknown deserted island. It has fight scenes and temple scenes involving Nazis, drunken Nepalese men, swordsmen, marksmen, traitorous jungle men and one big, bad Nazi soldier. It also has the best chase scene ever in a movie involving numerous vehicles, weapons and endlessly creative opportunities. What I have just described is what is on the surface level.The subtext in this movie comes from the universe it creates - and rips off. The sets look as though they have been built for destroying, the costumes look like they have been taken out of the circus, the make-up is deliberately bad, the acting is over-the-top and sentimental and the special effects are cheesy, tacky and meant to be that way. I hope they never update this film!What makes this film convincing is the brilliant camera work, editing, direction, sound effects and music. They make the cartoony universe all the more convincing and it provides a balance for the sometimes biting subtext. The other side of the balancing act is done on the entertainment scale. I believe this film to be the best pure entertainment ever!(One other thing. The character of Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones. The most original anti-hero ever made. That shooting-of-the-swordsman scene shows just what kind of a character he is!)I said before that Steven Spielberg hated adventure serials and George Lucas loved them. I found this out from a book on Lucasfilm's CV. This is what I think made the film such a spectacular success.

That for me justifies all of the comments I have read from Gallo about this film. Sure he may come across as arrogant in interviews, although I would say most of the time a lot of what he says is firmly tongue in cheek but in any case I think his film speaks for itself.Quite simply it is the most amazing film I have seen. if any film deserves the kind of pretentious plaudits that film critics roll out for many of the foreign art house movies this is it. Go look at the back of the three colours series of films by Kieslowski and read the comments made and they will sum up this film better than I can.If you have read some of the other comments people have made about this film then you will already know about the incredible cinematography. It really does stand out from the opening scene when Billy desperately seeks the bathroom. Showing him from multiple camera angles as he first takes the bus then darts around the car park. However what really stands out for me is the characters, especially Billy. As one comment I read mentioned this is a great study in loneliness. You really get to feel Billy's pain. He has developed this outer shell to protect him, make him seem tougher than he really is. At times though we are allowed glimpses as this shell get pierced and he shows little bits of his innerself, which as you would expect is far more fragile. I think this is what layla sees in him. She sees the little boy inside who just wants to be noticed by his family and ultimately loved. SPOILER ALERT I could go on and on about this movie, none of which would probably be very critically well researched or written but would at least show the passion i feel for this film. There are so many classic scenes, the spend time, couple that like each other but dont touch each other photo scene, the Billy I'm cold bathroom bit and the way Billy lies on the very edge of the bed until the two slowly and beautifully link hands. These latter scenes really display Billy's vulnerability and are amongst my favourite ever. Equally the bit where he tells Goon he will kill him if he goes near his bowling ball etc and then tells him how hes met this girl and she loves him, that is one of the greatest and most touching ever. We get to see the rough exterior as he rounds on his friend and then his otherside, almost immediately afterwards to compensate. he does that a lot during the film, shouts then apologises. Finally the end when hes in the donut shop is agonizing, if like me you are involved in the two characters and want that happy ending you will see what I mean.I have never seen a movie that displays such a human side to love.Personally I am heavily into romantic films like pretty woman and of course all the john hughes eighties boy gets girl movies like some kind of wonderful, pretty in pink et al. those were fun and always ended happily but they were glossy and unrealistic. The only competition as far as I can see in terms of a human romantic film would be say anything which is also awesome but lacks the indepth characters and grittiness.  Nothing I have yet seen can compete with Gallo's movie.If you dont believe me then try and get hold of a copy of Neon, the old but classic and best in my humble opinion movie mag. I'm sure they would do a much better job of convincing you than I can but regardless go get this movie, you will be surprised i guarantee it and you are really in for a treat, a true classic.Now if only i hadnt given my copy to a guy who now lives somewhere in Spain!

The beginning is slow, and I didn't like the end, but the middle was funny as hell.It takes a long time for this movie to really get started.  Elliot Richardson is such a loser at the beginning that it is painful to watch. He isn't even one of those lovable losers like Rob Schneider's copy man.  He is a painfully annoying loser.  His office mates are probably the biggest jerks that anyone has ever had the misfortune of working with.Just about the time I was getting really uncomfortable watching such annoying characters the movie finally starts.  Once Elliot meets the devil the movie gets pretty good.  Parts are a lot like `George of The Jungle.' There are a lot of really corny lines, and site gags.  Brendan Fraser does those type of lines really well, and I really enjoyed them.Elizabeth Hurley has been panned for her performance, but I thought she did quite well.  She seemed a perfect fit for the devil, and I could really picture her as a devilish vixen toying with Elliot's mind.  A lot like Lucy holding the ball for Charlie Brown, the devil gets Elliot's trust only to pull everything out from under him.  The idea of the devil being a vixen works better than an old man, but Peter Cook is a better actor than Elizabeth Hurley.

The beginning is slow, and I didn't like the end, but the middle was funny as hell.It takes a long time for this movie to really get started.  Elliot Richardson is such a loser at the beginning that it is painful to watch. He isn't even one of those lovable losers like Rob Schneider's copy man.  He is a painfully annoying loser.  His office mates are probably the biggest jerks that anyone has ever had the misfortune of working with.Just about the time I was getting really uncomfortable watching such annoying characters the movie finally starts.  Once Elliot meets the devil the movie gets pretty good.  Parts are a lot like `George of The Jungle.' There are a lot of really corny lines, and site gags.  Brendan Fraser does those type of lines really well, and I really enjoyed them.Elizabeth Hurley has been panned for her performance, but I thought she did quite well.  She seemed a perfect fit for the devil, and I could really picture her as a devilish vixen toying with Elliot's mind.  A lot like Lucy holding the ball for Charlie Brown, the devil gets Elliot's trust only to pull everything out from under him.  The idea of the devil being a vixen works better than an old man, but Peter Cook is a better actor than Elizabeth Hurley.  Anyway, just being Elizabeth Hurley is worth a few bucks right there.The movie built well on itself.  Each wish was a little faster paced and funnier than the last.  Right as his wishes were coming to an end I was thinking he was close to a classic.Then the end came.  The last half hour of this thing turns from a corny comedy (a very good one at that) to a sappy fable (and not the greatest either).  It wasn't awful, it just was a bit cookie cutter and corporate.

Going into the film I had high expectations, but let me just say that the film surpassed all of them.  This film WILL GET TO YOU! Watching the main characters slowly destroy their lives from drugs is not an easy thing to sit through, especially the way it is portrayed on screen.  Anyone who is taking drugs or is even considering taking drugs should view this film.  I know people who are faced with the reality and consequences of drug addition and drug abuse. Sadly, this film accurately portrays the affects.  It is an important film that needs to be seen.The writing, directing and acting is the best.  Even Marlon Waynes brings his acting status to a new level. But when Oscar time rolls around, I don't know how the film will sit well with the voters.  But one thing is for sure, the editing and cinematography should be shoe-ins for nominations as well as Ellen Burstyn's performance!  My God... she HAS TO BE NOMINATED to say the least.  The haunting images and fantastic score will forever be in my mind.After my friends and I left the theatre, no one was talking... we were still absorbing the film.  This film is truly an EXPERIENCE unlike any other. It is shocking, scary and horrifying- several people covered their eyes during scenes. Be careful going into this film and keep an open mind. Remember, it was going to be rated NC-17, but Artisan decided to keep the film as it was and release it as Unrated. This was smart on Artisan's part b\/c if the film had been edited down to an R rating, the affect wouldn't have been as great thus the entire point of the film might have been lost. Bravo to the filmmakers and everyone who worked on this film for taking the chance and making an extremely risky film. It is truly in a class of its own.Unless you have no soul, I guarantee it will move you and leave you stunned by the time the end credits roll.  It is a very, very TOUGH film to sit through and IMPOSSIBLE to forget. One of the best films of the year, right next to Almost Famous.  I highly recommend it- with caution.

Lara Flynn Boyle is, as always, very sexy, and I'm glad to see the brilliant veteran Ben Gazarra back in form.It doesn't bother me that the characters are not punished for their unlawful actions since the story does not revolve around the usual doctorine of the so-called 'civilized' society.  But there's one thing that bothered me though - about Joy's terrible experience with the Russian refugee who happens to be a thief.  At first Joy was against the lame protesters who accused the refugees of draining the country's economy which can be used for beneficiary pay.  Because of just ONE refugee's bad attitude, Joy has turned from a refugee sympathizer into someone who supports the protesters's ideas against ALL refugees.  All I can say was ... WHAT ?????  Forget the masturbation and the phaedophile rapist - those did not bother me in the slightest!Yes, I took it personally - the main problem is that the film did not signify any IRONY in Joy's bad experience with one refugee, as if the director made his statement about refugees as a fact.  As a film student, I tried to think of the director's intentions for the film, and I always try to give any ill feeling the benefit of a doubt.  After all, filmmaking is about exposing the truth derived from the director's experience in life, and in this case, 'Happiness' turns out to be great.

As a film student, I tried to think of the director's intentions for the film, and I always try to give any ill feeling the benefit of a doubt.  After all, filmmaking is about exposing the truth derived from the director's experience in life, and in this case, 'Happiness' turns out to be great.  BUT, that one flaw about portraying ALL refugees in a bad light leaves me with a sour taste.  I can't help it.  It really reminded me the blatantness of 'Birth of a Nation' by D.W Griffith which I watched a few years ago.I really liked this movie, but it actually made me think more about the merits of the so-called 'responsible' filmmaking.  I never cared about responsible filmmaking before until now, thinking that creating a work of art must not be bound by society's standards.  But if a film offends someone, does that mean its a great work of art?  Maybe, or maybe not.  I don't know.  I just hope people know better.

Tim Burton carried this over in his first Batman movie, but the story was clunky and too mean-spirited.  This movie is even darker and more mean-spirited than the first, and does not follow the comicbook history of the characters, mostly in the villains.The penguin in the series is *not* a deformed freak; he is an obnoxious thrillseeker, who was more of a pain in the butt to Batman than a deadly threat.  Likewise, Catwoman was a mysterious villain whose motives were never explained; the origins of both these villains have been re-written for this movie, which is fine, except that they are ludicrous and change the entire character of the villains to something one-dimensionally mean.  Devito and Pfeiffer are perfectly cast as the Penguin and Catwoman, but they are never allowed to breathe as the characters.  If the film-makers had lightened up and gone for an intelligent script, Devito could have had a field-day as a dangerous but lovable munchkin, and Pfeiffer doing much more with her role as Catwoman.  Instead, both are lost in ten pounds of gloom, darkness, and leather.  The story is ludicrous, but that's ok, it's a comicbook, so plot doesn't matter.  This is *not* the attitude that Frank Miller had when he wrote the successful series; readers didn't buy it because of the look, just as audience's don't buy this movie because of its look.  If Miller had sat down and wrote out a story in 15 minutes, it would have been much better than Batman Returns.  Would he have written a story about penguins with rockets attached to them attacking Gotham City, while the Penguin tries to escape on a giant motorized Rubber Duck?  I don't think so.  This movie was a tremendous, painful waste, all the more so because of the actors involved and what they could have done with an intelligent script. (An intelligent script?  What are you talking about?  It's only a comicbook!)   Tim Burton is the wrong director for this series.  It needs someone with a handle on the story and characters foremost, not the scenery.  Whenever a movie is based on a comicbook (except for the first two Superman movies), the producers only look at the art, not the story...because they don't understand the stories.  They only understand how to recreate the image.  And to assume that comics readers only look at the pictures.  That Tim Burton would make such a mistake is what depresses me.

If you have any care for film at all, see this in one of its wide-screen versions -you are literally missing half the film if you watch pan-and-scan (most movies).If you liked this movie at all and haven't yet seen La Femme Nikita or Leon (the butchered version of this is known as The Professional here in the US), then rent them both (wide-screen, please).

It got a decent storyline and the acting was okay for a horror flick. some people whining because they put Roseanne and Tom Arnold in this movie. they only have one small cameo scene, NO BIG DEAL!!!! It's not like it's big or anything. I admit the death scenes were weak, but at least the movie is watchable unlike Part 2 (UGH!)I give this film 6 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 October 2000","score":"","review":"  this movie is okay, but should have been better.
