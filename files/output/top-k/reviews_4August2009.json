And, SLEEPWALKERS(..screenplay written by Stephen King)is often used as an example of this. I like SLEEPWALKERS, though I fully am aware that Garris just says F#ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie. Forget character or plot development, who needs them anyway. It's about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkers(..feline-human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents, moving from town to town, living a nomadic existence, truly powerful)set their sights on a teenager who doesn't surrender without a fight. Before all is said and done, many will be slaughtered as a mother shan't tolerate the possible death of her beloved son.Garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed, as a teacher(Glenn Shadix), suspecting handsome, All American charmer Charles Brady(Brian Krause)to be someone entirely different from who he claims, gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into. Charles lures pretty virgins into his arms, drawing their energy, in turn feeding his hungry mama, Mary(Alice Krige). The fresh new target is Tanya Robertson(Mädchen Amick), and she seems to be easy pickens, but this will not be the case and when Charles is seriously injured in a struggle(..thanks to a deputy's cat, Clovis), Mary's vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way. Mary, come hell or high water, will retrieve Tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying son.Like many teenagers, I had a crush on certain actresses I watched in movies. Such as Amy Dolenz, I was smitten with Mädchen Amick. She's simply adorable in this movie and I love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards Charles, unaware of his ulterior motives. I just knew that Mädchen Amick would be destined to be a scream queen, but this would never be the case. Too bad because I would've welcomed her in the genre with open arms.Krige is yummy as the menacing, damn sexy, but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor Tanya's parents in one fail swoop, in less than ten or so minutes. She stabs one in the back with a corn cob! She bites the fingers off of poor Ron Perlman, before cracking his arm(..a bone protruding), knocking him unconscious with his own elbow! She tosses Tanya's mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father's face! A deputy is stabbed in his ear by Charles(Cop-kebab!), falling on the pencil for extra impact. Poor Tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by Mary, driven to the Brady home, and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster! The sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans. We see Mary and Charles' abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility. Writer Stephen King even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with Clive Barker and Tobe Hooper as forensics officers, Joe Dante and John Landis as photograph experts.The film is shot in a tongue-in-cheek, let-it-all-hang-out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home. It's about the ultra-violence, simple as that, with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting Garris' direction and King's screenplay. The incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in-your-face. Without a lick of complexity, this is closer in vein to King's own demented MAXIMIMUM OVERDRIVE than his more serious works.

This film last for three hours and it is a story of Death personified. In this movie you realize the value of life and appreciate the time you have on this planet since nobody knows how long it will last. The story starts with the scene where a couple Joe Black and Susan Parish meet in a cafeteria and find themselves in love; after this he leaves to go to work and while he is on his way he stops to think and wanting to go back to find out more about her he stops in the middle of the street and a car hits him causing his death. On the other hand Susan's father William Parish, a very important man who lives a very stressful life is experiencing a strong pain in his chest and feels like his time is very close to the end. He even starts hearing a voice, the voice of death. At the same time death is looking for a body to use in order to explore and discover how human life is. This body is Joe's body. Brad Pitt as Joe Black, is the perfect wonder, pure joy of the human elements; Antony Hopkins as William Parish brings his years of experience to this character and reflects the perfect business man whose life is out of control and his health is paying the price of his success, and Claire Forlani as Susan Parish the character who is in the middle and does not know what is really happening, she is just a victim of this game. The dialog of this movie is very interesting and sometimes it gets to be scary especially at the beginning of the movie when the death calls Bill to play his last card and then throughout the movie the way death's voice tells them what to do. This dialog puts the audience in a situation where everyone realizes how difficult would be to have a conversation with the death. I am sure nobody knows how to handle it. Lighting in the movie is fantastic with a lovely golden glow that goes by the hand with the soundtrack of Thomas Newman What a Wonderful World adding an extra depth to this movie. Music truly enhances the movie captivating and enhancing it. The mixture of the piano and orchestra builds up to an inspirational and emotional pull. The cinematography of the film was well thought out and extremely picturesque. This is the kind of movie that after you watch it you want to re-watch it more and more times. I absolutely recommend this movie not only for the message it leaves to the audience but also for the outstanding work done combining technology and technique to make the essence of the film come to life.

The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return, as we, audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle. It is foreboding, it is depressing, it is mesmerizing. It has been a very long time since a film, especially one made 78 years ago, seemed so delicate, so thought provoking, so timeless as M does. From these opening shots, Lang let's us know that this isn't going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops, but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window. With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty, Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred, where good and evil are similar, and a man defines his actions as uncontrollable. This merely scratches the surface of M, a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offered.What makes M shoot ahead of anything modern, anything by cult directors, anything close to popular? It begins with the actors, goes to the man behind the camera, and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story. Each of these elements never lack, never fall behind, and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch. To begin, Peter Lorre. How could you not talk about M without mentioning this doe-eyed murderer. From the beginning, we know his role in this film, yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route. We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried, we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic, we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children - and yet, he isn't the only character in this film. Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout. The infamous Inspector Lohmann (not to mention that great floor-up shot) is the perfect example of Lang's impressions on the local German police. The fact that Lohmann whistles, counter productive to what Lorre represents, only solidifies that idea. To add to these already dynamic people, we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence. The Safecracker is idealistic of what Germany was to become, the classic SS look, with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law. Each one of these characters provide humor, excitement, and full-blown emotion to the screen, adding to the overall impact to this film. With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion, it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits, angles, and direction doesn't hinder the power of his actors. Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avant-garde film making. I use the words avant-garde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond 1931. Lang incorporates powerful close-ups, amazing track following, and shots nearly unseen at this time. The overhead shots, the ability to make the crowds look ravenous, the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would. If you were impressed by his ability in Metropolis, M is only going to solidify that idea of Lang. A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals. Every shot, every detail is directed with ease, but complexity. It is easy to be in awe of this film, but to take the time to see Lang's ability behind the camera will take M to a whole new level. Personally, it is my belief, that he announces himself with this film. A pioneer of the camera, a grandfather of what cinema is today - one cannot watch anything released today and not see Lang's influences. See Fincher's Zodiac, a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce here.Finally, we have acting and direction, but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original, but for supporting a strong message. The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being 1931, a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry. The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail, that suburbia is always safe, and that the police actually do keep the streets safe. The story of M challenges you as a viewer even today, one could argue even more so today than in 1931. With crimes continually on the rise in this country, with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder (or is an easy innocence) the idea of M, especially that final dialogue seems more important today. The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story - the horror that simple events, kindness even, could turn on anyone in a moment of panic. Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way - a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop. Imagine if this film were made two years later, what a different theme Lang would have tackled.A deeply enticing film, Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field. Not only could he handle Science Fiction, but nearly every other genre imaginable. M is no exception to his skill. If you have not seen this film, watch it - experience it - know what it means to be marked like Lorre.

The infamous Inspector Lohmann (not to mention that great floor-up shot) is the perfect example of Lang's impressions on the local German police. The fact that Lohmann whistles, counter productive to what Lorre represents, only solidifies that idea. To add to these already dynamic people, we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence. The Safecracker is idealistic of what Germany was to become, the classic SS look, with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law. Each one of these characters provide humor, excitement, and full-blown emotion to the screen, adding to the overall impact to this film. With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion, it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits, angles, and direction doesn't hinder the power of his actors. Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avant-garde film making. I use the words avant-garde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond 1931. Lang incorporates powerful close-ups, amazing track following, and shots nearly unseen at this time. The overhead shots, the ability to make the crowds look ravenous, the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would. If you were impressed by his ability in Metropolis, M is only going to solidify that idea of Lang. A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals. Every shot, every detail is directed with ease, but complexity. It is easy to be in awe of this film, but to take the time to see Lang's ability behind the camera will take M to a whole new level. Personally, it is my belief, that he announces himself with this film. A pioneer of the camera, a grandfather of what cinema is today - one cannot watch anything released today and not see Lang's influences. See Fincher's Zodiac, a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce here.Finally, we have acting and direction, but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original, but for supporting a strong message. The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being 1931, a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry. The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail, that suburbia is always safe, and that the police actually do keep the streets safe. The story of M challenges you as a viewer even today, one could argue even more so today than in 1931. With crimes continually on the rise in this country, with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder (or is an easy innocence) the idea of M, especially that final dialogue seems more important today. The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story - the horror that simple events, kindness even, could turn on anyone in a moment of panic. Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way - a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop. Imagine if this film were made two years later, what a different theme Lang would have tackled.A deeply enticing film, Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field. Not only could he handle Science Fiction, but nearly every other genre imaginable. M is no exception to his skill. If you have not seen this film, watch it - experience it - know what it means to be marked like Lorre.

Jack's character bridges both high and low culture, Northern intelligentsia and rural Southern hillbilly without finding a steady anchor in either extreme. Many of the counterculture were - if pressed - looking for themselves in a mad rush for experience \/ sensation, and - for many - it was a futile quest for something that was really at hand - identity, and family. Here, Jack's character has - for the most part - surrendered to a loss of self, turned entirely cynical about any solution or connection. He personifies much of what I (and others) hoped to avoid while setting ourselves to achieve a separation from all the worst in society, while also exiling oneself from any possibility of finding satisfaction or contentment, as we strove to avoid mere sentimentality, and to be elsewhere (Alaska perhaps?). Jack has given up of course, he is a jerk, but one you come to feel great pity for, although he would only disdain you for the effort. The one time he comes close to revealing his self (as he understands it) is when he speaks to his mute father, obviously finding safety in the other's inability to have any feeling about him, thus entrapping him in expectations and love and concern. It is a perfectly wrought narrative about an existential crisis that has no fix.

While Bottle Rocket is not on par with these great movies it is a sure sign of the greatness to come.This is a meandering, character-driven story, as social rejects Anthony, Dignan and Bob attempt to assert themselves in the adult world by embarking on a well-structured but inevitably dysfunctional life of crime. I love the fact that Owen Wilson is willing to play himself as a goof or a nutjob, and his little asides are probably the funniest thing in the movie. During the robbery of a bookstore he holds the manager at gunpoint and asks, Do you have a bigger bag? One you might use for atlases and dictionaries, sir? These guys are harmless but their emotional pain is real, and their decision to become outlaws seems like just a way to tell the world they're unhappy. What about? Like other Anderson\/Wilson collaborations the characters in the film do not feel accepted, or loved. All they might really need is a father figure... the guys seem happiest not when they're pulling their capers but when they've been adopted by James Caan's Mr. Henry character, who serves- briefly- as the benevolent protector they so badly need.The title Bottle Rocket is in reference to the scene in the movie when the boys blow their robbery loot on firecrackers and throw them out the window of their car.

I was surprised to see this on their schedule, as it's usually the lowest rate affair. The situation was another example of a great work getting lost in another vast video copy collection.I was excited to be seeing an early movie from a director I always admired. I'd only ever seen his Hollywood work, and was especially fond of his Sci-Fi classics growing up. As others recognize, Verhoeven unashamedly puts into his films, his honest impression of the societal constructs we humans consistently find ourselves in. That regular criticism of the complexities of human nature, beyond the norms of each film's particular genre, has always resonated with my world view.I finally watched this film this morning. As it started it was obvious the image quality was very poor, not helped by early scenes being predominantly in the dark. Not surprisingly the character's voices were dubbed into English, but were often mismatched or exaggerated, unfitting for the film. It seems to be the UK version I saw, yet some accents were American. I always try to watch a film in it's original intended language, but it seems the foreign films on the local community station are only ever poorly dubbed video copies.Despite the poor quality of the copy I saw (the video company's logo even popped up irregularly in the bottom corner of the image), this film really amazed me. Much of the reasons why have been detailed by the few other comments on this site. The biggest flaw of the story for me was that the film ended too suddenly. This seems a common element to films the further back in cinema history you go. I actually appreciate a well crafted credits sequence, easing the viewer out of the film's world, and allowing reflection. Even at nearly 2 hours long, I felt my interest would have been sustained for a little bit longer.There is a DVD listed here with 5 of Verhoeven's films in their original Dutch form, with English subtitles. I'd like to see this one again, and the rest of his early creations, which others consider even better. Rutger Hauer is also a great, varied yet charismatic actor, and it seems his best work might be with Verhoeven.

With movies like A Clockwork Orange, Paths Of Glory, 2001 A Space Odyssey and Full Metal Jacket he created some of the most original, daring movies ever made. With Lolita, however, he showed that even the masters can make a mistake.It's not fair to judge the movie by comparing it to the book, so I won't do that- the film fails on its own terms. First and foremost, its central premise is never realized Humbert is supposed to be a man so obsessed with and attracted to the underage daughter of his landlady\/girlfriend that he allows desire to overtake his logic and crosses the line by engaging in a sexual affair with the child. For the movie to work, we have to see this. No, I'm not talking about graphic nudity or full-frontal sex scenes, I'm talking about on-screen manifestations of Humbert's lust and the seduction itself. I understand the film was made long ago and was even more of a controversial topic then as it was today, but Kubrick here clearly finds the topic too hot to handle, and though he ostensibly fought to make this film he was clearly unwilling or unable to deliver the impact necessary to support the story. In fact, the first time I watched the film I wasn't even sure that Humbert and Lolita had slept together until it was referenced later! If Humbert is going to be punished by his God\/conscience-figure Clare Quilty then you have to give the audience the nasty, vicarious thrill of committing the crime! Though we are a nation of outward prudes I guarantee that everyone who bought a ticket to this movie did so for the excitement and revulsion of the film's central premise. What we're left with is a repressed character being tortured by everyone in the movie for an implied crime he never got to enjoy. Since standards were so strict at the time we don't even really get to view Lolita as a sexual creature with the possible exception of her bikini debut and symbolic hula-hooping. Whether Kubrick was bowing to censors or employing his own coding this was too much suppression for a story that might be more at home in a Penthouse magazine.The film's other flaw? In two words Peter Sellers. I love the man, and he's as brilliant a comic actor as there ever was but in this film he is frustrating, borderline offensive. Clare Quilty seems to exist only to haunt Humbert, threatening to reveal knowledge of his crime and teasing him into feeling guilty with nauseatingly-cute quips and innuendo. Quilty was supposed to be a gay but Sellers holds back on the flamboyance, yet another example of this movie's maddening lack of commitment. In one scene he dresses up as a completely different person and, with the help of a fake accent, FOOLS HUMBERT COMPLETELY! Was this choice the result of a faithful adaptation to the book or Kubrick indulging Sellers' talent for playing multiple roles? Either way the scene is rotten, and it hurts the entire film. The Clare Quilty character is such a heavy-handed killjoy that by the time the film catches up to its flashback opening-sequence the only thing you're rooting for is for Humbert to shoot him in the face.Kubrick would later use the great Sellers to comic perfection in Dr. Strangelove, but Lolita is a movie that tiptoes on eggshells it promised to break.

At this point, it seems very clear that Lucas, irate that fans have pigeon-holed him into a niche as the auteur responsible for adventures in a galaxy far, far away, are going to seriously pay for it. And what better way than for Lucas to simply take a dump all over the opening trilogy that he has promised to provide for years? Attack of the Clones becomes the latest casualty of Lucas' incompetent writing and direction resulting in a much-awaited sequel that viewers hoped would improve on the problems of its predecessor, but instead finds entirely new ways to exploit and exacerbate them. The plot &#x96; such as it is &#x96; picks up roughly 10 years after the last film. Anakin Skywalker is now a strapping young man and acolyte of Jedi Master Ben Kenobi, who gets assigned as a glorified bodyguard to former Queen Amidala (now Senator Amidala), while Kenobi goes off in search of the supposed clone army of the title. There are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies as well as developments that simply fail to effectively dovetail with what viewers already know from the original trilogy. For instance, there is nothing especially heroic or admirable about the Jedi Knights as depicted in this film. They seem to be a suspiciously virginal monastic order with particular disdain for both emotions and outsiders &#x96; and they are almost laughably incompetent. They are constantly taken by surprise by enemies in their midst and most action scenes will be marked by a stretch where the Jedi participating will somehow lose their lightsabre during the battle. Yet their dialog &#x96; especially that as delivered by Samuel L. Jackson and the increasingly tiresome Yoda &#x96; is delivered with a smug self-righteousness that crosses the border of hypocrisy into arrogance. Also interesting is that Lucas fails to give us any reason as to why Amidala would be a target of assassination attempts since she brings nothing conceivable to the table to be a threat to anyone. It all functions as little more than a plot contrivance to throw Anakin and Amidala together for Lucas' ham-fisted idea of a romance. As though suddenly realizing that he needs to maneuver the future parents of Luke and Leia together, Lucas conspires painful passages awkwardly inserted into the story where we are supposed to see their relationship developing to a point where both parties buck the rules to become married. The film also continues to suffer from the lack of a good villain. Christopher Lee shows up late in the game as a sinister character called Count Dooku, but it impossible to tell in the mishmash of a story whether his goals are ultimately good or bad. Would that the attention Lucas has lavished on his overabundance of phony-looking CGI effects had been aimed at the story. C-3PO and R2-D2 are back, but used badly &#x96; especially in a concluding conveyor belt action scene that results in C-3PO's head being placed on an attack droid's body with assorted crummy one-liners in accompaniment. The various alien cultures that Lucas presents are not remotely imaginative and saddled with notable stereotypical English dialects. Ewan McGregor holds himself with a bit of dignity as Ben Kenobi, so it is a shame that Lucas has yet to write him a good role. Samuel L. Jackson's macho tough guy shtick is past its shelf life. Natalie Portman seems to become increasingly more catatonic as Amidala (her scene after falling out of a copter is high unintentional comedy). Poor Hayden Christensen has it the worst. He is stuck with the impossibly daunting task of eliciting audience sympathy for an anti-hero whose character arc is already known to the audience, trying to convince us that he is hopelessly enchanted with his wooden leading lady, and that he actually has a degree of mentor\/student chemistry with McGregor, all while being saddled with bargain basement dialog that makes the central character seem little more than a shallow, petulant brat. He manages a couple of nice moments where he hints of the darkness to come, but is largely crushed by the Lucas ball of ineptitude. In the director chair, Lucas seems to have no idea how to generate suspense or pace the film in an effective manner. In fact, it often seems that the film functions as barely more than a showcase for his CGI effects studio. A dismal wreck that truly has completely derailed what should have been a far more promising and durable series.

The various alien cultures that Lucas presents are not remotely imaginative and saddled with notable stereotypical English dialects. Ewan McGregor holds himself with a bit of dignity as Ben Kenobi, so it is a shame that Lucas has yet to write him a good role. Samuel L. Jackson's macho tough guy shtick is past its shelf life. Natalie Portman seems to become increasingly more catatonic as Amidala (her scene after falling out of a copter is high unintentional comedy). Poor Hayden Christensen has it the worst. He is stuck with the impossibly daunting task of eliciting audience sympathy for an anti-hero whose character arc is already known to the audience, trying to convince us that he is hopelessly enchanted with his wooden leading lady, and that he actually has a degree of mentor\/student chemistry with McGregor, all while being saddled with bargain basement dialog that makes the central character seem little more than a shallow, petulant brat. He manages a couple of nice moments where he hints of the darkness to come, but is largely crushed by the Lucas ball of ineptitude. In the director chair, Lucas seems to have no idea how to generate suspense or pace the film in an effective manner. In fact, it often seems that the film functions as barely more than a showcase for his CGI effects studio. A dismal wreck that truly has completely derailed what should have been a far more promising and durable series.

He has unorthodox teaching methods that inspire his pupils who then set up the Dead Poet's Society, a society that Mr Keating was involved in when he was a student at the school. The idea is to meet up at night and recite poetry in order to free the mind and impress the ladies. We follow a handful of students as they try and do things their own way as inspired by Mr Keating but things go wrong.....I was surprised that I enjoyed it. Robin Williams isn't his usual annoying self. In fact, it is Ethan Hawke who plays Todd that walks away with the most annoying character award. His character is very frustrating. There are a few unrealistic threads to the story, eg, a group of boys meeting up to read poetry at night - no way - boys sneak out to play football at night NOT to read poetry to each other. In real boarding schools, new kids are indoctrinated with humiliating rituals such as masturbating onto a piece of toast or a biscuit - they are not asked if they want to join a study group. But, then again, Americans are a different species. And no way would a pupil stand up in class and recite a poem about his love for a girl infront of his classmates just like a sissy! I also found that I didn't quite believe Neil's (Robert Sean Leonard) actions at the end of the film and as for the new boy, Todd, who knows his room-mate least out of everyone else, his reaction only makes sense if he is dealing with some gay issues. However, there were some funny scenes and there were also some parts that make you think, eg, when the pupils are shown the pictures of previous pupils on the walls of the hallway - pupils who are now all dead. This film is responsible for idiots saying Carpe Diem. Its a bit long but its entertaining despite a downbeat end section.

He sets up scenes with a clichéd and grating monotone Johnny Clay was up at 7 AM that morning, knowing today might be the last day of his life. The cheap device is also used to explain some massive plot-holes, especially in the film's finale The men had agreed beforehand that if anything went wrong in the robbery they would abandon one another immediately and whoever had the money at the time would keep it for themselves. How convenient! The second problem is the non-linear coverage of the heist itself we spend so long watching the men prepare for their racetrack robbery that once it begins we don't want it to stop. But stop it does- several times- as we see each character's view of the heist and jump the timeline backwards at least half a dozen times. Watching an exciting scene unfold and then flashing back to an hour beforehand sucks all the energy and joy out of what action there is.The over-the-top performances are yet another problem. Why is Sterling Hayden's girlfriend in tears in the film's opening scene, begging him to Be careful, Johnny, before vanishing from the rest of the film? Why does George's wife consider him such lowly human garbage that she has no reaction to seeing him bloodied and shot, going so far as to refuse him a ride to the hospital?

Funny Girl released in 1968, had been a Broadway smash, also starring Streisand. Actually, some of the top movie executives did not want to gamble on Barbra, as this was her first film. Thank God wiser heads prevailed. The story follows Jewish comedienne Fanny Brice's interesting and somewhat turbulent life; great liberties were taken here, both for entertainment value and surviving family members of Brice wanted it that way. We follow Brice through her early struggles to make a name for herself, to the Ziegfeld follies, which makes her a household name. Handsome Omar Sharif makes an unlikely suitor, and later husband Nick Arnstein, and much has been made over the 40 years since this film's release about their pairing. Regardless, Sharif manages to hold his own next to Barbra, no easy task. Veteran director William Wyler directed this film, and he and Streisand had many clashes during filming. The film has some flaws, such as the 1960's hairstyles the women wear, considering it is supposed to be the early part of the 20th century (something that drives me nuts!). Still, Wyler's touches are obvious throughout. Kay Medford has a nice turn as Streisand's wise -- although nagging -- mother. The other women, notably in the follies, have minor parts. Walter Pidgeon, looking rather old, does a good job as Florenz Ziegfeld. But let's be clear -- this is Barbra's show, and she doesn't let us forget it.

Regardless, Sharif manages to hold his own next to Barbra, no easy task. Veteran director William Wyler directed this film, and he and Streisand had many clashes during filming. The film has some flaws, such as the 1960's hairstyles the women wear, considering it is supposed to be the early part of the 20th century (something that drives me nuts!). Still, Wyler's touches are obvious throughout. Kay Medford has a nice turn as Streisand's wise -- although nagging -- mother. The other women, notably in the follies, have minor parts. Walter Pidgeon, looking rather old, does a good job as Florenz Ziegfeld. But let's be clear -- this is Barbra's show, and she doesn't let us forget it.
