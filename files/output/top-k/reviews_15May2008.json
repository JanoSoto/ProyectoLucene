Problems in the family, controlling wives, and annoying children; sure, it had all served as sure-fire inspiration for all of the comedians at one time or another. However, what is unique when we see Fields confronted with such problems in THE BANK DICK, is that his character witnesses the mayhem from the perspective of a comparatively mature reality. When Laurel and Hardy, lovable as they are, elope from their wives, one can be quite certain that the women will take off in a pursuit immediately, emphasizing that what we are presented with is a truly cartoonish world, and we need not to worry about it. As a contrast, when Egbert's wife nags at her husband for smoking in the house, probably just in need for something to complain about, it's delivered in a way which seems almost uncomfortably close to a truly convincing, dysfunctional family atmosphere. So much so that, while hideously funny, much of the humor comes off as rather dark in essence. Don't you dare strike that child! Well she's not gonna tell ME I don't love her!Apart from this, first-time viewers should be aware that based upon my experience, THE BANK DICK improves after each viewing. I did find it funny after first viewing, but much more so during the second time; having got more acquainted with the characters, I howled with laughter throughout. Numerous lines and sketches come to mind, but there is particularly one part which I simply can't resist mentioning here bank examiner J.

Helping the poor thing to bed, Sousé drops him out of the window, presumably by accident. The manner in which Fields rushes downstairs in order to save him, determined yet underneath quite matter-of-factly, is a brief moment of priceless comedy which beautifully demonstrates the comedian's ability to achieve subtlety into his acts, when it was required for.

Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that 'Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film.For years, Blade Runner was divided into two different camps, or rather four and they are Those that preferred the narration and those that did not and the other camp was those that thought Deckard was a Replicant and those that thought he was either human or felt it was left ambiguous. Ridley Scott has very gracefully over the years, given homage to these thoughts and made many statements that most readers are aware of, chiefly - that Deckard was a Replicant. Unfortunately, due to the studios fingering with the film during post-production, Warner Brothers had the right to trim anything after the 120 min mark, and thus butchering the nuance of the film and leaving several things vague and forcing Scott to tack on the Happy ending and the narration - because as we all know ... we're all just too stupid to get it.The new and most refreshing part of the new argument, evinced in the 210 (wow!) min documentary 'Dangerous Days' is that Scott gives equal time to those that enjoyed the film with the narration, with Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth \/ Hellboy) in the forefront, with his very candid telling of how Blade Runner changed his life and launched him down the road into film-making. We also get to hear a very lucid and warm retelling from Harrison Ford of the nightmare that he not only endured making the movie but the further commitment of having to do the Voice Over narration months later, which ended up having its own strange story as well.So, now with 5 versions available in this box set, you get to see Blade Runner in every single angle imaginable and it is engrossing every time. Ebert also said in the Nineties that the re-release of the movie for the Director's Cut gives you yet another version of the film, but fails to handle the main problems that were so apparent the first time around. As the film has changed Ebert has gone from student flippancy to utmost respect and enjoyment. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time if you're interested.There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself.

","genre":"Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"15 May 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In the words of the opening titles In the 1880's -unlike today- London was a haven for political refugees of all nationalities. They were kept under constant surveillance by their embassies as well as by Scotland Yard. This was fertile soil for every kind of conspiracy and betrayal. This is the world against which The Secret Agent, based on the novel by Joseph Conrad, is set, although I am not sure what was meant by that unlike today. In 2008 there are probably far more asylum seekers in London than there were 120 years ago, and I am sure the same was true in 1996 when the film was made.The central character in the film is Verloc, a Soho bookseller with a sideline in pornography. (Soho, although situated in the West End of London, was at this period a poor working-class district which had more in common with the poverty-stricken East End than with the wealthier surrounding areas). His nationality is something of a mystery; his name sounds foreign (Conrad may have derived it from the German verlocken, meaning to tempt), but Bob Hoskins' Cockney accent sounds very British. (We learn that he has served in the French armed forces, presumably as a member of the Foreign Legion). He is married to Winnie, an attractive younger woman who has only accepted him as a husband in order to provide a home for her simple younger brother, Stevie.Besides dirty books, Verloc has a couple of other sidelines. One of these is anarchism; he is a member of a multi-national anarchist cell plotting the downfall of every government in Europe. His final sideline is treachery towards his fellow-anarchists; he is secretly a spy in the pay of both the British police and the Russian embassy.Verloc is called into the Russian Embassy for an interview with his controller, the diplomat Vladimir, and learns that the Russians want him to become an agent provocateur as well as a spy. Their plan is that he should blow up the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, hoping that such a terrorist outrage will persuade the British Government, who at this period often took a soft line with criminal conspirators if their conspiracies only involved the commission of crimes in other countries, to crack down on the anarchist movement. This puts Verloc in an unenviable position. If he carries out the attack and is caught, he faces a lengthy prison sentence or even the death penalty if anyone is killed in the attack. If he refuses, he faces the possibility that the Russians will reveal his treachery to his fellow-anarchists, who will doubtless take bloody revenge. In the event he decides to carry out the attack, but uses the simple-minded Stevie to plant the bomb. Unfortunately, something goes wrong, the bomb explodes prematurely and Stevie is killed.Conrad's novel was also filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1936. That film today is generally known as Saboteur, although when it first came out it was sometimes shown under the title A Woman Alone. (Hitchcock could not use Conrad's title because, confusingly, he had made another film called The Secret Agent, based on Somerset Maugham's Ashenden, earlier in the same year). Hitchcock updated the story to the 1930s, which was probably a wise move, as period costume drama was never his forte. (Under Capricorn is not one of his best films, and Jamaica Inn is one of his worst). Although there are problems with the plot, Saboteur is an effective thriller in which Hitchcock makes good use of the devices, which he would perfect in later films, for creating a mood of ever-increasing tension.The 1996 film is not a thriller of that sort, but rather a downbeat character study. The film-makers seem more interested in their characters' personalities than in their political views, and there is no serious attempt to explore terrorism as a social phenomenon. (The only major terrorist act we see is actually instigated by a reactionary foreign government, not by the revolutionaries themselves). During that period in the nineties when it became fashionable to talk, in Francis Fukuyama's phrase, about the end of history, there was perhaps a lessening of interest in the ideology of violent revolutionary movements; today, in the post-9\/11 world, I suspect that a film made on this subject would have a very different emphasis.There are a couple of decent performances from Hoskins and from Jim Broadbent as Verloc, and two major foreign stars, Gerard Depardieu and Robin Williams, are seen in surprisingly minor roles. (Although it is a British film, the film-makers obviously thought that they needed some overseas talent to boost its international market appeal). Williams, unusually playing a villain, is good as the Professor, a ruthless explosives expert acting for the anarchists, but I was less impressed by Depardieu, a brilliant actor in his native French but much less so in English.

They were kept under constant surveillance by their embassies as well as by Scotland Yard. This was fertile soil for every kind of conspiracy and betrayal. This is the world against which The Secret Agent, based on the novel by Joseph Conrad, is set, although I am not sure what was meant by that unlike today. In 2008 there are probably far more asylum seekers in London than there were 120 years ago, and I am sure the same was true in 1996 when the film was made.The central character in the film is Verloc, a Soho bookseller with a sideline in pornography. (Soho, although situated in the West End of London, was at this period a poor working-class district which had more in common with the poverty-stricken East End than with the wealthier surrounding areas). His nationality is something of a mystery; his name sounds foreign (Conrad may have derived it from the German verlocken, meaning to tempt), but Bob Hoskins' Cockney accent sounds very British. (We learn that he has served in the French armed forces, presumably as a member of the Foreign Legion). He is married to Winnie, an attractive younger woman who has only accepted him as a husband in order to provide a home for her simple younger brother, Stevie.Besides dirty books, Verloc has a couple of other sidelines. One of these is anarchism; he is a member of a multi-national anarchist cell plotting the downfall of every government in Europe. His final sideline is treachery towards his fellow-anarchists; he is secretly a spy in the pay of both the British police and the Russian embassy.Verloc is called into the Russian Embassy for an interview with his controller, the diplomat Vladimir, and learns that the Russians want him to become an agent provocateur as well as a spy. Their plan is that he should blow up the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, hoping that such a terrorist outrage will persuade the British Government, who at this period often took a soft line with criminal conspirators if their conspiracies only involved the commission of crimes in other countries, to crack down on the anarchist movement. This puts Verloc in an unenviable position. If he carries out the attack and is caught, he faces a lengthy prison sentence or even the death penalty if anyone is killed in the attack. If he refuses, he faces the possibility that the Russians will reveal his treachery to his fellow-anarchists, who will doubtless take bloody revenge. In the event he decides to carry out the attack, but uses the simple-minded Stevie to plant the bomb. Unfortunately, something goes wrong, the bomb explodes prematurely and Stevie is killed.Conrad's novel was also filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1936. That film today is generally known as Saboteur, although when it first came out it was sometimes shown under the title A Woman Alone. (Hitchcock could not use Conrad's title because, confusingly, he had made another film called The Secret Agent, based on Somerset Maugham's Ashenden, earlier in the same year). Hitchcock updated the story to the 1930s, which was probably a wise move, as period costume drama was never his forte. (Under Capricorn is not one of his best films, and Jamaica Inn is one of his worst). Although there are problems with the plot, Saboteur is an effective thriller in which Hitchcock makes good use of the devices, which he would perfect in later films, for creating a mood of ever-increasing tension.The 1996 film is not a thriller of that sort, but rather a downbeat character study. The film-makers seem more interested in their characters' personalities than in their political views, and there is no serious attempt to explore terrorism as a social phenomenon. (The only major terrorist act we see is actually instigated by a reactionary foreign government, not by the revolutionaries themselves). During that period in the nineties when it became fashionable to talk, in Francis Fukuyama's phrase, about the end of history, there was perhaps a lessening of interest in the ideology of violent revolutionary movements; today, in the post-9\/11 world, I suspect that a film made on this subject would have a very different emphasis.There are a couple of decent performances from Hoskins and from Jim Broadbent as Verloc, and two major foreign stars, Gerard Depardieu and Robin Williams, are seen in surprisingly minor roles. (Although it is a British film, the film-makers obviously thought that they needed some overseas talent to boost its international market appeal). Williams, unusually playing a villain, is good as the Professor, a ruthless explosives expert acting for the anarchists, but I was less impressed by Depardieu, a brilliant actor in his native French but much less so in English.

But this film is so much more. It is (still, and will probably always be) relevant film about modern warfare, Iraq\/American relations, the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, and the greed and negative influence of American principles on other nations. The film is most probably at its core a dark comedy about the idiocy of war and the toll it takes on the lives of soldiers and civilians caught up in it.Although 2 hours in length, THREE KINGS seems to fly by thanks to great editing, snappy dialogue, solid acting, and fast-paced direction. The film is extremely funny (not really laugh out loud funny), but more smart, witty funny. There is a lot in this film that still sadly rings true today and it is those moments that make you laugh at the irony that Iraq is even worse off now that it was back in 1991, thanks to the current events of the times. Even though Saddam is gone and virtually every Iraqi portrayed in this film lives in fear of him and wants him out of power, look how bad things are now with him gone. Ahh, the irony! Hindsight is a b*tch, isn't it?! The acting is fine here. I'm not huge fan of George Clooney, but he pulls off his role as Maj. Archie Gates. Clooney is very understated here and makes you forget for 2 hours that he is George Clooney. Mark Wahlberg of course is outstanding as Pvt. Troy Barlow. He was on a roll in the late 90s with this film and BOOGIE NIGHTS which came out in 1997. Ice Cube is excellent as Chief Elgin, the 3rd King if you will. Actually, there is a 4th King, Spike Jonze who ends up being the most sympathetic character of the group that wants to steal the gold. Also, Nora Dunn delivers a terrific supporting performance as an American reporter who is in the middle of all this action.And the movie actually tells the Iraqi point of view as well. Cliff Curtis is great as an Iraqi businessman who is trying to get his daughter and others across the Iraq-Iran border to safety and Saïd Taghmaoui is memorable as Iraqi Capt. Said, who captures and tortures Barlow. The Said-Barlow scenes are the best in the film as it brilliantly shows the culture clash between Iraq and America.With its dark humor, great action, political satire, and vivid characters, THREE KINGS may be one of the top 5 films of 1999 in my opinion.

This was one of the most ridiculous, most poorly executed, worst written movies to come out of the 80's.From the first you are accosted by a god-awful soundtrack that could've come from a jazzercize video (whose idea was it to score a medieval movie with an orchestra made up completely by synthesizers?), and then right away you are treated to a hideous English accent by Matthew Broderick (which is accomplished simply by over-enunciating each word). Why he had to try so pitifully to fake such a bad accent while Michelle Pfeiffer didn't even bother is beyond imagining. His clumsy, flat delivery reminded me of a kid at a renaissance fair who thinks if he says m'lady it makes him English. The best acting in the whole film came from the wolf.The writing was flat and awkward, the lines completely wooden and forced, and the story so abrupt and poorly thought out that is was as if a high schooler wrote it as an excuse to see Pfeiffer turn into a bird. None of it made any sense, and not in the way that fantasy doesn't make sense in the real world...but in the way that there was barely any plot to hold what was supposed to be a story together. The fight scenes looked like rehearsals- those maddening scenes where all the other bad guys wait patiently to take turns fighting\/chasing the hero, so that they each get a chance, one at a time. The whole thing was laughable from start to finish, but not in a good way. None of the funny lines were at all funny, but uncomfortably recognizable as an attempt at humor- kind of like when a ten-year-old tells you a knock-knock joke that you heard when you were ten, and it wasn't funny then, either. This movie could have been directed by a broken record that repeated over and over the same commandsBroderick, say m'lady.Hauer, scream at the sky.Pfeiffer, look startled.Bad guy, look menacing.shot of a wolf here, shot of a hawk here.Repeat.This is one of those movies where you find yourself shouting at the screen because of the unbelievably stupid lines, plot developments, and acting.

This was one of the most ridiculous, most poorly executed, worst written movies to come out of the 80's.From the first you are accosted by a god-awful soundtrack that could've come from a jazzercize video (whose idea was it to score a medieval movie with an orchestra made up completely by synthesizers?), and then right away you are treated to a hideous English accent by Matthew Broderick (which is accomplished simply by over-enunciating each word). Why he had to try so pitifully to fake such a bad accent while Michelle Pfeiffer didn't even bother is beyond imagining. His clumsy, flat delivery reminded me of a kid at a renaissance fair who thinks if he says m'lady it makes him English. The best acting in the whole film came from the wolf.The writing was flat and awkward, the lines completely wooden and forced, and the story so abrupt and poorly thought out that is was as if a high schooler wrote it as an excuse to see Pfeiffer turn into a bird. None of it made any sense, and not in the way that fantasy doesn't make sense in the real world...but in the way that there was barely any plot to hold what was supposed to be a story together. The fight scenes looked like rehearsals- those maddening scenes where all the other bad guys wait patiently to take turns fighting\/chasing the hero, so that they each get a chance, one at a time. The whole thing was laughable from start to finish, but not in a good way. None of the funny lines were at all funny, but uncomfortably recognizable as an attempt at humor- kind of like when a ten-year-old tells you a knock-knock joke that you heard when you were ten, and it wasn't funny then, either. This movie could have been directed by a broken record that repeated over and over the same commandsBroderick, say m'lady.Hauer, scream at the sky.Pfeiffer, look startled.Bad guy, look menacing.shot of a wolf here, shot of a hawk here.Repeat.This is one of those movies where you find yourself shouting at the screen because of the unbelievably stupid lines, plot developments, and acting.

The non-linear style throughout the film which becomes more apparent throughout. The music is very eerie and quite silent but builds up when someone thing may happen which creates tension for the audience. The characters like the 'Sisters' who tell John and Laura that there daughter is warning them, at first John was sceptical but believed them in the end after seeing glimpses of what he thought was his daughter wearing the same coat as the one she died in. With them being in Venice the audience feel like the characters as they are in a country that they don't know, don't speak English and in other tenses are Isolated from everyone else, which is a common convention of a horror film.The love scene is rather lengthy with editing that influence the film Out Of Sight with the love shots and when they are getting changed. When a sex scene comes in mind it is usually not showing love and more of a quick and rather obnoxious sign of love. Sex scenes come in films like American Psycho and the more amusing of scenes like American Pie both beginning with American summing up the Americans love lives or what's left. But with Monsters Ball 'Sex' scene they are more about love and gaining love. The scene is an important part of the narrative where we are left with the idea that Laura was pregnant the scene at the end helps with that idea when the liquid is spilt and the liquid looks like the ovule. With John dead as well it's a life for a life.The colour red is a significant thing in the film, it probably has more screen time then Julie Chrisite. The colour red comes up so many times even if its obvious or if it is a little hint in the back ground. The opening sequence with the daughter dying has red flowers behind Julie Christie before turning around and screaming, a red rose stands for a loss of a love and I feel is a vital thing in the scene. The colour red means danger, passion, love, stop and anger. These are all vital in each scenes with the red coat at the end with the dwarf the colour red means danger and stop other wise you will be killed. The red coat at the beginning is the total opposite with John passionately holding his daughter and the love that he has for her.I did like the movie, the editing during the love scene was great and obviously was just like Out Of Sight but didn't have a love scene. The film was confusing and quite tiring to understand with scenes and objects that you have to think and remember I am usually a fan of films that you have to watch closely but this was to confusing. The story line was excellent. The film was atmospheric thanks to the editing and music and spine chilling with the finale. We were told as an audience that there was a murderer and was always at the back of my mind so you forget and when you finally see the murderer there is an element of surprise and the director laughing at me as I'm too naive to remember. The opening sequence shots looked amazing with the damp mist in the real country side of Britain. I can't wait for the Hollywood version, not! as they make a lazy attempt at re-making a classic British film.

FACE\/OFF is Hong Kong action director John Woo's 3rd Hollywood action effort, and it is in this one that he finally hits the stride. Woo deliver one heck of a punch and delivers one action scene after another...with style. FACE\/OFF is action filmdom as an art form. There are many moments of violence and shootouts, but thanks to th very talented Woo, the action is in a style of his own. Slow-motion shots and all, FACE\/OFF is not just a non-stop thrill machine that one quit for a second (from the opening credits to the seat-gripping climax, it hardly has time for small talk), it's also Woo's perfect ballet of style and violence. And if you think those to things don't go together, then you haven't seen FACE\/OFF.Perhaps one of the two best actors at work in action films is John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, and they prove the pride of their work in this movie. During the film's gloomy prologue, nice-guy family man cop Sean Archer (Travolta) is on a carousel with his little boy, while on top of the hill is eccentric terrorist Castor Troy (Cage), aiming his sniper at Archer but misses, and hits his son instead. Since then, Archer has devoted himself on bringing Castor down. After two years or so, he's still at it. We'll take a break, when the case breaks! Archer says angrily. When Archer does corner Castor in hi private plane (in one of the film's earliest action scenes), Archer brings Castor drop dead in a coma. Just when he thought it was over, secretly Castor and his brother Pullox (Alessandro Nivola) has already set up a bomb and Castor's brother, captured for interrogation, just won't talk. What does he do? Well, here it goes. Archer has to switch faces with the comatose Castor, go to prison with Pullox and make him talk. Oh! And he also must remain undercover. No one knows, even his wife Eve (Joan Allen), of the operation. Things get worse when Castor wakes up (!) from his comatose and asks for Archer's face. Silly plot as it is, but who cares. This give us a chance to see the good guy Travolta and bad guy Cage switch personalities for most of the film.What else is good about FACE\/OFF is how the characters are well-developed. Archer is a nice cop, but isn't the same as a husband and a father, as he is unable to handle his relationship with his wife and rebellious daughter Jamie (Dominique Swann). Castor Troy is what he is, a real villain everyone loves to hate. The supporting characters are surprisingly well-developed and interesting. We care about these batch of characters, more or less it's the action we want, and it's more than we get. The action scenes here, including the opening action fireworks and the boat chase climax is a seat-gripper. Then there's a number of shoot-outs and fist-fights that, under the style of Woo, is like a ballad... with guns and punches. FACE\/OFF is action movies of the best order.

There he captures some Lions & runs into a huge Gorilla named Joe by local farmer Jill Young (Terry Moore) who has known him since he was a little baby Gorilla. Amazed by Joe & sensing a publicity stunt Max convinces Jill to sign a contract to go back to the US with him & perform on stage with Joe in his nightclub. Starstruck Jill agrees but soon regrets her decision when Joe is treated badly & kept in a cage all day only to come out & perform at night...Directed by Ernest C. Schoedsack one has to say that Might Joe Young is King Kong (1933) in all but name although it's still a great film in it's own right. The similarities are there for all to see, director Schoedsack directed King Kong, actor Robert Armstrong plays virtually the same character who tries to exploit Kong\/Joe for his own gain, Ruth Ross provided the scripts for both films while both were produced by Merian C. Cooper & of course not to mention both King Kong & Mighty Joe Young revolve around huge Gorillas who both have special feelings for a blonde, both are transported to the US & exploited, both escape & go on a rampage & both end with their hairy over-sized stars climbing up large structures. However Mighty Joe Young is so much more than just a rehash, while it doesn't feature any other monsters or the terrific Skull Island expedition & certainly is softer in tone it's a a very enjoyable fast paced monster film with some truly mesmerising scenes & special effects. Forget about films like Independence Day (1996) & The Matrix (1999) this was the special effects Hollywood blockbuster of it's day just as those other two films are now. The story is good, it's maybe a bit predictable & there's a slightly sweet sugary happy ending but I must admit I was captivated by every minute of it.The sheer magic of Mighty Joe Young has to go down to stop motion animators Willis O'Brien & Ray Harryhausen who work miracles here. Some of the effects work is truly amazing, from spectacularly animated scenes of Joe running in Africa with a heard of Elephants to the scene when Max & his men try to lasso him to the nightclub scene where he runs amok climbing support pillars, swinging on ropes & fighting Lions to a scene where he leans out of the back of a moving truck or the amusing tug O'war scene to the magical image of Joe holding a huge platform above his head with Jill on it playing the piano & singing Beautiful Dreamer or the sequence when Joe gets angry & smashes the door to his cell open. Each effects sequence seems to have had so much care & attention lavished on it, stop motion animation is a laborious task & it's clear the effects guy's who worked on Mighty Joe Young loved the process. Deservedly Mighty Joe Young won an Oscar for best special effects in 1950. But that's not all since they saved the best for last as Joe rescues several children from a burning building as it crashes down around him, another truly spectacular scene which is just one of many. The animators give Joe real personality & sympathy, you really feel for the big guy. Unlike King Kong which was fairly horrific at times Mighty Joe Young has more of a heart & tones the horror elements down. Filmed in black and white it's also available in a computer colourised version.Technically the film is impressive with some truly dazzling special effects scenes although the films depiction of Africa & it's natives is poor with very flat fake looking painted backdrops. Certain shots in the cowboys in Africa sequence were apparently taken from footage originally shot for a King Kong sequel which was never completed. A sequel called Joe Meets Tarzan was planned to be made in 1950 but the box-office failure of Mighty Joe Young meant the project was canned & never made. The acting is fine, it's a little wooden at times like a lot of these early films are but it's alright.Mighty Joe Young is for all intents & purposes a King Kong rip-off but it's a bloody damned good King Kong rip-off, while not quite as wonderful as King Kong it's not too far behind. Remade to less than stunning effect as Mighty Joe Young (1998), definitely watch this one instead.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"15 May 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Mighty Joe Young starts as Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) needs some publicity for the opening of his new Golden Safari nightclub in Los Angeles, he organises an expedition to Africa. There he captures some Lions & runs into a huge Gorilla named Joe by local farmer Jill Young (Terry Moore) who has known him since he was a little baby Gorilla. Amazed by Joe & sensing a publicity stunt Max convinces Jill to sign a contract to go back to the US with him & perform on stage with Joe in his nightclub. Starstruck Jill agrees but soon regrets her decision when Joe is treated badly & kept in a cage all day only to come out & perform at night...Directed by Ernest C. Schoedsack one has to say that Might Joe Young is King Kong (1933) in all but name although it's still a great film in it's own right. The similarities are there for all to see, director Schoedsack directed King Kong, actor Robert Armstrong plays virtually the same character who tries to exploit Kong\/Joe for his own gain, Ruth Ross provided the scripts for both films while both were produced by Merian C. Cooper & of course not to mention both King Kong & Mighty Joe Young revolve around huge Gorillas who both have special feelings for a blonde, both are transported to the US & exploited, both escape & go on a rampage & both end with their hairy over-sized stars climbing up large structures. However Mighty Joe Young is so much more than just a rehash, while it doesn't feature any other monsters or the terrific Skull Island expedition & certainly is softer in tone it's a a very enjoyable fast paced monster film with some truly mesmerising scenes & special effects. Forget about films like Independence Day (1996) & The Matrix (1999) this was the special effects Hollywood blockbuster of it's day just as those other two films are now. The story is good, it's maybe a bit predictable & there's a slightly sweet sugary happy ending but I must admit I was captivated by every minute of it.The sheer magic of Mighty Joe Young has to go down to stop motion animators Willis O'Brien & Ray Harryhausen who work miracles here. Some of the effects work is truly amazing, from spectacularly animated scenes of Joe running in Africa with a heard of Elephants to the scene when Max & his men try to lasso him to the nightclub scene where he runs amok climbing support pillars, swinging on ropes & fighting Lions to a scene where he leans out of the back of a moving truck or the amusing tug O'war scene to the magical image of Joe holding a huge platform above his head with Jill on it playing the piano & singing Beautiful Dreamer or the sequence when Joe gets angry & smashes the door to his cell open. Each effects sequence seems to have had so much care & attention lavished on it, stop motion animation is a laborious task & it's clear the effects guy's who worked on Mighty Joe Young loved the process. Deservedly Mighty Joe Young won an Oscar for best special effects in 1950. But that's not all since they saved the best for last as Joe rescues several children from a burning building as it crashes down around him, another truly spectacular scene which is just one of many. The animators give Joe real personality & sympathy, you really feel for the big guy.

The problem I imagine most people have when approaching it would be the first twenty-minutes; an almost incomprehensible mish-mash of silent film references and 21st century digital film techniques crossed thematically with contrasting elements of tragedy and humour. These first twenty minutes prove to be the jumping off point for many viewers; with the film giving us time to settle into its particular approach and use of cinematic language before getting into the more rewarding elements of the story at hand. For those who jumped ship, so to speak, the true power of the film will be wasted, with the initial shock value of the film's opening sequences eventually giving way to the more broadly recognisable aspects of the story; a story about Truth, Beauty, Freedom and, above all things else, Love.Accusations of style over substance are probably accurate, with the formulaic plot being a well-worn one, mixing themes from classic opera such as La Bohème and Madam Butterfly - and even Luhrmann's own radical adaptation of Romeo + Juliet (1996) - with the idea of love struck poet Christian (McGregor) and celebrated burlesque performer Satine's (Kidman) secret affair becoming all too public, as the impending (and one must say, fairly obvious) sense of tragedy looms over their heads. However, as a musical, the use of style is entirely befitting of the form, especially when we take into consideration the use of absinth as one of the major motivators for the plot, not to mention the overly romanticised nature of the theme. So, we have both light and dark elements at play within the story; the light from the high-kicking musical numbers and the dark coming from the more operatic themed sense of tragedy, and all somewhat akin to the work of Dennis Potter perhaps, in which the recognisable melodrama of the musical was elevated to an agonisingly painful and personal degree.The style nonetheless is there for a reason, creating a heightened world in which Lurhmann's anachronistic story unfolds. From the colourful and lively cinematography, to the editing, which is really at its best - with a remarkable use of juxtaposition of scenes presented within the Tango de Roxanne sequence, with the lyrical metaphors of The Police song about a prostitute who dared to fall in love - the film is a non-stop, giddy, kaleidoscope of visual motifs, references and elements of theatrical pastiche. It fully illustrates Lurhmann's skill as perhaps more of a stylist than storyteller, but you could certainly say the same thing about highly acclaimed filmmakers like Seijun Suzuki, Derek Jarman, Jacques Demy or Wong Kar-Wai.

The great cast also includes Julie Christie, Jason Isaacs, Dina Meyer (from STARSHIP TROOPERS) and Pete Postlethwaite, all pretty good. The story didn't hold my attention for the entire running time. Perhaps its my lack of interest in the story that prevents it from getting into me.DRAGONHEART isn't unwatchable, not to the very least, but I must say I didn't actually enjoy most of it. It has a number of fun scenes with Connery's voicing of Draco as well as some pretty neat action scenes, but it ain't perfection.Rating **1\/2 out of 5. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"15 May 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Milos Forman's adaptation of Peter Shaffer's award winning stage play of the life and ultimate downfall of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and his difficult relationship with arch rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is certainly something of a flawed work, albeit, one that is incredibly pleasant and engaging nonetheless. The principal focus of the film is on the character of Salieri, from his guilt ridden suicide attempt at the beginning of the film, through to the scenes in which he recounts his story to a priest from the confines of a mental hospital. From here, the film deals mainly with Salieri's crippling jealousy over the younger composer and the natural rivalry that intensifies between them, as Mozart's natural talent and flair for presentation finds him embraced by the Emperor (Jeffery Jones) and the people of Vienna.As Mozart gains more and more success, it is Salieri's obsession to destroy the composer at any means necessary that drives the narrative further and further. Although you could argue that the whole thing is woefully inaccurate in a historical scene, you can't help but marvel at the film's style, wit and excellent period evocation. Shaffer's script fizzes with depth and amusing character quirks that should resonate with anyone who has some familiarly with the actual story at hand, while Forman's direction is close to Kubrick's greatest film Barry Lyndon (1975) in terms of scope, scale and detail. Here, the director is aided by cinematographer Miroslav Odericek's and his staggering use of composition and lighting, with the look, combined with the costume and production design evoking the true grimy beauty of the period.There is also a great pace being maintained by the editing of the film, with some interesting juxtapositions between the worlds of these two composers, and the intelligent use of Salieri as the teller of the story, which opens the film up to ideas of the unreliable narrator, thus somewhat anarchically excusing itself from the more obvious inaccuracies. This all goes towards making Amadeus (1984) a fascinating character study with some wonderfully bawdy comedy and, unsurprisingly, that fantastic use of music. A great look at one man's shallow obsession to share his art with the people and god, but is overshadowed at every turn by a much greater talent, something he only realises too late.

Lantana is the first one I've seen since I started and it was also quite an interesting film, so it gets a review.Lantana (so named after a plant that features prominently in the film's Sydney setting) is half mystery, half ensemble drama. It opens with the slow revealing of a dead woman caught up in a bunch of bushes, before progressing on to the main stories.The first half of the film sets up each of the dozen or so main characters the apparent protagonist is detective Leon (Anthony LaPaglia). Although he's married to Sonja (Kerry Armstrong), he has an affair with Jane (Rachael Blake), who's currently separated from her own husband Peter (Glenn Robbins). Sonja suspects Leon's affair and confides in renowned therapist Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey). Valerie is herself having a personal crisis or two, dealing with her emotionally distant husband John (Geoffrey Rush) and the unnerving revelations of one client, a gay man named Patrick (Peter Phelps). There are more sub-plots and characters that interweave in the lives of these characters on the edge, but those are the ones that truly drive the film.The second half of the film begins when it's revealed that Valerie has disappeared. Since several characters have some connection to her, it ramps up the tension between each character to breaking point.Handling a movie with multiple sub-plots is always difficult. You only ever hear about it if the makers get it absolutely right. Lantana managed to get it right, juggling each sub-plot smoothly. The film lasts for about two hours (roughly an hour less than films of a similar breed like Magnolia or Short Cuts) and it does not drag at all. It even feature a couple of mysteries outside of the main disappearance arc (the most obvious ones including Who has Patrick been sleeping with? and What does Sonja say at the end of the therapy session?) Visually speaking, the film is brilliant. The quality see-saws from grainy to polished in such a manner that it works. The acting (comprised of several well-known Australian actors, including a surprisingly serious turn by Robbins) is top-notch. Some moments may be over-the-top, but overall it's done well and with considerable restraint. I don't remember being too impressed with the score, but I'd figure that if it was good I'd remember it.Lantana may not be the most original of films. As I outlined earlier, it's very similar to Short Cuts and Magnolia in terms of narrative, and the strength of the disappearance mystery may seem about as strong to a modern audience as the plot of the average CSI episode. However, as a whole the film works out fine. It proves to be a complex, thought-provoking meditation on the lives of overly human people that aren't necessarily bad, but just struggle to try and stay good even in the face of such extreme adversity.

I don't think it did. The original movie's only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good in this sequel.I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. For starters, it just wasn't funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I didn't sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue. He appeared to hate every woman that his father Ben (John Ritter) dated for the sole sake of hating them. It also doesn't send a good message to kids with divorced parents (who constitute over half children in the U.S. these days) when the one woman Ben decides to (almost) marry is a Southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is.And as cool as I thought it would have been to see original SNL cast mate Laraine Newman come back to the big screen, she couldn't even save this movie. I also found it strange that she was a white Southern débutante whose name was Lawanda. That sounds more like an African-American woman's name. But of course, that has nothing to do with why I disliked this movie.I think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate, along with protagonists you weren't supposed to hate. John Ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting.
