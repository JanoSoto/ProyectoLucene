This brings him in contact with a girl with a secret (Leelee Sobieski), who finds herself torn between her new interest and a lifelong friend (Josh Hartnett).The perpetual teen film takes on a new direction with far more sobering, sometimes sweet, but over-sentimental tale of young love. Borrowing from staple fare such as the 1970s weepies Love Story and Sunshine, Here on Earth, the title of which stems partly from the poetry of Robert Frost, has some rather nice moments, but is ultimately simplistic and trite, to appeal to a cynical audience. Teenage girls, however, a largely untapped market, may warm to this tale of love, life and death, and the participation of an attractive trip of actors. The movie suffers from Michael Seitzman's wishy-washy script, one that is too obvious for its own good, and director Mark Piznarki, in his feature debut, milks the material for all its worth. Plus points are some beautiful cinematography (on location in Minnesota) and a strong soundtrack. Performances are varied. Chris Klein, resembling a young Keanu, shows as much dramatic range. Effective in less demanding roles (American Pie and Election), Klein is clearly uncomfortable as a straight dramatic actor. His stronger co-stars overshadow him, beginning with Sobieski, who photographs beautifully, and conveys the right qualities for the fragile and poetic character she beautifully plays. Hartnett is a rare find, and will be seen later in Virgin Suicides to better advantage, though here he gives a rather nice and intelligent performance in a simple character.There are some lovely elements in Here on Earth, and for its target audience, it's a welcome change from male-dominated teen dramas that flood the market. Male audiences will be turned off by the film's excessive sentimentality and consistent references to Frost. This is a well-intentioned film that could have been more effective as a solid drama, had it not been for its simplistic approach to the material, and the wooden performance of its lead actor.

It seems this film left just about everyone confused.It is easy to see why people either loved this film or hated it.  It was like the little girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead.  Where it was good, it was very good and where it was bad it was horrid.  On the plus side, the acting was terrific.  Ashley Judd played the sociopathic drifter par excellence, alternating effectively between vulnerable little girl and ruthless killer bitch.  Ewan McGregor was also convincing as the high tech snoop from the British Embassy who develops an all consuming obsession with Joanna.   Also, director Stephan Elliot gave us some innovative images and generally used the camera quite effectively.On the horrid side, we have an obviously flawed story that is exacerbated by very poor presentation.  Since Elliot got both writing and directing credits, we need to unload both barrels of criticism on him for ruining it.  The story had a sound premise, a spy witnesses a murder and becomes obsessed with the murderess.  There were so many interesting directions Elliot could have taken this, and yet he chose to go nowhere.  His attempts at character development just clouded our understanding of the story and the motivation of the characters.  The story begged for some clever plot twist that never came.  The only obscure message that came through was the irony that our spy's obsession to protect her became her undoing.There were other eccentricities with the direction that further muddied the film.  There were no clear indicators of the timeline.  As a matter of fact, there were period props that seemed to be out of time, old cars near the end, newer cars in the beginning and various props out of the seventies and eighties mixed together with nineties props.  This happened so often that I actually thought they were clues to some time based plot twist that I was supposed to be noticing.  In the end, they turned out to be irrelevant; just poor use of props.  And what was with all the shoe shots?  These added nothing to the story or its telling.  Also, how implausible is it that Hillary (k.d. lang), so obviously American, was coordinating espionage for the British government out of the British Embassy?

It seems to fall into that category of films that doesn't make you feel cheated for spending your matinee bucks on it but it also will not leave a lasting impression either. I'm not really sure where the lacklustre film could have improved but I just know it could have.Charlize Theron was pretty good as the vacilating female that makes herself palpable to almost every male character in the film.  She is a beautiful woman and to make her femme fatale like in here was a good move by the producers.The direction is quite nice with many chase scenes that are handled well by veteran director Frankenhiemer.  Especially intriguing is the Santa Clause break in at the casino.  It is quite the sight and pretty original to see a robbery attempt with five or six Santas firing uzis and such.The script is okay as well but it lacks something and this brings me to the two most recognizable faces in the film.Gary Sinise and Ben Affleck are good.  They do what they can with what they are given but again, they are lacking something.  Sinise just doesn't come across as that menacing and his gang of thugs are given some sporadic dialogue that attempts humour with lines about marketing and such.  But it doesn't work completely.  I think someone like Shane Black or even Jim and John Thomas could have been asked to come in do some re-writes.  With films like Lethal Weapon, Predator and Die Hard to their credit, they could have handled this situation better than Krueger.And now we get to Affleck.  I admire him very much.  People think that him and Damon are overnight successes in Hollywood and that is just not true. Both guys were in many films with smaller roles and only after Good Will Hunting came out did they hit stardom.  But think of films like Chasing Amy, Mall Rats, School Ties, Courage Under Fire and Dazed and Confused.  These are films that have been released over the last decade and had bit roles for these guys.  And now that Affleck has arrived on the scene he seems as though he wants to do as many films as he can.  He has appeared in big budget films like Armageddon and this one and had bit roles in films like Shakespeare In Love and Boiler Room.  The man loves to act.  Reindeer Games is a good role for him but it is also one that doesn't utilize his assets completely.  Here is a guy that is quite tall and in pretty good shape.  I would like to see him take action a little more seriously.  Why not give him a role that has him as a bad-ass tough guy.  I would like to see him beat the snot out of somebody.  Reindeer Games scratches the surface of this premise but it leaves much to be desired.This is worth a rental one night.  It certainly isn't a bad film but it is one that perhaps could have been better with a few rewrites and with Affleck being able to play a tougher role.

It doesn't help that hardly any character in the film is believable. Even in the craziest comedy, characters are believable for the situation they are in. Not in Rushmore. However, in the good old tradition of a popular N.American film, this film has some good acting, and pretty much everything else, except - no story to tell, idea to convey, or emotion to stir.

I saw the first film and thoroughly enjoyed it. I figured I could expect much of the same from the sequel. Well, I was wrong...very wrong. I was at least expecting a plot, but, alas, there was none. The poor excuse for a plot is that there is an evil man ready to set a devastating disease loose on all mankind and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), along with the requisite beautiful partner find the source of the disease and bring a living sample of it back to Anthony Hopkins (he is only in the movie for about 8 minutes total, so I don't remember his character's  name). I was turned off by the time the opening credits rolled. The film opens with a man speaking in an indistinguishable accent, so I had no idea what he was saying. But I had many opportunities to try to figure it out since they replayed the monologue 3 times throughout the run of the film (for no real reason). Then we are faced with a plane being hijacked, and then we zoom to Tom Cruise hanging from his fingertips off the egde of a cliff while the opening credits rolled. I truly believe the only real reason behind this movie is to make Tom Cruise look cool. John Woo was certainly the right director to go to for this, since he is known for his use of slo-mo, and penchant for symbolism in his films. The only real reason to see MI2 is to see Tom Cruise. Period.MI2 is bound to disappoint many. It's not a real action film, because there is very little action, and it's not a drama, because the characters are not developed at all Ethan Hunt=good, Sean Ambrose=bad, Nyah=sexy. That's another annoyance. Thandie Newton is a talented actress, but here, she is reduced to basically being a Bond girl, her estrogen used as a plot device. And, finally , speaking of plot devices, the overuse of the mask f\/x is extremely tiring. Give us a break Mr. Woo! We all saw FaceOff, it's a cool effect the first 20 times we see it. After that, it's a ridiculous parody of itself, a la Scooby -Doo cartoons,  that insults the audience. At one crucial point in the movie, it's obvious to everyone that a mask is being worn by one of the characters because it had been used 7 times prior to that in the movie. Yet, we are supposed to be shocked by the ultimate revelation...sloppy filmmaking, to say the least. All in all, I gave MI2 a 2. It was silly, overwrought, and campy in it's own way.

All this is okay, for he wouldn't pass for a normal human being if he didn't. He leads two lives.

For instance, one of the students is in the bathroom; spooky music starts up; he's sitting on the loo (ouch); a tap underneath comes loose by itself & water drips out; he gets up from the loo (phew); he sees a shadow in the mirror; he picks up a razor & cuts himself on the neck; the water moves purposefully towards his bare feet; NO, he's put down the razor & walks away just before the water touches his feet; he plugs in a radio (water, electricity &#150; ouch); again he moves just before the water reaches him; etc., etc. Is this supposed to be funny, knowingly clever, scary, all three? I don't know, but for me it was just dull.This sort of voyeuristically sadistic &#145;who's going to get it next & how' game, although basically in very bad taste, can be very funny for instance in &#145;Scream'. The difference is that &#145;Scream' is clever enough to make it obvious that the characters being bumped off in increasingly messy ways were parodies of themselves & not meant to be taken seriously; here however it seems we're supposed to believe that they are real. In expecting us to take sadistic delight in guessing who gets it next & in what particularly grisly manner I think makes a movie like this just plain nasty, & childishly so.At the risk of getting a touch of the Mary Whitehouses (God forbid) I think it is exactly this sort of movie which contributes to making society, (particularly American society & with it the rest of the Western world), numb to pain, suffering & violence in a way that immunises us from the real thing so that the war in the Gulf, the Kosovan crisis, become just another TV show -  & we forget that there are real people out there suffering & dying horribly, or maybe we just don't care. OK &#150; end of sermon!        I said we're supposed to believe the characters are real &#150; &#145;supposed' because they are badly realised, & mostly caricatures either shallow & nasty, stupid or plain dull. It's possible we're meant to think that they are in fact parodies of themselves but if this is the case it's so badly done it just doesn't come across at all. In fact I doubt if that much thought has gone into it.   There are a few genuine shocks & funny moments, mostly based around sudden & unexpected deaths, (although in hindsight I think I found it funny because I wanted it to be so), but overall this left me flat. After the 1st sticky death I lost interest, I didn't give a &#145;monkeys' about the characters, the story was thin & the direction mediocre. The best part of the whole thing was a brief cameo by Tony &#145;Candyman' Todd as a creepy mortician.This is doubly disappointing for me as director James Wong along with co-writer Glen Morgan were responsible for some of the very best of the early &#145;X-Files' as well as &#145;Space Above & Beyond' & are capable of much better than this. My verdict best avoided &#150; unless you're a schoolkid, which I suspect is the target audience 'it's not big, & it's not clever'.

I have the DVD version, and watch it occasionally.  I've come to realize that the love story (which MANY have complained about) serves to offset the disaster portion of the movie *perfectly*.  Without it, watching Titanic would simply be a bleak and depressing experience.  But notice how the love story reaches its peak JUST as the ship crashes into the iceberg, and a crossover effect is achieved -- disaster intersects with love and the human spirit.  Without the love story (and no, I didn't think it was particularly cheesy), Titanic would not be the movie that it is.People have said that this movie has aged poorly since its original release.  I don't think so.  I saw it three times on the big screen when it came out, and bought the DVD when *it* first came out.  Multiple viewings have not diminished this movie for me.  It still stands as the finest movie of 1997, and the best epic disaster film ever made.  Remember, this movie is not a documentary, and was never intended to be.  Some people don't quite seem to get that point.  As for Leonardo Dicaprio, I do feel they could have chosen a different actor for the part and it would have improved things, but only a little.  This film has only one lead character, the Titanic Herself.  All the rest are extras, albeit important ones.If you're one of those rare birds who hasn't seen Titanic yet, don't listen to its detractors.  Watch the movie and judge it for yourself.  I won't comment on the special effects, except to say they're incredible and 99% seamless.  The story (taken as a whole) is profound and moving.  No other disaster film (the innumerable Airport 19xx's and others) have managed to capture the human side of a major 20th century disaster so effectively.  And this is still a great 'date movie' as well.  It succeeds from many, many angles -- so many that its flaws (yes, it has some) can and should be overlooked.  Director James Cameron put his heart and soul into this film, and it shows.Verdict Acquitted on ALL charges and rated 9\/10 for true excellence in filmmaking.

This movie was so bad that I considered walking out and waiting for my friends in the lobby. A lot of the sentiment is way to action movie cliche.

Not like Star Wars visual effects, rather just a lot of eye candy. It was a lot of unbelievable stunts, car chases and martial arts fighting. From that respect it had a bit of a Matrix feel to it. But even The Matrix had better plot and character development. Don't go see this movie and expect to see anything like that last one. Some of the characters are the same. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickle. But this movie is all about Ethan Hunt. Rhames' character is very minor, and is nothing more than a snapshot of the Luther that we first met in the train car in the first movie, not the man he had become by the end. He's all attitude and one liners. Anthony Hopkins, who plays Hunt's boss is only in the movie very briefly, and even he is nothing but attitude.

This is the type of horror movie that I like, one in which every now and then you see a frightening image or a startling scene, and that image or scene lingers in your mind.Everything about this movie is haunting. First, there's the song at the beginning you hear a young girl's voice singing a beautiful yet somber song.

The black-and-white photography is perfect for this movie. This movie would not have been too creepy if it had been done in color. Further, many of the shots were innovative and the lighting was used ingeniously in some of the scenes.Additionally, I liked the way that the director chose to play around with the sound, which brought more of an element of mystery to the movie. In one particular scene, there was a lot of noise initially....and in a split second there was dead silence....then several seconds later, it was noisy all over again (all in the same scene).But what I think is the most interesting thing about this movie is the fantastic performance by Deborah Kerr. It's fascinating to watch her facial expressions in this movie. She demonstrates her character's fear quite well.I also think that the actor who plays Quint is very scary-looking! He has a very sinister look, and it adds to the spookiness of this movie.

So I wasn't really surprised when I saw East is East going the same route. In this age of political correctness, this film openly lambastes Pakistani culture and its beliefs.East is East could have been a very engaging, thought provoking sentimental drama about a Pakistani immigrant and his mixed race family struggling to cope with each other. But instead it is an offensive, obscene and crass comedy. The comedy has almost childishly been created at the expense of Pakistani values, which happen to be different than those of the film makers. It could even have been amusing, if this depiction were balanced, but unfortunately, this film just projects a one sided and highly biased viewpoint. All the Pakistani characters are portrayed as stupid, ignorant and devoid of any common sense.Om Puri plays (George Khan) a Pakistani immigrant living in Manchester in the early seventies. Although he acts superbly, his characterization is extremely one-dimensional. His very name, spells out the film makers' ignorance. No self respecting fundamentalist (as George is portrayed to be) would ever call himself George!!! He is portrayed as an ignorant, vicious, heartless and violent wife basher who has utterly no regard for any of his seven children. George is married to the white, English Ella, yet we are asked to believe that he is a traditionalist and wants to uphold his extreme religious beliefs.Not once is he shown expressing love and concern for his children. Instead, he is portrayed as a despot slave driver who is willing to whip up anybody who dares to confront him at the slightest provocation.  The most ridiculous premise is that we are actually asked to believe that his children who are all in their late teens to mid twenties,  (except Sajid) accept this reign of tyranny until the very last reel!!!The film would have been more intelligent if George Khan were shown as an intelligent manipulator. That at least would have been more convincing. The film makers sadly have numerous misconceptions about Islam and Pakistan and in their zest to pass it of as comedy, some totally unbelievable situations are injected such as the sequences involving watches with Arabic inscriptions. Moreover, only a blind father would be willing to marry his good-looking sons with hideous, unsightly girls in the name of culture and tradition. Perhaps the director implied that children raised in a Pakistani environment like Mr. Shah's daughters, turn out to be dull, dumb and grossly obese.The only commendable factor in this film is acting by a cast of virtual unknowns. Almost all actors have given decent performances with Om Puri once again establishing his prowess as an exceptional actor. Strong performances in particular from Ella (Linda Basset), Tariq (Jimi Mistry) and Saleem (Chris Bisson) help keep the film afloat. Jordan Routledge as the youngest son Sajid also deserves a special mention.The script by Ayub Khan-Din unfortunately, lacks authenticity and spells out extreme prejudice suggesting that any culture other than the western way of life is loathsome, silly and laughable! The fact that this film has been hailed as one of the finest British comedies ever made, only suggests the criterion of the British cinema.George's values are high voltage even by the standards of the most radical families in Pakistan. To accept that he wants these beliefs thrust upon his mixed blood family living in Manchester is nothing but an insult to the audience's intelligence.

Zion, Wisconsin in 1994. Alvin Straight, 73 years old, is a physical wreck of man. He needs two canes to get around. He can't drive due to poor eyesight. But his estranged brother has just suffered a debilitating stroke, and Alvin is determined to go see him. Since he can't drive, and since he'll be damned if he'll let someone in a bus drive him there, Alvin chooses the mode of transportation he knows best - a 1966 John Deere riding mower.   This is such an odd movie for a filmmaker like David Lynch to make. The creator of such cultish films as Eraserhead, Dune, and Blue Velvet generally makes weird, offbeat movies. His films are usually rated R (or worse), and are brimming with stylish violence and a real sense of atmosphere, creepy as it may be. With The Straight Story, none of these characteristics are apparent. I half-expected to see Alvin turn into a homicidal maniac who likes to lop off ears and drink the blood out of them in a crazed, stylish, symbolistic dance. But no, this was as gentle, as moving a movie as you'll see nowadays (aside from certain made-for-cable movies). There isn't an ounce of meanness, not a whit of wickedness, not one dollop of demonic possession. It's as placid as a quilting bee, and what's more, it's absolutely beautiful. If you've seen any of Lynch's movies, you know the director has his own trademark  camera angels and movements, and these are unmistakable in this film, as well. From each loving look at the amber waves of grain (okay, maybe they're golden) to the stark farmhouses poised in repose, each camera angle seems to have been painstakingly tended to. There's love in the details, friends, and this is one of those rare, rare movies that'll stay in your mind for years. And to top if all off, you have an Oscar-nominated performance from Richard Farnsworth, a former stuntman-turned-thespian. There's hardly an emotion from cranky old Alvin Straight for most of the film, the repressed WWII vet on a mission. The casting couldn't have been better in this movie. Farnsworth is an absolute delight as Alvin, and his eyes are more revealing than the faces of many well-paid actors. Tired, wrinkly, and a little despondent, Alvin's eyes express everything from sadness to resignation to resilience. The moment when Alvin finally reaches his brother's house is very memorable, the kind film scholars should be talking about for decades.
