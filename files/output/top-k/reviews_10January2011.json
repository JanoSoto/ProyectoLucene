Not my favorite director, just someone who generally makes an interesting movie that also usually ends up kind of overlong. This one is no exception, as it runs a bit to long, but it was a different kind of movie to be sure. The movie's plot is about a man who falls for a very young girl. This fact, however, does not make him an unsympathetic character in my eyes because the girl may be underage, but she is very attractive. Any guy would have a hard time ignoring her. It is not like the remake in 1997, now in that one the girl is underage and looks it and you get more of a creepy vibe in that one. This one though you feel for the guy as you do the mother and of Lolita herself. The only character I had no sympathy for is Peter Seller's character, an oily kind of guy that seems to be playing some sort of game with everyone's life and he does not seem to truly love Lolita as the main character most certainly does. The movie ends how one would expect it to, making me feel even more sorry for the man in love with Lolita. Very sad to see him give her up. I am not saying the man is a saint or anything, his life and that of the mother would have been better off if he had never developed feelings for the young girl or had pursued him, but like I said I found him to be someone you could feel bad for. Though that goes for everyone in the film with the exception of the Seller's character, so bizarre that I had the most dislike for his character when he is the reason I watched it in the first place.

Because, I honestly can't believe that they all witnessed the same film I did. (Not to mention, mass negative voting from people who haven't seen the film is a problem here for movies with hype or notoriety.)I knew the story, I heard about it all. The film was shelved for two years, didn't get much publicity, and was released August of 2002. Releasing a major comedy with a huge budget 2 years after completion, with little publicity on almost the exact date of the 1-year anniversary of one of the biggest tragedies to ever hit the US... Seriously, did the studio even think when they tried to push this film out? I can only assume not. Critics crucified it. Audiences ignored it. It was a flop.I went along, blindly following the notion that because it flopped, it sucked. (Although, I have found out that many great films flopped, among them It's a Wonderful Life.) Finally a few months ago, a friend of mine said Hey Adam, let's watch 'Pluto Nash'! It's on NetFlix! I scoffed, but after he persisted, I agreed.I'm glad I did.Pluto Nash was refreshingly entertaining, and in no way was it the abysmal slight against cinema I had been told it was.The film centers on Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy in a fun performance), his sidekick robot Bruno (Randy Quaid in perhaps my favorite performance in the film) and Dina Lake (the astonishingly beautiful Rosario Dawson), with numerous other actors in supporting roles. Nash is the owner the nightclub Club Nash, on the moon, some time in the future. He bought the club to save the life of a friend (Jay Mohr), who has since become a famous singer in a snazzy upscale part of the moon, leaving Nash behind. Dina arrives, hoping to work for Nash in order to earn money to buy her way back to Earth.Soon, henchmen sent by the mysterious Rex Crater arrive, interested in buying Nash's club. When Nash turns them down, they destroy the place. Nash, Dina and Bruno vow to discover who this Rex Carter is, and stop him.And so begins this fun action\/comedy\/sci-fi feature. In all honesty, the story is cliché, but it actually works quite well. This isn't supposed to be a revolutionary masterpiece, it's meant to be a fun good-guys-VS-bad-guys-buddy-movie type film, only set on the moon in the future. The characters are quite endearing and likable as well. They feel like people you'd want to hang out with.The special effects (which were unfairly criticized at the time) are surprisingly good, considering they were from 2000 (remember, the film was finished but shelved for two years), and the direction of Ron Underwood is quite nice. Visually, the film is a treat.The cast works. Murphy, Dawson and Quaid are all great in their roles, and supporting characters are played very well by some big names, such as Peter Boyle, Pam Greir, Burt Young and even a cameo by Alec Baldwin.The music is fun, the editing is great, the set design is exquisite, the acting is generally very good, the direction is fantastic, the story is decent enough. I really can't say much. The craftsmanship is very competent. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination from any conceivable way you look at it. Is it a particularly strong film? No. But is it a halfway decent film with some laughs and some heart? Yes, it is most definitely. I also admire the fact that this film isn't ashamed of being light-hearted and positive.

It is an artistic film, which may turn off some viewers unfortunately. It is a surreal film. Sections of it are dream-like, but they are also imaginative and captivating. David Lynch, the director, is well-known for this style. He is an imaginative director, who incorporates the surreal into his films. He is my favorite director, and this is one of his best works.The Elephant Man is an engaging movie. It is sad, but it is also moving. The Elephant Man is a little slow-paced, but it really integrates the viewer into the story. It is about a man named John Merrick, referred to as the Elephant Man. John Merrick is disfigured. His has a misshapen head, and face. He is unable to talk, and has trouble sleeping because of his condition. He is also frequently sick.John Merrick is in a circus. The circus profits of his disease, while John Merrick suffers because of it. John Merrick is constantly put through the humiliation of being gawked at by crowds at the circus. People marvel at him, and are horrified by his physical appearance. You really understand what he is being put through, and you really feel sorry for him.John Merrick has to wrap cloth around his face when he is in public. People are shocked when they seem him. He is not accepted by society, or sympathized with. He is instead ostracized and ridiculed as a freak. This film has a lot to say about humanity. It really exemplifies the fact that humans can be savage and cruel.John Merrick has been used and mistreated by nearly everyone he has ever known. There is no known cure or treatment for his condition. Doctors are really not much help. Nobody ever seems to have given him much love, or showed him any hope. He has just been exploited by humanity his whole life. But one day everything changes. He meets a man, a doctor, who decides to take on the challenge of helping him. This man is a very good doctor who has a lot of character.He feels sympathy for John Merrick, and is dedicated to helping him. He spends a lot of time with him, and slowly gets him to feel better. John Merrick never really talked his whole life. His disease prevented him from talking. But his doctor, through great patience and determination, teaches him how to speak. This doctor is the only man who ever believed in John Merrick. He gradually gets him to learn English. He also is able to improve his immunity and reduces symptoms of the disease.This doctor changed John Merrick's life. He not only healed him physically, but he mended John's broken spirit. Before, John lived a life devoid of happiness, but instead filled with pain. The doctor gave him something to live for. He is also responsible for discovering that John is a sensitive and intelligent man, and an exceptionally kind person.This film is a testament to the fact that humans can be harsh and unmerciful. Humans are generally not that accepting of people like the Elephant Man. People can be scornful of others who are different, whether that difference be physical, or personal. But among that majority there is a minority of people that are capable of great kindness and compassion towards others. I think we should all try to aspire to the dedication and the kindness of the doctor in this movie. The doctor in the Elephant Man is one of those special people who have the ability to aid those who are needed, even when no one else can.The Elephant Man is a strange movie. It is not your typical pop corn flick you get now. There are still good contemporary films, but many of them lack originality. Today a lot of films were clearly made to try and please crowds, so they won't be flops at the box office. Filmaking is too much of a business today, and not enough of an art.

From the opening frame, warning bells sounded no '20th Century Fox' logo. Not a good sign considering that said studio was behind the film. As I watched the film, I was unmoved by some pretty dodgy special visual effects (the huge torrent of water which sweeps up reluctant - and hungover! - hero Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis), and the rather underwhelming explosion which destroys the cargo ship near the film's end). On the whole, I felt that the whole affair was a letdown, especially considering the raised expectations cued by the fact that this installment marked 'Die Hard' director John McTiernan's most welcome return to the franchise.Now it seems that every time I see the movie I enjoy it more and more. It is the final splatter film in the series; 'Die Hard 4.0' was the first flick in the series to be awarded a PG-13 rating. 'Vengeance' is, like its two predecessors, R-rated, and contains some pretty shocking violence a close-quarters shootout in an elevator yields a great deal of bloodshed, and later a henchman is cut in half by a cable.Once again we have a memorable and charismatic villain in Simon Gruber (British actor Jeremy Irons). While Irons - an extremely talented actor - can not better fellow Brit Alan Rickman's bad guy, Hans Gruber, from the first 'Die Hard', he still delivers a solid and engaging performance, always keeping his cool despite being constantly thwarted by McClane. His sultry and silent partner, Katya, is played by former Contemporary Christian Music singer Sam Phillips. The fact that she does not speak throughout the entire film is a very clever conceit, and she is able to say a great deal with just a glance. But Katya is not just along for the ride, something she demonstrates by dispatching - in a very bloody and graphic display - several security guards.'Die Hard With a Vengeance' is lean and mean and very entertaining. The film opens explosively... quite literally! We see various shots of New York as The Lovin' Spoonful's 'Summer in the City' pounds on the soundtrack. Suddenly, a bomb explodes at the Bonwit Teller department store, shattering the hustle and bustle of a typical morning in the Big Apple.Responsibility for the bombing is taken by a man who calls the New York Police Department and identifies himself only as 'Simon'. He wishes to play a game with McClane whom, we discover, is on suspension. 'Simon' is insistent if McClane does not participate in this 'game', then 'Simon' will detonate another bomb in another part of the city. Our first sight of McClane is very telling he is hungover and half-asleep, and dosing himself up on coffee and aspirin. This is no muscle-bound Schwarzenegger-type hero out to save the day and kill the bad guys McClane would clearly rather be in bed, catching up on much-needed sleep. This makes him all the more human, and his particularly nasty hangover becomes something of a comic motif as the action-packed events of the day unfold. He is the ultimate reluctant hero jaded, cynical, and very profane. He would much rather someone else save the world on this occasion. The problem is, 'Simon' is calling for him, and no one else.McClane's first task is as bizarre as it is dangerous he has to strip down to his boxer shorts ('You're the first person since Holly to see me do this,' he tells cop Connie Kowalski (Colleen Camp). 'I'm honoured,' she replies with a distinct lack of enthusiasm) and walk through Harlem, wearing a sandwich board bearing a racially inflammatory declaration. An electronic goods store proprietor, Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) happens to notice McClane and, fearing an imminent homicide, takes pity upon him and rescues him from certain death when McClane is set upon by a group of young men who have taken the greatest possible exception to the sign he is wearing.What follows is more of these deadly 'games' and riddles which McClane and Carver must solve in order to prevent further bombs being detonated in their city. Like McClane, Carver is a reluctant hero who is caught up in the mayhem. He would much rather leave McClane to his own devices but he feels an obligation to help if he can.Three very strong action set pieces spring to mind in the first, McClane commandeers one of those ubiquitous yellow cabs and tears through Central Park while joggers, picnickers, and mime artists(!) leap for desperately for cover. The second serves up a spectacular subway crash which recalls those in 'Speed' and 'Money Train'. The third involves two helicopters and closes the film with a very satisfying amount of pyro.Speaking of the film's ending... The Definitive Edition DVD release offers a very classy alternative ending in which McClane tracks Simon down to a swank gentlemen's club. Seating himself opposite Simon, McClane places a specially designed rocket launcher upon the table and begins to spin it slowly around and around as Simon tries to figure out which end of the weapon is the dangerous one. McClane then gives Simon a taste of his own medicine, reeling off riddle after riddle before solving the rocket launcher puzzle in a very clever way. Not as spectacular as the theatrical ending but interesting nonetheless.McTiernan has not built a better 'Die Hard' the second time around. But 'Vengeance' is full of action and some great lines and certainly earns its rightful place in the series. It is refreshing that the script does something a little different and takes risks. They pay off. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 January 2011","score":"","review":" I was pretty disappointed when I first saw 'Die Hard With a Vengeance'.

Yet as soon as I could make myself composed, I did enjoy every minute of the film. Jessica Tandy (an unusual late bloomer) won BEST ACTRESS in the Oscar race and set the record to become the oldest actor to win among all four acting categories, which is still unbreakable to date. Her performance is combined with subtlety and accuracy, and plunged herself to incarnate her role, a vivid recreation yet not over-the-top. As for Morgan Freeman, I guess it's rather difficult to see him in his younger time, given that the film was made 22 years before, he carried the same contour in The SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (2004), SE7EN (1995) and even MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004), the only distinction was the more rapid and fluent speed of speech.

In fact, the literal translation of the original title is It Happened in Your Neighborhood. Basically, whatever happens in this film can happen to you. In such a random way that fear is useless, and such ruthlessness, it's scarily democratic.The movie follows Remy Belvaux and his friends, a crew of young wannabe film-makers shooting a documentary about the life of a ... guess what? A serial-killer, named Ben as an allusion to the main actor's name  Benoit Poeelvorde. Why not? The movie is from Belgium, not a hazard since the country was famous in the francophone world for a TV documentary named Strip-Tease which followed the everyday life of a person, a community, or a group of people, in their jobs, lives, or specific activities. The movie is a parody shot in black and white. The main protagonist kills for reasons, basically money and revenge, never fun or pleasure, though he seems to enjoy it sometimes. He puts so much perfectionism in his acts  how to correctly ballast a dead body to prevent it from floating in the river? or to spare some bullets by freaking out a poor granny with a heart condition? Ben, the killer, is a delight to watch, and we, as viewers, are put in the same position as the crew, we observe, follow, listen to his speeches, and amusing anecdotes. The act of killing becomes almost banal. And the feeling is so real, we even stop at one point, early in the film, to question the morbid nature of his job.Indeed, the character is so sympathetic, so colorful, we really enjoy watching him working, just because it's so damn funny despite the realism. How did the film manage to make us laugh at such cruel acts? In one word genius. Every single element makes the movie work  the writing is clever and subtly cynical, the acting of Poelvorde is what I consider one of the greatest male performances ever, his interactions with the crew are priceless, the situations are funny and the violence exaggeratedly graphic. This guy is one of the most unforgettable characters ever, he's flamboyant, friendly, educated, exuberant, he loves his family, yet all the charisma he brings out to the character is nothing else like his sadistic mercilessness and immorality when it comes to killing. This man is a professional with no limits, no morals, no taboos. The fact that we laugh to this violence is a credit to the talent of the actor, and the genius of the film. His racist, macho, and sometimes xenophobic comments are offensive but hilarious, they're almost objectively hilarious. And if we can't not laugh, because that would imply we are offended by dialogs more than violence? Besides, the movie doesn't make any segregation every social, racial or demographic category is targeted. So, are we supposed to be shocked only by the violence that is against us? The movie highlights our hypocritical approach to violence by condemning only the aspect that touches us.In fact, the movie doesn't desensitize us, but makes us realize how desensitized we already are. We can't help but feel empathic to Ben because he's the main character, and his background makes him even more sympathetic. The documentary-like shooting made it as far as showing his real mother and grand-parents, a lovable family who didn't know about Ben's activities. He also has friends, who like and care for him. Yes, we fear Ben but are charmed by his bonhomie at the same time. His crimes, as brutal and gruesome as they are, are watched in a very tolerant mindset. After all, aren't antiheroes cool? Isn't the act of killing a man so common now that we don't even care? Wouldn't we enjoy being Bruce Willis or Arnie's sidekick in a film &#x85; this level of empathy inspired by cool or sympathetic character is illustrated in one moment of the film when the crew joins Ben in his activities. It's a clever but predictable turn of events that highlights how inclined we are to feel sympathy for villainous characters, which lead me to the most important point. The movie brilliantly reveals the darkest side or our human sadistic nature, because in one scene, it reaches such a level of violence than we stop finding cool. The movie breaks its point, the charm ends, and the horror finally appears. At this point, we feel guilty for having enjoyed the film. In the final Act, the Black Comedy is dethroned by a very dark climax. It's dark but necessary, because it's cathartic. Violence is not cool, nor fun. I felt guilty at the end, and this is one of the few violent films that made me feel that way.Man Bites Dog is an offensive, brutal, violent, sometimes unwatchable, but most of the time hilarious, masterpiece of Black Comedy, working like a clever mix of Henry the Portrait of a Serial Killer and This is Spinal Tap. It features one of the funniest scenes you'll ever see, with a clever use of meta-humor. A movie I recommend to watch, especially in those days, where violence and humiliations became so banal, we don't even care, where the multiplication of TV reality shows and voyeurism fed a kind of sadistic pleasure to watch people suffer.The movie will make you question your own morality.

Two years later, the studios looked back on everything that worked with it's previous film and decided to ignore it, and lo...INSURRECTION was created. To ensure action and fun were kept to a minimum, the film centers on a race known as the Ba'ku, who live on a planet where the radiation in it's rings acts as a fountain of youth. The Federation has partnered with another race, the Son'a, to relocate the Ba'ku from their planet to acquire it's youth-giving properties. The Federation, represented by Vice-Admiral Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe), seek to use the planet's powers to aid billions of other people in the galaxy while the Son'a, led by Ad'har Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), have their own motives. Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise find themselves caught in the middle of this moral quandary and soon side with the Ba'ku, going against Federation orders to see to it the Ba'ku remain on their planet.There really isn't a lot to get excited about with this film. As I'd mentioned, the story finds Picard and his crew faced with a moral question previously approached in STAR TREK II and STAR TREK III do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few? Whereas II and III made an exciting multi-feature adventure out of the topic, INSURRECTION gives us two hours that feel as if it could've easily been compressed down to an hour and used as an average episode of the series. Credit is due for the fantastic special effects that continue to evolve with each film, and the space sequences in this movie look better than ever. Some of the ground-based effects don't hold up as well, particularly the Son'a drones used in the middle of the film. One thing can be said for the franchise...they know how to cast a villain. It's one thing that nearly every STAR TREK film (even the bad ones) can seem to do right. F. Murray Abraham, who I'm surprised even agreed to appear in this film, is great as the leader of the Son'a who manipulates the Federation into assisting him in his personal quest against the Ba'ku. Anthony Zerbe does an equally good job as the Starfleet Vice-Admiral whose intentions are good but fails to understand that it's wrong to force an entire race (even if it's only 600 people) to relocate.From the moment the opening credits began rolling, I knew this film was going to be trouble. Whereas the credits of previous films in the franchise have epic music and great visuals as the vast is introduced, the opening credits here look cheap and tacked on as if the budget ran out before they were considered. I was also bothered because the film took on such a light-hearted, goofy tone. Goofiness is all right if used correctly; FIRST CONTACT had some humorous moments in the Cochrane portion of the plot. Here, the laughs are practically center-stage. The film is loaded with corny moments as the crew begins to feel the effects of the planet's radiation Worf has a zit, Riker and Troi act like horny teenagers, and Picard does the mambo. And when the film isn't trying to make us laugh, it's focusing on a romantic subplot between Picard and Anij (Donna Murphy), a 300-year-old Ba'ku who reminds Picard what it is to feel young again.

From Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) onwards those with a pacifist message were not uncommon. However, none were quite so harrowing or so bleak as this 1966 adaptation of the Richard McKenna novel The Sand Pebbles.The movie follows the book closely, and as such is rich with subplot in a way that few motion pictures are. Those subplots are crucial to the impact of the whole. Time and again we are lead to believe this will be some uplifting tale of the underdogs triumphing and interracial harmony &#x96; for example Steve McQueen and Mako's working friendship or Richard Attenborough's romance with Marayat Andrienne &#x96; only to see the story take another shockingly dark turn and have all hopes dashed.This was a pet project for producer-director Robert Wise, one he had worked hard to get off the ground and would later look back on as one of his proudest achievements. He brings it to the screen with his usual touch for flow and rhythm, with sudden shifts in tone, from frenzied action and rapid editing in another to languid long shots in another. We have on one hand the utter simplicity of the scene in which McQueen and Candice Bergen get to know each other on their steamer voyage &#x96; just two opposing shots, the river as a backdrop, the actors motionless as they speak their dialogue. Compare that to the boxing match between Mako and Simon Oakland, a quick-fire bout of agonising close-ups of contenders and crowd. The differences are not simply a case of editing and movement, but also the amount of business in the background, the distance the camera is from the action, and sometimes even the lighting and colour. And Wise doesn't call attention to the changes with sudden jolts &#x96; tension is built up gradually before giving way to scenes more tranquil.Of particular note here is the set decoration. Of course, the story necessarily takes place in a series of small and squalid spaces &#x96; the bowels of the ship where McQueen works, the brothel where the men spend their shore leave &#x96; but it is the incredible production design by Boris Leven that makes it all so desolate. The interiors have rough, grey walls and small dirty windows, even the small chapel where the wedding takes place, which in spite of the scene has to be one of the most depressing sets ever made.Tough action heroes like Steve McQueen may achieve stardom but they aren't normally praised for their acting skills. However The Sand Pebbles brings out something very deep in McQueen. He seems totally in tune with the picture's moodiness, bringing a lot of wordless emotion to his laconic character. At one point he breaks down in tears while shovelling coal; the camera is to his back but the moment is all as it should be in his body language. Another great but often overlooked player here is Simon Oakland. Oakland was great when you needed a small part with a lot of impact (see him at the end of Psycho for example) and was often a levelheaded authority figure. Less often was he cast as the bully, but he makes a decent job of it, being both threatening and repugnant. I'm less enthusiastic about Richard Attenborough's performance. For one thing he isn't right for the uniform &#x96; he looks like a little boy in a sailor suit &#x96; and for another he isn't right for the American accent, unless he was doing it as some kind of cultural revenge for Dick van Dyke's appalling attempt at being a cockney in Mary Poppins.The Sand Pebbles is undoubtedly one of bleakest war movies ever made, but what is so different about it is not its anti-imperialist stance or even its downbeat mood. It is the fact that the US forces are shown to lose control of the situation. It was one of the great ironies with anti-war films like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket that apparently some youngsters were actually inspired to join the marines after seeing them. However I cannot imagine The Sand Pebbles having anyone rushing down to their nearest Navy recruitment office. Even though it does not exactly condemn servicemen or even the armed forces, it makes armed service look about as glamorous as cleaning a sewer. And rather than portraying the Americans as a conquering force &#x96; for good or bad &#x96; it shows them as lost, isolated and overwhelmed. There will be no cavalry riding to the rescue this time. And it creates this impression without ever losing respect for its principle characters, whom we are lead to pity rather than condemn.

From Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) onwards those with a pacifist message were not uncommon. However, none were quite so harrowing or so bleak as this 1966 adaptation of the Richard McKenna novel The Sand Pebbles.The movie follows the book closely, and as such is rich with subplot in a way that few motion pictures are. Those subplots are crucial to the impact of the whole. Time and again we are lead to believe this will be some uplifting tale of the underdogs triumphing and interracial harmony &#x96; for example Steve McQueen and Mako's working friendship or Richard Attenborough's romance with Marayat Andrienne &#x96; only to see the story take another shockingly dark turn and have all hopes dashed.This was a pet project for producer-director Robert Wise, one he had worked hard to get off the ground and would later look back on as one of his proudest achievements. He brings it to the screen with his usual touch for flow and rhythm, with sudden shifts in tone, from frenzied action and rapid editing in another to languid long shots in another. We have on one hand the utter simplicity of the scene in which McQueen and Candice Bergen get to know each other on their steamer voyage &#x96; just two opposing shots, the river as a backdrop, the actors motionless as they speak their dialogue. Compare that to the boxing match between Mako and Simon Oakland, a quick-fire bout of agonising close-ups of contenders and crowd. The differences are not simply a case of editing and movement, but also the amount of business in the background, the distance the camera is from the action, and sometimes even the lighting and colour. And Wise doesn't call attention to the changes with sudden jolts &#x96; tension is built up gradually before giving way to scenes more tranquil.Of particular note here is the set decoration. Of course, the story necessarily takes place in a series of small and squalid spaces &#x96; the bowels of the ship where McQueen works, the brothel where the men spend their shore leave &#x96; but it is the incredible production design by Boris Leven that makes it all so desolate. The interiors have rough, grey walls and small dirty windows, even the small chapel where the wedding takes place, which in spite of the scene has to be one of the most depressing sets ever made.Tough action heroes like Steve McQueen may achieve stardom but they aren't normally praised for their acting skills. However The Sand Pebbles brings out something very deep in McQueen. He seems totally in tune with the picture's moodiness, bringing a lot of wordless emotion to his laconic character. At one point he breaks down in tears while shovelling coal; the camera is to his back but the moment is all as it should be in his body language. Another great but often overlooked player here is Simon Oakland. Oakland was great when you needed a small part with a lot of impact (see him at the end of Psycho for example) and was often a levelheaded authority figure. Less often was he cast as the bully, but he makes a decent job of it, being both threatening and repugnant. I'm less enthusiastic about Richard Attenborough's performance. For one thing he isn't right for the uniform &#x96; he looks like a little boy in a sailor suit &#x96; and for another he isn't right for the American accent, unless he was doing it as some kind of cultural revenge for Dick van Dyke's appalling attempt at being a cockney in Mary Poppins.The Sand Pebbles is undoubtedly one of bleakest war movies ever made, but what is so different about it is not its anti-imperialist stance or even its downbeat mood. It is the fact that the US forces are shown to lose control of the situation. It was one of the great ironies with anti-war films like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket that apparently some youngsters were actually inspired to join the marines after seeing them. However I cannot imagine The Sand Pebbles having anyone rushing down to their nearest Navy recruitment office. Even though it does not exactly condemn servicemen or even the armed forces, it makes armed service look about as glamorous as cleaning a sewer. And rather than portraying the Americans as a conquering force &#x96; for good or bad &#x96; it shows them as lost, isolated and overwhelmed. There will be no cavalry riding to the rescue this time. And it creates this impression without ever losing respect for its principle characters, whom we are lead to pity rather than condemn. It shows war not as hell or as mass murder, but as bitter human tragedy.

Though I did find myself admiring Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglass) it wasn't because Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) was poorly done in any way. Rather it was because of the superb job both the film and Douglass did in bringing to life the wonderful character of Gordon Gekko.Bud Fox is a low level Wall Street broker that works the phones at an investment firm, trying to sell stocks to investors. Knowing that he won't get rich doing so, Fox also tirelessly pursues the big fish, like Gordon Gekko, trying to prove he is more than just another stock broker working the pits. After months of trying, Fox finally gets 5 minutes with Gekko. Gekko is unimpressed with Fox until he reveals he has inside information about the outcome of an airline lawsuit. Thus begins the tutelage of the young and slightly naive Fox by the crafty cynic, Gordon Gekko. It's a wild ride that is a blast to be a part of but ultimately Fox and Gekko part ways and become bitter rivals in a contest that can only end with the destruction of one.Too often the corporate banker\/investor\/CEO is portrayed in a one dimensional, cookie cutter fashion in Hollywood (see Avatar). Greedy, soulless, and completely without any vestige of humanity or decency (see Captain Planet villains, and Avatar again) they exist as plot points but not as characters. Gordon Gekko is greedy, to be certain, but in the defining moment of his character he defends himself saying, Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. He goes on to eloquently state his case to the shareholders of a company to convince them to go along with his plan to buy it, all the while secretly planning to screw them over, such is the world of high-stakes Wall Street investments. Oliver Stone might have been trying to make an ant-capitalist movie, but only succeeded in creating a capitalist icon that inspired a generation of Wall Street sharks.

This is such a film, startling, very uncomfortable and gruesome, agreed, but also intrepidly sincere, and so well acted that for most of the film I discarded any compulsory spectator aloofness and purely gazed as if I were scrutinizing the lives of real people. This harsh, lingering peep into the human condition converges four people who are, by themselves, quite identifiable types. However, while a usual Hollywood treatment of this material would just hook them up to a plot, this film compels them to really contend with each other, so that we see a clash between watchers who are fascinated by violence providing it's at intimacy-excluding distance, and those who are indeed ready and willing to inflict it.This visually classy, thematically spine-chilling movie familiarizes us with two couples. Brian and Carrie are well-dressed, striving yuppies. Early and Adele are abject trailer trash. Brian is a writer with an concentration on serial killers. Carrie is a photographer of large-scale, highly stylized black-and-white close-ups of frank sexuality and brutal acts. She has a subdued, plain-speaking voice and an austere objectivity. They want to move to California, and Brian proposes a cross-country tour of the locations of famous killings. She can snap the shots, he can record the wording, and they can finally churn out a book. Early and Adele, played by Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis in two of the most traumatic and nerve-shaking performances I've ever seen, live in a disheveled rented trailer. He's on parole. She's a slack-jawed child-woman who replicates lines that feel as if to have been poorly gathered from TV. The property-owner is on their case about the rent.Pitt breaks this character open with an alarming awareness of deranged conceit, aggressively challenging the TeenBeat coverboy impression against which every heartthrob actor seems to have to prove himself. But it's Lewis who leaves you trembling after a handful of mesmerizing monologues, the descent of her character, and just the pure, tragic naivete she evokes in her use of her voice, face and body. There are even moments where she leaves the loudest silences between her line and the next character's, during a precious few of which I actually felt like I understood something about the harshest realities of the harm society's dregs and failures inflict on themselves.Brian and Carrie need someone to go halves with for their trip. They put up a bulletin. Early sees it and resolves it's time to take off for Cali with Adele. Needless to say, that's a parole violation, but no matter. Most of the film is set on the road, as the writer and photographer little by little become alert to the temperament of the people who are splitting the drive. It's here that the movie shows its magnitude. A lesser film would probably be a thriller in which the protagonists would frantically plot to flee the killers in their company. This genuinely shocking voyage into psychosis is much more shrewd. It's about the extraordinary attraction that we feel for those who appear tougher and more real. Generally we who idealize in that manner have never had to confront anyone who harms others merely for amusement.There's a profound class disparity between the two couples, between nouveau riche activewear and oily hair, slapdash tattoos and reeking socks. And between a feminist a girl who remarks peculiarly that she's not allowed by her man to smoke, drink or curse. The conspicuous consumers, however, with their noninterventionist' disinclination to demonstrate incivility, attempt to tolerate these two outsiders and to make concessions for their actions.A particular attachment even develops between Brian and Early. Brian, for instance, has never shot a gun. Early has. Brian is spellbound by Early's gun, Carrie petrified. Early lets him shoot out some windows in an derelict factory, and Brian is like a kid with a Tonka truck. It's also exhilarating when the two guys go out drinking one night, and when a guy in the bar picks on Brian, Early intervenes and kicks the guy nearly to death.The violent redneck is not slow, and has a better impression of the urban intellectual than vice versa. As Carrie steadily learns that Early hits Adele and is likely psychotic, Brian is being somewhat enticed by Early's anarchy. Not that he wants to join in, of course. But it's a high to be so near it. Increasingly, by measured, plausible steps, director Dominic Sena and writer Tim Metcalfe expose to Brian and Carrie the complete actuality of the circumstances they've gotten themselves into. Here's a bourgeois couple who thought it would be a kick to re-examine the scenes of murders, and of all the darnedest things they find themselves with a real murderer, right in the same car, and it isn't pleasurable. Not by any means.Sena went on to helm the very sorts of empty-calorie ultra-modern Hollywood kitsch to which this film is a refreshing exception, but he demonstrates the sort of powerful skill with material here that we see in other breakthrough films such as Lumet, Friedkin and Scorsese's early work, McNaughton's Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, Aronofsky's Pi or Requiem, Clooney's Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Mendes' American Beauty. The tension and anxiety remove the seeds from a jalapeno. The characters stay convincing; we have a divergence of personalities, not pigeonholes. The action synchronizes impeccably with the implications.It's overall too self-deceptively reassuring to accept as true that people require encouragement to maim and murder. Some people, the movie imparts, are just malicious. They deficient in all moral compass and intrinsic compassion. And nobody's whispering in their ear or twisting their arm to do what they do.

It's also exhilarating when the two guys go out drinking one night, and when a guy in the bar picks on Brian, Early intervenes and kicks the guy nearly to death.The violent redneck is not slow, and has a better impression of the urban intellectual than vice versa. As Carrie steadily learns that Early hits Adele and is likely psychotic, Brian is being somewhat enticed by Early's anarchy. Not that he wants to join in, of course. But it's a high to be so near it. Increasingly, by measured, plausible steps, director Dominic Sena and writer Tim Metcalfe expose to Brian and Carrie the complete actuality of the circumstances they've gotten themselves into. Here's a bourgeois couple who thought it would be a kick to re-examine the scenes of murders, and of all the darnedest things they find themselves with a real murderer, right in the same car, and it isn't pleasurable. Not by any means.Sena went on to helm the very sorts of empty-calorie ultra-modern Hollywood kitsch to which this film is a refreshing exception, but he demonstrates the sort of powerful skill with material here that we see in other breakthrough films such as Lumet, Friedkin and Scorsese's early work, McNaughton's Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, Aronofsky's Pi or Requiem, Clooney's Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Mendes' American Beauty. The tension and anxiety remove the seeds from a jalapeno. The characters stay convincing; we have a divergence of personalities, not pigeonholes. The action synchronizes impeccably with the implications.It's overall too self-deceptively reassuring to accept as true that people require encouragement to maim and murder. Some people, the movie imparts, are just malicious. They deficient in all moral compass and intrinsic compassion. And nobody's whispering in their ear or twisting their arm to do what they do.
