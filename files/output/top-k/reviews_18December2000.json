[{"date":"18 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Rushmore is undeniably one of the paramount achievements in modern film. It takes a somewhat trite  `coming of age' story to the next level by incorporating a dry and darkly comic edge, exposing the melancholy behind youthful innocence and hopeless romanticism. This is accomplished primarily through the surreal maturity found in its young characters, but also with the tenderly problematic older ones. Overall, Rushmore dispenses a gloomy charm, as the events of the film constantly teeter over failure, yet remain focused on fanciful dreams of success. The result is the ability of the audience to overlook disappointment and cherish the love of creation to love the actual process of achievement, no matter how impossible or unattainable the ends may seem. In essence, Rushmore illustrates a new love for life, questioning whether one can ignore consequences in spite of the trivial pursuit of fun and invention. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Rushmore is undeniably one of the paramount achievements in modern film.
