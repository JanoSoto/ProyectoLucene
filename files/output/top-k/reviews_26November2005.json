That does not happen often, particularly for a film that I was late seeing and therefore had tons of preconceived notions. I was pleased with how well they established the basic premise of the film at the beginning as, something that had seemed silly in the trailers was perfectly credible in the actual film. The $95 Million U.S. box office must have happened from word-of-mouth because the trailer simply does not do the film justice.There were only minor plot holes, although the lame way that Meg and her daughter initially got into the panic room almost derailed the whole thing. And I still find it inconceivable that $48 Million had to be spent on what is really a very small film. Since so little of the budget ever makes it onto the screen they would have been better served with the creative incentive of a smaller budget.Nicole Kidman was originally cast to play Meg but hurt her knee and had to drop out. I don't think they lost anything by bringing in Jodie Foster, I can't imagine Kidman doing any better, Meg's kind of brainy stubborn scrapper is Foster's specialty. And she is much better from a physical casting perspective as Kristen Stewart looks like she could actually be Foster's daughter. In fact, there were more that a few times when I momentarily got the two of them confused. This was very appropriate because Panic Room's heroines are not the usual film-fare mother and daughter (one strong and one weak), but rather a like mother-like daughter situation. I think Stewart has a great future in films (see Speak for a example of her ability to carry a whole feature) and it was nice that she got a chance so early in her career to work closely with Foster. I was particularly impressed with the pacing of this story and its similarity to chess masters hiding one line of attack inside another. The battle progresses much like a chess match, as pieces are lost the layout becomes less familiar and the alternatives fewer. As the two sides use up resources and get sucked in deeper, their earlier choices limit the choices that are available to them. This chess-like process holds until the very end of the film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

'Se7en' is mind-blowing. 'Fight Club' is quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. 'Panic Room', while not as excellent, is still a highly entertaining thriller. Well, there is also 'Alien 3'. I saw it a long time ago and all I remember is that it takes place in a prison this time. As if Ripley hadn't had enough already. I'm pretty sure I liked it, though. I was... twelve? I liked almost everything then. But it's perfectly likely that the movie is genuinely good on its own. I just don't remember. Anyway, I think 'Alien 3' can be safely excluded from the count. IMDb claims that Fincher left the production early owing to a conflict with the studio and practically disowned the movie.So, 'Se7en', 'Fight Club' and 'Panic Room'. Three high scores. 75% of Fincher's whole filmography. It wasn't much of a leap to presume that his only movie that I had NOT seen yet, would be just as good. The higher the expectations, the more bitter the disappointment. Fincher won't have it easy to earn my trust back. 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club' are still brilliant, nothing will ever change that, but the implicit faith I had in the man took a very hard blow.Actually I can't really say that it's such a bad movie. It's far far away from the disasters of 'Elektra' or 'Battlefield Earth' calibre (there are probably oodles of non-sf and non-comic-book bad movies but I pointedly avoid any contact with them; I'm a science-fiction junkie so I'm willing to see it even at its absolute lowest, but when other genres are concerned, my standards are still in fully working order). So far away, that it might as well be in a different galaxy. It's never boring. There is the always-present tension, definitely Fincher's forte. Michael Douglas is unquestionably well-suited for the role and holds his own quite nicely. The premise of such thorough manipulation of reality and how said manipulation can make a remarkably intelligent and successful man completely lose his bearing and start operating almost solely on instinct, is certainly noteworthy.It doesn't change the fact, that 'The Game' is one of the most irritating movies that I've ever seen. The plot is so ridiculously far-fetched, the stunt brought to such absurd level, that the movie has totally no credibility.The Game, an extraordinarily complicated and actually life-threatening role play, is based only on a personality test. Sorry, but I just don't buy it. Granted, it's a very comprehensive personality test, but even giving it the benefit of doubt and kindly assuming that such accurate analysis and resulting behaviour predictions are possible, there are also some environmental factors, depending purely on coincidence, that simply cannot be controlled. What if Michael Douglas decided to jump off the roof from a place five metres to the left? It looked exactly the same. Well, not that it really matters so much, I'm still lost at the personality test stage.Besides the scale of the whole show is completely unbelievable. It involves dozens of people. It requires assistance from various institutions, even those of public service (like the embassy in Mexico). Breaking into the main character's house and vandalizing it, staging his killing his own brother, manipulating the TV transmissions, it all seem much too extreme to be meant just for amusement. It would be much more plausible if the mysterious SRC (CRS?) company was really after Micheal Douglas' lots and lots of millions. A colossal amount of money is the only thing that I could imagine to possibly make people go to such lengths. OK, they drew a very impressive bill at the end, but it was surely nowhere near the size of main character's bank account.Then ending is undoubtedly surprising, but not in a good way. The happy-end seems forced. It doesn't really fit. It certainly is the least lousy option for Micheal Douglas, but it's destructive for the movie. It's as if the air suddenly came out of the figurative balloon. You feel bewildered, cheated and slightly outraged, that the fun has ended too soon and not how it supposed to.The last half an hour is by far the most annoying part of the movie. The plot executes a shocking twist every five minutes, completely changing the whole perspective and leaving the audience just as dumbstruck as the main character must feel. That's probably the result Fincher was going for - to befuddle the audience totally and without mercy. It's really effective, I have to give him that. It's just that every time the story made a sudden swerve in an entirely new direction, I kept expecting Fincher to just jump on screen, yell 'Fooled you AGAIN!' and start cackling evilly. I can't say that it was a particularly pleasant feeling. Made the badness of the ending hit even harder. Shame on you, Fincher.Now it's just Tarantino left. Four movies, four wins. My only constant in the movie universe. Oh oh wait, there's Darren Aronofsky, too. So perhaps the world isn't such a dark and hopeless place, after all. Quite a relief, actually.

At the cursory glance, it's a typical movie about a hero struggling with his awakening powers. Just like any other comic-book story. The difference is, it doesn't feel like a comic-book story. The movie doesn't have the right atmosphere, has no flashiness at all, no fantastic events. All in all, it has no comic-book accessories. It is basically about the same thing as 'Spiderman' but gives a totally different impression. Only Shyamalan could make a comic-book story look like a gritty human drama. You really have to admire the man. Then again, there's The Moment. Never since 'A.I.' could I pinpoint the very scene, where the movie takes the turn in a completely wrong direction, with such certainty. Only, 'A.I' went bad and kept on going even badder, while 'Unbreakable' managed to recuperate at least some of the losses and strike again with an interesting, if pretty bizarre, ending. It was the last desperate attempt to redeem itself but the harm could not really be undone. When such things like The Moment happen, they stay happened forever.The Moment, actually, doesn't last more than three minutes. Three paltry minutes that somehow spoil all the other 103 minutes around them. Ironically, if the scene was slightly edited, 'Unbreakable' would turn into the great movie that the beginning promised. Even the ending would make more sense. With a few small changes in one single scene, 'Unbreakable' would be one of the best movies I've ever seen. What is that bitter taste in my mouth? Is it disappointment? The strongest point of the first hour of the movie, e.g. the good part, is its ambiguity. We can't know for sure that Bruce Willis is really all that special. He was the sole survivor of a terrible catastrophe, but he could just have had extraordinary luck. He discovers that he can lift two times more weight than before, but he could simply be a very strong guy, who wasn't aware of his own physical potential. He lifted the car to save his girlfriend, but people are capable of seemingly impossible feats if the life of their loved ones is on the line. We don't have any conclusive proof that it was all caused by some supernatural factor. The narrative is strictly subjective. We are never quite sure that Samuel L. Jackson's far-fetched theory is something more than wishful thinking.Then comes The Moment. Bruce Willis goes among people, gets a couple of low-res highly detailed visions, that could under no circumstances be given natural explanation, and all the intriguing uncertainty is suddenly lost. Bruce Willis goes after a bad guy and saves the day, half-drowning on the way. He joins the ranks of Superman, Spiderman and, uhm... that's really not my field of expertise. Ironman? Anyway, he becomes a true hero. As the immediate consequence, the movie stops being interesting.Without The Moment the ending would have been brilliant. 'Unbreakable' would have been a movie about a fanatic, who tries to force the world to play along with his insane ideas. Who, on his mission to make his vision real, disregards completely human lives. A beautiful case of megalomania. Also an excellent example of the force of conviction. He actually succeeds in creating his hero, the hero that he thinks himself destined to counterpart. An ordinary, gentle, peaceful man rises to the occasion, manages to reach the level that the self-appointed villain designed for him. Only to learn that all the way he was manipulated by a self-righteous maniac. The irony so delightfully perverse, that it sends shivers down the spine.Only, it was not to be. Why, Shyamalan? Why didn't you see it? Why did you have to make The Moment instead and ruin everything? Did you jump into the puddle of triteness willingly or was it an unfortunate slip? That I will never know.After it becomes unmistakably clear that Bruce Willis is, indeed, a superhuman with psychic powers, the movie suddenly loses its momentum. The fact that the only action sequence of the movie, therefore supposedly the most entertaining one, is just around the corner, doesn't matter at all. It's not even a little bit exciting. Bruce Willis is indestructible now, for Pete's sake. Of course he's going to win. The hero in spandex always wins. That's one of the main rules of a comic-book story and the plot suddenly became one, so all the standards apply.What's even sadder, this way the ending feels definitely lacking. I called it 'interesting, if pretty bizarre' earlier. That's still truth. It's interesting, because it takes you by surprise and wraps up Samuel L. Jackson's character really nicely. It's bizarre, and not good-bizarre at that, because it doesn't fit as an ending. It doesn't bring closure, not for the main character. In the No-Moment imaginary version of the movie, it wouldn't be the problem, because the accents would shift, Bruce Willis wouldn't be the focus point any more. In the real-life version, he still is.

So sad, that thrashing it feels like kicking a lying man. In the balls. I'll be adamant, though. I'll thrash it anyway.I tried to look past my burning hatred for Adam Sandler movies. Either I didn't succeed to eliminate the tunnel vision or the movie is just that bad.The plot is harebrained. What happens in this movie is so not right, it's practically painful to watch. The ridiculousness and gleeful disregard for reality are high all the time but reach their absolute peak during the sham of a court trial at the end.I really hope that scene was intended to be a parody. It's not very clear as it makes a sharp turn towards melodrama at some point, but I'll be generous and give it a benefit of doubt.. I have nothing against parodies. I'm, in fact, a big fan. So there wouldn't be anything wrong with it being a parody, were it actually a funny parody. Or innovative parody. Or even, at the last resort, a pretty parody. Instead it was just a sorry parody. That particular brand should be punishable by law.The characters are either ludicrous, like the hippie homeless guy Steve Buscemi, or bland, like the squeaky-sounding Lawyer Lady, who must have suffered some tragic head injury in the past, since she completely bypassed the normal female reaction to being hit on by Adam Sandler, that is franticly running away.The acting isn't particularly bad, but also nothing more than passable. Especially the kid actor wasn't a very good choice. Wait, kid actors, plural, the identical twins. Not that I noticed before the end credits. Most of the time, they come across as obnoxious rather than cute. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the intention. On the other hand, what can you expect from... five-?... six-year-olds? OK, I'm not impartial here. Doubly so. It's not only an Adam Sandler movie. It's a kid movie, too. With a real kid, not just an Adam Sandler character. I didn't like kid movies even when I was a kid myself. Actually, I didn't like kids, too. Still don't. The movies like 'Big Daddy' certainly won't make me change my mind. They only confirm me in my conviction that children are stupid annoying little monsters that should be kept doped till they reach 16. Perhaps that's a little extreme, but I never believed in half-measures.All in all, 'Big Daddy' is an unfunny, disgusting movie. Well, as it fits into a category that I privately call a physiological comedy, it couldn't be any different. I never understood the 'charm' of the humour focusing on pissing, vomiting, spitting and other situations involving bodily fluids, and that is the only sort of humour you can find here. The fact that the main character and the kid bond over urinating in public is wrong on so many levels, that, I think, it'll be better if I just stop thinking about it. Does male bonding really look like that? Really? I'm going to ignore the gross trick with spit that the kid does at some point to impress the adoring audience, because if I don't then I won't be able to stop wondering whether it's actually physically possible. And I don't want to do that.Then, there's the thing with the main character himself. Well, not only one, but I have to prioritize. He's supposed to be one of those simple, good-hearted characters, that the viewers just can't help not to love. My impression is, he's a despicable, vulgar, moronic parasite with anger management problem and an abominable concept of hygiene. Against all reason I hoped he'll go to jail after all. No such luck, of course.Oh, and the pansy lawyers. The ones that hug a lot, make puppy eyes at each other and, generally, are less manly than the main character's squeaky girlfriend. It shouldn't come as such a surprise anymore. but it still gets to me when I see that stereotype. It pisses me off to no end, which is a bit weird as I'm not a gay man myself. Or even a man, actually. Fortunately, the unofficial rule that gay men can be portrayed only as flaming queens or psychos, is slowly becoming just a matter of historical interest. Dumb comedies are always the last to catch on.I admit I'm angry. Mainly because I had to watch that monstrosity all the way to its senseless end. Frankly, I didn't even want to start. I'd have preferred to stay blissfully unaware as to how really bad it is. However, Lady Fortune felt particularly sadistic that day. I was at my friend's place, without really announcing my visit first, crashed the movie night, it wasn't my choice. I had to swallow my pride and suck it up. Cruel, the life is.

So sad, that thrashing it feels like kicking a lying man. In the balls. I'll be adamant, though. I'll thrash it anyway.I tried to look past my burning hatred for Adam Sandler movies. Either I didn't succeed to eliminate the tunnel vision or the movie is just that bad.The plot is harebrained. What happens in this movie is so not right, it's practically painful to watch. The ridiculousness and gleeful disregard for reality are high all the time but reach their absolute peak during the sham of a court trial at the end.I really hope that scene was intended to be a parody. It's not very clear as it makes a sharp turn towards melodrama at some point, but I'll be generous and give it a benefit of doubt.. I have nothing against parodies. I'm, in fact, a big fan. So there wouldn't be anything wrong with it being a parody, were it actually a funny parody. Or innovative parody. Or even, at the last resort, a pretty parody. Instead it was just a sorry parody. That particular brand should be punishable by law.The characters are either ludicrous, like the hippie homeless guy Steve Buscemi, or bland, like the squeaky-sounding Lawyer Lady, who must have suffered some tragic head injury in the past, since she completely bypassed the normal female reaction to being hit on by Adam Sandler, that is franticly running away.The acting isn't particularly bad, but also nothing more than passable. Especially the kid actor wasn't a very good choice. Wait, kid actors, plural, the identical twins. Not that I noticed before the end credits. Most of the time, they come across as obnoxious rather than cute. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the intention. On the other hand, what can you expect from... five-?... six-year-olds? OK, I'm not impartial here. Doubly so. It's not only an Adam Sandler movie. It's a kid movie, too. With a real kid, not just an Adam Sandler character. I didn't like kid movies even when I was a kid myself. Actually, I didn't like kids, too. Still don't. The movies like 'Big Daddy' certainly won't make me change my mind. They only confirm me in my conviction that children are stupid annoying little monsters that should be kept doped till they reach 16. Perhaps that's a little extreme, but I never believed in half-measures.All in all, 'Big Daddy' is an unfunny, disgusting movie. Well, as it fits into a category that I privately call a physiological comedy, it couldn't be any different. I never understood the 'charm' of the humour focusing on pissing, vomiting, spitting and other situations involving bodily fluids, and that is the only sort of humour you can find here. The fact that the main character and the kid bond over urinating in public is wrong on so many levels, that, I think, it'll be better if I just stop thinking about it. Does male bonding really look like that? Really? I'm going to ignore the gross trick with spit that the kid does at some point to impress the adoring audience, because if I don't then I won't be able to stop wondering whether it's actually physically possible. And I don't want to do that.Then, there's the thing with the main character himself. Well, not only one, but I have to prioritize. He's supposed to be one of those simple, good-hearted characters, that the viewers just can't help not to love. My impression is, he's a despicable, vulgar, moronic parasite with anger management problem and an abominable concept of hygiene. Against all reason I hoped he'll go to jail after all.

But this time I saw the whole thing. I just popped in the tape and watched the whole thing two weeks after I recorded it off of the AMC channel. Obviously there were commercials to fast forward through but I didn't care because whenever the movie would fade and go to a commercial, it kept me going wanting to press the two arrows pointing to the right (on the button). Every time a commercial would come, the suspense killed me! I could literally hear my heart thumping THUMP pause THUMP pause THUMP in the dead silence not even hearing the VCR fast forwarding. I actually wanted to fast forward through all the disgusting commercials. It was near Halloween when I recorded the movie meaning AMC had their traditional Monsterfest movies throughout the month of October. They showed the clip of the famous knife scene from the movie Carrie (Stephen King novel). Then showed the famous jumping scene from the John Carpenter classic Halloween. Then a not so famous scene from the very disgusting movie (I could tell because the person had no skin but just bones, blood, muscles showing) Hellbound Hellraiser II. That was one of the worst movies of all time besides the original Hellraiser. Stupid, Stupid! Other movie clips shown were Scream (1 and 2), Friday the 13, another clip from Carrie, and the horrible acted movie The Amityville Horror (original). Woops! I forgot! I need to be reviewing the movie. Let me shorten this a bit. This movie was basically trying to catch the notorious villain named Al Capone and the rest of his gang members. In the middle of trying to catch Al Capone and his gang members were many gruesome killings and many gunfights, and an interrogation. There was another very long scene where Kevin Costner's character Agent Elliot Ness has to help a lady bring her baby stroller and luggage up these steps to a train station but he also had to shoot some guys in the process. He shot a guy and then accidentally knocked the stroller over but his sidekick Andy Garcia's character Giuseppe Petri (Agent George Stone fake name) saves it just in time. This movie also includes a chase on rooftops of many buildings until finally a member of Capone's gang gets pushed off one of the building's rooftops. Okay, why did I like this movie so much? Well, mainly because Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors. I also think Kevin Costner and Robert DeNiro did a great job in this movie as well. Andy Garcia was okay in this and so was everyone else besides Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Robert DeNiro. I also thought the story was quite entertaining and suspenseful. The cinematography was excellent which was directed by Stephen H. Burum, A.S.C. and the music was also excellent which was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Ennio Morricone. Even though this movie was violent and had some blood and gore, that doesn't mean you can't see it. Since I had the cut version (taped from AMC which cuts out every little thing), it wasn't as bad as if I had the uncut version. I still thought it was violent but I could tell they cut out a few swear words. I know if a movie like this has a person that says darn or goodness or golly and has all this blood and gore, there is something wrong with the makers of the movie! Movie directed by Brian De Palma.

Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice. He did Buddy proud, as were the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played Holly's backup group, The Crickets.Music-wise, there are some of Holly's better-known songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa in their last concert ever. Busey not only sings like Holly, he's a dead ringer for him in the looks department. Some thing was the actor''s best performance ever, and you get no argument from me.I'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that Iowa concert, instead of dwelling on his tragic accident. The ending could have been a real downer, but they didn't let it be.

Sadly, Stone has the ability to pick some really human and moving stories and blow them up into gargantuan proportions to the point where it becomes nearly impossible to care about anyone or anything that is going on in the movie. Very few quality dramatic films have been done on the topic of professional football (BRIAN'S SONG and NUMBER ONE come to mind)and I don't why this is the case. It seems to me that the world of professional football would be rife with dramatic possibilities and it's nice that Stone recognized this; however, he as attempted to tell this story on such a large scale that the film-goer just gets bored with trying to keep up with all the stories and all the characters. I think if Stone and the screenwriter had chosen to be a little more economical with the screenplay an focused it on two or three of the stronger stories\/characters, this film would have worked much better; however, as is, the film is too busy and there is just way too much going on...Al Pacino as the past-his-prime coach butting heads with new owner Cameron Diaz (badly miscast IMO)...Jamie Foxx as the up and coming quarterback who gets a swelled head...James Woods as the team doctor with the questionable code of ethics butting heads with his idealistic assistant Matthew Modine...Lawrence Taylor as the defensive player so obsessed with getting the yards he needs for endorsements his risks his life...Dennis Quaid as the quarterback coming face to face with the mortality of being a quarterback...Lauren Holly and Lela Rochon showing two different sides of being a football wife and it just goes on and on and on...Stone has assembled an impressive Spot the Star type cast but unfortunately has given them precious little to do. Pacino has his moments, but his performance mostly consists of a lot of unmotivated screaming and yelling and over the top drunk scenes. Lawrence Taylor and LL Cool J seem to be competing for the Which is Worse Award?- Football player turned actor or Rapper turned actor. Former NFL and movie legend Jim Brown adds a touch of class to the proceedings as the defensive coach and John C, McGinley (SCRUBS) has some genuinely funny moments as a sardonic sports columnist, but Jamie Foxx easily walks away with the film with his charismatic turn as Willie Beamen. Foxx completely invests in this character, who is not painted in shades of black and white, and makes you care about him nonetheless, a performance which was a definite precursor to RAY. I think if Stone had economized his screenplay, re-thought some of his casting, and tightened the direction, this movie could have been something really special.

There are numerous memorable scenes, some of them involving some downright shocking violence, even for today's movies. However, the amount of violence is less than what you see today.The movie also sports an interesting twist near the end involving the two major characters, played by Robert De Niro and James Woods. The story is not always clear, either, so be prepared to be possibly confused about a few things....at least on the first viewing. Confused or not, this film always is fascinating to view, especially with intense actors such as the two men just mentioned, along with Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Joe Pecsi, Burt Young, Treat Williams and more.The child actors in here take up almost half the movie and are excellent.

She was 12 years old in this film and was already alluring.This is Godfather-type crime movie that ranks right up there with that famous film, not taking a back seat to it at all. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"26 November 2005","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Most movies, like most novels and musical compositions, have a beginning, a middle, and an end. But a gifted, creative director\/writer such as Quentin Tarantino can convolute time and come out with a new kind of animal. And look what James Joyce and the stream of consciousness writers such as William Faulkner did with time in their works. Another great movie Momentum did it all backwards, starting at the end and ending at the beginning and it worked like magic. When I first rented Pulp Fiction when it was first released on VHS I watched it late at night and fell asleep right after the Jack Rabbit Slim sequence. When I awoke the story was back on the hit scene with Vincent and Jules still talking about quarter pounders and Big Macs. I thought the tape had rewound itself and so turned off the player. I didn't finish the movie until a few months later. Then I realized Tarantino was merely playing with time. In lesser hands Pulp Fiction would be too episodic, but Tarantino makes it all work. In the end we have a happy closing knowing that tragedy lies ahead because we have already seen that part in the middle.Vincent and Jules have to be the most garrulous hit men ever to appear in the cinema. They are debating the difference between oral sex and giving a lady a foot massage on their way to a kill. Jules, the spiritually misguided soul, continues to rattle on until eventually told to shut up when they arrive at the cleaners. With Tarantino at the controls all this seems to fit in when the final play is made. This element could have easily degenerated into prattle.Although there are many other levels of interpretation, I see this film as mainly a farce filled with dark humor and pathos, not just a farce on gangster movies in general but on our brave new world, centered on urban decay, corruption, exploitation, and perversion, filled with raw sex, drugs, and violence. The relationship between Butch and his woman points to another direction of love, compassion, and fulfillment. Note also that Butch goes back to help the man who was out to kill him because his morals wouldn't let him leave Marsellus to the rapists just as they wouldn't let him throw a fight. The watch is symbolic of eternal values that rise above the glitter and garishness of the ephemeral. Going back for the watch could have cost Butch his life but it and the values it represents were more important to him. In the end these values win out. Even Vincent has moments of compassion and tenderness, especially when with Mia. Jules almost goes full circle, but the viewer is left with a feeling that he is not totally sincere in his awakening following his brief encounter with death. Butch and his woman seem to be the only two who are able to get completely free from sin city.Each decade has movies that define the era. Think of Rebel Without A Cause for the 1950's or Casablanca for the 1940's. For me Pulp Fiction defines the 90's. All the things that were wrong for America are touched on by Tarantino, yet he provides the means of escape to what America should be. The world of the 90's was almost like a cheap book, or a book of pulp fiction as such a work was called once upon a time, showing the underbelly of urban life but with a way out. There is an exit. Sartre's No Exit doesn't work here. Redemption is possible, hopefully a more lasting redemption than the one Jules claims to have discovered. All he really has is a suitcase with contents that glitter when opened. Butch has the watch with eternal values.Tarantino wisely uses surf music from the 60's to highlight the gritty life of beach bums, now street bums, who think of themselves as warlords and urban supermen...but, hey, it's all pulp fiction in the end.
