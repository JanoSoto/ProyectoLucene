The Best Years of Our Lives is a complex film in a sense that it is intricately honest about its political restraints and yet applies the same careful consideration to both the entertaining dramatic facade and underlying it social context.Running time of over 170 minutes turns The Best Years of Our Lives into a 'domestic epic'- film of subtle pleasures and intervening relationships focused on the mundane but extended into the proportions usually reserved for stories of much more grandiose scale. Yet initially balanced perspectives shift dangerously and for lengthy periods of time character of Homer is pushed into the background. Played by an actual disabled veteran, Homer adds a level of harsh realism that is unexpected for a Hollywood film of that period. All three veterans, levelled only briefly by a shared anxiety of returning to their families are constantly challenged by their different economical positioning, but strangely disproportionated by the narrative's momentum.Wyler's film reveals itself to be a melodrama, in most natural way evolving from the struggle for readjustment into a love affair and it thrives on sentimentality. This notion dominates the tone of the whole with a pleasurable alas predictable manner, leading to an ending that seems to be entirely satisfied with its shmalzy quality. Film is simply most comfortable in this familiar territory, once the obstacle of the controversy- Al's contradictory intentions at work, Fred's unemployment and Homer's disability become merely a set up. At one point Homer's sacrifice comes under blunt questioning but the villainous gentleman who dares to display his doubt is brutally dispatched- questionable necessity of war dismissed in favour of the future prosperity; an optimism of blindfolded conformity. This suspension of criticism is film's dominant mode.Staged and executed with precision, film utilizes, infamously, deep focus to achieve a level of undeniable verity. It is hard to dismiss it as only a technical nuisance and although one should be extremely careful to seek Bazinian inclinations of dominance in this particular form, The Best Years of Our Lives is a thoroughly impressive achievement. Depth of every shot provokes a curiosity that is often rewarded through reoccurring use of reflections and significant details that would otherwise require editing, disturbing film's considerate pace.Verdict It's a classic that is as enjoyable a movie now as it might have been in 1946 but even more interesting as a story of a significant compromise. One between the urge for reassessment in a mass medium not quite ready for this kind of impact and a story that could support the interest of a broad audience- disillusionment and patriotism. More a mark of its times than perhaps any other Classical Hollywood venture, The Best Years of Our Lives is an example of a film that lost none of its excellence and purely emotional impact even if it intellectually resonates in a rather underwhelming way.

The way I feel about classic Hollywood film, especially comedy, is that there is a certain magic about it, something that is able to reconcile the viewer with the world. I've never known exactly what it is -it may be the light-heartedness spirit that those movies convey, with their witty dialog, their absence of any kind of crudeness -or, in the case of dramas and action or adventure films, the moderation and prudence with which adult content was treated-, and the charisma, talent, and elegance of the Golden Era stars. Well, Charade is one of the quintessential representatives of all of the above.Charade is a delightful and very funny comedy, a sexy (for the time it was made) romance and a challenging suspenseful mystery that, yes, reminds of Alfred Hitchcock, and it gives you an idea of what could have come had Hitch and the exquisite Audrey Hepburn teamed up. Here, we already have her coupled up with one of Hitchcock's favorite male stars, Cary Grant, and the result couldn't have been better, for they make up one of the most exciting and in-tune on-screen couples. Add to the cast Walter Matthau, Charles Coburn and George Kennedy, and it can't possibly get very far from anyone's dream cast. Set the story in a beautifully photographed Paris, and voila, a glamorous, fast-paced, intelligent, and very funny film.In Charade, Audrey Hepburn, at the peak of her renowned beauty and her fame, plays Regina Lampert, who finds herself a widow upon returning to her Paris home -her husband has been murdered. She immediately gets a call from US Embassy representative Hamilton Bartholomew (Matthau), who requests that a quarter of a million dollars unlawfully kept by the late Mr Lampert be returned to the Government. But the US Government is not the only one that seeks Mrs Lampert, for she is soon chased after by three mysterious -and not at all friendly- men who were apparently in some kind of relation with her late husband. Only the attractive and nonchalant Peter Joshua (Grant) jumps in for her rescue. Lucky her... or is she?

Henry caught the gist of the novel and got it on screen, using the device of returning again and again to an airplane with a scene we don't fully see, showing us a little more each time, then fading to white as we get the voice over of the next scene. We get the circularity of the novel and the scattered sanity of Yossarian as he struggles to keep his shredded reality less tattered if not totally intact.The cast is incredible. Nichols gives us an all-star cast without the drivel of such disasters as A Bridge Too Far and The Longest Day. The cast includes Alan Arkin, Martin Balsam, Richard Benjamin, Buck Henry, Bob Newhart, Anthony Perkins, Paula Prentiss, Martin Sheen, John Voight, and Orson Welles, among many, many others.Henry had to make a movie out of the novel, so he made some hard choices, excising characters and situations that some find disappointing. My suggestion is to see the movie as the movie without comparing it to the book; on the other hand, I'm astounded at how well Henry captured the essence of Heller and his work. Jon Voight is chilling as Minderbinder, who is in my very humble opinion the lynchpin of the movie. When Minderbinder tells Yossarian, Then they'll understand, the full impact of World War II (and who's the real enemy) shatters Yossarian's weakening sanity.For me the end of the novel and the end of the movie are unsatisfying, but the ride is still worth it.Trivial notes concerning the people involved in the movie. Mike Nichols also directed The Graduate, with Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman. Charles Grodin (Arfy Aardvark) was supposed to play Benjamin, but couldn't agree on a salary with Nichols, so Bancroft suggest Dustin Hoffman to Nichols - she'd heard about Hoffman from her husband, Mel Brooks, who had just signed Hoffman for his movie The Producers. Hoffman bailed on Brooks and did The Graduate instead. Norman Fell (Sgt. Towser) played Benjamin's landlord in a short scene (also involving Richard Dreyfus) in The Graduate. Bob Balaban (Capt. Orr) was in Midnight Cowboy with Jon Voight (and Dustin Hoffman, of course). Buck Henry wrote a TV series for Richard Benjamin (Major Danby), who is married to Paula Prentiss (Nurse Duckett). Orson Welles (General Dreedle) did the voice-over narration for Mel Brooks's History of the World. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry developed Get Smart.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, War"},{"date":"10 April 2011","score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Directed by Mike Nichols, the screenplay by Buck Henry is totally brilliant. The novel by Joseph Heller is itself brilliantly written, with nuances and subtleties many readers miss. Henry caught the gist of the novel and got it on screen, using the device of returning again and again to an airplane with a scene we don't fully see, showing us a little more each time, then fading to white as we get the voice over of the next scene. We get the circularity of the novel and the scattered sanity of Yossarian as he struggles to keep his shredded reality less tattered if not totally intact.The cast is incredible. Nichols gives us an all-star cast without the drivel of such disasters as A Bridge Too Far and The Longest Day. The cast includes Alan Arkin, Martin Balsam, Richard Benjamin, Buck Henry, Bob Newhart, Anthony Perkins, Paula Prentiss, Martin Sheen, John Voight, and Orson Welles, among many, many others.Henry had to make a movie out of the novel, so he made some hard choices, excising characters and situations that some find disappointing. My suggestion is to see the movie as the movie without comparing it to the book; on the other hand, I'm astounded at how well Henry captured the essence of Heller and his work. Jon Voight is chilling as Minderbinder, who is in my very humble opinion the lynchpin of the movie. When Minderbinder tells Yossarian, Then they'll understand, the full impact of World War II (and who's the real enemy) shatters Yossarian's weakening sanity.For me the end of the novel and the end of the movie are unsatisfying, but the ride is still worth it.Trivial notes concerning the people involved in the movie. Mike Nichols also directed The Graduate, with Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman. Charles Grodin (Arfy Aardvark) was supposed to play Benjamin, but couldn't agree on a salary with Nichols, so Bancroft suggest Dustin Hoffman to Nichols - she'd heard about Hoffman from her husband, Mel Brooks, who had just signed Hoffman for his movie The Producers. Hoffman bailed on Brooks and did The Graduate instead. Norman Fell (Sgt. Towser) played Benjamin's landlord in a short scene (also involving Richard Dreyfus) in The Graduate. Bob Balaban (Capt. Orr) was in Midnight Cowboy with Jon Voight (and Dustin Hoffman, of course). Buck Henry wrote a TV series for Richard Benjamin (Major Danby), who is married to Paula Prentiss (Nurse Duckett). Orson Welles (General Dreedle) did the voice-over narration for Mel Brooks's History of the World. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry developed Get Smart. Bob Newhart (Major Major Major) and Peter Bonerz (Capt. McWatt) were in The Bob Newhart Show together. And Susanne Benton (Dreedle's WAC) had a completely unrelated role in the totally unrelated A Boy and his Dog. Hollywood is a small town. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, War"}]
