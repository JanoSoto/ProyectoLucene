Having experienced the films together as a single work, I now believe I was wrong to label the first two films good and the third bad. What's wrong with them is wrong all the way through, from the first one on, and only becomes more obvious in the third. It's true that Fellowship entertained me more than the others, and that The Two Towers satisfied me more completely, in being more of a piece. But I now think that what pleased me in them was the obverse of what was lacking. And so every time I see Fellowship it palls on me before the end, and Towers hardly seems worth re-seeing.For me to criticize this first film unfavorably feels unfair, because in doing so I seem to be discounting the real pleasure it gave me. Seeing the places and incidents and characters from the books more or less faithfully reproduced up there on screen for the first time produced a series of little explosions of wonder and delight. They were fewer in Two Towers, and absent altogether from Return of the King. In part, this was to be expected--one can't have the same experience three times--but it was also because those momentary delights, in order to amount to something in the end, would, as they subsided, have had gradually to reveal a continuous and coherent narrative and drama underneath. This is what was lacking, and nowhere more than in this first and most entertaining film.As a basis for adaptation LOTR most nearly resembles Gone with the Wind, another long novel set in a world which the author has inhabited in imagination for so long that it has taken on a reality of its own. The difference between the two works is this Gone with the Wind would have made a good film no matter in what period it had been produced, because it has colorful, dynamic characters and strongly dramatic scenes, and LOTR does not. It has all the other makings of a good film (probably not three), but not those. An able screenwriter could have made it into a good script, but would have needed the acuity to know which ingredients to cull from the books and the skill to transform them. An opening example the first two facts we learn about Frodo in the books are that he likes to wander the woods of the Shire, and that on observing his uncle Bilbo's odd behavior at his farewell dinner he becomes worried for him. Neither of these characteristics fits with the Frodo of the films.Frodo is not a very deeply drawn character, in conventional terms. Most of what there is to be learned of him must be gleaned indirectly from incidental observations, from the words and rhythms of the language that describes him. More can be gleaned from his occasional exercises of will, such as the decision that sets the story going his volunteering, before the assembled council, to take the Ring. This scene can serve as an example of how the films fall short of the books.In re-viewing Fellowship, almost the first thing that struck me was that this act seemed completely unmotivated, though it hadn't in the book; and in re-reading the book, it still didn't. So I went back to it to see why.In principle Frodo has made this decision long before, almost accidentally, after learning the Ring's history. Gandalf says, If you want to destroy the Ring-- which seems just a manner of speaking, but Frodo answers, in more or less these words, I do want to destroy it!...or, well, I want to see it destroyed. He has committed himself almost without knowing it. When he leaves the Shire it is with this purpose in mind, though he has no idea how it is to be realized. When he adds to his declaration, ...though I do not know the way, he's only re-stating what his position has been all along. In addition, before he makes his offer Bilbo has done the same, and after he's turned down someone else asks, in so many words, Then who is it to be? Verbally, Tolkien leads the scene to a point where it can only be Frodo who responds, and the reader hopes and knows he will rise to the occasion. Tolkien has planted the clues, or cues, so cunningly that the reader has to search for them. In scripting the film, Jackson failed to note them or, where they couldn't be communicated cinematically, to supply substitutes.And with rare exceptions, this remains the case throughout his trilogy.

There is not a great deal of plot other than an account of how a group of young people spend New Year's Eve in New York. The one linking thread is that most of them are on their way to a party being given by a mutual acquaintance named Monica, although we do not see much of the actual party itself. For most of the film, in fact, the neurotic, self-pitying Monica worries that none of her friends will actually turn up- even her best friend Hilary leaves- and that she will be forced to spend the entire evening arguing about her sex life with her equally self-pitying ex-boyfriend Eric, a Scottish artist who specialises in multicoloured close-ups of the female genitalia.A number of reviewers have wondered why it was necessary to set the film in the early eighties rather than the late nineties when it was made, speculating that this may have been a device to market a nostalgic soundtrack album. Certainly, we get to hear a lot of songs from the era by artists such as Blondie, Roxy Music, Kim Carnes and Elvis Costello (who makes a brief cameo appearance)- all of which took me straight back to my own college days- although I suspect that the real reason for choosing 1981\/2 was that this represented the end of the carefree, pre-AIDS era.If the film has been set in, say, 1998\/9 all the bed-hopping and partner-swapping that goes on would seem a lot less innocent. This is very much a film about sex. Some of the characters are looking for love, but most of them are just looking for sex. Most of them end up with a partner, although not always the one they started the film with. Monica dumped Eric because she found him inadequate in bed, but now worries that she will be unable to find another boyfriend. Val, Monica's young country cousin from Long Island, throws herself at every man she can find, overcome by the excitement of being in the big city. Lucy, a girl even more man-hungry than Val, tries to get off with a handsome young bartender and her (hitherto platonic) flatmate Kevin, who is depressed over the failure of his own relationship. Cindy, a naive and innocent girl, has just lost her virginity to the handsome but obnoxiously conceited Jack, a young man who complains that every girl who goes to bed with him falls in love with him. (He sees that as a major problem).Cindy, in fact, is one of the few attractive characters in the film. She is terminally clumsy and accident-prone (in one of the film's grosser moments she manages to slip over and land in a pile of dog-dirt), but there is at least a certain sincerity and sweetness about the way Kate Hudson plays her. (Justice is done when Cindy ends up with sensitive punk rocker Tom, about the only likable male character on view). Most of the other characters are an unlikeable bunch, whose main vices are self-centredness, arrogance, reckless promiscuity and an even more reckless tobacco addiction. (The early eighties may have been pre-AIDS but they were certainly not pre-lung cancer). The title presumably refers to the number of cigarettes the characters smoke between them. Is this some sort of product placement for Big Tobacco? The film has certain similarities with Barry Levinson's Diner, another nostalgic film (in that case made in the eighties about the fifties) about a group of young friends in the period leading up to New Year. Both films are episodic in character and concentrate on character rather than action. Diner, however, is by far the better film, the main reason being that the characters in that film emerge as rounded individuals, whereas the characters in 200 Cigarettes are little more than one-dimensional ciphers. Diner concentrated on only half a dozen characters; the scriptwriter of 200 Cigarettes made the mistake of trying to interest us in nearly twenty in a film lasting just over an hour and a half.

At first glance a period drama culled from a work of 19th century literature may seem completely at odds with the innovative and in-your-face look of Space Odyssey and Clockwork Orange, but it is perhaps the most carefully considered work by a director at the top of his game.Apparently the source novel is one of its authors less well known works, but its structure and themes were perfectly suited to Kubrick. Kubrick's films can usually be seen as being made up of contrasting segments, and Barry Lyndon is in fact formally separated into Parts One and Two. Part one is the rise of Barry, Part two is his downfall. The two parts can be seen as mirror images of each other, and there is a sense of history repeating itself, particularly with the two main pistol duels. Barry's story begins with his duel with Captain Quinn. It ends with his duel with Lord Bullingdon. Both duels are between a young man and an old man. Both duels are (essentially) over a woman, and in both cases the younger man is a relative of that woman who has a somewhat inappropriate love for her, whereas the older man is or will be her legitimate husband.Kubrick further contrasts the two halves of the story. Part one is largely set outdoors, and all the most important scenes take place in the open air, signifying Barry is at first an outsider. This is in contrast to the luxurious interiors of Part two. The music changes throughout the picture from delicate folk airs, to pompous military marches to stately classical pieces. Kubrick goes to some pretty excessive lengths to add little subtle touches that signify the changes in Barry's position. For example, if you watch carefully in the first half, you'll notice that every time there is a candle-lit scene, the number of candles on the table increases by one each time.Of course, all these symbolic touches don't really add much to the story. What is the real key to Barry Lyndon's brilliance (and also the reason it isn't more popular) is its pacing. It is incredibly, indescribably slow. There is no abbreviation. Every little event, every encounter is played out at in full as it might really have happened. Establishing shots are held for so long that they almost become miniature scenes in themselves, and act to set up chapters in the story rather than the next scene. This is not simply a life story stripped down to the exciting bits, it really feels like a life story. Two things prevent the film from becoming mind-numbingly boring. Firstly, every shot is beautifully composed and lit, so if nothing else the film is nice to look at. Secondly is the way Kubrick handles the emotions.Emotion is nearly always understated in Kubrick's films. His characters tend to hide their emotions, and Kubrick rarely uses any cheap devices to make things too obvious. The emotions in Barry Lyndon are at their most understated. All the dialogue and conduct is highly formal and ritualised, in keeping with the period setting. But paradoxically the emotions are also constantly on display. Throughout these unbelievably long drawn out set pieces the characters are constantly betraying their innermost thoughts and feelings through subtle gestures, body language, tones of voice and facial expressions. Kubrick actually makes more use of close-ups than in any of his previous pictures, far subtler than what is generally called a reaction shot, but the characters are constantly reacting all the same. The world of Barry Lyndon is one in which the characters say one thing, yet think and feel another. When eventually we do get to see a very openly emotional scene &#x96; little Brian between his mother and father &#x96; the effect is incredibly powerful, like the floodgates have finally been opened.With all this considered the actors all do an amazing job, and the casting is perfect. Marisa Berenson is particularly good, keeping her face blank and expressionless, but showing very strong emotion just beneath the surface. There is a great supporting cast too, for example Leonard Rossiter as Captain Quinn, who helps keep that slightly bizarre and silly feel that is in all Kubrick's pictures. This is not to mention Michael Horden's narration, which gives a spot-on tone of friendliness with a touch of sadness.Barry Lyndon is really a refreshing take on the period drama. All too often period films and historical epics simply duplicate the stuffy, formal manner of their source material. Barry Lyndon on the other hand transcends its literary roots and, while sticking to the language and story of the novel, shows a very genuine humanity in the characters. It never forgets that, no matter how much they are constrained by the conventions of the time and place, people still experience the same emotions.

The major flaws are all at the military political level of plot development and the fact that these are never really explained to any great satisfaction does sort of strain the premise a bit. Over all I like the movie, a throughly enjoyable testosterone filled film that does make you proud to be American and realise the freedom is something that can never to taken away from unless your willing to give it up. So what follows is just my picayune points that were made during the movie.1. 500,000 Cuban and Nicaraugan troops invade. 63 Russian divisions roughly 600,000 men and tanks. The Russians come across the Bering Strait, cut the pipeline and drive south to Cheyene while the Cuban and Nicaraugan troops come in as paratroops disguised as commercial airline flights. Really what road where 600,000 men\/tanks coming down from Alaska except the one two lane and in places gravel road that's there. They would have been annihilated before that got 50 miles into the US. Movie makes no mention of spy satellite data which would have picked up all this troop movement and build up.2. Russian nukes 400 million Chinese and they do nothing? The Chinese would have screamed across the border with everything they had not to mention massive nuclear missile retaliation wiping out the USSR. Ditto the US Navy via submarines, which gets no mention in the film, would have nuked Cuba and Nicarauga not to mention Mexico, cutting the supply line to enemy troops, then the Army would have driven across the southern US to the sea and cut them off.3. Roughly 1.1 million troops are going to hold 250 million Americans hostage, do the math, it would never work.4. Jeb is told during the winter that maybe in the spring the US is going to drop special forces in to help him. What they need to wait for good weather, some special forces? 5. Way too little use of the radio they are given and Radio Free America. This would have been there lifeblood and sustaining courage.I'm sure there are other points as well. This could have been a fantastic film and maybe even a mini series but it need to have a military adviser and a stronger scenario for it to score higher in my book.
