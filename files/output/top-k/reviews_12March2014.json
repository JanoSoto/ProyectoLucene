[{"date":"12 March 2014","score":"","review":" Dracula (1931, Tod Browning, Karl Freud) certainly achieves the eeriness it was obviously attempting. The use of dim lighting and shadows is definitely not subtle, but still really amusing to watch out for. Most notably, when the Count's face falls into shadow, but a beam of light falls across his eyes (sort of like a reverse raccoon effect) and it really adds to the mortality emanating from him. I'm not a big fan of horror movies (from any period, really) and this film wasn't an exception, but I don't particularly regret watching it. The additions to contribute to the sinister atmosphere like the music, or the use of fog, were fun to note. The costumes were also impressively authentic, if a little dramatized. The way Bela Lugosi plays Dracula is remarkable, as well, because he embodies the very cold impression every audience member gets from his character. I wouldn't watch it again, because I found it a bit cheesy, script and prop-wise, but I recommend watching it if you're a horror movie\/thriller buff. It's a great example of the pioneering horror movies of the '30s.

I just have seen so many remakes and spin offs. And of course there was the vampire fad with Twilight, Vampire Dairies, True Blood, just to name a few. So watching the original Dracula was fun, I liked to see all of the vampire stereotypes where they happened for the first time, the Transylvania accent, pale skin, charming personality, coffin sleeping, bats etc. Although I didn't find the movie very scary it did have some moments that were spooky, to me the the character that brought the most spook was the hopelessly devoted Renfield. His bulging eyes and lunatic behavior really made for some eerie scenes, one that immediately comes to mind is when the ship arrives to Europe and what they found is the whole ship crew dead and the unstable Renfield all by himself laughing. The movie also used shadows in great ways, many times the shot would be a close up on Dracula's face but casting a shadow over his entire face expect his eyes. This making the shot that more intense, this was done when Dracula was hypnotizing his victims. One negative thing I have to say about the movie was the ending. Through out the movie there was a lot of suspense and build up but it was so anti-climatic. There was a lot of action when chasing Dracula but before you knew it they found his coffin and the shot goes off to Mina and we hear Dracula off die of screen. The end. Over all the movie was good I just wish they carried the excitement all the way to the end of the movie.

On the one hand, the film has some fine actors and LOOKS great -- sets, costumes, locations (England and the Swiss Alps), etc. There are some good scenes, like the creature's time spent with the peasant family where his unseen help is mistaken as a good spirit of the woods. On the other hand, the film is so over-the-top it's hard to enjoy, specifically during the first hour, before the monster escapes, and the final 40 minutes or so. The tempo during the initial 55 minutes (and then later) is ultra-manic -- characters are introduced, scenes flash by, times constantly shift, the soundtrack blares and everyone overdoes it. Seriously, the characters are so melodramatically over-the-top in every scene I just wanted them to stop, take their meds, and chill for about five minutes.I realize Branagh wanted to throw everything in but the kitchen sink but, by doing this, he failed. This is definitely a case where less is more. Take, for instance, the bookend arctic sequences; they could have been omitted altogether with no harm done. Branagh needed to take a chill pill and cut out unnecessary details so viewers could enjoy the Gothic settings and get to know the characters. But, no, everything's so manic it's laughable -- people constantly emoting, yelling, running, confronting, fighting, dying -- Ahhhhhh!!!!! NoooOOOOOoooooo!!!!! Et cetera. It's like Branagh assumed everyone watching the film would have ADHD or something. Of course, I realize some people may prefer this approach; if so, they'll likely appreciate this movie.Regardless, the film and cast do look good and Robert De Niro's great as the creature. I especially liked the aforementioned part where the monster finds sanctuary with the rural family (unbeknownst to them); in fact, I wish the film would have spent even more time developing this important sequence. It helped us get to know the creature and have compassion on his plight; but when he ludicrously frames someone with a locket and murders a boy all sympathy is pretty much lost. On the other hand, he IS a 'monster,' after all.Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is similar to 1992's Bram Stoker's Dracula in that they both look awesome but are ultimately disappointing in their storytelling. But I like Dracula more because of the well-done first hour or so; not to mention it's not ridiculously manic.GRADE C- ","genre":null},{"date":"12 March 2014","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version of the oft-filmed Frankenstein story offers a mixed experience.
