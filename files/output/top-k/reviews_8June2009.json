The first time I saw it, I was about 10 or 11 and I was as ignorant and stupid as most of the IMDb.com population. Plus, I was a kid. But now, after watching it, I appreciate it so much more.The reason why people hate this film is because they take everything literally with it and\/or they are Christian or religious. So it's no surprise, at all. You weren't meant to take the whole alien scene literally, it was clearly a metaphor for how life started, by evolution and not by some magical fairy called god . I mean, let's face it, we all came from water. A percentage of our body is made up of water, so how can you even claim that this so called god created us? that's no true and it sound stupid and insulting.Anyways, back to the movie review. I liked this more than Red Planet. It's more realistic. The visuals were beautiful. The sand storm scene reminded me of the first mummy movie. OK, so Mars may not have those kinds of dust storms or those kinds of aliens, but whose to argue that life does not exist beyond earth? Exactly. The acting was great, and so was the plot. Although I wanted to see where Gary's character goes to at the end. And let's not forget, this is Brian DePalma, he made the Godfather which is in the top 10 IMDb.com list, are you forgetting who this is? One of Hollywood's greatest directors among many.Overall, a 10\/10 for original ideas and great metaphors. Here's a fun fact, the movie takes place in 2020, and the mission to mars starts in 2021 or 13 months later. In real life, in the year 2020, we have a manned mission to mars already planned, so I guess you could say this movie was ahead of its time, it certainly did its research on Mars. Great movie, I hope we colonize on Mars someday.

I don't entirely blame him though..with such a terrible director and script I don't know who could have given a memorable performance in this time vampire. His performance was so stale and bland I was amazed. John Travolta dear oh dear.. wow..probably the lowest point in his career. The fact he was able to salvage a career after this movie deserves a massive amount of respect.The plot is just terrible!!! I mean...these ugly looking alien things conquer Earth. They enslave humans to mine gold..why the hell would these Aliens want gold so bad?? I mean..it really has no practical use except looking good on some bimbos ears or finger so why the hell would these Aliens want it so much?

There really is very little to fault.I'm still a little sceptical about the huge (apparently gravitational) voids containing breathable atmospheres in the spaceship, yet with no obvious means of replenishment. I also find the contrasts of technology a little hokey. The grubby engine-room of the Nostromo more resembles a coal or diesel powered steamship, whereas Ian Holm's character 'Ash' is an android replicant so minutely realised as to pass muster for human to all but the minutest scrutiny. That lot just doesn't stack up.I'm also sceptical about the absolute and exclusive trust everyone places in the medical officer. I would expect such a small, close-knit crew to take a much keener interest in the plight of one of their number, particularly considering his bizarre and horrific condition.Still; get your head around that lot and it's a heavy-duty horror trip of the first water. You'll be hard-pressed to keep still in your seat during some of the more sinister moments. You'll likewise be as hard pressed to keep from laughing when Ash - literally - loses his head.The whole plot was fully realised a few years later in its riveting sequel 'Aliens', and that continues to be the absolute business for me.

The Cohen Brothers, after winning the Oscar for Best Writers (not before), eventually came out and admitted the story was entirely fictional.

The son, however, who was terrified for his mother, was not shown comically. So here we have a screenplay where the writers showed a terrified victim as comedy, and the son's terror for his mother dismissed.

She had earlier told Starman that she couldn't have children. In a sign of his love for her, he gave her a boy baby. After telling her this, he does give her then option to stop it.

His one friend tells him that he is retiring from his crime life and that he should seek Henry Gondorff (Newman) so that he can become a big con man. Gondorff agrees to help Hooker run a sting on Lonnegan for revenge on their friend. Hooker becomes the bait for the scheme that Gondorff is plotting. A majority of the movie is a back and forth gambling fight between the two men on that can out cheats whom. The night before the final act, Hooker hooks up with a new waitress named Loretta. When he wakes up in the morning, she's gone. As he is leaving and walking down the alley, he sees her and a guns man turns the corner and shoots her in the forehead. Hooker finds a gun on her and the guns man tells him that she was plotting to kill him. This gunman is one of Gondorffs friends that have been sent to look over Hooker. The final scene takes place at a gambling parlor where Lonnegan brings a case filled with half a million dollars. Bets are taken and the movie ends with great twist that shocked me. The Sting contained a very tricky plot that shocked me by the time the end of the movie came around. I enjoyed the setting being in the 1930's with the gangsters and mobs. The effects used were very minimal and it made the film to be very realistic. The characters used in the movie made it seem like I was in the 30's and in the city. Some things I didn't enjoy so much were the constant running back and forth between the two sides. The movie took place in Chicago, which I think should've been in New York or some place more northern. For being mobsters, there wasn't a lot of gunplay. It almost seemed as if they tried to make the shootings one on one and secluded from everyone else I enjoyed watching Paul Newman (Gondorff); he played a very smooth and laid back mobster. He was very sneaky in his plot against Robert Shaw (Lonnegan). Overall, I think this movie had a very simple yet tricky plot. There were definite dead scenes and some actors that could've been cut. If this movie had a different cast or director, I think it could've been a lot greater or more enjoyable. I don't think it was a total flop, the three main characters made the movie and I think the movie should've had just those three men because everyone else seemed to be just extras. I would recommend this film for older people over thirty. I wouldn't watch this film again just because I think it had a lot of dead scenes. I'd rate this film 6 out of 10.

Still, I don't find myself identifying with its characters or empathizing with their struggles other than the basic I wish I didn't have to leave. Granted graduating college is different now than it was in the 1990s, but if this film were truly very good, it would resonate with college graduates of all generations. The problem is that as sharp, witty and original as the dialogue is, it's unnatural and it pushes us toward nothing.Fans of dialogue in film, particularly the avant garde approach, will probably be quick to love this film debut from writer\/director Noah Baumbach. He manages to write a lot of dialogue that we all think but never actually speak aloud (admirable), it's all quite clever (funny or at least amusing) but his characters like to talk a lot about what they do, which in this movie is nothing (boring). College graduates and friends Grover, Max, Skippy and Otis, all played by no-name actors basically decide to spend their first year post-graduation back at school because they are to afraid to leave. Skippy's girlfriend Miami is still a student so he stays, Otis is scared of moving to Milwaukee, Grover's girlfriend went to Prague, thus dumping him and backing out of their plans to live in Brooklyn together, etc. It's a very indie take on a coming of age story.If it hasn't been made apparent, there's a lot of talking. You'll like a lot of what you hear and you'll be bored by a lot of it. People just generally don't talk this way, which helps the movie avoid cliché, making it fresh and funny, but also alienates the audience at times. At times I told myself I kind of liked it, at others I wondered what the point was. There is some definite intention behind everything Baumbach does, but he communicates this intention in ways most people won't grasp and it all comes across pointless. Plus, either Baumbach never communicates the reason for the title or I missed it because I wasn't totally paying attention. With so much dialogue, everything Baumbach really wants the audience to understand he must have spoken aloud and so rather than discovering meaning, it comes in the form of explanation.Kicking and Screaming is an experiment, an artsy film that some will love just for being artsy and others will find boring for being exactly that way.

This movie succeeds largely because the documentarian does not inject his bias into the story, nor does he push any sort of agenda. He lets his subjects give their side of the story. He listens to both sides of the argument, whether they approve of what Robert Crumb has done as an artist, or whether he is nothing more than a bizarre pornographer. In all, the neutrality of the movie-maker is this film's best selling point, and I highly recommend this film as one that doesn't beat you over the head with its opinion or message; it lets the subjects do the talking.On the topic of semi-famous underground cartoonist Robert Crumb and his family, the film leaves one with an uneasy feeling at best. Charles, Robert's brother, and his mother reminded me of the recent HBO Grey Gardens movie, which itself was based on a documentary. If Robert Crumb can be perceived by some as a stark eccentric who cannot fit in to modern society, at least he has been able to create a stable home life with a loving family of his own. This movie is utterly tragic in its portrayal of Crumb's brothers, Charles and Maxon, especially so since Charles is gifted with exceptional cartooning skills (his artwork looked superior to Robert's best efforts), yet was cursed with severe psychiatric problems which prevented him from entering society as a functional individual. While Robert is a functional member of society, the overall impression the movie gave was that he was somewhat distant from other people, including his kin, and could not pick up easily on the feelings of others. The most poignant example of this was a brief (maybe one minute?) description of his father by Crumb's son from his first wife. Still, it was delightful to see Crumb nurture his children by helping them do artwork of their own.On the surface, Crumb may seem like a unique if peculiar individual snobbish, detached from the outside world, relishing in dressing in anachronistic clothing and listening to old jazz records. Still, the impression was of a kind-hearted individual who found release through art. I did enjoy the movie's inclusion of those who objected to Crumb's art as blatantly pornographic, though my sense is that Crumb's work does not have the mainstream popularity which would make it troubling to society at large, nor the messages in his illustrations singularly sexual, to classify it as straightforwardly pornographic.A solid effort.

Reprogrammed by the older John (don't you just love time travel paradoxes?) the 'old' Terminator is a lot different then the one from the prequel. Sarah Connors is locked up in a mental institute because the authorities claim her to be... nuts. We all know she isn't, and so it is very painful and rather sad to see her being mistreated in the institute. Eventually, John and the Terminator bail her out and together, they run from their enemy, the newer and improved Terminator.Let me take the elements of the movie one by oneStory Very moving and well-written. There's a very strong connection with the prequel and you can see the writers put a lot of effort in this movie.Music It's the same tune that gave me chills in the prequel.

In Memento Nolan really establishes himself as an extremely talented filmmaker. Memento has an intricate but not too complicated story and the way the movie plays out with the ending in the beginning and the beginning at the end makes it feel different (in a good way) and original. Its one of those films to watch a couple times to fully understand what it was all about and so that you can pick up on little things you didn't notice the first time around. The surprises in store for anyone who hasn't seen it I wasn't quite expecting myself which made the film very enjoyable to watch at least to me. The three leads in the movie are admirable in their roles including Guy Pearce as Leonard a man with a rare brain disorder after an accident who can't form new memories. Pearce's Leonard is after the one who raped and killed his wife a man's identity he can never know for sure. Pearce is believable in the role and does a great job as the main character. Carrie Anne-Moss does a decent job as Natalie an ally to Leonard who helps in his quest to find his wife's killer but may not be who she appears. Moss is quite good at playing a character you're not sure is trying to help Leonard or just using him. The same can go for Joe Pantoliano whose equally impressive as Teddy a man Leonard isn't sure whether he can fully trust. The rest of the relatively unknown cast also turn in solid performances. The ending is fitting which reveals some secrets while keeping other questions unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie. Overall Memento was much better than expected because of it's interesting revenge story, complex characters played by talented actors, and surprising plot twists that make for an above average entertaining thriller to watch.

It's actually a movie about the transition from ape to man condensed into a relatively short time for one tribe. It's actually more philosophical and emotional than one might initially think.

It felt strangely grim, uncomfortable and disorienting to me, which when I think about it, is probably how those tribesmen going on the quest must have felt.They even had a famous linguist\/author, Anthony Burgess, invent a language for the ape men to communicate.

The beautiful musical score certainly helped counteract the lack of intelligible words by conveying the drama of the times. The performances were very good and convincing especially the one by Rae Dawn Chong (strange female covered in gray makeup) who had the guts to be mostly naked throughout the film.

He tried to blame the original failure at the box office on the fact it was released just before 9\/11 but that is a cop-out. The script is painfully unfunny and stuffing a film with cameos only serves as a prop to hold up the weakness of the whole venture. I tried to concentrate on it but there was really nothing to watch. Kudos to the filmmakers for being able to get so many stars to appear in it but that is really not enough to save it. I managed to get through 30 minutes this time before I thought to myself, Do you really want to waste minutes of your precious life watching this pile of faeces? I came to the conclusion that I did not. As for Stiller-wake up people the Emperor has no clothes. Just because he has connections to show biz through his family was never any reason to laud him as a comic genius. Do NOT get me started with Will Ferrell either!!

It's not life-affirming or magnificent; but it's well constructed and a lot of fun to watch. The film is often compared to Hitchcock, and that's mostly owing to the central plot which clearly takes influence from Rear Window, although director Curtis Hanson does occasionally implement a Hitchcock-like style during the rest of the film. It is not, however, comparable to the films Brian De Palma made in the seventies and eighties. The film focuses on a man named Terry Lambert. Terry is having an affair with Sylvia; his boss' wife. Whilst at his apartment one night, Sylvia spots a man being attacked out of the window. The next morning, another girl turns up dead and Terry, thinking the two incidents may be related, decides to go to the police and tell them that he witnessed the attack. However, things soon start to spiral out of control when Sylvia will have nothing to do with it for fear of the affair being exposed, and the police begin suspecting Terry.Steve Guttenberg; an actor often not taken seriously because of his ties to the Police Academy series, takes the lead role and does surprisingly well with it. Guttenberg cuts a likable figure who is easy to root for, and that is important in a film like this. The story moves well throughout; and although I initially felt that almost two hours was too long for a film like this; the time is well used and the film flies by. The Bedroom Window is based on a novel by Anne Holden; and directed by Curtis Hanson; the talented director of the 1997 masterpiece L.A. Confidential. Hanson's direction is assured and he does a good job of telling the story. The support cast is decent too; the casting of Isabelle Hupert is a bit of a surprise considering most of her previous films were made in her native France; but Elizabeth McGovern is a good choice as the victim of the attack towards the start. The first two thirds of the film are rather subdued; and so it's a bit of a surprise when the film explodes into life for the final half hour. However, the change works well and the payoff is worth it.

Jonny would rather kill Doyle outright, but then settles for a big con that will hurt Doyle's pride. Jonny gets help for a game scanner named Henry Gondorff. The mood set in the film is perfect.

You would have to pay close attention to catch all of them. It consists of one con game after another having not only you fooled but the characters as well. It has its humor. It also has a surprise ending!! The film was very detailed from the setting, to how characters talked, to what they wore. It also has a fast momentum to it. The movie never pauses. Even though the music was made a few years earlier, it goes perfect with the movie. The music has an up beat to it. The cons that go on in the movie keep you on your feet. Wondering if they are going to be caught and when. You can really tell they put a lot of thought not only with the plot of the film but the cons in the movie think everything through. I really liked the film and cannot think of anything bad to say about itPaul Newman and Robert Redford did a flawless job on playing the roles of Henry Gondorff and Jonny Hooker.

You would have to pay close attention to catch all of them. It consists of one con game after another having not only you fooled but the characters as well. It has its humor. It also has a surprise ending!! The film was very detailed from the setting, to how characters talked, to what they wore. It also has a fast momentum to it. The movie never pauses. Even though the music was made a few years earlier, it goes perfect with the movie. The music has an up beat to it. The cons that go on in the movie keep you on your feet. Wondering if they are going to be caught and when. You can really tell they put a lot of thought not only with the plot of the film but the cons in the movie think everything through. I really liked the film and cannot think of anything bad to say about itPaul Newman and Robert Redford did a flawless job on playing the roles of Henry Gondorff and Jonny Hooker. They were the ones setting up the big con against Doyle Lonnegan. Doyle Lonnegan was played by Robert Shaw, who did a fantastic job taking on the role as the dirtiest mug in Chicago. If and when you watch the movie, you would think that someone was actually filming this and was not a movie. All of the characters did an amazing job playing their roles. Everyone was a contribute to the movie. The ending is fantastic and comes as a total surprise. It is a very detailed film and I want to see it again. It is a little long but worth every minute. Watch carefully because there are many twists and turns, along with surprises. I rate this film a 10 out of 10.

His personal problems originated by his marriage with young Oona, added to the hate generated in the United States from the brilliant, anti-capitalism movie Monsieur Verdoux left him in a very dramatic situation, that made him look back at the past, only to realize how the art he made better was changing... characters, themes, directors and actors were now different. His eternal black and white pantomime was at the moment useless, and colored motion pictures were appearing...Limelight is the bittersweet movie that narrates the impossible love story between Calvero, the fading comedian, and Terry, the suicidal Dancer. Perhaps his final masterpiece, Limelight earns recognition and admiration for its philosophical thoughts about life, love, and the mix of comedy and drama. Considered as his will to artists and his homage to his three loves London, arts and women, the movie reflects Chaplin's worries about his audience, his marriage, society. Almost every aspect of Chaplin's life is represented in this motion picture. Just the tittle evokes his theatrical debut, in the late XIXth Century, Calvero is just a variation of Chaplin's eternal character, The Little Tramp, the story of Therry is the same as his mother (her sister also prostituted to make a living), and it goes on...There will be no movie that'll make me laugh and cry as much as Limelight. I consider it as the last Chaplin film. Enjoy the gag between Chaplin and Buster Keaton, long-time rival in the silent-film era, and the marvelous original score composed by Chaplin himself.Limelight is a perfect, brilliant, touching movie that'll make you know the person that hid 30 years under the Little Tramp character a great artist and unique man called Charles Spencer Chaplin.

What makes this film really unique is that Kubrick leaves few clues to what this concept is which makes it impossible to form a clearly defined interpretation. Is the concept intelligence? Or the past and future of human kind? Or has it a religious message? There are NO answers...I remember watching it for the first time...and the second time the day after. What was this REALLY about? Browsing the internet for explanations. I read many theories, but none that was more plausible than the other.Just one time I got this feeling again, when I looked up on the pyramids in Egypt. What on earth IS IT? It's both frustrating and a pleasing at the same time. A kind of religious feeling.The sound plays an important role in the film. The music is partly classical, partly avant-garde. There are many scenes where breathing or distant sounds from animals make up the sound stage.Like other Kubrick films the story is told in chapters. The story is nonetheless easy to follow.A sci-fi movie can't be reviewed without mentioning the special effects. A sci-fi made in 1968 will make most people think of flying saucers and silly costumes. 2001 does not look dated. The special effects are very much the same as those in Star Wars. It looks more realistic than Star Wars episode IV but not as astonishing as episode V.This is not a film for everybody. In the same time you do not have to like sci-fi to love this film.

Antonio Banderas gives a very spirited performance as Alejandro, and the well-choreographed sword fights, beautiful score and witty screenplay allow Banderas to do what he does best. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Don Diego, giving his character a sense of bitterness, sensitivity and vulnerability that make all his performances so endearing. In fact, this, Silence of the Lambs and The Elephant Man just go to show what a great actor Hopkins is; the only film he disappoints in is in Chaplin, where he played the rather unnecessary role of the fictional autobiographer. Catherine Zeta Jones is lovely beyond words as Elena, and Stuart Wilson plays his his-sable villain almost to perfection, but Matt Letscher as Captain Love isn't quite as threatening as he should be. The cinematography is very handsome, capturing perfectly the beautiful sets and costumes. The only other criticism I have of the movie, is its length, it's quite excessive. But I will say the explosive finale and spirited performances more than compensate, making it a very well-done and entertaining film. I wasn't as impressed with the sequel, the swordplay was more like slapstick and the plot was less involving and a little bloated. 8\/10 for Mask of Zorro though.
