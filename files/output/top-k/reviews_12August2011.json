It's long, mostly consists out of just talking back and forth and is lacking in adventure, action, true excitement and than some more.Guess you could still say that the movie is good, just not great. Even though it was lacking a lot, it wasn't a movie that I hated watching, simply because it's a far too well made one for that. Howard Hawks and John Wayne are obviously at ease within the genre, I just wished that the story had more to offer.It takes literally almost 90 minutes into this movie for the 'conflict' to finally develop but that doesn't mean that the movie takes off after that point. It's one that more puts its focus on its characters, rather than its story. That's fine of course, as long as the characters are interesting enough and the actors that play them are good in their roles. But no, John Wayne wasn't exactly the best actor that ever lived, which also shows in this movie and Ricky Nelson was also distractingly poor in his role. What the movie is further more lacking, when it comes down to its characters, is a good strong villain. Of course they still found room for a love-story to get thrown in, which just isn't something I'm waiting for when I'm going to see a western. It still is good and fun to see a young Angie Dickinson in this, as Wayne's, almost 30 years younger, love interest.Because the characters aren't really that compelling, the dialog of the movie also falls sort of flat. And the dialog is really something the movie its script had put its emphasis on. This is the foremost reason why the movie tends to feel a bit overlong and slow. I kept waiting for a good stand off or the moment that they got on their horses and ride off but it just wasn't that kind of western. So yes, maybe I was expecting a different movie but I was also certainly expecting a better one.Sorry to say but this movie just never surpassed the level of 'just good' for me.7\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"12 August 2011","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Perhaps it is because westerns aren't really my thing but I just never really could get into this movie.

Unfortunately, like The Age of Innocence, this is yet another wallow in victimization and misery that Wharton seemed to specialize. However, unlike The Age of Innocence where director Martin Scorsese seemed psychotically obsessed with the elegant trappings at the expense of his story, director Terrence Davies is actually more interested in the players of his piece.The primary player is one Lily Bart (played by Gillian Anderson), a lovely, elegant young woman, who not only bungles her chance at true love, but comes to realize to her detriment how much she is at the mercy of a fickle high society filled with pettiness, envy and jealousy.Lily is at heart that rarest of beasts - a genuinely decent person. She has had the misfortune of accumulating a sizable debt from card playing, which she anticipates paying back with the inheritance to be left her by harridan aunt Eleanor Bron. As Bron is infinitely more taken with dishrag ward Jodhi May, it is questionable how much Lily can count on this development. Lily pines for scandalous attorney Eric Stoltz, who is the sometime lover of society grand dame Laura Linney, but finds bad timing and circumstance consistent obstacles to a relationship. In fact, bad timing and bad luck seem to relentlessly dog Lily in every endeavor. Trusted friends and companions reveal themselves to be bitter enemies beneath the surface. When some scandalous letters fall into her lap that would prove to be her personal salvation, Lily takes the high road to her further detriment.The House of Mirth does not have much mirth in it. It is depressing, gloomy and leaves the viewer in an utterly hopeless state. It is a despairing experience to watch the destruction of a person, who did not invite it, does not deserve it and is left broken and battered by life, while some appalling specimens of humanity glide past unscathed. This is by no stretch of the imagination an enjoyable viewing experience and one would imagine that it would be an even more trying reading experience.All that aside, there are definitely reasons to watch the film. Davies' assured direction and the fine literate screenplay being two of them.Another compelling reason would be Anderson's central performance. Anyone who is only familiar with Anderson from The X-Files and oblivious to the stellar acting she has also contributed to British TV and films, will most certainly be impressed with the appealing, nuanced and heartfelt performance she contributes here. What makes Lily's inexorable downward spiral a spirit crushing blow is that until the final moments where she confronts her dismal future, Anderson never plays Lily as a victim. She seems entirely too self-assured and confident in her quest to do the right thing. The climactic moments where her emotional walls crumble at what life has in store for her is a powerful sequence. The entire performance is a demonstration of understated grace.The supporting cast is strong with one notable exception. Linney is matter-of-factly monstrous as society force of nature Bertha Dorsett, who throws Lily to the wolves on a whim to make herself look better. Terry Kinney is sympathetic as Linney's cuckolded husband. When he makes an offer to Lily late in the film that would make both of them whole, it comes across as a meeting of two lost souls and one is disappointed that Lily does not take him up on it. Dan Aykroyd is terrific playing against type as a joyfully manipulative scoundrel.Unfortunately, the film is thrown off-balance by the miscasting of Stoltz in the pivotal role of the scandalous lothario that inspires so much consternation among the female characters. I usually find Stoltz underrated, but here he is all wrong. Pasty-faced and limp, Stoltz adopts an effete fey attitude that is more off-putting than attractive. It reminds one somewhat of the miscasting of John Malkovich in Dangerous Liaisons. It is difficult to believe that one woman would find him irresistible, but the fact that three women are in such ardor over him as to launch campaigns of betrayal on each other strains credibility at every turn. Worse, Stoltz barely registers a pulse when Anderson shares the screen with him so that it hardly seems that Lily is letting much pass her by with this colorless smelt. He seems less like an unrequited love than a chance acquaintance. When Lily makes the ultimate sacrifice to spare his reputation, it seems like a wasted effort. This casting leaves the important unrequited romance between the two characters a bust. And while it may be believable that a milksop like May would be enamored of Stoltz in this film, it is inconceivable that a being depicted with the voracious appetites of Linney's Bertha Dorsett would stoop to inspect him much less expose herself to vulnerabilities to chase him. A really foolish bit of casting here that nearly throws the film off balance.

The horror movie in particular was advancing swiftly at this time (largely thanks to Val Lewton and his antics over at RKO), but Arsenic and Old Lace has its origins not in movie-land but is adapted (by celebrated fraternal duo Julius and Philip Epstein) from a popular Joseph Kesselring stage play of the time.The director is Frank Capra, of all people. It's the closest Capra ever got to horror, and really his first all-out comedy since the silent era (his silent comedies were truly dire, by the way). Oddly enough though he actually does a very decent job of taking on the methods of horror. Arsenic and Old Lace shows many of the unnerving formal techniques that had been perfected over the last twenty or so years &#x96; actors moving towards the camera, doorways open in the background. The cluttered set decoration really helps here, as does the cinematography, not so much because of the light and shadow but because of the sharp definition it gives to all the bits and bobs on the set, giving that archaic, stuffy, Gothic feel to the house in which the action takes place. Of course the aim of this picture is not to be actually scary, but it certainly does add to the fun to set the right tone. It actually looks better than most of the genuine horrors from around this period, but this is probably mainly due to the fact that the genre was strictly B-budget. Perhaps what is most surprising about this being a Capra picture is that it does not have Capra's name all over it.What is more interesting about Arsenic and Old Lace is its cast. A lot of comedies feature a straight man surrounded by various loopy oddballs, and this is more or less the case here, except that the opposite is true for the way they are played. Lead man Cary Grant, always an excellent and sophisticated comedy player, is unusually over-the-top, seeming to put in various crazed mannerisms as they occur to him. A lot of these are hilarious, but easy to miss &#x96; like waggling a spoon when someone gets Witherspoon's name wrong &#x96; so repeated viewings are recommended. Grant himself felt he went a bit too far, and at times I am tempted to agree with him (his head-bobbing like an intrigued pigeon is not really very funny) &#x96; this certainly isn't his best work. But he gets a good share of laughs and that's what counts.Besides Grant, we have a good selection of the sort of people we can expect to see as supporting players in a comedy, except that in contrast to the lead man (and even in contrast to their usual personae) they are in fact underplaying it. The wonderful Edward Everett Horton is almost natural, although he still has that brilliant tendency to make an innocuous line sound funny, a good example being his One never can tell response to Grant saying he'd never been to the sanatorium. Raymond Massey (not actually a comedy player, but a fine dramatic actor) certainly looks outlandish, but his performance is creepily understated. Peter Lorre, who could sometimes be a little annoying, as at his very best here, again in very subtle mode. Jack Carson is also very funny as an unintelligent cop. Strange as it may sound, this dynamic between a normal-yet-exaggerated lead man and weird-yet-natural supporting players works fantastically, and is the main thing that makes the movie enjoyable.But on the downside, Arsenic and Old Lace is perhaps lacking a little in structure and purpose. It is in fact not really a proper horror spoof, as despite the look of the thing it doesn't really send up or even reference the conventions of the genre at all. Not that it necessarily has to be a true spoof to be good, but a decent, fully-fleshed comedy needs something else, some other point of interest, be that satire, romance, suspense, pathos or simply the pricking of pomposity, which is largely what kept the Marx Brothers comedies going. Without that additional factor it simply a collection of gags and silly business. And on that level it is good fun to watch (albeit a little long and slow to get going), but it falls some way short of being a masterpiece.

Oddly enough though he actually does a very decent job of taking on the methods of horror. Arsenic and Old Lace shows many of the unnerving formal techniques that had been perfected over the last twenty or so years &#x96; actors moving towards the camera, doorways open in the background. The cluttered set decoration really helps here, as does the cinematography, not so much because of the light and shadow but because of the sharp definition it gives to all the bits and bobs on the set, giving that archaic, stuffy, Gothic feel to the house in which the action takes place. Of course the aim of this picture is not to be actually scary, but it certainly does add to the fun to set the right tone. It actually looks better than most of the genuine horrors from around this period, but this is probably mainly due to the fact that the genre was strictly B-budget. Perhaps what is most surprising about this being a Capra picture is that it does not have Capra's name all over it.What is more interesting about Arsenic and Old Lace is its cast. A lot of comedies feature a straight man surrounded by various loopy oddballs, and this is more or less the case here, except that the opposite is true for the way they are played. Lead man Cary Grant, always an excellent and sophisticated comedy player, is unusually over-the-top, seeming to put in various crazed mannerisms as they occur to him. A lot of these are hilarious, but easy to miss &#x96; like waggling a spoon when someone gets Witherspoon's name wrong &#x96; so repeated viewings are recommended. Grant himself felt he went a bit too far, and at times I am tempted to agree with him (his head-bobbing like an intrigued pigeon is not really very funny) &#x96; this certainly isn't his best work. But he gets a good share of laughs and that's what counts.Besides Grant, we have a good selection of the sort of people we can expect to see as supporting players in a comedy, except that in contrast to the lead man (and even in contrast to their usual personae) they are in fact underplaying it. The wonderful Edward Everett Horton is almost natural, although he still has that brilliant tendency to make an innocuous line sound funny, a good example being his One never can tell response to Grant saying he'd never been to the sanatorium. Raymond Massey (not actually a comedy player, but a fine dramatic actor) certainly looks outlandish, but his performance is creepily understated. Peter Lorre, who could sometimes be a little annoying, as at his very best here, again in very subtle mode. Jack Carson is also very funny as an unintelligent cop. Strange as it may sound, this dynamic between a normal-yet-exaggerated lead man and weird-yet-natural supporting players works fantastically, and is the main thing that makes the movie enjoyable.But on the downside, Arsenic and Old Lace is perhaps lacking a little in structure and purpose. It is in fact not really a proper horror spoof, as despite the look of the thing it doesn't really send up or even reference the conventions of the genre at all. Not that it necessarily has to be a true spoof to be good, but a decent, fully-fleshed comedy needs something else, some other point of interest, be that satire, romance, suspense, pathos or simply the pricking of pomposity, which is largely what kept the Marx Brothers comedies going. Without that additional factor it simply a collection of gags and silly business.

This has been a childhood favorite of mine for many years.Pee Wee loves his bike and that of course could be no more apparent from the opening scene when he dreams that he is riding his bicycle in the Tour De France and wins the race. Pee Wee's nemesis Francis Buxton wants Pee Wee's bike. Francis tells Pee Wee that it's his birthday and that he can have whatever he wants and that everything is negotiable with money. Pee Wee tells Francis that his bike is not for sale and Francis finds a way to take away Pee Wee's bike. When Pee Wee's bike gets stolen he comes up with an idea to get it back but Francis decides to doesn't want the bike anymore and the guy that stole it for him takes it away. Pee Wee desperate to find his bike ends up on an adventure cross country after a phony fortune teller claims that his bike is at the Alamo in the basement. So Pee Wee sets out and gets picked up by Mickey who is on the lamb. At some point he gets abandoned from Mickey after falling from a cliff in the car. He then picks up a ride from the crazy Large Marge and gets dropped off at a truck stop and he runs into a girl named Simone and he ends up having to get away from her jealous boyfriend Andy. He then ends up in a bar where some bikers hang out and he gets out of a tight spot after he knocks over their bikes and he decides to win them over by dancing in platform shoes to the song Tequilla. He's a hit and they decide to let him drive a bike on his adventure only he ends up hitting a sign and is sent to the hospital. There he has a dream about his bike getting destroyed by clowns and Francis as the devil finally doing his bike in. He wakes up and finds that his bike is not far off at a movie studio. While there he takes his bike and ends up on a hilarious chase scene that's probably one of the biggest parts of the film.Pee Wee is a great film and while it isn't a classic it is probably one of the best films of the 80's.If you have never seen Pee Wee's big adventure I highly advise it. You will be in for a real treat and a hilarious adventure.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"12 August 2011","score":"","review":" After the sort of cliffhanger ending in the first Fright Night, three years later gives us Fright Night 2. I had no idea this even existed until I was stumbling around on the internet looking at stuff from the first film. Instead of Tom Holland directing, its Tommy Lee Wallace, the same guy who directed the loathed Halloween 3. And whenever the director from the first film isn't involved with something that he created himself, you know it can't be that good...?Roddy McDowall reprises his role again as the infamous Peter Vincent, as well as William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster. Charley is now grown up and in college. He has separated himself from Peter Vincent after all the trouble they went through and receiving psychiatric treatment trying to make himself believe that all the vampires were just some illusion he imagined in his mind. When Charley finally visits Peter again (who has his TV show back)he notices something strange about Peter's new next door neighbors. They pull up in a stretch limo with movers carrying in big long crates.... hmmm. Charley, trying to deny his senses, eventually has to face them and reunite with Peter to once again battle vampires and werewolves in the final 'real' Fright Night movie.Roddy McDowall's performance is once again great as Peter Vincent. Although in this one he's not really involved a lot throughout the film unlike the first one. Which is weird considering he's first billed and in the first one he's like fifth billed and he's in it a whole lot more. Being compared with first one, this film isn't all that bad, even though the first one is CLEARLY the best. Instead of keeping the light-hearted spirit of part 1, Part 2 keeps more of a serious and darker tone than the first. One thing I've noticed about these films is that soundtracks to them both suck. They sound like something that belongs in a porn film. They should've gotten someone like John Carpenter or Jerry Goldsmith to do the music, instead of composers who make only incidental type scores. There's only one thing that has me confused. Towards the end of the movie Charley is captured by the main vampire and is bitten on the neck ? I can't tell. During the whole end scene he keeps switching back from human to vampire, from human to vampire, and so forth. The showdown in the end is no where near as memorable as the first film, but is cool in its own way. Peter and Charley are a great duo and there should've been more stuff done with them, like maybe a TV series. Its probably would've been a whole lot better than the crap stain remake that's coming out. The new one seems like too much of a comedy and has a weird bright and punchy atmosphere to it. Nothing really like the original ones. And no one on earth can replace Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent, no one !
