Then I read some IMDb reviews here, where the names of Nietzsche and Freud popped up, and I decided to take a new look. After that, I still think it stinks, but now with better reasons. See, this is about a puppeteer, and loser, who gets a job in the 7Â½ floor of some building, that floor being only about 5 feet high, as it was built to please a dwarf who complained to the owner during its construction (for some reason this is considered hilarious by some). Then, by pure chance he discovers a hole and a tunnel in a wall, which leads right into the head of JM. So, he and the female coworker he got the hots for set business, allowing people to...(yawn)... Anyway, this is all you need to know about BJMAll characters here are egocentric, narcissistic, hedonistic, amorally opportunistic. They have absolutely no ethics or compassion, except for Lotti--the puppeteer's wife--and that only for a while. They all act exclusively for the satisfaction of their own needs and wantings, which makes them elemental creatures. (There are only two, or three, kinds of humans who behave that way lactating babies, caveman...and psychotic killers). Nobody here does anything out of love, friendship or ethics; all is just for self interest, because of greed, be that physical or psychological. Which naturally brings to light its philosophical roots, which are--why I'm not shocked, shocked, to learn it!--Nietzsche. Same Nietzsche who said that, as God was dead, everyone could do whatever he pleased, which served as a moral pretext for many things, including Nazism and the Jewish Holocaust. Freud is also brought into the mix. Speaking of Freud, I have another way to prove what I stated. Freud divides human psyche in 3 parts Ego, Super Ego and Id. In elemental creatures there's no Super Ego, as this part develops as the result of learning experiences and elemental psyches have little of this, if any at all. The Ego is the part who thinks, analyzes and decides. Ditto. The remaining part is the Id, which acts simply by instinct, with the single minded purpose of satisfying the own needs, wantings--just like the characters in BJM. So, there's no doubt that these characters are as elemental creatures as any lactating baby. For that reason we can't learn a thing from them; there is nothing they may show us of new or original. If you want to be entertained by such kind of person, better watch your own infant kid, your baby; at least you'll be watching someone you love and not people you don't give a s**t about.BJM is the contrary of what his fans say it is it is unimaginative, pedestrian, ordinary, lame, deja vu. It doesn't even live up to his title. You don't get to be JM at all. All you get is a trip inside his head, like you get every day in your car. I have seen more imaginative plots in The Flintstones. The real thrill would be something more abstract imagine to REALLY get inside Stephen Hawkings' mind and see the evolving Universe. Or inside Paul McCartney's and experience the feeling of hearing random notes coming together, the genesis of a new hit song. That would be a thrill! Not that of becoming some generic Hollywood actor and be there when he scratches his lower parts or bangs some starlet. But the worst thing about BJM is that it gives us no life lesson, no food for thought, no lasting impression; just a cynical, hedonistic, predatory, view of mankind.Some years ago writers from around the world voted on the greatest literary work of all times. By a wide majority(+50%) the winner was the tale of a madman who fancied himself a white knight and who went around XVII Century Spain fighting for justice--or so he thought. He was Don Quixote. Here, in IMDb, the film voted as the best is about a man fighting for freedom and justice, in this case his own. I was pretty impressed recently with 2 films, one of a child psychiatrist deeply troubled for having failed to one of his patients & the other about a pastor who lost his faith after the tragic death of his wife. See, there's a pattern there all this indicates that--despite the cynicism of our era--exists a deeply felt longing by Man's soul for being in peace with itself and in good terms with his personal divinity, by doing the right thing. This shows also that Man is above all a moral creature. BJM goes totally against this fiber by being just a shallow, empty, cynical, nihilistic, piece of cinematography. I can see now members of the artsy-fartsy community raising their incredulous eyes from their Tweeters, I pods--from their tables at the back of some trendy Starbucks--to fling at me their high minded insults, between thoughtful sips at their javas and their dignified yawns of existential tedium peasant, stable boy. I don't care. This had to be said.In any instance, this is not a movie to hate, just one to be bored to death with. It's like being at a New Year's party at 4.00 AM, listening to your drunken uncle Bernie trying to tell you what he thinks are his best jokes.

Charly (William Ragsdale) suspects his new neighbor (Sarandon) of being a vampire but, naturally, no one believes him so he takes it upon himself to take him down before he steals his girlfriend (Bearse) away from him and turns her into his bride. Sarandon effortlessly delivers as the vampire and McDowall's comedic turned terrified performance are enough to make me watch this but two things deliver and make this movie so good that there's obviously a remake on the way (August 12, 2011 starring Colin Farrell and David Tennant) because of it. Aside from the story and acting and blah blah blah, the special effects and Stephen Geoffreys' performance are awesome to watch. The way they made the vampires is extremely scary. It's not just the typical black eyes, white make-up, and long teeth. No, it's Julia Roberts-sized mouths with shark-type teeth that threaten to rip a chunk off your neck rather than leave two small holes. That and their movements. Fantastic. It might be better than Twilight. ;) The other thing is Stephen Geoffreys. He gives such an eerie and energetic performance that he definitely stands out more than his acting counterparts. His character is an enigma and when he's turned into a vampire he embraces it as much as any top notch actor can. He's phenomenal.

After receiving a series of threatening valentines, the girls & their current beaus, are being picked off by the madman who hides his face behind a cupids mask, after a while the girls do figure out it's him thats doing the killings, but their problem is where is he? & what does he look like after all these years? especially since he changed his looks. As the body count mounts, the girls better find out who & where he is, or wind up being spending their valentines day being buried six feet under. Ah yes VALENTINE, a film I have been trying to see for quiet a few years now, but due to me reviewing other films, I completely forgot about it until just recently, when my local video store had nothing that seemed to interest me, as I was about to leave this one popped out at me, so I decided to rent it & see what it was like. Prior to seeing the film, I heard mostly mixed reviews, some said they enjoyed the film greatly, others said it was a turd, as for me, I found it not all that bad, far from anything spectacular, but good & really isn't the disaster most made the film out to be. What I liked about the movie is that the film boasts some good acting & I thought the story was interesting. Director JAMIE BLANKS has a good visual eye & his direction is well suited for the material. The film also has a few suspenseful moments & the cast was attractive, all that out of the way though, VALENTINE also messes up by trying to be something that it's not, & by that I mean trying to aim higher than something than that of the horror genre & as a result, I feel that's the main thing that makes the film seem half baked. The film tries to hide it's gory intentions under the title of psychological thriller using it as a get out of jail free card, as a result, the film hasn't got much to offer slasher fans & those who aren't a fan of the genre aren't likely to take to much of a shine to it either, but really is anyone really surprised by any of this? especially for a slasher film released by a major studio, where the word Horror is a dirty word to say within high brow Hollywood? The gore is almost non existent, with a few light smears of blood here & there, there is no requisite nudity, despite the attractive cast & despite that's what a lot of fans of the genre expect, the kills are equally as lame & the director blows it with his weak ending which while clever, is a real let down considering the amount of momentum the film has in getting to that place. However it seems the worst death of all didn't happen on screen but rather in real life, as no one it seems could stop the bruising reception the film received by fans & critics at the time of it's release, all of whom pretty much called it trivial & boring & worse, the film came at the very end of the SCREAM era slasher craze & as a result, didn't fare well at the box office either & killed the seemingly promising career of young Blanks as a mainstream director. Fans of the SCREAM films & non demanding horror buffs may like it, others looking for more, may want to leave this valentine unopened. **1\/2 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2011","score":"","review":" In this SCREAM wannabe, mixed with 1980's slasher story & Dario Argentoish mystery killer overtones, a public school nerd badly beaten by his school chums, after being falsely accused of coming on sexually to the chubby member of a clique of beautiful girls (who like him, was having difficulties in finding someone to dance with her.) returns thirteen years later to get revenge on the girls responsible for mistreating him.

Westlake's novel The Hunter, although I will not attempt a direct comparison of the two films as it is a long time since I last saw Point Blank. Westlake's work has also served as the basis for a number of other crime thrillers, including The Outfit from 1973.The main character is a gangster named Porter; we never learn his Christian name. (The equivalent character was named Walker in Point Blank and Parker in the original novel). The film tells the story of his search for revenge against his ex-wife Lynn and her lover, his former partner Resnick. Porter and Resnick carried out a successful robbery, netting them $140,000, but Resnick and Lynn betrayed Porter in order to cheat him of his share of the proceeds, shooting him in the back and leaving him for dead. To get his revenge, and to reclaim his $70,000 cut, Porter is forced to take on not only Resnick and Lynn but also the Chinese Triads (the victims of the original robbery), the Outfit, a powerful criminal organisation of which Resnick is a member, and two corrupt cops. His only ally is a prostitute named Rosie. The Outfit also featured in the film of that name; the name is probably code for the Mafia, a word which does not actually appear in either film.The film was the directorial debut of Brian Helgeland, previously better-known as a scriptwriter, and is made in the same neo-noir style as his best-known film as a writer, L.A. Confidential. Mel Gibson, who plays Porter, had also made an earlier excursion into neo-noir with Tequila Sunrise. That film was also made by a director, in that case Robert Towne, who had previously been better known as a screenwriter. One of the faults of Tequila Sunrise was that it was too much of a writer's film and not enough of a director's one, being dominated by too much talk and too little action. Helgeland here handles his material much better than Towne did in the earlier film. As a piece of film-making Payback is a grimly efficient piece of work, with a fast-moving storyline, well-handled action sequences and stark, gritty photography of the seedier parts of New York.The main problem is that Payback lacks any sort of heart. The classic films noirs softened the stark good-versus-evil morality of many earlier crime films, bringing a note of moral ambiguity to the crime drama, and this note was repeated in neo-noirs such as L.A. Confidential. Payback does not merely abandon a strict black-and-white notion of morality; it abandons the whole concept of morality altogether. It was advertised under the slogan Get Ready to Root for the Bad Guy, and although Porter is ostensibly the film's hero there is little difference in moral terms between him and his enemies. He sets out to reclaim what he believes is rightfully his, ignoring the fact that because the money is stolen neither he nor Resnick can claim to have any right to it.Gibson is better here than he was in Tequila Sunrise, where he did not bring much menace to his character, Mac McKussic, or suggest his criminal background. Roger Ebert called him the nicest drug dealer you'd ever want to know. Here his Porter is certainly menacing. The trouble is he's the nastiest hero you'd never want to know, prepared to carry out any crime up to kidnapping and murder for the sake of $70,000. The result is that, whereas Payback is a film one can occasionally admire, it is impossible to love or even to like very much. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Payback, like John Boorman's Point Blank from 1967, is based on Donald E.

Meanwhile the studios kept themselves alive with the last big budget features of old Hollywood. Eventually however as the decade turned the old timers began to die out, while the younger generation of filmmakers began to get their act together and produce movies with maturity and professionalism.The Last Detail was an early directing assignment for one of those young hippies of the previous decade &#x96; Hal Ashby. Ashby shows a smooth competence with the form, being very focused in his introduction of characters. We first see Jack Nicholson filling the foreground with his reclining form (a very typical Ashby composition), while the orderly talking to him is in the background, and for Otis Young's first scene he is held in a long take while the officer has his back to us. What these two contrasting set-ups both do is to really impress these characters on our minds, without distracting us with the face of a minor player (the officer) who will soon be out of the story.There's a shot about ten minutes in when they are all at the back of the bus, and we see a young boy turn in his seat to stare at the three sailors. I don't know whether this little moment was in the script or not, but what is great is the way Ashby gives it just the right level of prominence, so that we are sure to notice it but that it looks entirely coincidental. In other words it doesn't look as if that shot was put in on purpose, although it undoubtedly was. This sort of thing is perhaps what is best about Ashby's style. He doesn't go in for any of those hit-and-miss neo-realist tactics like casting non-professionals or extending scenes of mundane activity, but will ensure that the dramatic storyline is placed in a believable, living environment which interacts with the narrative.The lead star of The Last Detail, Jack Nicholson, got his big break in what is perhaps the archetypal messy, druggy late-60s movie, Easy Rider, in which he was just about the only good thing. His style never changed much; he is never that realistic, and whatever character he inhabits it's still really the same old Jack, but he has such an electrifying presence that he is able to carry a movie. In this way he is a lot like classic-era leading men such as Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart &#x96; with one difference. If Nicholson had come along in the 1930s he would have been limited to comedic supporting roles. Randy Quaid is a rather different kind of player to Nicholson, but no less effective here. What is best about Quaid is the way he develops his performance as the movie goes on. There are his flashes of guilt and general awkwardness in the earliest scenes, but then look at the confident swagger he has after the scene where he complains about his eggs. These changes are palpable yet they are also slight enough that he doesn't turn Meadows into a totally different person.The Last Detail is today a bit of an overlooked movie, lost amongst all the Godfathers and Cuckoo's Nests of its era. But while not exactly a masterpiece, it deserves its place amongst the defining pictures of the early 70s &#x96; a performance-driven, thought-provoking and occasionally poignant little drama. A worthy effort from the new Hollywood.

This is unusual, and I'm not sure I could say that of any other movie, but the atmospheric, other-worldly sounds at critical moments simply make the difference between those scenes being the low-budget exploits of girls exploring a rock outcropping and the kind of stuff that sends chills down your spine no matter how many horror movies you've seen.This is definitely a high-brow horror movie to remember.

The movie is the story of a class of boarding school girls who go to a huge rock formation called Hanging Rock on Valentine's Day, 1900. Three of them, along with a teacher, mysteriously disappear.There are no special effects, no crazy monsters chasing down the abundant supply of heroines. There is immense personal conflict - love and hate - between many of the characters, but much of it is unspoken, to the point where the audience is almost starved for more information, as opposed to bored with a glut of uninteresting sappy details as in many films.

As in all three films of that trilogy, the leading role is taken by Ford's favourite actor, John Wayne, although this film is not set in the West but in Mississippi during the American Civil War. (Despite being set in the eastern half of the USA, it is nevertheless occasionally referred to as a Western).The story is a fictionalised version of the real-life Grierson Raid of 1863 in which a unit of Union Cavalry penetrated deep behind Confederate lines in order to destroy a strategically important railroad junction being used by the Confederates to supply their garrison at Vicksburg. Wayne plays the raid's commander, here called Colonel John Marlowe, who ironically was a railroad building engineer before the war. Apart from the battle scenes, much of the drama in the film arises from the clashes between Marlowe and his politically ambitious second-in-command, Colonel Philip Secord, and between Marlowe and the regimental surgeon, Major Henry Kendall. Kendall makes little secret of his dislike of war and sees himself as a doctor first, a soldier second. He considers that his main duty is to relieve human suffering, wherever it may occur, rather than to further the military aims of the Union armies.An additional complication occurs when the unit stops at a plantation house and Marlowe discovers that the plantation's attractive young mistress Hannah Hunter and her black slave Lukey (played by the tennis star Althea Gibson) have been spying on them. To prevent them from betraying his mission to the Confederate forces, and unwilling to shoot two unarmed women in cold blood, Marlowe is forced to take them with him.Ford does not really attempt to explore the causes of the war or the moral issues involved. Three years earlier he had made The Searchers, in which he analysed the nature of racism in the Old West, but here he does not take up the challenge of analysing racism in the Old South in the same way. Doubtless, however, he was well aware of the economics of Hollywood film-making. The most commercially successful films were those that could appeal to audiences both north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line, and in the fifties a film which took too hard an anti-Confederate line would be likely to alienate Southern sympathies.Although the film is essentially a war film, it combines action with other elements, including psychological analysis and occasional humour. There is even an element of romance, something not generally found in films of this type, as Marlowe falls in love with Constance Towers's Hannah, something I did not find particularly element in the film; it struck me as an unsuccessful attempt to import into an action drama that hoary old convention of the romantic comedy whereby two characters start off as bitter enemies and end up falling in love. (As had had shown in films like A Man Betrayed, Wayne was not the world's greatest exponent of romantic comedy). Wayne is, however, very good when he concentrates on being a tough soldier rather than a sentimental lover, and William Holden is also good as the no-nonsense medic Kendall. The Horse Soldiers is not perhaps quite in the same league as The Searchers or Fort Apache, but it is a good action-drama and one of the better Ford\/Wayne collaborations. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In The Horse Soldiers John Ford returns to the theme of the US Cavalry which he had immortalised in his Cavalry Trilogy made around a decade earlier.

It works marvelously, because noir itself is the cracked reflection of a world that is not ordinary, often it happens inside heads and thoughts or it adopts a kind of nightmare logic, and because the small details that would be only proper in a sci-fi world attain an uncanny quality in this context.This dichotomy between past and present is touched upon in the film too, we're told only the present matters because it's the only time we can live in rather than a time to remember or fear. Caught between a Mike Hammer or Sam Spade private dick and a HAL 9000, the remembrance of a Humphrey Bogart and the premonition of a Kubrick film to come, Alphaville seems to invite us to live in the present narative, in time as it happens. Lemmy Caution's habit of taking photographs of everything, ostensibly his espionage trade, attains a double meaning here; present time is captured for posterity in his camera, but also in Godard's. I love the scenes of urban nightlife captured by that fleeting camera, it's one of things I appreciated in Breathless, also one of the things I look for in my noirs like Blast of Silence.

It's also about the same time that Lemmy Caution starts shooting people, like the two film styles are duking it out inside the Godard film. Again with a Godard film I don't like the constant verbiage. It's the same with Bergman, I like him as a director of images but his literary ambition leaves me indifferent. Godard's barrage of poetic reference takes something out from the pleasure of watching the film for me; likely a director can be a poet with words, but I prefer it when he's a poet with a camera.What's again problematic for me is Godard himself, his persona that looms over the film. Like the Alpha 60, he speaks in his films from all directions, from the mouths of disparate characters. It's a tricky game to try and decipher what we're meant to take seriously, what is being mocked. I was ready to clap in the end when Anna Karina says I love you, a corny moment in any film, but finally there's emotional clarity, something is at last embraced or committed to in a Godard film. Then I read a user comment which read irony in that declaration. Does Natasha Vonbraun mean or know what she says and does Lemmy give a damn, I'm not too sure.This may be the genius of Godard, or our own folly. Do we take nothing of what he says seriously for fear that he pulled one over on us? It's like the Aesop myth with the sheep herder calling out for help. It's strange though how he went in just two years from the individualism of Alphaville to the call for revolution in Week End.

There's not too much of it, but I prefer the Alphaville that takes place inside cheap hotels. It's also about the same time that Lemmy Caution starts shooting people, like the two film styles are duking it out inside the Godard film. Again with a Godard film I don't like the constant verbiage. It's the same with Bergman, I like him as a director of images but his literary ambition leaves me indifferent. Godard's barrage of poetic reference takes something out from the pleasure of watching the film for me; likely a director can be a poet with words, but I prefer it when he's a poet with a camera.What's again problematic for me is Godard himself, his persona that looms over the film. Like the Alpha 60, he speaks in his films from all directions, from the mouths of disparate characters. It's a tricky game to try and decipher what we're meant to take seriously, what is being mocked. I was ready to clap in the end when Anna Karina says I love you, a corny moment in any film, but finally there's emotional clarity, something is at last embraced or committed to in a Godard film. Then I read a user comment which read irony in that declaration. Does Natasha Vonbraun mean or know what she says and does Lemmy give a damn, I'm not too sure.This may be the genius of Godard, or our own folly. Do we take nothing of what he says seriously for fear that he pulled one over on us? It's like the Aesop myth with the sheep herder calling out for help. It's strange though how he went in just two years from the individualism of Alphaville to the call for revolution in Week End. Likely in that period he finally discovered a cause to adopt, a reason to make films other than the simple pleasure of it, but I like him better without one.

For Your Eyes Only was, until the 007 franchise went into an even steeper nosedive with the risible Octopussy and the creaking A View To A Kill, quite comfortably the worst effort so far. Many reviewers on here have suggested this film was a much-needed return to down-to-earth, gritty realism after the space-set absurdity of Moonraker. But as ridiculous as it was trying to cash-in on the success of Star Wars by sending 007 into orbit, I would argue For Your Eyes Only is every bit as absurd. And I'd go further and say that at least Moonraker was a spectacle and was consistent with its own internal logic. From its catastrophic casting to its laughable plot, FYEO fails at every turn, with Roger Moore turning in, once again, his pensionable-clown-spy shtick. Director John Glen tries to bullseye all the right Bondian staples, with girls, gunfights, villains and set pieces. But like the henchmen Bond battles, he's wide of the mark every time. The girls, for instance; lead foil Carole Bouquet, playing the Elektra-like daughter Melinda, manages to turn in a performance so static she could well have been one of the Greek statues she was so interested in preserving. She may have been a Chanel model, but her performance stinks. At the other end of the emoting spectrum, superfluous character Bibi ramps up the cringe factor by literally throwing her 17-year-old self at the then 54-year-old Moore. Thankfully, Jimmy doesn't indulge. The other female character, the 'scouse Countess', was another character with zero reason to be involved. As with the winter scenes (more later), her inclusion was completely irrelevant. She was a character who posed no threat to the bad guy, so there was no reason for her to be targeted. Apart from, or course, that Bond could then have a Dune Buggy scene. Which leads me to believe dune buggy's were all the rage that summer (see the winter scenes bit below). The girls may have been redundant, but the men involved were also totally forgettable. Apart from a charismatic turn from Topol as Bond sidekick Columbo (who still manages to train his binoculars horizontally whilst following Bond up a vertical cliff-face), the bad guys are personality vacuums. Where previous Bond films had larger-than-life foes, FYEO has the dullest and dumbest yet.Kristatos (Julian Glover) the bad boss-man was possibly one of the more unimposing villains in the 007 canon. His master plan is so non-diabolical is could have been conceived in a monastery. Which is where he ends up. The KGB Biathalon assassin, who is supposedly a high-profile sportsman but yet still tries to kill Bond mid-competition, in broad daylight, tries to finish off Bond by throwing a motorbike in his general direction. Hardly a crotch-crawling laser beam, is it?A mainstay of the 007 films has always been their interest in contemporary trends. Whether that be locations or cultural pursuits, the reason Moore was rocketed into space was because of Star Wars. So when planning the set pieces of FYEO, the public fascination with the Winter Olympics of 1980 in Lake Placid loomed large. Inevitable then that some skiing be involved. Spying and skiing go together like vodka and Martini. It can be extremely exciting (OHMSS, The Spy Who Loved Me). But to then add in an ice hockey assassination attempt?!! Bond body checking one thug into the net with a Zamboni?? Did the guy not see that coming? That scene was laughable. But to then crowbar in a ski-jump scene, a biathlon and bobsleigh. Mr Glen, are you sure we've referenced winter sports enough here? I suppose I should be thankful we didn't see a laser-guided curling-stone bomb, or a machine gun equipped ice sculpture...To continue the ridiculous theme, the car chase at the start included the pursuing thugs drawing alongside Bond's 2CV and receiving a condescending eyebrow arch from our hero (where'd I put my gun, it'd be handy to have a projectile weapon right about now?), the final cliff-climbing scene had one bad guy descend on a rope alone to knock out Bond's pitons with the grip of his pistol (where did I put my gun, it's be handy to have a projectile weapon right about now?) and Kristatos's death-by-coral attempt on Bond has to be one of the most drawn out ideas ever by a villain. If Bond hadn't escaped, he could literally have been at that for HOURS (where did I put my gun... etc). The films have to be fantastical, I know, but they should at least stay consistent to their own internal logic. If Kristatos needed it to look like an accidental drowning, fair enough. But there were literally no witnesses. This was just dumb.Which brings me, finally to the plot. Right at the start, we have a missing ATAC device. The MacGuffin that everyone is after. MI6 know it's off the coast of Albania. They know Malina was on board the ship that was looking for it. So where is Bond sent? To look for the assassin that killed Malina's parents. Why? It's irrelevant who wants the ATAC. Retrieve it or destroy it. Simple. But nope. Bond is sent on a mission to retrieve the ATAC by finding a man hired by a man hired by another man who want to sell the device to the KGB. It just doesn't make sense. Characters make illogical decisions, trying to push the plot forward. I appreciate a good plot as much as the next man, but is HAS to be internally logical, or it just becomes a joke. For Your Eyes Only, for many reasons, is certainly laughable. It beggars belief that Roger Moore went on to do two more (where did I put my gun....?)

It was a critical and commercial success and was nominated for a record 14 Academy Awards, a feat which has since been matched (by Titanic in 1997) but never bettered. Of those fourteen nominations it won six categories, including Best Picture. And yet it is a film completely different in style to anything likely to win Best Picture today. It perhaps illustrates the changes in film-making which took place during the second half of the 20th century better than any other Big Film of its era. Indeed, it is very different to most other Best Picture winners of the 1950s. It is not a light-hearted musical like An American in Paris or Gigi or an action film like The Greatest Show on Earth, Bridge on the River Kwai or Ben-Hur. It is made in the filmed theatre style of cinema, the sort of film which was shot in the studio and concentrated on dialogue and character development rather than physical action. (Such films were usually, although not always, made in black-and-white rather than colour). This was the sort of film which had dominated during the thirties and forties but which began to lose favour in the fifties as the studios demanded more in the way of spectacle. The film is set in the world of the theatre and reflects the mutual antipathy between Hollywood and Broadway at this period, something also referred to in Singin' in the Rain from two years later. Both leading characters are female. Bette Davis plays Margo Channing, a leading Broadway star- hugely popular, but beginning to show her age as she approaches forty. (Rather pointedly, her current play is titled Aged in Wood). Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington, an obsessive young fan with theatrical ambitions herself. After Eve is introduced to the older woman, Margo befriends her, and offers her a job as her assistant. Eve initially seems well-intentioned and helpful, but it soon becomes clear that she is using Margo to further her own ambitions. All About Eve remains the only film ever to receive four female acting Oscar nominations. (Besides Davis and Baxter for Best Actress, the others went to Celeste Holm, who plays Margo's close friend Karen Richards, and Thelma Ritter as her maid Birdie for Best Supporting Actress). Despite this galaxy of female talent, however, the only acting award it actually won went to George Sanders as Best Supporting Actor. Sanders plays the gossipy, spiteful and sarcastic theatre critic Addison DeWitt, who both acts as the film's narrator and also plays an important role in the action. Addison DeWitt, actually, sounds a much more plausible name for an American than for an Englishman- Sanders makes no attempt to hide his British accent- but the name seems to have been chosen symbolically, Addison being a reference to the eighteenth-century critic and DeWitt presumably a pun on the wit. The role of Margo has become so closely associated with Bette Davis that it seems strange to think that she was not the first choice for it. Claudette Colbert was cast in the role, but had to withdraw with a back injury, and several other actresses were considered. Davis, however, was precisely the right choice to play the ageing Margo. (Coincidentally, Sunset Boulevard, probably All About Eve 's closest rival for Best Picture, is also about an ageing actress). In her youth in the 1930s, Davis was considered a beauty, known for her large, limpid eyes, but by 1950 her looks had faded although she was only in her early forties. (Colbert was five years older but looked much younger). She delivers what has become a legendary performance- arrogant and bitchy, yet also vulnerable to Eve's scheming in the battle of youth versus age. The film did much to re-establish Davis's career after something of a slump in the late forties. This film changed the way in which I regarded Anne Baxter. I had previously seen her as primarily a supporting actress, someone who only achieved leading lady status in films like I Confess or The Ten Commandments where the emphasis is much more on the male characters. Here, however, she emerges as a real star in her own right and gives a great performance as the cunning, manipulative Eve. (She also look stunning with that short, boyish haircut, something not all actresses could have pulled off). I can well understand why she insisted on being Oscar-nominated for Best Actress, even though she might well have won for Best Supporting Actress. In the event she and Davis both lost out to Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday; as I have never seen that film I will not comment on the wisdom of the Academy's decision. Holm and Ritter are also very good, and there is a brief but vital contribution at the end from Barbara Bates, an actress I had not previously come across. I will not enter into the controversy about whether both Eve and Addison are supposedly gay, except to say that this was not an interpretation that occurred to me, and that Eve's predatory designs on Margo's boyfriend Bill argue against it. There are films from this era, such as Caught and Strangers on a Train, which strike me as having a possible homosexual subtext, but this is not one of them. All About Eve is not, officially, a comedy, but it has a brilliantly witty script, written by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, with far more wit and humour than many so-called comedies, and manages to combine that wit with a gripping psychological drama and some first-class acting. It is a long time since I last saw Sunset Boulevard, so will not attempt to compare the two directly, but both must count among the finest films not just of the year but also of the decade. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" All About Eve was the Big Film of 1950.

(She also look stunning with that short, boyish haircut, something not all actresses could have pulled off). I can well understand why she insisted on being Oscar-nominated for Best Actress, even though she might well have won for Best Supporting Actress. In the event she and Davis both lost out to Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday; as I have never seen that film I will not comment on the wisdom of the Academy's decision. Holm and Ritter are also very good, and there is a brief but vital contribution at the end from Barbara Bates, an actress I had not previously come across. I will not enter into the controversy about whether both Eve and Addison are supposedly gay, except to say that this was not an interpretation that occurred to me, and that Eve's predatory designs on Margo's boyfriend Bill argue against it. There are films from this era, such as Caught and Strangers on a Train, which strike me as having a possible homosexual subtext, but this is not one of them. All About Eve is not, officially, a comedy, but it has a brilliantly witty script, written by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, with far more wit and humour than many so-called comedies, and manages to combine that wit with a gripping psychological drama and some first-class acting. It is a long time since I last saw Sunset Boulevard, so will not attempt to compare the two directly, but both must count among the finest films not just of the year but also of the decade. 9\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"25 January 2011","score":"","review":" Joel Schumacher has built a notoriety for making potentially amazing movies and turning them into mush. Look what he did in Batman Returns by making the Batsuit look like car rugs sewn together. Not to completely chastise him, he can be a really good director if he wanted to, but his failures seem to get the best of him and catches him off guard. Falling Down had tons of potential to captivate its audience as an eye-catching drama with plenty of commentary for good measure. And it succeeds in that spectrum thanks mostly to Schumacher, but with the help of the always impressive Michael Douglas during the first two-thirds of this movie. Douglas' perspective stands true to today's economy that even the rising price of a can of soda can raise angst among society as a whole. His frustration on the golf course represents shows how much he sympathizes the lower-class people in society. Up until, Falling Down have we ever seen Douglas annihilate a phone booth and that's when the movie bone's the fish. By shooting stuff for no real purpose is when we discover the film has lost its spunk.And so, as Douglas rants about the negativity of society, these comments become very random or sever the viewer's minds with it obviousness. Going back to the golf course scene, this would've been the best scene in the movie had Schumacher prevented Douglas from making a mockery of himself with unnecessary preachy diatribes. Ever since special effects came into prominence in movies, Hollywood has never mastered the skills of subtlety. Every problem in movies can be resolved with just a large dose of violence and hostility. It's as if they think the audience will buy into it. Like we're all a bunch of idiots. And so I say that Falling Down is strong in entertainment value and a film that anyone can enjoy. The Achilles Heel in this movie is that the ending didn't live up to its promise from its outstanding beginning. Too bad because as long as Schumacher is at the helm, he'll continue to make movies that builds on momentum with a disappointing outcome in the end.

Like a prologue before I start with the book itself.I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie.What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment.Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love.I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen\/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it.
