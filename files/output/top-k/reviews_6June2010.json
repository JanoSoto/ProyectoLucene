Kazaam was on demand and I asked if any the girls had seen it, only one of my friends did and I asked if it really was as bad as everyone says it is. She said she didn't remember since she saw it as a kid so we all decided to go for the bait and see if Kazaam really does deserve one of the worst movies in cinema titles. Oh, yeah, it really does. I could not believe how bad this movie was. Shaq has the acting quality of a wooden shelf, the kid who is supposed to be a hero is actually a brat, the villain of the story looks like a chewed up version of Mario from Super Mario Brothers and the story does not make sense for the child audience it was aimed for. How in the heck is a child supposed to relate to this story of trying to get his pirate music stealing father back with his mother while being stalked by a 7 foot tall grown man offering him free treats and all the presents in the world and OH MY GOD does that not sound so bad?! There are so many things wrong with this movie it drives me insane.A schoolboy named Max is confronted and chased down by a group of bullies through the city of New Bronslin. Max is chased into the abandoned building, where he discovers a magical boom-box and accidentally unleashes the genie inside. The genie, who introduces himself as Kazaam, tells Max that he is now Max's genie. Max returns home to find that his mother is marrying a fireman. It is revealed that his mother lied to him about his real father's whereabouts, and that he is actually located in the city. Max set out to search for his father in the hopes of rekindling some sort of bond between them. He suddenly encounters Kazaam during his travels, who pesters Max into making a wish. Max eventually finds his father, only to learn that he is a musical talent agent who specializes in pirated music. A employee of the nightclub shows interest in Kazaam upon the realization that he is a genie, and hopes to control Kazaam through Max's father.Between the awful acting, the terrible script and the lousy effects, this movie is just plain bad. This is how bad this is, Shaq literally slam dunks the villain to defeat him! If that's not a plug in for his career, I don't know what is. The kid Max has no likable qualities, he has a very loving mother and a possible step father who cares for him, yet he acts like a total jerk because he's not getting his way with not having his dad around who is a criminal no less! Even when his criminal father kicks him out of his life, Max still does everything to save him, sick isn't it? Shaq, I don't know the writers were thinking. Maybe that it's so funny that a giant basketball super star should be a genie and it's a great way to make a quick buck for those sucker parents who's kids are begging to see the film. I don't know how to say this other than just say it, it really is as bad as everyone says it is if not worse. Trust me, don't waste your sanity on this horrible movie, Shaq's acting is enough to make you wish this movie never existed in the first place.1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 June 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The other day my girlfriends and I were having our pizza night and looking for movies to watch.

One involves all the men getting drunk and piling into a car with Marilyn Monroe. Gable and Clift fall asleep in the back seat, leaving the besotted Wallach to drive them home at 90 miles an hour, rambling on about how many people, horses, and dishes he destroyed while bombing nine European cities during the war, while a frantic Monroe sympathizes with him and begs him to slow down.They arrive at Gable's and Wallach's dilapidated rural homestead. The trip from Reno, Nevada, has taken some time. Now, in an ordinary movie, the men would be sober and grumpy as they wake up and tumble out of the station wagon. Instead, Huston has them still drunk. It's a hilarious and very masculine moment as Clift staggers around tearing the bandages from his half-shattered skull, demanding to know what they are, challenging the others and shouting, You put me at a DISADVANTAGE? He's stumbling over boards and falling down and Gable is growling with laughter and throwing mock punches at him from ten feet away. I imagine the writer, Arthur Miller, to whose wife, Marilyn, this is a paean, wrote the scene but Huston really put it together. Miller gives her some good lines though. In the blazing stillness of the desert, Marilyn remarks, It's so quiet out here. You can hear your clothes against your skin.Another memorable scene has Marilyn in a polka-dot dress whanging away at a paddle ball in a Reno saloon while all those part of her that must shake during such an exercise jiggle away.The most powerful scene, and it's rather long, appears at the end. The boys have taken Marilyn out to the desert to watch them rope wild mustangs that will be sold to the canneries for dog and cat food. The first time I saw this, in a theater, I was impressed, but this time around I found it a bit more than just a dramatic action scene.Instead of the hundreds of ponies that used to roam the highlands, the band is now only able to round up half a dozen, including a mare and her year-old foal, and the stallion who runs the remuda. Shocked and repelled, the nurturant Marilyn runs away and disembowels the men in long shot. Gable fights the stallion to a point of mutual exhaustion and then releases the creature and his small brood.You can't rope a dream. The mustangs represented his only real opportunity of avoiding wage work and having to take orders from someone else. For Gable, the problem isn't horses. It's history passing him by, and it's age too. The ground has shifted under his feet. Clift has already accepted this, though he has his own demons to contend with. Wallach is not yet ready to give up and screams insults at the others as they drive off and leave him behind.Gable's fate is to settle down and do wage work while living with and eventually marrying Marilyn Monroe. Now, that's my kind of surrender.I doubt that the film would be as good as it is without Huston's having directed it. (As it is, there are some talky moments and author Miller has made some things too explicit and some exchanges too wordy.) But, just for example, who else would have staged that climactic scene in which Monroe excoriates the men for their brutality so that she is seen about fifty yards away and can barely be heard? It's not really a tragic tale. There's a good deal of comedy in it, the characters are user friendly, and, to tell the truth, all that cowboy masculinity, hairy and angular, needed a touch of tender-minded femininity.

","genre":"Drama, Romance, Western"},{"date":"6 June 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" While not for all tastes, this is an excellent filmIt has been filmed as if each individual frame of film is a painting.The story is archetypal but interesting, telling the story of the rise and fall of an anti-hero. Ryan O'Neal in the title role is a real surprise and is engaging despite being a character that is deliberately dislike-able. In fact as the character rises up the social ladder, with setbacks on the way, I began to sympathise with the character more. When the character makes it, the film then shifts to be a study of hubris and the character becomes deliberately dislike-able again. Even when the character undertakes a surprising redemptive turn, it is appropriate, and perhaps inevitable that the character becomes subject to the very type the act that he would be more than happy to meat out to other individuals, and certainly does to his stepson, played well by Leon Vitali as his older form, but absolutely brilliantly by in the younger form by child actor, now TV director Dominic Savage. The young Bullingdon comes across as more mature than some of the adult characters that surround him. Other performances are all good and appropriate for the story. Kubrick again makes use of performers he has worked with before, notably Philip Stone as the Lyndon's family lawyer, Leonard Rossiter and the cowardly Captain Quinn, Anthony Sharpe as Lord Hallam, and and excellent Godfrey Quigley as Captain Grogan, the only character with genuine warmth and integrity in the story.The plot progresses at a steady pace. As a viewer, you have to be patient to be rewarded by it. Less patient viewers will see it as boring but then Kubrick as a director expects you to be patient. He was patient with actors in his films, as evidenced by very long shooting schedules and working with actors not to rush when planning their performances; he was patient putting his films together is post production. He therefore expects audiences to be patient. The story is in effect a series of rises and falls of fortune, culminating in a fall at the end of the film. In fact, this major fall is the character's own making, and I did feel frustrated that the character started making a series of wrong choices, not helped by the hubristic attitude of Lyndon's mother, who is well played by Irish actor Marie Kean. Therefore, it was clear that the film had succeeded in drawing me in despite the objective, observational style of the film, with an effective narration by Michael Hordern.Technical credits are outstanding, which is typical for Kubrick films of this period. John Alcott's photography gives great realism to the period, lighting scenes to suggest natural light sources, rather than more typical feature film compositional lighting. Camera-work is more subtle than in previous Kubrick films. However, Kubrick does make very effective use of slow zooms to help tell the story. It is no surprise that Alcott won an Oscar for his work.

In fact as the character rises up the social ladder, with setbacks on the way, I began to sympathise with the character more.

As a viewer, you have to be patient to be rewarded by it. Less patient viewers will see it as boring but then Kubrick as a director expects you to be patient. He was patient with actors in his films, as evidenced by very long shooting schedules and working with actors not to rush when planning their performances; he was patient putting his films together is post production. He therefore expects audiences to be patient. The story is in effect a series of rises and falls of fortune, culminating in a fall at the end of the film. In fact, this major fall is the character's own making, and I did feel frustrated that the character started making a series of wrong choices, not helped by the hubristic attitude of Lyndon's mother, who is well played by Irish actor Marie Kean. Therefore, it was clear that the film had succeeded in drawing me in despite the objective, observational style of the film, with an effective narration by Michael Hordern.Technical credits are outstanding, which is typical for Kubrick films of this period. John Alcott's photography gives great realism to the period, lighting scenes to suggest natural light sources, rather than more typical feature film compositional lighting. Camera-work is more subtle than in previous Kubrick films. However, Kubrick does make very effective use of slow zooms to help tell the story. It is no surprise that Alcott won an Oscar for his work.

And this is part of the reason that since the collapse of the studio system American movie production has been locked in cycles of irony and self-parody. Motion pictures tended to imitate the life around them, and in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? you have, played out on screen for your enjoyment, the sorry states of two grandes dames of cinema - Bette Davis and Joan Crawford - and the much-maligned producer-director Robert Aldrich.The two leading ladies famously had a longstanding rivalry, and it's often commented on how this fuelled their performances. Maybe this is the case, but it's interesting how their portrayals here relate to their offscreen personae. This is among Miss Crawford's finest turns, and in fact one rough way to guage the strength of her acting is in how amiable she comes across, since it's fairly well-documented that in real life she was conniving, selfish and abusive to her children. Funnily enough though I don't think Crawford realised the irony of her warm screen image - she probably believed she was a nice person. Compare this to Davis, who was wryly aware of her reputation for bitchiness both on screen and off, and very knowingly pushes that image to its credible limits as Baby Jane. It is perhaps her most exaggerated role, but also appears to be one of her most effortless as she hams beautifully on the cusp between realism and caricature, in a performance that matches that garish crust of makeup.And makeup is really integral to Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, in an era where such things were not highly considered (for example we only have only had an Academy Award for it since 1981). Bette Davis is a startling sight, with cheeks like chalk and enough mascara to sink a battleship, inadvertently accentuating her age rather than concealing it. It might seem a step too far outside of a comedy, but it's worth bearing in mind that makeup is for women a primary means of expression and even a form of defence and self-denial, and there are plenty of women in real life who look just as ghastly as Davis does here. And for proof of that one need look no further than co-star Crawford, who since the early 40s had perpetually sported her trademark pencil-eyebrowed, thin-lipped, ghost-faced visage, an unintentionally macabre look if ever there was one. Appropriately however, Crawford's slap has been toned down for this picture, and in one or two of the later scenes we see her looking very natural, and incidentally the most beautiful she has appeared since the 1930s.As far as I know producer-director Robert Alrich never wore makeup, but he is an intriguing figure behind this little drama nonetheless. He had been on the scene since the early-40s, directed several pictures of varying quality in the mid-50s, and became a Hollywood exile after helming the controversial drama The Big Knife. After shooting a couple of flicks abroad, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? was his comeback. Rather than going wild in the more liberal post-studio system industry, he shows his technique to have matured and refined in his years away. There is a bit less of the shameless attention-grabbing of his earlier pictures, but still that deliberately odd and slightly detached look to each shot - god-shots, low angles, foreground clutter - which is simply ideal for this intense (but not totally mindless) melodrama.To be honest though Aldrich was always a better producer than a director. Although he rarely took a writing credit he appears to have taken a hand in post-production structuring, and one of his neatest touches was to always have the opening credits several minutes into the picture, creating a prologue and leaving the grand opening to announce the real beginning of the story. He was also great when it came to assembling production teams. Here the crowded art set decoration of George Sawley is complemented by the grimy cinematography of Ernest Haller to create a musty, decaying look to the Hudson's mansion. It's also worth remembering that while Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is adapted from a novel, it was Aldrich that made its commentary on Hollywood politics far closer to the bone by deciding to cast Davis and Crawford.Is this picture then a vicious attack on the fallout from the star system, as was The Big Knife? If it was, it was a bit late, since Hollywood no longer worked in quite the same way. Besides, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is far more affectionate, almost nostalgic in tone. Davis in particular probably regarded it as rather fun - after all she had been playing washed-up, ageing actresses since Dangerous in 1935; at least this time round she had the chance to inject a bit of over-the-top of absurdism. And Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is after all verging on comedy. True, the only aspect which is truly funny is the supporting part brilliantly played by Victor Buono, but the overall feel is one that suggests that joking could occur at any moment, and in fact it is this slightly bizarre tone that keeps this unusually lengthy suspense thriller as spellbinding entertainment.

The women are too resigned to men cheating than...we would be!If you're maybe college age...perhaps this movie (part FRESH - part DATED) ..... makes your grandma (great-grandma) seem real! That woman (in the black and white old photo in your family album---probably wearing a hat, veil, and fur piece around her neck...she's flesh & blood. Her heart could break as easily as yours!!!) And she could be as funny as any of your Facebook friends!A few comments about the best character of all--- the Silly Sylvia Fowler... ..... Silliest of the Silly Characters is played by Rosalind Russell, an actress who was fun, witty---yet was NOT a Sylvia Fowler Airhead. Roz Russell got a pile of humanitarian awards for her charity work. In fact, this movie THE WOMEN helped Roz get matched with her only husband!.First, THE WOMEN was shown over & over...on a boat which crossed the Atlantic...to passengers who hoped & prayed the Nazis would not torpedo and sink their boat. One Danish man aboard that boat even hunted down Rosalind Russell and got his friend Cary Grant to introduce him.

The film is a beautiful depiction of broad humanism. It shows how each character has their own motivations to get ahead in life. By using broad humanism, it's showing each character is multiply faceted and is built with flaws like in real life. An example of this is Perhan's journey throughout the film and his ultimate demise due to his insistent need for revenge at any cost. Perhan's story was an unusual coming of age story intertwined with elements of magical realism. Magical realism was another important aspect in the film. It is understood in the film that Perhan has telekinetic abilities in which seem unimportant in the start of the film but are later tied in for the revenge scene against his former mentor, Ahmed. I thought the female relationships that Perhan carried were extremely influential throughout the film. He was close to his grandmother, who raised him due to his mother's dead during his childbirth. She was a maternal figure in his life who taught him right and wrong despite their economic status and lives as gypsies. His younger sister, Danira was his beacon of hope and his second chance to do the right thing and leave his grimy past behind. There is a point in the film when he is on the train, reunited with Danira and his son and he has the choice to leave on the train with them, but he chooses to get his revenge on Ahmed instead. It's a heart wrenching scene to see his young son begging Perhan to stay with them. You can get the sense that the son knows he won't see the father again. The most important relationship in the film is the relationship between Perhan and his girlfriend, Azra. She represented innocence and pure love throughout the film from the first time she is shown to her death. Overall, the film is a beautiful story about a young boy growing up and having to go against the various conflicts in his life.

Since Polanski has been in trouble & his new film released I have been trying to catch up on some of his films I had not seen. PLOT British couple Fiona & Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman, & that night Nigel meets her while dancing alone in the ship's bar. Later he meets her crippled American husband Oscar, who tells him their story. While living in Paris for several years trying to be a writer, he becomes obsessed with a woman he met by chance on a bus. He tracks her down & they start a steamy love affair. Soon Oscar finds himself enslaved body & soul by her love, & continues to tell Nigel the details of this (this woman is played by Polanskis wife Emmanuelle Seigne) relationship in various stages over a number of visits to Oscar's cabin. Here the film settles down into a series of long flashbacks detailing Coyote-Seigner's tempestuous love life. Coyote's scheme seems to be to lure Grant into Seigner's bed to perform the marital duties that he is unable to perform. This film reminds me of Damage or other French amor-fou movies. Film wants to be epic in scope but does not succeed. Details revealed to me were just presented in a tawdry or lurid way. Nothing in the plot really grabbed me & involved me. Fiona did interest me as I had just seen her new French movie with her (an English gal) speaking French. There are some interesting parts & scenes to this movie however I was just plain bored & not really engaged into the movie. There is a real horrible fascination as Polanski goes every which way with the material. But the only real bait is finding out how Coyote ended up in a wheelchair. It is downhill fast after that. In reality the film reminded me of Misery (Stephen King) The film plot & dialogues are all very cruel & cruelly presented. At times it seemed downright mean. I just got no enjoyment as there was no point to the cruelty as in Misery. Skip this one.
