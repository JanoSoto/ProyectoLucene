HERE'S THE LINK FOR MAGIC MAGIC REVIEW http\/\/www.imdb.com\/user\/ur42840778\/?ref_=nv_usr_prof_2The '90s seemed to be all about Pulp Fiction, but I'm not talking about that big film today, as for this review it's about the 1999 Cult Classic Go. Many critics claimed it to be the best ripoff of Pulp Fiction, not granted I've never seen Pulp Fiction (I will one day), but after watching Go I can kinda get an idea on what it's about. Go takes place over the course of a Christmas Night, in both Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and follows several young adults doing some stupid stuff. First we meet Ronna (Sarah Polley), a 24 Hour Store clerk who's in desperate need of some cash for rent, or else she'll be evicted. She decides to take her co-worker Simon's (Desmond Askew) shift while he goes to Las Vegas with some friends of his. But she soon gets the opportunity to make some more money when a pair of Soap Opera actors (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolfe) walk in hoping to score some drugs, since they usually go to Simon for drugs. Ronna gets her co- worker friend Manny (Nathan Bexton) and her more levelheaded friend Claire (Katie Holmes) to help out when she gets the supply from a drug dealer named Todd (Timothy Olyphant), but soon things get hectic. What I told you was just one part of the story, there is much more craziness to be had in this film, and I mean crazy in a great way. Go is one of the most entertaining movies about nothing. Director Doug Liman (Swingers) does a great job directing this fast paced adventure. There's plenty of cool camera tricks and great editing, that shows us Liman's cinematography skills. The script by John August is also darkly hysterical with many quotable lines. And the acting all around is great, with the standouts being Polley, Mohr, Wolfe, Holmes, Olyphant, and Askew. Problems include a slightly anti-climatic ending, and some illogical scenes, but in the end, a few words to say about this film are GO see it.

While the song is never heard at that moment, we all visualize it with I Will Always Love You playing in the background. That image of Houston in Costner's arms is one of the most defining of the romantic nineties, Houston's feet never touched the ground but her soul touched our hearts forever and even more after her untimely passing, last year.It's the mark of great movies to be able to capture the soul of a relationship by only using the simplicity of images and music a film like Titanic will always be remembered for the flying-over-the-boat moment and My Heart Will Go On, Ghost for the pottery scene erotically conducted with the Unchained Melody, and Dirty Dancing when Johnny gives Baby the time of her life after putting her off the corner, and so on and so forth. And whether the film is good or bad becomes almost pointless when it reaches such a classic status. Cinema is not a rational world you know, imagery, lyrics, music have their 'word' to say and sometimes it transcends any attempt of an objective reasoning.My tone is partly defensive because I'm aware of The Bodyguard's reputation, I know that the film met with mixed to negative critics, that it was panned for its formulaic story, for the wooden performance of Kevin Costner, the eternal Razzie's scapegoat, and even Whitney Houston, didn't escape from criticism. The Bodyguard would almost need a bodyguard of critic to reply to its harsh disapproval. But I believe a film is also to judge in retrospect, at the light of what it has become and what has generally become of Cinema for the years after. Take all the movies I mentioned, with the exception of Titanic, a few romances ever make it now to the top highest grossing films of the year. We thought the 90's to be 'cynical' but in comparison with the 2010's, it's the 60's.Today, most successful films are action blockbusters \/ Pixar \/ Marvel adventures' adaptations or successful franchises, the recipe for success is clearly established, and a film like The Bodyguard wouldn't have necessarily worked or even been considered to be made. Take the script, written 20 years before the release (for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross as the leads) a former ex-Secret Service Agent is assigned to protect a pop star whose life is threatened by a stalker, the material is simple but it's only through the casting that Mick Jackson elevates it, by confronting two of the then most inevitable faces of show-business. Costner is Frank Farmer and Houston Rachel Marron, but we all know she's playing herself, like Ava Gardner in The Barefoot Contessa, she gets a role tailor-made for her, and a powerful testimony for the person, that she was.Marron is Houston, and vice versa, a diva whose talent and unique voice brought her on the top of the billboards and the kind of spotlight that unveils the darkest side of stardom. As Costner said in his eulogy anyone could have played the leading man, but only Whitney Houston could have played that part; in one sense, he was right, even a star like Madonna wouldn't have fit the film. She already played in movies, which would have damaged her credibility as a 'vulnerable' star. Houston showed enough strength to convince us as a diva (because she was one) but she was fragile enough to need a strong shoulder to put her head on. But Costner is wrong about himself, he always cherished lone-ranger roles, men who combined both competence and high morality, with a wound in his past, so only him or a younger Clint Eastwood could have made it work.And both Costner and Houston make it work. And the film never treats the interracial romance as if it was relevant to the story, but nevertheless it accentuates the gap between the two characters. He works in secrecy, she's a star, he takes his job in a no-nonsense way, she embraces celebrity with full arms, knowing that it's part of her competence to be available to the crowd of fans. These contradictions create many situations where they have to make the rules, to adapt to each other, but we know these scenes are only meant to make their chemistry grow slowly and surely until the romance finally blooms. The romance is convincing because it starts as respect, understanding, and empathy to the point of when it happens, we don't feel it contrived, but as natural, exhilarating and passionate as the song that defines it.Indeed, I Will Always Love You is the darlings of Karaoke and the ultimate test in musical reality programs, and that's a credit to Whitney Houston's miraculous talent for having made both the opening and conclusion, such milestones in the world of music. It was Costner who picked the original Dolly Parton's song and suggested Houston should remake it. That fact alone proves that his casting was a blessing. The Bodyguard is as great as a film can get in terms of impact, and music enhances it to an extraordinarily emotional level, being till now, the all-time best-selling soundtrack.Naturally, The Bodyguard was nominated for every Razzie Award possible, but like I said for Mommie Dearest, some films stick in our mind, no matter how seemingly bad they are for some pompous critics, and that's the kind of achievement some 'greater' movies fail to achieve. The only difference is that I called Mommie Dearest a guilty pleasure, while I don't feel so guilty for having enjoyed The Bodyguard.

With the unintentional aid of eccentric friend, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), Marty is sent back to the time of his parent's teenage years in a time machine that is powered by Plutonium. Marty then has to bring his parents together again while diverting his mother's romantic interest in Marty, making it very awkward, so he and his siblings would still exist.Back to the Future was the biggest movie for the year of 1985. Back to the Future was an all-time kids favourite and also enjoyed by adults, as I still watch the movie from time to time and thoroughly enjoy it. There have been other movies in production that copies the time travelling concept but hasn't come close to the greatness of Back to the Future.

All of those combinations make Carlito's Way one of the greatest Gangster Films ever made and is Brian De Palma,Al Pacino and Sean Penn at their best.Based on the novels Carlito's Way and After Hours by Edwin Torres and set in New York City in 1975,Carlito's Way tells the story Carlito Brigante,(Al Pacino)a former drug dealer who after five years in prison has been released. While out of prison,Carlito wants to go straight and get out of the business and rekindle a relationship with his former girlfriend Gale(Penelope Ann Miller). But Carlito's efforts to go straight are interrupted when corrupt lawyer and friend Dave Kleinfeld(Sean Penn)as well as other associates and enemies who are trying bring Carlito back into his criminal lifestyle. Will Carlito keep trying to go straight and start a new life or go back to his old criminal life?Released in 1993,Carlito's Way did decent business at the Box Office but surprising received a lukewarm to mixed reception by film critics some of the criticisms was that Carlito's Way was too similar to the other Brian De Palma-Al Pacino Gangster classic Scarface. But overtime Carlito's Way gained a Cult Following thanks to Home Video and many television showings and is now seen as a one of the best Gangster films of all time and the praise is well deserved. Carlito's Way is Gangster classic that is amazing from beginning to end because while the storyline of Carlito's Way has been done before(i.e ex-convict trying to go straight)director Brian De Palma and Al Pacino bring something unique and creative to the film giving viewers a movie that is stylish and powerful,dark and tragic,romantic and beautiful as well as intense and thrilling. CW is a Film that is also rooted in the style and tradition of Film Noir with the gangsters,criminals and thugs are vicious and follow the rules and codes of the streets and the tone of the movie is gritty and dark. CW is also a Film Noir with the narration of the main character Carlito because with the narration we as the viewer are pulled into Carlito's mind and thoughts which are done almost like quiet whispers that are haunting and talks about the past and the present. While Carlito's Way is a Gangster film,De Palma has time to put in a few exciting and thrilling Action and Suspense sequences. De Palma knows how to film Action,suspense and thrills and De Palma is at the top of his game with CW because with each Action scene there is a great build up and a satisfying payoff and with Action scene there is attention to detail as well as amazing timing. The most memorable and explosive Action scene is the train station chase sequence which is directed like an Alfred Hitchcock scene and will also remind viewers of De Palma's classic train station scene in The Untouchables and if you loved the train station scene in The Untouchables you will the train station scene in this film. The character Carlito Brigante is great character because he is complex and has great depth and you will relate to him in wanting to go straight despite all of the things going on around him and we as the viewers are rooting for him to succeed and start a new life. While wanting to go straight Carlito still follows the rules of the streets but Carlito also follows his own rules and as you watch Carlito's Way you will see Carlito make great attempts to stay out of his old criminal life and while some of his friends and associates are trying make him go back to his old ways which makes Carlito sympathetic and tragic. The screenplay by David Koepp is fantastic and memorable,with Koepp giving the characters dialog that is gritty and tough matching the tone of the film. The ending of Carlito's Way is amazing.powerful and sad but it adds to the greatness and tragic feel of the movie. A powerful ending.The whole cast is great. Al Pacino is excellent and at his best as Carlito,with Pacino bringing grittiness,depth and intensity to the role. Sean Penn is brilliant as Kleinfeld,Carlito's friend and lawyer with. Penelope Ann Miller is terrific and beautiful as Gale,Carlito's girlfriend and love interest. John Leguizamo is fantastic as Benny Blanco,a hood from the Bronx. Ingrid Rogers is wonderful and sexy as Steffie,a club girl. Luis Guzman is outstanding as Pachanga,an old associate of Carlito's. Viggo Mortensen is great as Lalin,an old friend of Carlito's.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera bringing his usual visual style and tone to the film with zooms,close-ups with tracking and over head shots. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Patrick Doyle is amazing,powerful,tragic and intense matching every important scene in the movie. Terrific score,Doyle. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Bee Gees(You Should Be Dancing),The O'Jays(I Love Music,Back Stabbers),KC & The Sunshine Band(Shake Shake Shake)Shake Your Booty,That's The Way(I Like It),LaBelle(Lady Marmalade),Joe Cocker(You Are So Beautiful),The Hues Corporation(Rock The Boat),Cheryl Lynn(Got To Be Real),Santana(Oye Como Va),Ed Terry(Disco Inferno,Rock Your Baby), and more. In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Brian De Palma,Al Pacino,Sean Penn or films in general,I highly suggest you see Carlito's Way.an excellent and stylish Gangster classic that is Brian De Palma,Al Pacino and Sean Penn at their best.
