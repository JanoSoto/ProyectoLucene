Never before have I seen a more painful portrayal of the Holocaust. The horrible images about the humiliation, the fears and the pain of the Jews are combined with the extraordinary absorbing story about Oskar Schindler, great camerawork, music and acting, both from the principal characters as the minor characters. A quiet, but nevertheless very impressive scene was the one in which the personal belongings of the Jews, who just had been put on transport, were sorted out. The first time I saw Schindler's List, this shot just seemed to go on and on, and thus gave me an idea of the enormous extent of what happened to the Jewish people. We witness how war can bring out the worst in men, like it did in Amon Goeth. Men like him were given the power, the opportunity, to develop the evil qualities in their characters. Luckily, Spielberg didn't portray only the evil side of Goeth, he also showed his audience that this horrible man still was capable of feeling something for another human being, even though he didn't want himself to. Thanks to the superb performance of Ralph Fiennes, the Amon Goeth character is in every way believable. We see how war also can bring out the best in men, like it did in Oskar Schindler. Spielberg very subtly develops the relationship between Schindler and Stern. They both know Schindler's feelings changed during the war, but neither of them talks about that. But still, the audience knows, just as Schindler and Stern know. Liam Neeson was very impressive, Ben Kingsley gave one of the best performances in movie history. Many people say that Saving Private Ryan is Spielberg's best movie, but I don't agree. Schindler's List has much more depth, and touched me far more deeply. It's a real masterpiece. A tip Read the book! It gives a lot of details Spielberg couldn't show us, because of the limited length of the movie. It's worth your effort.

In my opinion, this later version of Nineteen Eighty Four is one of the best literary adaptations I've seen.The film was obviously a labor of love for director Michael Radford, who also co-wrote the screenplay.  As noted in the end credits, the film was photographed in and around London during the period April-June 1984, the exact time and setting imagined by the author.  If this were a big-budget Hollywood bomb, I might consider that a publicity stunt, but in the case of this little-known, little-seen British film, it's fairly obviously a form of homage.The look of the film is extraordinary in its evocation of the world Orwell created, down to the tiniest detail.  Although that world was obviously very different from the real world of 1984, a deliberate choice was made to stick with the Orwellian vision in every way, anachronistic technology and all, and I firmly believe it was the right choice, as opposed to the updating we sometimes see in adaptations of classic futuristic stories.  Thus, we are treated to the baroque and slightly disorienting sight of black rotary-dial telephones, pneumatic document-delivery systems, old-fashioned safety razors, tube radios, etc., all of which were already obsolete at the time of filming.  And of course, the omnipresent black-and-white telescreens with rounded picture tubes.As Winston Smith, the story's protagonist, John Hurt is an inspired piece of casting; absolutely the perfect choice.  Not only does he fit the author's description of Smith to a T, but with the haircut he's given, he even bears a striking resemblance to Orwell himself.  And there is no actor alive better than Hurt at evoking victimization in all its infinite gradations and variations.  Suzanna Hamilton, relatively little-known here in the US, also does a fine job as Julia.  The film also contains the final film appearance of Richard Burton, in one of his most fascinating and disturbing performances as O'Brien.  And the great Cyril Cusack does a classic turn as Charrington, the pawnshop proprietor.Right from the opening scene, in which we look in on a screening of a short propaganda film, brilliantly conceived and executed by Radford, during the daily two minutes hate, climaxing in Dominic Muldowney's memorable, genuinely stirring national anthem of Oceania played behind the gigantic image of Big Brother, we are catapulted headlong into Orwell's nightmare vision.  While not a particularly long novel (my copy is 256 pages), it is nevertheless dense with ideas, and it would be impossible for a standard-length film to include them all, even if the audience could stand all the endless talking heads it would require.  Given the inherent limitations, I think the film largely succeeds in preserving a good portion of the ideological meat of the novel.  It is certainly extremely faithful in the material it does include.  Even the incidental music by Eurythmics feels entirely appropriate, and doesn't in any way break the mood.  In fact, it even enhances it.While I thought the 1956 version did a fairly good job for the time, it had a number of flaws in my estimation that made it far less successful an adaptation.  For one thing, although the world it portrays is grim, it's not nearly grim enough.  Also, Edmond O'Brien may have done a creditable job as Smith, but physically he's all wrong for the part.  The portly, even chubby O'Brien bears little resemblance to the slight, emaciated, chronically exhausted, varicose-ulcerated Smith described in the novel.  Neither is the 1956 version as faithful to the book; some of the material is softened, and there are odd, unexplainable alterations O'Brien becomes O'Connor, and I don't think that Goldstein, the possibly imaginary leader of the possibly fictitious Resistance, is even mentioned.  At 90 minutes, it runs a good 23 minutes shorter than the later version, which necessitates the trimming of even more of the novel, for all you literary purists.

The film is set in a British boarding school and concerns the exploits of three seniors who fail to conform to the strict rules placed upon them by the school, and society itself.  A young Malcolm McDowell plays Mick Travis, the leader of the three rebels, giving probably the best performance of his career.  Lindsay Anderson's direction is just plain amazing.

AN EVIL, EVIL man who blew people up for money. So, having him suddenly discover a conscience because a young girl is in the car they're about to zap is especially puke-worthy. It's not like he didn't know what he's been doing all these years. This problem is all the more so in that crap-fest Assassins, where he also killed people for money. So, in this film and that one especially, why didn't you play it as such and drop all the really sickening moralising O.K?

Swingers has enough spontaneous plot twists, cute dialog and LA in jokes to make it interesting. If I were in my 20's maybe I'd think this was a fantastic film. But I'm not. This film with a wink pays tribute to Scorsese and Tarantino but the borrowing goes deeper. Essentially Swingers follows the basic story of Marty, a 1955 film that won the Academy Award. What Swingers does not do is develop any of its women characters. In fact except for Mike the male characters do not change that much. (I sometimes thought that a more appropriate title could be Losers.) The film is fun but shallow. But I think that was the idea.

While I personally am a big fan of Rice's novel, I think it would have been far better to leave it alone and *not* turn it into this horrid movie, considering that it is, undoubtedly, a book that is very difficult to adapt.I find it sad that 11 years-old Kirsten Dunst could outact three men in their thirties. While Cruise at least has some strong parts in the film, Pitt obviously just walks through it sighing. His sullen performance, along with the really useless comments from the off were simply and painfully boring. Banderas, while in other films a rather good actor, could be left out completely in Interview. The only thing he did was confuse me. Other parts, like Stephen Rea's and Slater's weren't developed enough to add anything to the movie, and Pitt's sudden disappearance for half of the movie didn't leave a good impression on me either.Another thing that I felt was completely missing in this movie was the part of the victim. The only victims we were showed were either people that had no effect on the way the movie would take whatsoever, or villains, aristocrats that killed their former life partners and animals.And lastly, who was responsible for Pitt's and Banderas' horrible hair-do??
