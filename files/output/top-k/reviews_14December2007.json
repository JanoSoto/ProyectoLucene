But still, the movie was on my 'to get' list for a long time after that. I had difficulty getting my hands on an affordable copy. Why was it so grueling to watch? The qualities that made so many flock to movies - human warmth, excitement, people shedding tears, bloodshed on an epic scale; these are omitted in the Haneke movies I've watched. The characters are not likable. They might be crying. They could be having sex as well. But it is like suddenly having insight in General Walther Model's emotional life. It feels alien. In The Piano Teacher, one is looking for what feels like minutes at merely a door closing, waiting for someone to emerge from it. It is almost like waiting for a reward, for watching this. Haneke, I read, is a courageous man. He does not compromise. He does not pretend. His movies are realistic. And slow moving. Time moves here like a glacier. His movies are like cold breezes from the poles. It must have been the lingering and haunting memory of the seventh continent that made me rent The Piano Teacher, because I've watched Time of the Wolf a while ago and found it a boring movie. The Piano Teacher is an incredibly rewarding movie. It's about a piano teacher, Erika Kohut, in Vienna. She is staying with her mother in a small apartment; in fact, they share a bed. Their relationship is strange; her mother is incredibly possessive, almost jealous. For instance, they get into a fight about Erika buying an expensive dress; it ridiculously gets out of hand (pulling out hair, slapping, etc). Then they made up with the mother remarking, We are a hot blooded-family, this is the way it is. Erika is overall unable to express her emotion. Apparently, that is typical Austrian. Then, a student (Walter Klemmer) starts to pursue her and applies to enter her class, after being blown away by a conversation between them about Schumann's madness; His so called twilight right before he went mad, when he realizes he will soon loose himself completely. She senses that he has a hidden agenda and tries to shun him from entering her class by stating, I feel unable to nurture Mr. Klemmer's virtuosity. He enrolls in her classes, but it become soon really obvious that he is unable to think about anything else than her. Eventually they get involved. This is where the movie gets really shocking. A better word is probably anti social. Ridiculous. I'm only going to comment here that Erika wants to run a pretty tight ship on sexual matters. She will state what when, where and how. It is quite obvious that she is a very repressed woman. Between classes also, she frequents sex shops. Or walks around in a road movie theater, engaging in an act of flagrant voyeurism when encountering a couple making love in their car. Simultaneously, she verbally attacks and manipulates one of her students when she caught him in the sex shop. I've asked myself initially why the scene (Erika damaging one of her insecure students hands by secretly slipping broken glass pieces into her pocket) is in the film, to realize later on that Haneke deliberately try to make Erika not likable. Even Walter gets a bit disgusted at a point when she insist on him tying her up, hitting her, etc. She replies later on that this has always been inside her, the urge to be hit. It seems as if Erika's governing dynamic is extremity; she is fluctuating only between scream and whisper (a quote from the movie about playing Schubert). She appears to be on the twilight of her sanity, like her idol Schumann. When she eventually fell in love with Walter, it is then also the only way forward - to fracturing her mind. It is inevitable because she is completely unable to cope with her own emotion. She gets even more radical The letter she writes him, cannot be explained in sane terms. Walter's defense when he eventually ends up raping her is that you cannot delve in people's inside and then reject them but there was not much that could prepare him for Erika's twisted up inside. Erika's defense is basically, Love is built on banal things.In another director's hands, the film matter at hand could easily have turned this movie into a 'likeable' film, with agreeable characters. It is possible to alienate modern man from emotions, and to make the filmgoers identify with his struggle. It would have been possible to make society 'feels her pain'. But this movie is stripped. It does not want to be liked. It is strong, and clear. The long shots on Erika's face, clarify a lot. It is a clear shot of apocalypse.

As we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 America, this three act play is opened before us with the help of The Stage Manager, a visual narrator if you like. After his initial introductions, we are led into the homes of two particular families; The Webb's and the Gibb's.This is most definitely middle America at the turn of the century, and the progressive way of life of the American Dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town. Here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire, even if there are, too, the migrant Polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers, they, never get a look-in.Once the daily lives of these families have been introduced; wives cooking, children home-working, fathers working, kids falling in love and the clean picket-fences painted white, the second act is started three years later, after young George (a young and unrecognisable William Holden, then aged 22) and Emily have fallen in love and intend to marry. Blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching, too, a turning point in their own lives, from the nest they lived and now, into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step. The third act is slightly more sour and foreboding, it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent, here we see not life, not celebration but death, and it is in this predicament that the dead, as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past, are here to remind us, to tell us, that life, and every last minute, every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered.It is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too, feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on, and by, middle America and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order. This isn't just about Our town, this is moral diction aimed at Our souls and how America can better itself if its peoples', (excluding the Poles, the Irish, the Native American and the freed ethnic minorities', and minorities' in general, plus the supporting backbone of the Americana's who, still, have not had a fair part in this narrative), such as the middle classes, can live up to the expectations of the American Dream through honest, decent living.

When Astaire did it on Broadway, the Cole Porter musical had been entitled The Gay Divorce. But that extra 'e' was added on lest anyone get the idea that divorce itself was something frivolous. Imagine anticipating Britney Spears by about 70 years.Actually Fred had also done Funny Face and The Bandwagon on stage as well. But on stage The Bandwagon was a revue and Funny Face had an entirely different plot than the musical made by Astaire in the Fifties. Only in The Gay Divorcée was he asked to repeat a stage role.The basic plot is still the same, the usual Astaire-Rogers case of mistaken identity. Ginger is the budding divorcée going to London to get a divorce as Aunt Alice Brady hired a professional co-respondent. Ginger mistakes Fred for that co-respondent and it takes a while for Fred to warm her up.Fred's an American musical comedy star visiting London with his manager Edward Everett Horton who also happens to know Brady. This gives the excuse for the musical numbers.Cole Porter's score was cut completely from the screen other than the immortal Night and Day. In it's place came four songs, three written by Harry Revel&Mack Gordon and one written by Con Conrad&Herb Magdison. Fred and Ginger dance divinely to Night and Day.Fred does a solo dance to A Needle in a Haystack and Don't Let It Bother You. Betty Grable got her first notice from the movie going public, singing and dancing in Let's Knock Knees all of which were contributed by Revel&Gordon.

I don't think I'd ever actually seen Twins properly until recently and when I did see it, I still felt a certain wave of recognition; a certain emotion when everything was said and done and the closing shot faded out to the credits. Twins is a film that evokes a certain fondness from its viewer but it doesn't do so in a manipulative way; consequently Twins does it in a way that probably won't make you shed tears but won't have you labelling it 'cheesy' or anti-climatic and this is clever film-making proving that it has aged well.I was surprised at how much I could read into Twins. It's true to say that the film allows the narrative to take over once everyone gets going and sorts themselves out since it takes on a road trip approach &#150; from this point on. However, leading up to this point Twins manages to combine humour with deadpan humour; violence with censored violence; family values with self values and manages to integrate Western philosophy and ideals into its aesthetic. The idea is one that although holey, remains interesting and seemingly original Julius Benedict (Schwarzenegger) has been living on an island away from civilisation; kept adrift from any sort of values be it Western or otherwise which is why his introduction to American life is so clever. Julius discovers he has a twin brother in America and so sets off (in a rowing boat at first) to find him. I find it smart and somewhat political that Julius has been kept away from any sort of 'life' and is a better product of his society than any country in the world could ever teach him to be. America in this film is portrayed as a somewhat lowly and nasty country full of liars; criminals; antagonistic people and apparent mad-scientists who like to experiment with human milkshakes. Julius comes to America strong, well educated, well built and seemingly naïve hence when we see a montage of him in the U.S. for the first time; it's as if a child in an adult's body has been let loose on the streets.Julius' introduction into Western society is just as humorous as it is fascinating to read into. He sees and experiences things he has never come across before; a real fish-out-of-water. The film's montage deals with America's love of food as Julius eats pizza slices and hotdogs, even sharing one time with a tramp which also highlights the homeless problem America may have been experiencing back then. He gets an introduction to clothes, technology, fast food, Western iconography when he compares muscle sizes with Sylvester Stallone a dominant hard bodied piece of American iconography given the time this film was made 1988 and during the Cold War when Ronald Reagan was in power. He's also given harsh introductions to violence and sex; these two occurring in the same scene one after each other. After a brief discussion with a guy over some mannequins advertising lingerie; an attempted mugging occurs but unwillingly and somewhat naively; he is up to the task of dealing with it. His second 'introduction' to sex in the Western world comes in the form of looking at a magazine; a few seconds later he bumps into Marnie Mason (Preston) in a one in a million chance encounter it's no coincidence that this is the girl he will fall for and vice-versa and it's no coincidence that he was looking at a Playboy literally seconds before their meeting.But Schwarzenegger isn't the only star in this film. Danny de Vito plays Vincent Benedict in arguably and unfortunately; his best role behind The Penguin in Batman Returns, four years later. De Vito is quite the opposite in fact he's the binary opposite of Julius short, cocky, confident and a bit of a criminal; all of which are set up through a series of funny set pieces. But that's the joke two people who are the exact opposites of one another in terms of physical appearance and yet are twins. Director Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame reminds us that these people are related by having Schwarzenegger and De Vito play out scenes during which they mimic each others activity simultaneously; resembling perhaps a Marx brothers film or otherwise &#150; I wonder how much funnier the takes that didn't work turned out.Twins is a film that knows its place in the pyramid and never dares to be anything bigger or smarter than what it actually is; entertainment. Both brothers' adventures and mishaps leading up to the point it becomes a road picture are played out in an entertaining manner even if I found De Vito's 'wrong place, wrong time' route funnier since it involved incorrect identity and had that criminal element whilst Schwarzenegger's was mostly him attempting to find who his family is which in itself was very heart-warming.

Nevertheless, he piles his two boys, along with three neighbor kids (its Dan's turn to be the carpool driver) into the van and stops for doughnuts for everyone to have a good breakfast. Trouble is, at the bakery, there is a hold-up, with Franklin (Tom Arnold) taking the money and taking Daniel hostage, too, to complete a getaway. Franklin is really a nice man but his failing carnival show necessitated the immediate need for funds. Daniel is aghast for he still has his meeting looming on the horizon.

The second part of the movie piles on so much trouble, misfortune and drama that it seems like some kind of Lifetime docudrama. So much in their young lives goes wrong that in order to have an acceptable ending, too much has to go right all at once. The ending just doesn't seem believable because it is such a sudden jump from the end of the second act.I liked the characters, who remained believable throughout the various situations. The plot and direction could have been worked out a bit more carefully.

It's still one of most powerful movies ever made, out of any genre or time period. And not just that, the movie is also really among the best ever made.The movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers during WW I, of which most of them are still just only school kids in the beginning. First we see how the very young boys are being reprogrammed as soldiers. Then we see how they all are slowly going crazy, due to the madness of war. After that the movie shows the aftereffects of war, on those who fought in it. From the hospital till their leave back home, this movie shows and tells it all. We further more see them dealing with all kinds of problems; the lack of food, rats, the death and see them discuss the point of war. Or like Paul Bäumer sums up in the movie; We live in the trenches out there. We fight. We try not to be killed, but sometimes we are. That's all.It's not hard to see that this movie influenced many other later war\/anti-war movies, even till this present day, with Full Metal Jacket and Starship Troopers as the most obvious and best known examples.For its time period this was also a very graphic movie, although no way people will now be shocked by any of the 'gore' within this movie. Nevertheless the movie its violence and disturbing moments still haven't lost any of its power. This is also thanks to the great build-up directing by Lewis Milestone. He knows how to create the right certain tension and the atmosphere that goes with it. He also had a real eye for detail, especially of course during the battle sequences. Because of its many little details the movie also becomes a very realistic one.The movie features some great looking and also at times innovating The camera positions and angles, as well as the good fast editing. It makes this a technical fantastic movie to watch.Obviously none of the actors are among the greatest of their time but the characters are all nevertheless great, since they are very humane and realistic and each has their own strong identity.A movie that you HAVE to see at least once in your lifetime.10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 2007","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" There were some anti-war movies before this one but none of them hit the mark- and made its point so well such as this one.

Like Brazil this is a complex story and, like all his previous features (with the exception of the inferior Jabberwocky) it deals with the conflict between imagination and the real world. The screenplay thus puts Gilliam on familiar ground, and gives him free reign to create something weird and wonderful &#150; enter homeless vigilantes, a moustachioed cabaret singer and a fire breathing red knight. In spite of all this the bizarreness is just a little more restrained than in previous Gilliam efforts. All for the best perhaps as it allows him to give more weight to story and character.The plot of The Fisher King is multi-layered and highly original, the best study of guilt and redemption I have seen. While keeping the setting and concerns of present-day America it references Arthurian legend for its story, and any number of classic romance movies for its tone. Gilliam handles this poignant side confidently, as well as introducing that same light, lyrical touch that cropped up in Brazil &#150; one scene, in which hundreds of commuters in a station concourse suddenly break into ballroom dancing, is done so smoothly it could almost have been something out of a Vincente Minelli musical.What really brings The Fisher King to life though is the top-notch cast.

Mercedes Ruehl plays his girlfriend, creating a character who is at once over-the-top and utterly believable, and she deservedly one an Oscar for the part. And then there is the unique Robin Williams as Parry, in one of the best performances of his career, no doubt supplying much of his own dialogue.The Fisher King is Gilliam's second masterpiece. It may lack the constant creativeness of his earlier works, but there is now a greater emotional depth on display.

There are about a million characters in Gosford Park so it is hard to feel with them and really care about what they're doing. Well, actually they didn't really do anything at all.The first five minutes or so were quite good though. I thought Maggie Smith's character being such a selfish cow was funny. But then she, like all the others, descended into a dull blur.For an hour and twenty minutes, absolutely nothing happened except that a few birds died, a guy played piano almost non-stop and some rich snobs played bridge. Woohoo. It was all so exciting I just had to keep shaking myself to wake up.Finally, when the crime occurred I was able to watch the movie and take in what was going on. But no, a few minutes later it went back down to flat and boring mode.When I managed to find the energy to movie my hand I switched it off after 90 minutes. Normally I can't stop watching a movie half way through because not knowing how it ends would be annoy me. But for this, I was at the point where I just simply didn't care at all.My rating 2\/10 I'm not giving it a 1 because of some rather nice art direction. But a movie does actually need a story.

Well, actually they didn't really do anything at all.The first five minutes or so were quite good though. I thought Maggie Smith's character being such a selfish cow was funny. But then she, like all the others, descended into a dull blur.For an hour and twenty minutes, absolutely nothing happened except that a few birds died, a guy played piano almost non-stop and some rich snobs played bridge. Woohoo. It was all so exciting I just had to keep shaking myself to wake up.Finally, when the crime occurred I was able to watch the movie and take in what was going on. But no, a few minutes later it went back down to flat and boring mode.When I managed to find the energy to movie my hand I switched it off after 90 minutes. Normally I can't stop watching a movie half way through because not knowing how it ends would be annoy me. But for this, I was at the point where I just simply didn't care at all.My rating 2\/10 I'm not giving it a 1 because of some rather nice art direction. But a movie does actually need a story.

This idea has been used later in the Star Treck series under the name of beaming and thus become quite popular.From the standpoint of theoretical physics, tele-transportation is principally possible, i.e. first de-materialization, then transportation and then re-materialization of objects. Although technics is not yet ready, there are no principle obstacles as long as dead objects have to be transported. But it is quite different with living organisms. Unlike an object like a stone which is a pure quantitative item, organisms involve quality. But in physics, there are only quantitative conservation laws, not qualitative ones. Therefore, before it will be technically possible to tele-transport an organism, physics must be able to handle with qualitative conservation, since otherwise the tele-transporting system will handle organisms like dead objects, and all quality will be lost during transportation.But qualitative conservation requires a fundamental change of our whole science, since it presupposes the exchange of mono-contextural by poly-contextural logic, i.e. the fundamental concept of two-valued logic has to be abandoned in order to transgress the metaphysical border between subject and object. Only when the subject-object border will be abolished, qualitative conservation will be possible. The reason is that dead objects are not capable of self-reflexion and therefore remain objects, while organisms have an environment and can thus be subject and object at the same time. As a matter of fact, this capability only enables them to reproduce themselves. Stones cannot reproduce themselves. Since de- and re-materialization is a reproductive device, tele-transportation requires polycontextural computers.The motive of the Fly-movies can be seen as a consequence of Einstein's relativity theories which are based on quantitative conservation laws which, however, are based again on the quantitative conservation laws that had been already formulated at the end of the 19th century. And it was at that time, to be exact in 1892, when the idea of complementing quantitative by qualitative conservation appears for the first time as a metaphysical topic in the work of the German psychiatrist and philosopher Oskar Panizza. But speculations concerning qualitative conservation go back at least to the church father Gregor von Nyssa in his discussion about the resurrection of the dead at doomsday Will the dead resurrect in their original shape which they had during their life-time or will they be changed, and if, how will their shape and character look like after they will have resurrected? Will different persons get mixed up or will everybody conserve his own qualities? These exciting ideas were discussed as early as in the 4th century A.D. but got popular only with the Fly-movies which therefore have a metaphysical background involving theoretical physics, cybernetics, mathematics and semiotics that goes far beyond common horror movies. Early American science fiction of the beginning of the 20th century anticipated present day's monocontextural computers. It is thus to await that newer American science fiction anticipates also the future's polycontextural computers.
