I never would have thought, after seeing the crap he's doing now.  Wow. His acting here, though not quite in the league of Daniel Day-Lewis' Cristy Brown in My Left Foot, rivals that of Geoffrey Rush in Shine and Dustin Hoffman in Rain man.  I do not hesitate to say this.  Rush and Hoffman are huge actors, and Dicaprio was just a boy at the time, but his performance is just as moving, just as comfortable, and just as mind-blowing, real and believable.  Wow.  He can act.  It's a shame he's so terrible now.  Maybe he just needs a suitable role.  He's just no good at the squinting tough-guy stuff.  He's no Clint Eastwood (which could be a compliment, I'm not sure).Anyway, the rest of the movie doesn't quite measure up to Dicaprio's tremendous acting, which doesn't make it necessarily bad.  I don't want to seem shallow or closed, but I'm not into the cliché romance stuff.  Yawn. I've heard it all before. Juliette Lewis is just boring, but her character is boring, being the perfect girl savior.  She's not noticeably bad, though. Johnny Depp isn't bad either.  He's not outstanding, but he's believable.  Gilbert Grape is a complex character, that doesn't come around too often.  He's conflicted, with himself, his mother, his autistic brother, his secret lover's husband, and the people that mistreat Arnie.  He's a good kid.  And he is human (unlike Juliette Lewis' character, faw!).  He loses it.  He runs away when things get hard.  But he can come back.  At one point, he  hits Arnie, trying to get him to take a bath (like Dustin Hoffman in Rain man, Arnie is afraid of water).  And he runs away, ashamed.  But he comes back to Arnie's party, and they make amends.Gilbert's mother is overweight.  Which is an understatement.  He's embarrassed of her, and frequently refers to her as a beached whale. Really a rude analogy coming from her own son.  She never moves from the couch. Never goes anywhere.  But she loves her children, and when the police take Arnie away (after he climbs the tower for the last time), she gets up, and fights to get him back.  Sniff, sniff.  Touching.  Anyway, she dies later during the party, and Arnie goes up to visit.  This is a beautiful scene. A horrible scene.  A beautiful scene.  Haha, you're hiding, momma, Arnie says.  He thinks it's a game, but when it lasts for too long, he's scared. He's shaking her.  He's crying.  He's yelling for her to stop hiding. He's crying.  What do you know...I'm crying too.Anyway, I don't want to bore myself (or you) by going on and on about the plot.  Lalala.  I didn't like the cliché romantic part of this film, but the rest is quite good.  Good acting overall,  not a bad story actually, though slightly predictable, the relationship between Gilbert and Arnie is thorough, moving and developed, and well, Leonardo Dicaprio is outstanding.

And what does The Thing have to offer; well not much; Kurt Russel is his hillbilly self, taking the leader role from the very start and the rest of the cast doesn't amount to much either.

There are just so many things popping and bursting out of those creatures it's hard to swallow, and the head-turn-to-spider scene is a real gem when it comes to idiotic comedy. Plus it shows just how much the special effects creators were influenced by Alien which came out only a couple of years ago; the thing even lived off of the same thing, it needed a host and then it just ate whatever it could find. There were even similarities with the whole blood scene; alien's was acid, this one just lived forever and didn't like fire.

So this review is definitely from that perspective. I didn't come to this film fresh, but I suspect most who watched it didn't either. In the end...it's an okay movie that suffers a cascading failure because of a poorly-conceived villain.I liked the flashback scenes between Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert, showing the development of the friendship between their two characters. The two actors have an obvious chemistry; it's too bad Lambert didn't pop up more often in the series. Why wasn't Connor around more often anyway? At least this movie ties up that loose end.Also good was the sub-plot involving Duncan's immortal wife(!). Very logical for the character, especially given that he never married in the series. Why not? The film resolves that loose end too.But the movie falls apart because of the villain. First, he's tiresome. At least Clancy Brown (and many others in the series) had some good lines. Second, he's poorly conceived. He's supposed to be awesome because he's killed more immortals than Duncan or Connor combined? So what?!?Duncan took out several immortals on the series MUCH older than himself who would have had a MUCH higher kill count--Kronos, in particular, comes to mind. Why is this guy such a bother? Only because he fights with a team, and before the big battle, what does he do? He kills them! MORON!And the ultimate fight scene is over-long and unpleasant. Duncan held his own against six guys earlier in the flick (best action sequence in the film, BTW), but this one putz gives him a problem? Come on. The series established Duncan as an immortal warrior supreme--to be a big threat, the guy would have to have something special going for him, and this guy didn't.And that leads to the biggest problem of all. Because I couldn't believe the villain was much of a threat, I couldn't accept Connor's sacrifice, which is supposed to be the big, poignant scene in this picture. It seemed out of character for him as well--the MacLeods are fighters. If the big threat of the villain was fighting with a team, why not have Connor and Duncan FACE him as a team? And with a few other favorite immortals thrown in, such as Amanda and Methos? (Where the heck was Amanda anyway? And Peter Wingfield was wasted. Good stuff with Joe, though--he's wonderfully ruthless.)Worth seeing if you were a fan of the series, but it's more like a mediocre two-parter than a feature. 5\/10.

At least this movie ties up that loose end.Also good was the sub-plot involving Duncan's immortal wife(!). Very logical for the character, especially given that he never married in the series. Why not? The film resolves that loose end too.But the movie falls apart because of the villain. First, he's tiresome. At least Clancy Brown (and many others in the series) had some good lines. Second, he's poorly conceived. He's supposed to be awesome because he's killed more immortals than Duncan or Connor combined? So what?!?Duncan took out several immortals on the series MUCH older than himself who would have had a MUCH higher kill count--Kronos, in particular, comes to mind. Why is this guy such a bother? Only because he fights with a team, and before the big battle, what does he do? He kills them! MORON!And the ultimate fight scene is over-long and unpleasant. Duncan held his own against six guys earlier in the flick (best action sequence in the film, BTW), but this one putz gives him a problem? Come on. The series established Duncan as an immortal warrior supreme--to be a big threat, the guy would have to have something special going for him, and this guy didn't.And that leads to the biggest problem of all. Because I couldn't believe the villain was much of a threat, I couldn't accept Connor's sacrifice, which is supposed to be the big, poignant scene in this picture. It seemed out of character for him as well--the MacLeods are fighters. If the big threat of the villain was fighting with a team, why not have Connor and Duncan FACE him as a team? And with a few other favorite immortals thrown in, such as Amanda and Methos? (Where the heck was Amanda anyway? And Peter Wingfield was wasted.

It sounded like a wonderful story with some very real characters. Well, I just had a chance to watch it and when it was over, I was dumbstruck. The plot is as follows Jessica Stein is a neurotic perfectionist who is unable to sustain a normal heterosexual relationship due to her anal retentiveness and constant criticism when DUM DUM DUM........... She decides to answer an ad under women seeking women. Sound familiar ladies?? Well, it is all down hill from there. The relationship is inevitably doomed due to Jessica's fear of committing herself to a LESBIAN relationship, not to mention that she is as cold as the iceberg that sunk the Titanic. The biggest letdown of them all was that horrible ending, although not surprising to say the least. So, while the story was real and heartwarming, the movie was boring and trite with a host of cliches that made me want to gag. There was nothing remotely redeemable or likable about Jessica at all which left me disappointed. She was annoying, whiny, cold, and emotionally unstable. I would think that you would want to have one likable trait in a lead character of a movie other than looking good in a short skirt and that she did, but I digress. Or at least, something that allows people to connect to the character in some way. All I wanted to do is jump through my tv and smack this whiny chick in the head.With all its flaws and cliches I will say that the  saving grace in the film was the compassionate and open-minded mother played by Tovah Feldshuh. Heather Juergensen was also quite good as the character of Helen.While it was not the worst movie I have ever seen, it was a real let down considering how much potential it had. I would highly recommend movies like High Art, Better than Chocolate or Treading Water if you are looking for good stories about lesbian relationships.

Then the monster drops in and terrorizes our victims; they get chased and we get 'scared'.  Various happenings in the plot where things we didn't know before get revealed try to keep up interested.

I think Stephen King's got a how-to book that explains how to do all this stuff, if you're interested...Suspiria, if you haven't seen the movie or heard anything about it, doesn't exactly work like that, or even try to.  'Atmosphere' is not even the right word- it's more like a shared hallucination.

I wouldn't exactly call it scary, but I don't know that I've ever really been literally scared by any movie since I was about ten or so.

This was just another good guys (America), bad guys (Germans) type film.If you want to see a real, and I mean real anti-war film you must see the 1930 version of All quiet on the Western front. Ask me the ending of Private Ryan and in three months I wont be able to tell you, but our High School teacher made us sit through this when I was about 13\/14 and to this day the final scene still jars me.Go see it, trust me, it will move you more than Ryan. (look it up on imdb it has scored 8.2 to ryans 8.3)But whats the use, people who gave Private Ryan a 10 will probably be bored with it because it is one war film that has little violence in it (and it is full of shudder Germans).

There are more than enough car chases, gun fights etc. to make the movie an enjoyable experience. The plot is fairly simplistic but good A white, racist rich kid named Walter Wade(Christian Bale) murders a black man outside a bar in New York. After his father pays bail and he skips country, Shaft (Samuel L Jackson) vowes to track him down and bring him in. Unfortunatly for him, Wade allys himself with a local drug dealer (Jeffery Wright). Diane Palmieri (Toni Collette) is the only witness to the horrendous crime, and is sought after by both sides. That's all you really need to know to have a good time watching this movie.The acting in this movie is supurb. Although it's been said so many times, I'll say it again Samuel L Jackson OWNS the role of John Shaft. If they ever make a sequel (and I believe they should), they'll have to sign him. Bale works as the rich, spoiled brat that everyone hates. Wright is excellent as the mid-level dope dealer who is trying to rise above his position. The rest of the acting is great, aside from Busta Rhymes (not bad, but could have been better). There is only one tune that I can remember from this movie, the great theme from Issac Hayes. I mean, you can't hear it enough. It personifies this movie. The action sequences are great, well paced, etc. Although there were quite a few, I think there should have been more, but that's just a minor quibble.Just about my only complaint about this movie is the lack of sex - I'm not a pervert or anything, but the original Shaft was a fighter AND a lover. While I don't know much about the original (I'm only 18) I do know that much. If they would have included some T&A they probably would have got more teens.Overall, a great movie, a sequel-worthy movie.

This was just such a disappointing direction for the series to go in -- I'm a huge fan of Alien and Aliens, and I walked out of Alien3 halfway through the first time I saw this, when I saw what they'd done to the lovely ending of Aliens. James Cameron made a fantastic, thrilling, pulse-pounding film with the second one, gave Ripley a well-deserved happy ending (complete with a new family) -- and this film goes and takes a dump all over it. It just seemed like a pointless and cruel choice for the series to go in.Fincher may be a prodigiously talented director -- no argument, I'm a huge fan of his other work -- but in this case it's all overblown, overdone -- it feels more to me like a look what I can do film exercise than a Scifi film.  I just wish the film had paid half as much attention to the script as Fincher does in setting up his shots. Fancy, too-long shots of blood spattering in slo-mo, predictable artsy shadows for the alien to lurk in, etc -- even upon rewatching this (it's taken me three times simply to make it to the end), I just didn't care, and it's obvious the filmmakers don't either.  It's very cold, characters are dispatched on schedule, and oh, look at the pretty slomo.On the good side, the acting is uniformly fine, with Weaver fantastic as always in a totally thankless role, and the cinematography is really gorgeous. People get slaughtered right and left but at least it's by candlelight.Ultimately, what bothered me most (and still does) was Alien3's underlying humiliation of Ripley -- it was like they went out of their way to rob her of all previous happiness, then further degrade, debase, and humiliate the character until she dies a gruesome, painful and unhappy death.  Um, OK. Nice ending.Anyway, all you Fincher fans will probably throw things at me, but count me in as one of the minority who hated this.
