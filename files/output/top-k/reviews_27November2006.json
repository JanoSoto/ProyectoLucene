Having been raised on frenetic, action-packed science fiction films like the Star Wars and Matrix series, and having spent too much time immersed in the chaotic frenzy of video games, they finally sit down to 2001 and are bored and frustrated by it. Well, naturally, if you're used to films in which every three seconds there is a crash, a special effect, a sex joke, an explosion or a killing - then you attempt to watch a slow, ponderous film like 2001 you're going to get bored. For those people, this is an education in what cinema can be. Science fiction doesn't have to be horror, comedy or martial arts. It can be literature and philosophy. 2001 dares to ask meaningful questions of the viewer, for example, What is mankind's place and purpose in the universe? And it doesn't provide all the answers. It challenges the viewer to come up with his\/her own answers. Other issues, such as man vs. machines of man's invention, and the possibility of higher intelligence than man existing, are also also addressed but not given pat or preachy answers. The ambiguity is part of the appeal of this film, in addition to the spectacular visuals. The slow pace and long scenes give the viewer a chance to digest and contemplate what he\/she has just seen and heard, while the film is still in progress. The long scene of the spacewalk with the only sound being the astronaut's breathing is intended to make the viewer a little uncomfortable. The extended special effects sequence near the end is almost like taking a hallucinogenic drug, but without the need to actually take one. This film, like other wide-screen epics (Lawrence of Arabia et. al.) really needs to be seen in a theater with a large screen and good sound system, or at least on a large, high-quality video screen with good sound. I was lucky to get to see it at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood in 1973, and it was shown with an intermission - and the soundtrack included an overture which was played before the curtain even went up, and also at the end of the intermission, to help set the mood. Of course the cinematography is masterful - space travel never looked this elegant or beautiful, in any other film save possibly Apollo 13. Beyond that, it is the intellectual challenge that the film presents to the viewer that makes this film so memorable.

I would agree with this in part because he doesn't show anything- the characters really- on any one side. We see her follies completely. But I think there is a male view going on with his look at these characters too; after we see how a woman can be all liberated and free of being too restricted with who she wants to love\/fool around with, there's more of a sympathy going on for the men too as the situation starts to come down to an essential thing- what does Nola REALLY want? By the end of the picture, no one can really say for certain, Nola most of all, but all the while Lee has given us a look at romance that is ordinary only in how some of the typical characteristics of men and women are portrayed at times. But really, it's also out of the ordinary on showing the little things that wouldn't get into the common romantic comedy. It's a little too loosely structured and the style isn't altogether great, but it has as much ambition as Scorsese's Who's That Knocking or Bertolucci's Before the Revolution, at least in trying to convey subject matter primarily through style. Not to say the substance is left unchecked- in fact for the most part it's one of Lee's sharpest satires on the troubles of the sexes, and the main characters are a bit more believable than those of the main white\/black couple of Jungle Fever. Lee boils it downs to seeming essentials at first- Nola (Tracy Camilla Johns, not bad at all if not as strong as the main 'heroine' could be) is a magazine painter, but really its her romantic life that keeps her usually occupied. We see the various attempts of various male 'pick-up lines' (which is pretty hilarious, if dated), and then we meet guy #1, Jamie (Tommy Hicks, maybe the best 'real' actor of the group), who is really the nice guy, the kind that any reasonable woman would consider probably marrying sooner or later. But she also has male #2, Greer (John Canada Turrell, with a great, shallow look to him if not overall performance), who is a male model who is meticulously egotistical even with folding up his clothes before sex. And then there's #3, Mars Blackmon (Lee himself, in uproariously huge glasses and his name etched out in gold across his neck, surely one of his most wonderful characters played by him), who is the jokester, and word-spinner, and always takes a while to get around in a conversation.So around and around she goes, and it's really only until the last twenty minutes when Nola finally has to come down and make the decision- and it perhaps will have to come down to the 'right' decision- but for what she just can't tell. Part of it is that she just loves sex, which becomes a problem when she invites over the three men for thanksgiving (not a totally successful scene, mainly due to the dialog and pacing, but still a nice job in awkward tension). And also a problem when Jamie, the nice guy, makes an ultimatum for Nola. At the same time in the background there is the unusual tension of a possible lesbian affair with Opal (Raye Dowell, very good in her scenes), but nothing comes to it. Scenes like those, where the sexual and relationship-type boundaries come into question, are really interesting. The self-conscious talking-to-the-camera interview bits range from excellent to just OK though, and sort of mark the quality of the film down a peg, even as the characters get to share some of their inner thoughts (Lee's being the funniest).What then makes Lee's film a big step above any other number of films out there, primarily in the Hollywood mainstream, about a woman who has trouble deciding what to do with herself? It's two things; one, that the men are probably just as interesting with what they have going on as her, if not more so for Jamie, and two, the cinematic techniques imposed by Lee and cinematographer Ernest Dickerson. The latter of those two helps make She's Gotta Have it even more of a light-hearted picture than it might have been if just filmed as the script is. We get the images first put to Lee's father Bill's score, which is definitely one of his best after Do the Right Thing. Then the images get a lot of invention on such a small budget, unusually intimate and creative camera angles (I loved the bit when we see in slow-motion the extreme close-ups of Mars getting close with Nola), the lighting often very expressionistic, and sometimes the editing going to playful, odd lengths like the sex scene between Nola and Greer. Sometimes the playfulness and first-time filmmaker amazement is a little much, like the color film sequence, which is beautiful but almost better self-contained than with the black & white grittiness of the rest of the film. I also could've done without the last bit after the denouement where all the actors say their names with the clapper. Nevertheless the stylistic merits add a lot to make it a richer film in context and structure.But if you can seek it out, especially in widescreen (I saw it on IFC, though I wish I could see the director's cut to see what was cut out, however explicit it might be), it's well worth it. It's a small film, yet one that brings up some intriguing bits about what it means to really love someone vs. desire them, and what mind-games go on between men & women, men & men, women & women, and where the middle-ground could be, if at all.

The fact that the film is called Snatch shows the main theme of the movie. The word snatch means to seize something in haste, which shows that greed is the motivational factor for all characters in the film. Vinny and Sol's use of fake guns b\/c they were cheaper than real ones. The movie ends with the circle of wealth still being passed on to others. Boris shows his greed in the scene where he cuts off Franky's entire arm, he obviously only needed to cut his hand to get the suitcase, but took more than he needed.

One of the skateboarders is Jonathan Cross, who had a chance to be the NHL's no. 1 draft pick. Instead, he goes to the former Soviet Union to participate in a real man's sport.Rollerball works this way male and female skaters and motorcyclists travel around a figure-8 track with ramps and a rabbit hole in the middle. Points are scored by hitting one of several bowl-shaped goals above the track with a ball--hard enough to make a bell ring.There is a lot of corruption in this sport. People bet on it as if they were betting on horses in this country. And TV ratings can be seen instantly--I haven't seen this since Max Headroom. Ratings go up if a player gets hurt. And this is a very violent sport. The players look the other way instead of concerning themselves with the ethics. After all, the money is great, and people who try to buck the system disappear.I'm not really a fan of movies like this, but I thought LL Cool J was good, and Rebecca Romijn was beautiful, despite her scar. She also did a good job; I wouldn't have known her because of the dark hair and the accent. Both played members of Jonathan's team.The standout performers, though, were Paul Heyman as the English-language TV announcer and Jean Reno as the man who owned the team, the coal mine, the supermarkets ...I also thought it was interesting to go behind the scenes. The men in suits got so excited. And an Asian announcer had about as much energy as his English counterpart. Fans of Metallica and other hard rock will probably enjoy the background music for the games, provided by live bands. I was going to say the band in Mongolia or Siberia or wherever it was made Metallica look like The Spice Girls--but then I remembered Metallica used to rock even harder than those guys.This seems like it would appeal to fans of The Fast and the Furious as well as pro wrestling. In addition to the skateboard scene, there were plenty of exciting chases involving cars, trucks, even an airplane. And of course the action on the track. One nighttime chase scene was filmed entirely in green, so some sort of night vision technology must have been involved. I will say it was pretty.What can I say? My taste in movies is obviously like 98.7 Simon on the radio--I'll watch anything.

It's not that dangerous out in the country, but when they reach the city, they must deal with traffic--including truckers who must honk their horns before they narrowly miss these daredevils! One of the skateboarders is Jonathan Cross, who had a chance to be the NHL's no. 1 draft pick. Instead, he goes to the former Soviet Union to participate in a real man's sport.Rollerball works this way male and female skaters and motorcyclists travel around a figure-8 track with ramps and a rabbit hole in the middle. Points are scored by hitting one of several bowl-shaped goals above the track with a ball--hard enough to make a bell ring.There is a lot of corruption in this sport. People bet on it as if they were betting on horses in this country. And TV ratings can be seen instantly--I haven't seen this since Max Headroom. Ratings go up if a player gets hurt.

Billy might dress like a cowboy, but in reality he is not even a Westerner; he was originally a New Jersey shoe salesman who has spent time in jail for the attempted murder of his unfaithful first wife. Two other stars of the show have criminal records- one for practising medicine without a licence, one for embezzlement- and a third has been on the run ever since deserting the Army during the Vietnam War.Billy has big ideas for his show, but the whole thing has a very amateurish air. One of his female assistants quits after he accidentally hits her in the leg during his knife-throwing act, another after she falls off his horse. He accidentally finds himself entangled with Antoinette, an heiress who has eloped but who has been abandoned by her husband. Antoinette's elopement was dictated not by love but by the terms of her late father's will, which provided that she will only inherit his money if she marries before the age of thirty. Her husband, John, is a fortune-hunting gigolo; his main attraction for Antoinette is that she needs a husband who is as mercenary as she is. Antoinette is reluctantly persuaded to become Billy's new assistant, but the two initially loathe one another. Of course, this being a romantic comedy, that means that they will eventually end up falling for one another.Antoinette is played by Sondra Locke, who was Eastwood's lover at the time. She starts off as cold, snobbish, sarcastic and foul-tempered before gradually mellowing; I wonder if her name was borrowed from the French queen who is popularly, although inaccurately, believed to have advised her starving subjects to eat cake. There is a similar development in another film from this period, The Gauntlet, which also starred the two together. In that film also Locke's character starts off as foul-mouthed and shrewish and the two characters initially hate one another before falling in love. This casts an interesting light, to say the least, on the real-life relationship of Locke and Eastwood.There are some amusing scenes arising from the efforts of Antoinette's stepmother Irene, with the assistance of a conniving lawyer, to defraud her stepdaughter of her inheritance. At one point Antoinette, having gone missing, is believed to be dead, and John is persuaded by the promise of a large windfall to confess to her murder. (The lawyer assures him that if he pleads insanity he will only receive a few years in a mental institution). The film is, however, more than simply a rom-com. It also deals with the theme of the way in which the enduring legend of the Old West continued to influence American culture even in the late twentieth century.Clint Eastwood's Billy character has been described as a parody of the sort of Western heroes he played in films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or High Plains Drifter, but in fact he is both a parody of and a celebration of the traditional Western hero. Billy's stage persona is similar to that of Roy Rogers or the Lone Ranger, the Western hero who tries to live by a simple moral code- honour, patriotism, decency, courage, truthfulness and (for the children) always do your schoolwork and respect your parents. Cinema Westerns of the sixties and seventies such as The Wild Bunch and Lawman had often taken a revisionist view of the Code of the West, trying to show that it was a myth. (Eastwood himself was later to make Unforgiven, possibly the greatest of all revisionist Westerns). Of course, the Code of the West was a myth- not everyone in the West was honourable, patriotic, decent, courageous or truthful. The word myth, however, in its original Greek sense, did not simply mean a falsehood. It meant a story which was not necessarily literally true but which had a deeper, symbolic significance. The significance of the Myth of the West for Billy is that he himself believes it. It is not merely a stage persona. He has his faults, but for the most part he does make a genuine effort to live by the code he preaches (which is why Antoinette, who has spent most of her life surrounded by phonies, ends up falling for him).In a scene at the end Billy and his troupe give their show, to the strains of a rousing Sousa march, in a tent symbolically made up of American flags stitched together. This indicates that this is a patriotic film, although this is not a gung-ho, military patriotism. Leonard, the Vietnam deserter, is treated sympathetically, which perhaps suggests that Eastwood is not the die-hard conservative he is sometimes assumed to be by both admirers and detractors. Rather, it is a wider patriotism celebrating the way in which America allows its citizens to reinvent themselves, to realise their full potential, to be whatever they want to be. Billy's circus may be small-scale and amateurish, but it has allowed Billy and his colleagues to live out their dreams. Billy, the shoe salesman with a criminal record has become, on his own terms at least, a sort of a hero. The Wild West Show thus functions as a microcosm of the Wild West itself, which in the nineteenth century allowed many Americans to make new lives for themselves, just as America has offered a fresh start in life to many people from other parts of the world.Until this film was recently shown by TCM as part of a Clint Eastwood season I had never seen it before; indeed, I had never heard of it. Having seen it, however, I am surprised it is not better-known, and can understand why Eastwood counts it among his favourites. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 November 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Bronco Billy McCoy is the poor man's Buffalo Bill Cody, the proprietor and star of a touring Wild West show, essentially a circus with a Western theme.

Based on the book We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young by Lt Col Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway about the first major battle in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965, the film accurately depicts the bloody engagement of four hundred American troops against two thousand North Vietnamese soldiers. The movie was was written and directed by Randall Wallace. There were three producers of the movie; Bruce Davey, Stephen McEveety, and Randall Wallace. We Were Soldiers takes a unique approach to the war story as told by cinema. This movie addresses the emotional toll the war has on the soldiers during the fighting, and the same toll as felt by the families they left behind to serve this country. The beginning of the movie revolves around the establishment of relationships between the soldiers and their families, as well as the connectedness of all the families portrayed in the movie. In no time at all, however, the viewer is introduced to the gruesome reality of war. Almost upon landing at LZ X-Ray, the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (led by Lt. Col. Hal Moore) are surrounded by enemy forces. Some of those soldiers whom the viewer is led to believe to be the main characters are quickly faced with the bitterness of mortality, as they are not immune to incoming enemy fire. Despite the large number of characters introduced, it was pretty easy to follow each individual story. There were no inconsistencies in character portrayal throughout the movie, lest you count Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley telling Sgt. Ernie Savage, That's a nice day, Sergeant Savage after Savage is rescued. This is inconsistent with Plumley because at the beginning of the movie, Plumley regularly dismisses Savage's attempts at describing the beautiful mornings at base camp. Other than the said example, the rest of the movie flowed smoothly in its character portrayal.Nick Glennie-Smith composed the music of We Were Soldiers. He delivered a highly passionate score filled with heroism and sadness. Every scene of heroism was filled with music set to inspire the viewer. Each scene of sadness was magically paired with a haunting piece of music. This can really be seen in the scenes in which Lt. Col. Hal Moore's wife Julie Moore delivers the telegrams to her friends and fellow wives. Or when 2nd Lt. Jack Geoghegan sacrifices his life to bring back a fallen soldier. The music is a perfect match to the movie. In We Were Soldiers, there are many instances of slow motion. This adds to the dramatic affect the director is looking to get from his audience. For instance, when Sp4 Galen Bungum and Sgt. Ernie Savage each kill a North Vietnamese soldier in hand-to-hand combat. The speed is slowed so that the viewer might really understand the soldiers' fight for survival in Vietnam, and realize the emotional impact that would be felt by the two American soldiers. Another scene was when Joe Galloway ran through the battlefield taking pictures of the dead, the wounded, and those in combat. Once again, this was done to allow the viewer to appreciate the full scope and magnitude of the fighting and sacrifice that happened in the Valley of Death. It was because of scenes such as these that really opened my eyes for the human need and want to survive. The will of these soldiers as portrayed by the actors was simply amazing. Such determination to keep the man standing beside them alive was truly inspirational. I think Lt. General Hal Moore had it right when he said, American soldiers in battle don't fight for what some president says on T.V., they don't fight for mom, apple pie, the American flag...they fight for one another. We Were Soldiers could be argued to be a propaganda movie that tries to glorify the Vietnam War. However, I believe that purpose for the movie was to bring to light the sacrifices of the American soldier and his family during this time period. In the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, the authors write about Hollywood movies of Vietnam, and how they got it wrong every time. Randall Wallace (director, writer, and producer of the movie) only sought to get it right. Though I wasn't even alive during the Vietnam War, I believe Wallace and his crew got it right, for once. The movie We Were Soldiers is a very probable movie. For one, it is based on actual events that occurred at the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Also, the movie is based on the nonfiction, documentary book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young. The special effects, the raw emotion, and the outstanding acting made this movie very believable. On a scale of one to four, four being the highest, I would rate the movie a four, for reasons found throughout this critique.

Despite the large number of characters introduced, it was pretty easy to follow each individual story. There were no inconsistencies in character portrayal throughout the movie, lest you count Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley telling Sgt. Ernie Savage, That's a nice day, Sergeant Savage after Savage is rescued. This is inconsistent with Plumley because at the beginning of the movie, Plumley regularly dismisses Savage's attempts at describing the beautiful mornings at base camp. Other than the said example, the rest of the movie flowed smoothly in its character portrayal.Nick Glennie-Smith composed the music of We Were Soldiers. He delivered a highly passionate score filled with heroism and sadness. Every scene of heroism was filled with music set to inspire the viewer. Each scene of sadness was magically paired with a haunting piece of music. This can really be seen in the scenes in which Lt. Col. Hal Moore's wife Julie Moore delivers the telegrams to her friends and fellow wives. Or when 2nd Lt. Jack Geoghegan sacrifices his life to bring back a fallen soldier. The music is a perfect match to the movie. In We Were Soldiers, there are many instances of slow motion. This adds to the dramatic affect the director is looking to get from his audience. For instance, when Sp4 Galen Bungum and Sgt. Ernie Savage each kill a North Vietnamese soldier in hand-to-hand combat. The speed is slowed so that the viewer might really understand the soldiers' fight for survival in Vietnam, and realize the emotional impact that would be felt by the two American soldiers. Another scene was when Joe Galloway ran through the battlefield taking pictures of the dead, the wounded, and those in combat. Once again, this was done to allow the viewer to appreciate the full scope and magnitude of the fighting and sacrifice that happened in the Valley of Death. It was because of scenes such as these that really opened my eyes for the human need and want to survive. The will of these soldiers as portrayed by the actors was simply amazing. Such determination to keep the man standing beside them alive was truly inspirational. I think Lt. General Hal Moore had it right when he said, American soldiers in battle don't fight for what some president says on T.V., they don't fight for mom, apple pie, the American flag...they fight for one another. We Were Soldiers could be argued to be a propaganda movie that tries to glorify the Vietnam War. However, I believe that purpose for the movie was to bring to light the sacrifices of the American soldier and his family during this time period. In the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, the authors write about Hollywood movies of Vietnam, and how they got it wrong every time. Randall Wallace (director, writer, and producer of the movie) only sought to get it right. Though I wasn't even alive during the Vietnam War, I believe Wallace and his crew got it right, for once. The movie We Were Soldiers is a very probable movie. For one, it is based on actual events that occurred at the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Also, the movie is based on the nonfiction, documentary book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young. The special effects, the raw emotion, and the outstanding acting made this movie very believable. On a scale of one to four, four being the highest, I would rate the movie a four, for reasons found throughout this critique.

I don't love it as a guilty pleasure, or as camp, or as an example of film-making from the Golden Age of Hollywood. I don't love it as a soap opera or as example of the long lost genre, the theatrical-release, big budget, woman's picture. I love Now Voyager as a movie. Now Voyager's quality could stand comparison with any great film out there.Plot Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis), the psychologically abused child of a sadistic iceberg of a wealthy, Boston Brahmin mother (Gladys Cooper), thanks to the intervention of a compassionate sister-in-law (Ilka Chase) is packed off to a posh asylum, where Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains) restores her to well being.Charlotte loses weight, loses her glasses, and receives tutoring in how to dress and carry herself. Superficially quite the glamor puss, she goes on a cruise and charms Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid) an unhappily married architect.Circumstance intervenes and Jerry and Charlotte enjoy a brief affair. As time goes on, they make some heart-wrenching decisions about how to handle their adulterous love; along the way, Charlotte forms an important bond with Tina, Jerry's daughter, whose mother does not love her.The screen is full of women's bodies, women's voices, women's choices, and women's lives. There are old women, middle aged women, and young women. There are good and bad women in every class. For example, while Tina is the sweet but unattractive and lost young woman, Bonita Granville, as June Vale, is a pretty, blonde, young b----. The scenes in which June, without censure from any quarter, uses her youth and prettiness to torment her pathetic spinster aunt are terrific, honest, and cruel.The plot is built around the issues of which women's lives are built their relationships with their mothers, or mother figures, both good and evil; how the world treats women based on how women look; women's competitions with, and support of, other women; what women do to survive economically and emotionally.The scenes between Charlotte and Tina are stunning in their sensuality. Tina, the daughter-surrogate, and Charlotte, the mother-figure, cling to each other in bed at night, and while sleeping under the stars on a camping trip; Tina sobs tears that wet her face; Charlotte strokes Tina's hair, and Tina clings to Charlotte's bosom.The simple message here is how incredibly important parenting is in the lives of both children and mothers, and how a person who has suffered -- Charlotte -- can often be a better person than those who have had it easier -- Mrs. Vale and June, and how having been handed a life that denies you love doesn't make it impossible for you to go out and find love on your own, to create your own family.Mrs. Vale is one of the most naked depictions of a child abusing mother ever committed to the screen. No, there are no graphic scenes of abuse, but the film never lets you believe that this woman is anything but a nightmare who damaged her child for life while the world let her get away with it because of her money.Again, the abuse is not graphic, but it is made certain. In one brilliant scene, Charlotte has returned to her mother's house after being out in the world and, for the first time in her life, experiencing some affection, joy, and confidence.Charlotte speaks in her new voice, a voice of self possession. But she is trying to be nice to her mother, and her voice quavers a bit, without losing its ground.Charlotte is out of camera range; we hear her, but do not see her. Her mother's back is to the camera. She is motionless -- except for her bejeweled, claw-like hand, which taps rhythmically against a carved bed post. One thinks of a cat waiting to pounce. One realizes that all that is going through Mrs. Vale's head is, How do I destroy her this time? That motion alone renders the scene both chilling and telling.Charlotte's love affair with Jerry Durrance is equally complex. This is no soap opera as some reviews here dismiss it as. Viewers are so caught up with Jerry's (Henreid's) trick of lighting two cigarettes at once that they miss the depth, power, and complexity of this relationship.Now Voyager gives us a terribly convincing portrait of two people who really love each other, and whose love is apparently doomed. Jerry is a superficially charming, nice guy whose unhappy marriage has given him reason to see beneath the surfaces of life; he's no rocket scientist, though, so he's not as smart as he could be. He is attracted to a superficially glamorous woman whose secret past as an ugly duckling and abused child gives her a hidden side. For both, society demands that they present a pleasant facade, but pain has caused them to develop in ways that many people never do. Their love is real.Jerry is deep enough to be attracted, but not deep enough to realize, as soon as he might, how much his acting on his attraction could potentially devastate Charlotte, a woman whose hold on her life is tenuous, at best.Whether their love can ever be realized, or whether it would continue to grow outside of the confines of an adulterous affair begun on a cruise ship and consummated after the most outlandish interventions of fate on a mountain road, is a question viewers can still debate to this day. What is clear is that this love is real, and its stakes are terribly high. Charlotte's whole life hangs in the balance here, no less so than a Scorcese hero's life hangs in the balance given how he handles his weapon.Claude Rains is solid as Charlotte's best hope at the beginning, and, perhaps, also at the end of the movie..

David Lean was an excellent director, but no director, no matter how brilliant or talented, could improve this ponderous postcard. Let's not forget it has Lara's Theme, which is cinema's most nauseating piece of music. To be fair, though, the negativity of my review primarily stems not from the relentless length of this overrated epic, but my disgust over the love story. Yuri Zhivago (doe-eyed Omar Shariff) is a brilliant doctor with a poet's heart who lives during the Russian revolution and who's married to his childhood sweetheart Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin). But familiarity breeds contempt and Yuri falls hard for volunteer nurse Lara (Julie Christie in all her vacant-eyed glory) while away on assignment. Lara has a tragic past and an unlucky history with men, yet she is easily the most boring troubled woman I've ever seen. Even though they are both married to others, Yuri and Lara begin a barely secret affair. They have several things in common, such as looking good in fur hats and being maddeningly uncomplicated. Meanwhile, Yuri and Tonya (remember her?) have been forced to move from their comfortable estate to a more modest home in the country, and to Yuri's perverse delight, Lara lives right down the road. In the film's most sickening scenes, Yuri goes off, supposedly to work, kisses the ever loyal Tonya good-bye&#133; and proceeds to sleep with Lara. Stuff happens, everyone dies, but by then I was too bored with the film and repelled by the so-called love story to care. The story pretends to care about the bigger issues at hand (Communism, the Russian Revolution) but it's really about the love triangle of Yuri\/Lara\/Tonya. Personally, I think Yuri was not only a dog for abandoning his wife and son, but a fool to even cheat on Tonya in the first place. Tonya is cultured, intelligent, steadfast, loving and beautiful (Chaplin resembles a more cherubic Audrey Hepburn). Chaplin deserves special praise for portraying the best woman a man could have without heading into Stepford Wife territory. I thought Lara was a dull, dreary, vapid object of lust and desire.

Lecter came back to America to help Starling out with her dilemma regarding her suspension. Like he could really do anything. It makes more sense for him to have returned because of his love for her. Which he is. Now the infamous dinner scene was just an insult to my intelligence. First off, he fixes up Clarice and her bullet wound. Fine. Gave the appropriate drugs to help her pain and healing. She wakes up and finds, very nice and neat, on the desk all her stuff. Cuffs, money...etc. Too convenient. Lecter disconnects the phone because he knew Clarice's nature would be to try to call the police. Why did he not just rip the phone off the wall to ensure no outside intruders? He just disconnected it where a child could put it together very easily. Clarice make the call to the cops and that limits Lecter from having quality time with her, which he has been aching to have. Remember, he does love her in his own sick way. He literally has only minutes to be with her before he has to escape. WHY? He is so smart and in love with her. He would never let that happen where she would call for help. He wants to eat the guy's brain and talk with Clarice. If he is to convince her to love him, without the use of drugs, he needs TIME...period. Time he did not allow himself to have.Now the cops are on their way. Time is short. He traps her with her hair and the fridge and ask if she could ever love him. The OBVIOUS answer is NO, NO, NO. Why would she? Dumb on Lecter's part. Makes no sense. He needed time and or drugs to get his way with Clarice. So he can hear the answer he longs for. If no is the obvious answer, maybe he never should of come to America, but I will talk about that in detail a little later in this writing. Let me go back a little now.In The Silence of the Lambs, the thing that I liked a lot about Jodie Foster's performance is that she was respectful of Lecter but, immensely afraid of him. Even between 6 to 10 inches of glass or steel bars separating them. She feared Lecter, which made me fear Lecter. Watch the movie again and see what I mean. Total fear yet controlled and respectful. I was scared every time she spoke with him. In Hannibal, Clarice is actually face to face with her worst nightmare and totally unafraid. This guy would in a second eat your face off and she attacks him like he is the bully neighbor you grew up with. She was drugged, I understand, but she was relentless the whole time. If a big dog chased me and I had a gun, I am brave because of the weapon yet I still would be afraid. The foreign cop guy in the beginning of the movie was afraid of him but, very greedy and it cost him his life. Clarice tried to get him with a knife and fist and then cuffs. She was relentless. It made me not afraid of Lecter. We all should be. He is capable of ANYTHING.Finally, Lecter escapes by mere moments from the police, minus one left hand. We are talking moments. Seconds. He is on the 10 most wanted list. Everyone in America is after him. All the airports have his picture, the state line, the damn Mexican border. His likeness is out there plus the now distinguishing mark of a missing left hand. Yet, he is able to board a plane for overseas, no problem. I am to assume he is on the plane days later after the dinner scene. It's not like he was in hiding for a while to let the heat die down. No disguise and no left hand to the airport for a flight overseas. I defy you to walk across the street after robbing the local 7-11 or gas station, and get you hand cut off and be able to board a plane for anywhere. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. That part makes no sense. Even if he dressed like a priest, all people with casts, or splints, or missing left hands would be questioned by airport officials.I like the beginning of the movie. It's after he arrived to America, the movie goes downhill. Keep the story simple consistent to real life regardless of the extreme circumstances.

It could be anywhere in the country. Most of us spend most of our lives doing jobs that are not rewarding and they become a dull routine. In large places, like the one we see in the film, some of the supervising personnel are pompous and love to bully the people under them, which is the case with Bill, the coffee drinking supervisor, who loves to make Peter's life miserable with the petty little details, like not having the reports with the proper cover sheet.Milton, a lonely man, seems to live to go to work. He surrounds himself with the right things to put in his time at the job. One of his prize possessions is the red stapler that the cruel Bill, takes away from him, leaving him sort of naked in the office. There are also Samir and Michael Bolton, the only friends Peter can rely on, especially in the long coffee breaks they must take just after they have arrived at the office.Peter is lost in this milieu until two things happen to him. First, is the therapist that hypnotizes him and then proceeds to drop dead right in front of Peter, leaving him in a state of Nirvana. The other is the appearance of Joanna, the friendly waitress of the restaurant where the friends meet. This young woman is the one that brings Peter out of his shell as he falls for her big time. Joanna, who is made to wear about fourteen different pins in her uniform, is also dissatisfied with her own life until she finds in Peter a kind soul mate.Mike Judge, who wrote and directed this film, presents all these characters without making them stereotypes. We all have known them, in some form, or another, and yes, we can identify to the life they live because we have been exposed to most of these characters in our working lives.Ron Livingston makes Peter a personal triumph. He clearly understood his character and plays it without making a caricature. Jennifer Aniston was another surprise in the film. Her Joanna is one of her best screen work. Stephen Root makes a wonderful Milton, the strange man we have met before in our own life. Gary Cole is perfect as the supervisor without a clue. David Herman and Ajay Naidu are seen as Peter's office pals.We had not seen this film since its release and on second viewing it still holds our interest thanks to the excellent material Mike Judge wrote for the occasion where we see ourselves and our co-workers in the big screen.
