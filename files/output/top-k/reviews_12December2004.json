What is a film and what is a movie. I take the logical stance most of the time, the crew films so that the director and editor can create a movie. But I have a difficult time thinking of Schindler's List as a movie. I didn't watch it to be entertained, no person with a clear vision of the history behind it would. So for me, Schindler's List is certainly a film, one about a real stain on our human history, a stain placed there solely from religious beliefs. The persecution and attempted extermination of the Jews by the German Nazis.But this film, while its overall subject is the holocaust, is not really about the holocaust. While it revolves around the mistreatment of Jews by the Nazis, it is about the man, Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson. A German, a connected man in society, he went to Poland and bought a factory, employing cheap Jewish labor, hoping to get rich. He was no humanitarian. But perhaps his biggest weakness, his not being an astute businessman, was responsible for the conversion we see during the course of the three hours running time of the film. He has to rely on a Jew, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), to run his factory. And the rest, as they say, is history. He changes to the point that he risks his own life to save many, perhaps over 1000, Jews from extermination, no longer for profit but for true humanitarian motives.Unique in this time of modern movie-making, this film is mostly in Black and white. For me this works very well, because first it is such a stark subject and second, there is not so much to distract the viewer from the story. Many consider this Spielberg's best directorial effort, probably because as a Jew it was very personal to him. As a viewer, many times I found it difficult to watch, because the scenes are so realistic. I will never forget the scenes of nude prisoners being marched across the prison grounds to their deaths. I give great credit for this film's place in history, but it is not one that I enjoy watching, it is such a reminder how some can be so cruel to those who should be treated as our brothers and sisters.

If you haven't seen this film, please stop reading.Eddie Miller is an old salesman who loses his job after having a mild heart attack. The firm he has been working for years suddenly decide to fire him because he cannot be insured any more. Eddie is in a difficult position; his wife has died and left him with debts that he must repay. This is a decent man who has done honest work for his company and suddenly finds he must either stay for a few weeks training the new guy, who is going to inherit his job, or else, go into an unknown future, probably doing menial work.The new man, Bobby is a happy go lucky kind of guy who enjoys his time on the road as it gives him the opportunity to play around all over his territory with waitresses, bar maids, or other women who are willing to have a good time with a handsome fellow. The contrast between Eddie and Bobby is notorious. Eddie prefers to stay in the motel room and solve puzzles rather than go drinking with the apprentice. This is a story of contrasts between two different generations. What makes the film so endearing is the great work by the two principals. Robert Forster has been around, behind the stars for quite a while. He is a reliable character actor who is dependable, does his work well, but one never sees him in a lead role such as the one in here.

Then again, I suppose this could be said about most of Stanley Kubrick's films. I've seen a few of his films lately, and have become quite a fan of his work... so far I've seen A Clockwork Orange, 2001 A Space Odyssey and this one(I've seen The Shining as well, but that was before I knew who Kubrick was and what kind of a director he was, so I didn't fully enjoy it). While I think both aforementioned titles are better than this one(if only slightly), I really did like this film. And while it isn't the best war film ever made, it is definitely one of the better. The film consists of two parts(though they aren't really that separated... and they are both parts of the same story), the first part being about the boot camp which trains the Marines, and the second one being about the Vietnam war.

However, here, he seemed almost lost for a few scenes... things didn't seem to go anywhere... maybe he's just not used to doing such a grand project... yes, he was a very ambitious director, with very big films on his resume... but I'm not sure if he had done something on this scale before(or after), so that might be it.

We first see Rocky, Sylvester Stallone,in the ring fighting journeyman boxer Spider Rico, Pedro Lovell. After getting illegally butted by the Spider a mad and outraged Rocky pounds him into the ring and into defeat. Pushing 30 and with his best fighting days behind him Rocky works on the Phillie docks as a collector for local mob boss Gazzo, Joe Spinelli, to make ends meet. Even as that, collecting mob debts, Rocky is too kind and good natured, a real softy, to break peoples arms legs and thumbs who are late in paying up. With his life set as a low level hood, thats just what Rocky is a mob enforcer, and washed up as a professional boxer he had nothing to look forward to in the future. Meanwhile the World Heavyweight Champ Appolo Creed, Carl Weathers, is out of opponents to defend his title against and needs a new act to attract a big crowd for his next payday in the ring. Appolo and the top promoter in the world of boxing Jergens, Thayer David, come up with this great idea that to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the United States, in 1976. Why not defend his championship against one of the descendent's of the man who discovered America Italian navigator Christopher Columbus. All at once the bleak future that was staring wash-up broken down club fighter Rocco Balboa became the once in a lifetime chance for proud Italian-America Rocky Balboa to show the world that he's not the bum or has been. Which everybody in the local boxing circles in Philidelpia thinks of him With the exception of his trainer Micky, Burgess Meredith. Rocky goes on the prove in the movie that he's a champ today as the champ that he always was of days past but never knew it. Stirring boxing film about the rags to riches story of a nobody, Rocky, who became a somebody in the ring against the heavyweight champ with nothing more then the guts and determination and those who stood behind him throughout the entire ordeal. Rocky trains and works himself into a championship caliber boxer to fight the fight of his life. Even in the end when he lost a close fifteen round decision to Appolo Creed he won not only the hearts but the respect of the whole boxing world as well as the world itself.Sylvester Stallone has never been able to top himself since he stared in Rocky and I doubt that he ever will. Rocky is a truly once in a lifetime movie and Stallone had just one once in a lifetime movie and he already used up his Rocky. As good as the fight scenes are the movie is even more heart lifting and touching with Rocky's actions out of the ring. Micky who at first humiliated Rocky in public when he threw him out of the locker room and later wanted to train and manage Rocky for the big fight with Appolo and get the chance, like Rocky, to be a champ. Rocky after telling the old sick man off and practically throwing him out of his apartment runs out to apologizes for what he did and then accepts his offer and lets bygones be bygones between him and Micky.

We first see Rocky, Sylvester Stallone,in the ring fighting journeyman boxer Spider Rico, Pedro Lovell. After getting illegally butted by the Spider a mad and outraged Rocky pounds him into the ring and into defeat. Pushing 30 and with his best fighting days behind him Rocky works on the Phillie docks as a collector for local mob boss Gazzo, Joe Spinelli, to make ends meet. Even as that, collecting mob debts, Rocky is too kind and good natured, a real softy, to break peoples arms legs and thumbs who are late in paying up. With his life set as a low level hood, thats just what Rocky is a mob enforcer, and washed up as a professional boxer he had nothing to look forward to in the future. Meanwhile the World Heavyweight Champ Appolo Creed, Carl Weathers, is out of opponents to defend his title against and needs a new act to attract a big crowd for his next payday in the ring. Appolo and the top promoter in the world of boxing Jergens, Thayer David, come up with this great idea that to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the United States, in 1976. Why not defend his championship against one of the descendent's of the man who discovered America Italian navigator Christopher Columbus. All at once the bleak future that was staring wash-up broken down club fighter Rocco Balboa became the once in a lifetime chance for proud Italian-America Rocky Balboa to show the world that he's not the bum or has been. Which everybody in the local boxing circles in Philidelpia thinks of him With the exception of his trainer Micky, Burgess Meredith. Rocky goes on the prove in the movie that he's a champ today as the champ that he always was of days past but never knew it. Stirring boxing film about the rags to riches story of a nobody, Rocky, who became a somebody in the ring against the heavyweight champ with nothing more then the guts and determination and those who stood behind him throughout the entire ordeal. Rocky trains and works himself into a championship caliber boxer to fight the fight of his life. Even in the end when he lost a close fifteen round decision to Appolo Creed he won not only the hearts but the respect of the whole boxing world as well as the world itself.Sylvester Stallone has never been able to top himself since he stared in Rocky and I doubt that he ever will. Rocky is a truly once in a lifetime movie and Stallone had just one once in a lifetime movie and he already used up his Rocky. As good as the fight scenes are the movie is even more heart lifting and touching with Rocky's actions out of the ring.

This system has been proved effective (not a single murder has occurred in the greater Washington D.C. area in several years), yet just when PreCrime is about to expand its divisions nationally, something horrible and seemingly irrevocable occurs its chief official, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is prognosticated to be the perpetrator of the murder of a complete stranger, Leo Crow, within 24 hours. Having recently lost his son to abduction, currently depressed with drugs and sobbing away at the memory of his happy family, this recent development succeeds in devastating and enraging John Anderton. Thus ensues a ruthless chase by the system to apprehend a certain, yet confused suspect. John of course is bemused and frightened at this indictment of murder, and will stop at virtually nothing, dodging his former allies against crime, altering parts of his body to elude security detectors, and abducting a primal precog (humans programmed to mind censors in pools to prognosticate murders) Agatha (Samantha Morton) to escape his captors and discover the truth behind his indictment in this mysterious and baffling murder. Rife with fascinating who dunnit scenarios, classic chase sequences, and plot contortions galore, yet featuring a perplexing and somewhat unresolved conclusion, Minority Report is an exceptional, if perplexing, piece of science fiction suspense that is entertaining, inquisitive, deceiving and wildly provocative. Spielberg's direction is remarkably stirring and subtle, and is orchestrated without much of his signature regard to sentimentality, but rather, criminality. Tom Cruise is attractive and menacing as John Anderton, as an innocent, yet perturbed fugitive on the lam sorting the pieces of PreCrime together. Colin Ferrell is sharp and engaging as the villain Witwer seeking to steal Anderton's position and capture him with malice and eagerness. Minority Report is an enjoyable and fascinating, if perplexing and disjointed, science fiction thriller that is entertaining through and through and a genuine thinking man's futuristic whodunnit. *** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"12 December 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Minority Report features the typical science fiction innovation of over-the-top technology circa Steven Spielberg's vision of 2050 America jumping scanners, perilous highway sectors, flying and tracking robots, booster rockets, and of course, advanced PreCrime technology that enables police officers to thwart homicides before they even occur and apprehend the suspect from committing the crime ever again.

But trading on that affection has meant selling your soul it would seem. At the time of filming,Duchovny himself was at his hottest property moment in his career.Not wishing to short sight his possible career path,but the massive reception for the X-files had also bought him some film leeway. So here we have the base for an excruciating indulgence. What we have in this film is basically smulchtz.Its a sickly sweet affair,playfully insulting your lighter side in the name of romantic comedy. Duchovny's wife has sadly departed but,..no wait!!..it turns out Driver needs a new heart..and ..er..yes she receives Duchovnys wife's's used thumper. Bring on the first plucked heart string at this point. Now as you well know,nothing in Hollywood romantic comedy comes easy. Theirs got to be the mechanism of a joke that propels us though this charade. You would clearly need to be gagged and bound in a box not to see where this is going.Its a case of how will she tell him...how will he react..oh i wonder.. The supporting cast is tastefully sublime,simmering away in the background.Belushi serves as a side comedic role as the best friends husband.In 1 or 2 scenes he could have taken the film himself and ordered everyone off the set i dare say!!!!. The quirky off beat manner that makes Driver so alluring and attractive to watch,is at least,present. Duchnoy however,seems to be as hollow as ever and rivalling Keanu Reeves in the wooden furniture impressions. It will appeal to a soft female audience who thrive on these heart warming,slightly too sickly for consumption films,but the average male will have hanged himself by the first 20 minutes(optimistic prediction).

They visit the various lame attractions the carnival has to offer like a magician named Marco the Magnificent (William Finley), a strip show, a fortune teller named Madame Zena (Sylvia Miles), and a freak show complete with two headed cows and deformed babies. Completely out of nowhere total knuckle head Richie suggests that they spend the entire night in the carnivals funhouse, don't ask why. Amy's little brat of a brother Joey (Shawn Carson) visits the carnival on his own, strangely he doesn't interact with anyone else at the carnival and has no significance whatsoever to the overall story, he just generally walks around aimlessly to waste time. Once in the funhouse they hide and get ready for a long night. Then under neath them a light turns on, they appear to be above another room. The friends look on as Madame Zena the fortune teller and the funhouse's attendant (Wayne Doba) who wears a Frankenstein mask enter the room below them. The attendant gives Zena $100 in exchange for her to masturbate him. After he can't get an erection and Zena refuses to give him his money back he strangles her. The friends try and leave the funhouse but all the doors are locked and chained up, they are trapped. They decide to head back to their hiding place, again they look into the room below. The funhouse's Barker (Kevin Conway) who happens to be the attendants dad is also there now. The attendant takes his Frankenstein mask off and reveals that he is a mutant freak. Richie drops his lighter and they are discovered. From then on the friends must survive as they are hunted down one by one.Directed by Tobe Hooper, and according to the IMDb he turned down Steven Spielberg's offer to direct E.T. (1982) because of this film, bad move Tobe, bad move. This adds nothing new to the horror or slasher genre. It's predictable, dull, boring, over talkative and uninteresting. The opening sequence rips off both Halloween (1978) and Psycho (1960) or if you prefer pays homage to them, either way it gave me the feeling that there wasn't going to be an original idea in the whole film, and by the end I thought I was proved right. There's just about next to no gore or violence and an extremely low body count, no one is killed until over half way through the film. The monster itself, created by Rick Baker, is revealed in a very low key fashion. It's obviously just a mask that has no movement at all, the eyes, nose and forehead are static while occasionally it's mouth will open and close a little bit. Personally I thought he looked creepier with the Frankenstein mask on. There is brief nudity at the start as Amy takes a shower. The script by Larry Block is strictly by the numbers, I could easily tell who was going to survive, and that she would stop screaming become tough and resourceful and kill the bad guy at the end. Something else to take into consideration is that this was made after or about the same time as most other early eighties slashers including Halloween, Friday the 13th (1980), the Burning (1981), the Prowler (1981), Hell Night (1981), Just Before Dawn (1981), My Bloody Valentine (1981) and Night School (1981) and I would stick Funhouse right at the bottom of that list. The main problem I had with it is that it's just so devoid of any action, it takes 40 odd minutes for Richie to even suggest they spend the night in the funhouse, and it's one of those film where I got the feeling not much really happened between the start and finish. The only thing the film has going for it is the fact that it's technically very well made and has a polished look about it, otherwise this is a total waste of time. Recommended to insomniacs only.

It's certainly vivid, though it's so relentless and there is so little variety in the movie's mood that it becomes a drag. Anyway, stuff like rain and good lighting are nothing without a good script, so moving on . . .Characters come on, classic Hollywood mismatched buddies movie, only without the slapstick. The young, overeager cop and the jaded cop who slowly learns how to deal with him. Give me a break. There's nothing here that I haven't seen in 500 other cop movies. They just stuck this million-year-old and million-times-used Hollywood trope in the middle of a serial killer movie. Bravo. As for whether John Doe is a great villain (I can't believe people would compare him to Keyser Soze or Hannibal Lecter), more on that in the themes.Plot\/twists What exactly do people think is clever about haivng each murder correspond to one of the 7 deadly sins? The cleverest one is the first one--the killer makes the guy glutton himself to death by eating until his stomach bursts--and that isn't exactly mind-blowing, but once it's out of the way and you get the basic idea, all the others are 5x less elegant. It would be cooler if the killer had actually found a way to *truly* turn people's own faults against them--i.e., trapping the Greed guy by making him put himself in harm's way when tempted by the promise of money, or killing the Lust victim just by tempting them with an attractive but diseased person. Instead, all of these murders come down to the murderer holding a gun to the person and ordering them to act something out that in some (often convoluted) way has something to do with the sin. For lust, he kills a woman while she's having sex. This is supposed to be clever\/creative? And it gets weaker, not stronger, at the end. **Spoilers alert, I guess.** The envy victim doesn't die of envy--instead, he kills her and explains to the cop that he's guilty of envy. How elegant. The final twist--making the guy kill him out of wrath--is the cleverest, and is cute, but that's about all I can say about it. It certainly doesn't live up to the ridiculous buildup they give it during that car ride when they say this will be a masterpiece and remembered by everyone. A killer killed 6 people in contrived ways that somehow had something to do with the 6 sins, and then for the 7th he got someone to kill him out of wrath. I mean . . . not bad, but certainly not great. Plus, that last scene doesn't even make sense. If I were Morgan Freeman, I would say Hey, put the gun down and just beat the guy up. That would be infinitely more satisfying anyway, and it would be pretty freaking easy to claim it was in self-defense afterward . . . good thing for John Doe's little scheme that they didn't think of it. Anyway, the ending is cute, but not the kind of mind-blowing ending that would make up for an otherwise ho-hum movie.Themes OK, I have a major beef with anyone who calls this movie profound or the killer's philosophical view interesting. We all know there are lots of people doing bad things in the world, but (a) it seems to me that the seven deadly sins are entirely the wrong place to focus, as evidenced by John Doe's unconvincing You mean a guy didn't deserve to die for being so fat it was gross? Come on--things like gluttony and sloth are things that you should stay away from for your own sake, but in the scheme of things that people should be killed for, they should be all the way at the bottom. You're telling me that sloth is worse than deceptiveness? Or, say, racism? I don't even think there's anything wrong with lust. And wrath can be justified. (b) Granted that we know lots of people do bad things, what exactly does it accomplish OR illustrate OR express to pick out 7 people (one of whom wasn't even guilty of any of the 7 sins) and kill them in ways that graphically illustrate the 7 sins? Is this supposed to show how sinning will kill you? (Only if there's a serial killer holding a gun to your mouth making you act it out . . .) Or just reinforce the message Hey, sinning is bad? They try to present John Doe as this mysterious, rational, calculating, intriguing man completing a masterpiece, but I end up seeing him as a nutcase whose project makes no sense and doesn't express anything meaningful. A truly chilling character is one who scares me not just by being violent, but through the idea that he has some sort of special wisdom or intelligence that threatens my view of myself as normal and right. Keyser Soze (a true mastermind) has this. Hannibal Lecter does as well. Some idiot who kills 7 random people because he's off on a Bible-beating rant that's barely coherent?
