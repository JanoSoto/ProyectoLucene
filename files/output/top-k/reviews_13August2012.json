[{"date":"13 August 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Quirky characters, fast paced dialogue and equally fast comic situations, Bringing Up Baby is where any viewer can become absorbed into the hilarious madness which ensues and inhabits the narrative.All beginning when Palaeontologist David Huxley is seeking funding for his project he unexpectedly runs into Susan Vance, whose assertiveness beings to dominate the more feeble David the moment they first meet. From here Bringing Up Baby becomes a romantic story with a difference. It is the female who vigorously seeks the male for romantic desire rather than the usual vice versa and through comically deceitful means. And it all works to perfection thanks to the chemistry of the two leads.David is a passive and easily led person opposed to Susan's persuasive strength and cunningness. If it was any other genre besides comedy then the relationship between such contrasting characters would be bleak however in this case Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn give to their respective roles warmth and likability that for the audience helps Bringing Up Baby to be a greatly engrossing film. The same can be said for the large amount of peculiar and zany situations the characters find themselves in. Chasing a pet leopard all over the woods, going to desperate methods to hide a gigantic rip in Susan's dress and Susan mocking the Police Chief with a fantastic parody of a gangster's moll, we go from one dynamic situation to another at such an alarming rate you can't help but enjoy the experience being offered.The non &#x96; stop pace and abnormal events evidently makes Bringing Up Baby memorable viewing and a comedy which you can still appreciate.
