It was what started off my fascination with science-fiction. The aspects of time-travel are very interesting, and in the case of this film, it demonstrates what a fundamental impact it can have on the world altering the events of yesterday to affect tomorrow.I imagine just about everyone in the world must have seen the Terminator, since this is the film that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger's film career. This is by far his best film (and performance) when compared to some of his later films.The Terminator begins in the future, 2029 A.D. amongst the ruins of Los Angeles. This is indeed a grim, bleak vision of the future, since there has been a nuclear war, and a war that is currently raging between man and machine. A sophisticated computer, Skynet, has declared war on the human race. Ironically, Skynet was built by humans to act as a defence for humanity. But the computer became self-aware, and decided all people were a threat. So it began the system-wide extermination of the human race.To carry this out, Skynet has built an army of machines to destroy humanity. But a young man, John Connor, formed a resistance movement, and managed to turn the war to our favour. But Skynet is not so easily defeated. It sends a machine called a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), back through time to 1984, to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before she can give birth to John.In response, the resistance sends one of their soldiers, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back through time to intercept the Terminator before it carries out its mission. Reese must protect Sarah at all costs, or humanity's future is doomed.Arnie is perfectly cast as the Terminator (or T-101), because he manages to give a very believable performance of a machine. He portrays the Terminator as something that is not clouded by compassion or feeling. Completely emotionless. He will hunt down Sarah to the ends of the Earth if necessary to complete his deadly mission. There is a great scene when Reese is describing to Sarah what it is they're up againstListen, and understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead.Arnie is utterly without mercy, tracking down Sarah with total efficiency and clinical detachment. He murders people left, right and centre in his pursuit of Sarah. He allows nothing to stand in his way. Probably the scariest aspect to Arnie's character is he is not evil. He is just doing what he has been programmed to do. If that means committing unspeakable acts to complete his mission, then so be it.The film is extremely suspenseful, as the Terminator cuts a swathe of destruction in pursuit of Sarah. One of the best scenes is when Sarah is in a police station, and the Terminator just barges right in and kills nearly 20 policemen. This is a brilliant example of how single-minded the Terminator is. That scene alone was probably influenced by Assault on Precinct 13, but still the scene is a moment of shocking intensity.Both Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton put in good performances. Sarah's character shows a great deal of evolution in this film. At first, she is a slightly scatty waitress. But when told she is the mother of the future, her experiences harden her until she becomes a brave soldier in the face of adversity. The stunning climax really shows how far she has come from her introduction at the beginning of the film.Michael Biehn's performance is pretty good, because the audience is not really sure what to make of him at first. The script constantly keeps you guessing, and for all we know, Reese might be the bad guy too. He's got a good chemistry with Linda Hamilton, and we get to see his world through his eyes. The scenes of war-torn L.A. are good, and shows the constant struggle humanity must contend with against the machines they created in the first place.Because this was James Cameron's first feature film, it has a rather modest budget when compared to the other two films. Wisely, Cameron uses suspense to keep the audience hooked. Some of the chase scenes are helped no end by the pounding music from composer Brad Fiedel. They feel even more gripping, and send chills down my spine. Admittedly, the FX have dated considerably. E.g. the scene when Arnie must remove one of his human eyes. Other technologies like CGI were only in their infancy at this stage. But still, the endoskeleton looks very impressive, and still scares me at the film's finale.There is a very interesting paradox involving Sarah's son, but for those who haven't seen the film, I won't reveal it. Some of the science seems rather nonsensical, but when talking about time-travel, there are lots of unanswered questions. The paradox is explained further in the other two films, so you may not completely understand the paradox until you've seen all the films in the trilogy.The film that introduced Arnie's catchphrase I'll be back has never sounded better then in this film. Arnie's movements, mannerisms are all perfect. Everything about this film is superb, and is the best of the Terminator trilogy. From the great beginning and that theme music, to the shocking outcome. It constantly keeps you guessing, and hits you right between the eyes with all of the intensity of an unrelenting nightmare.Simply marvellous.

As the only black writer on staff, Delacroix's boss, Thomas Dunwitty, demands that he produces a proper black show instead of his usual middle class black sitcoms that have black characters `acting white'.  Offended but contractually unable to quit, Delacroix comes up with a show that will be so racist and offensive that he will be fired - an update of the old minstrel show.  However the show becomes an unexpected hit.A fascinating failure of a satire, Lee succeeds in making his audience think, even if he produces a slightly messy plot and leaves himself open to accusations of the pot literally calling the kettle black.  The plot is an interesting swipe at blacks in the media - at those who green light the shows, perform in the show and watch the shows.  In other words - there aren't many who will watch this film who won't feel like Lee was having a go at them; which is a problem because Lee offers no answers or suggestions. Lee's basic point is that the modern portrayal of blacks on tv\/film is no different from the days when they were buffoons or exaggerated comedy figures - the only difference being that now they are painted as `urban' caricatures as opposed to c**ns and n*ggers.In the UK this is maybe not as true but when I have been in the US I've always been taken back by just how many black sitcoms there are on TV - all of them with exaggerated black comedy caricatures rather than characters. True, there are white sitcoms that do the same but the number of white actors in these things are not out of proportion with how they are represented in other types of show.

Story is of course about Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) who have become top spies for their agency but now they are in competition for the best jobs by another brother\/sister spy team. A gadget called the Transmooger that can shut down any defense system is stolen from the President and Juni is blamed for his carelessness. The Agency sends Gary (Matthew O'Leary) and Gerti (Emily Osment) who are the children of Donnagon (Mike Judge) who is in charge of Operations so Carmen hacks into the computer and has the mission changed so that she and Juni are sent instead. They travel underwater to an island that is invisible and inhabited by strange looking creatures but they have to hurry because Gary and Gerti will be showing up eventually to get the Transmooger that they are trying to find as well. The meet Romero (Steve Buscemi) who is hidden underground because he was the one that created all the creatures and he thinks they want to kill him. Meanwhile, Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid Cortez (Carla Gugino) are in pursuit to find their children along with the help of Grandfather (Ricardo Montalban) and Grandmother (Holland Taylor). Not only did Robert Rodriguez direct this film but he also wrote, edited, produced, scored and did the production design. I'm sure he did other things as well and this shows that he remembers his days as a poor independent filmmaker with this type of self reliance. Rodriguez has a wild imagination and its not uncommon in his films for him to throw everything at an audience but the kitchen sink. This film is chock full of digital effects and at times it bordered on being more animated than live action. As much as I enjoyed the first film I always told people that I thought it would be even better if the story was more simplified. Have the kids in more realistic situations like James Bond but instead we got a cartoonish film with walking thumbs and gadgets that even Bond himself would laugh at. Here in this sequel it goes even more over the top with such outlandish situations that even Indiana Jones would be clueless. I couldn't decide which was more incredible, the giant monsters on the island or the fact that parents were sending their small children out on dangerous missions to save the world! Another thing I noticed was the sister of Haley Joel Osment who plays one of the other spy kids. It may be too soon to judge her but after watching Emily Osment's performance in this film she should beg her brother for acting lessons. She has an eternity to go. I am recommending this film for its wild imagination and high tech energy and their are some nice tributes to the great Ray Harryhausen but if they continue to make these sequels they might want to think about simplifying the stories.

Moreso when that true story is one that means a lot to you as Ed Harris has said about Jackson Pollock's biography.Based upon those precepts, I feel Harris succeeded, however I cannot say this film is an unqualified success. It is sprawling, but unlike Pollock...for cinema circulation, Harris could not stretch his canvas so wide. He gets over two hours here...but I suspect he could have filled six easily.Based upon early buzz when this came out,  including the snippet shown at the Oscars for Marcia Gay Harden, I had trepidation that this would be reduced to a shout and spittle film; that the rage and angst of Pollock and Krasner would be the story. Certainly this is one aspect presented, but not the sole one.Interestingly to me, it seemed that the more halcyon Pollock's life was, the better his exploration of his art. I went in expecting that alcohol-oiled turmoil would be presented as the key to complicated creation. An artist must suffer and so on.This shows that while I was familiar with Pollock, I was not that familiar. I could recognize his later chaotic, laced and dripped paintings...but I did not know anything about his personal life.But in the course of two hours, I did enjoy...1) Seeing a progression in Pollock's paintings. I had not seen many of his earlier works that had more blocks to them, that were more easily seen as assemblages of images. The way these were filmed, in the act of creation was well done here. Same is true for the latter works.      2) The importance of Pollock's family. I loved seeing his Mother come to the openings. I did not know that two other brothers also painted; Sande alone seems to understand Jackson's talent and torment. Their relationship could have made a film of its own. 3) Jeffrey Tambor's portrayal of Clem, a critic\/king-maker of sorts. Us posters here, run the risk of being posers as well. And I think the best of us realize how subjective our comments are, a function of when we watch films, and who we are with, or how we are feeling as much as the films themselves. 4) Following on that notion, to me one thread of Pollock is how the circle of critics destroys artists with either persecution or praise. It is not a revelation, that much art is highly personal, both for the purveyor, but painfully so for the artists. Not a revelation, but still worth repeating... When we see Pollock drunk on his ascent, reading from an Italian magazine during a family reunion, that really got to me. Maybe that was more dangerous than alcohol. Even if that critical acceptance is not essential, eating is. Another thread alluded to in this film, how to work and to live as an artist.That scene also drove home the obsessive nature of being an artist, how it is hard at the same time to be a brother, or uncle, husband or perhaps impossible to be a father. Thus that obsession helps to contrast Sande and Jackson, and certainly sets up the power of Marcia Gay Harden's performance.  Krasner too is an artist,  who has had some success. She retains her name, and her dreams, but fully embraces Pollock, and Pollock's artwork. Her support of him, while aware of her limits, was presented without martyring her. She was not a saint wandering into Pollock's hell. 5) Talking to an artist about his\/her obsession is problematic. They are already communicating in their chosen medium, and presumably they are communicating that way as it is easier than using words. I thought the interview with Life magazine in this film, and Pollock's notion of viewing his art as one views a field of flowers helped me. Maybe that was obvious to others, I think that way in music\/sound...but in art too often I am hunting for images, for mirrors to our world.The radio interview that Pollock conducted, halting and awkward could have underscored the travails of talking about art, or it seemed like he was trying to read from a manifesto of sorts (perhaps in real life one exists). Finally, the documentary film is painted as an undoing of Pollock. Fascinating as we ourselves are watching a film about Pollock. It's as if Ed Harris the actor in character could be talking to Ed Harris the film auteur.The documentary film was to Pollock, what a zoo can be to a wild animal. The habitat corrupts the inhabitant. How Pollock puts on his shoes, when he's done painting, all control is lost...the private process made public, is made impure.No, that's not the point to this film. If you are looking for a film with one tidy point, go elsewhere. But for an abridged but admirable biopic on Jackson Pollock, with many tangled and tantalizing threads...this is one to rent. And now a book for me to read. Rarely do I watch the deleted scenes and wish they had been in the film, as I did in this case.There was a great shot early in the film where Pollock is pacing before the mural commissioned by Peggy Guggenheim. From the plot, we know he's worried about looms before him, and we get eerie shots of his shadow projected on the empty canvas to reinforce that. Harris too may have felt this was an ominous undertaking, I hope he pleased himself as he did me.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 December 2003","score":"17 out of 21 people found the following review useful","review":"  I think it is very hard in general to make a based on a true story sort of film, that alone can clamp a pretty heavy anchor to your ankles.

Moreso when that true story is one that means a lot to you as Ed Harris has said about Jackson Pollock's biography.Based upon those precepts, I feel Harris succeeded, however I cannot say this film is an unqualified success. It is sprawling, but unlike Pollock...for cinema circulation, Harris could not stretch his canvas so wide. He gets over two hours here...but I suspect he could have filled six easily.Based upon early buzz when this came out,  including the snippet shown at the Oscars for Marcia Gay Harden, I had trepidation that this would be reduced to a shout and spittle film; that the rage and angst of Pollock and Krasner would be the story. Certainly this is one aspect presented, but not the sole one.Interestingly to me, it seemed that the more halcyon Pollock's life was, the better his exploration of his art. I went in expecting that alcohol-oiled turmoil would be presented as the key to complicated creation. An artist must suffer and so on.This shows that while I was familiar with Pollock, I was not that familiar. I could recognize his later chaotic, laced and dripped paintings...but I did not know anything about his personal life.But in the course of two hours, I did enjoy...1) Seeing a progression in Pollock's paintings. I had not seen many of his earlier works that had more blocks to them, that were more easily seen as assemblages of images. The way these were filmed, in the act of creation was well done here. Same is true for the latter works.      2) The importance of Pollock's family. I loved seeing his Mother come to the openings. I did not know that two other brothers also painted; Sande alone seems to understand Jackson's talent and torment. Their relationship could have made a film of its own. 3) Jeffrey Tambor's portrayal of Clem, a critic\/king-maker of sorts. Us posters here, run the risk of being posers as well. And I think the best of us realize how subjective our comments are, a function of when we watch films, and who we are with, or how we are feeling as much as the films themselves. 4) Following on that notion, to me one thread of Pollock is how the circle of critics destroys artists with either persecution or praise. It is not a revelation, that much art is highly personal, both for the purveyor, but painfully so for the artists. Not a revelation, but still worth repeating... When we see Pollock drunk on his ascent, reading from an Italian magazine during a family reunion, that really got to me. Maybe that was more dangerous than alcohol. Even if that critical acceptance is not essential, eating is. Another thread alluded to in this film, how to work and to live as an artist.That scene also drove home the obsessive nature of being an artist, how it is hard at the same time to be a brother, or uncle, husband or perhaps impossible to be a father. Thus that obsession helps to contrast Sande and Jackson, and certainly sets up the power of Marcia Gay Harden's performance.  Krasner too is an artist,  who has had some success. She retains her name, and her dreams, but fully embraces Pollock, and Pollock's artwork. Her support of him, while aware of her limits, was presented without martyring her. She was not a saint wandering into Pollock's hell. 5) Talking to an artist about his\/her obsession is problematic. They are already communicating in their chosen medium, and presumably they are communicating that way as it is easier than using words. I thought the interview with Life magazine in this film, and Pollock's notion of viewing his art as one views a field of flowers helped me. Maybe that was obvious to others, I think that way in music\/sound...but in art too often I am hunting for images, for mirrors to our world.The radio interview that Pollock conducted, halting and awkward could have underscored the travails of talking about art, or it seemed like he was trying to read from a manifesto of sorts (perhaps in real life one exists).

Any film of the forties can't be complete with out the house wife\/ mother.  Melinda Dillon acts, and looks like the typical house wife of the forties who cares for her family. Ralphie's dad, who is refrred to as `the old man',  is somewhat crabby, but for the most part he is a very likable character. He likes to enetr contests and eventually wins a `major award' which turns out to be a sexy leg lamp. The `Old Man has a tendency to use bad language, however, when Ralphie starts to use some of these words, he is punished by having his mouth washed out with Life Boy Soap. . Jean Shepherd's narration, and Peter Billingsley's portrayal of Ralphie make it seem as though the two really grew up in the forties.  From the way he dresses to the way he acts, Peter does a great job acting out Ralphie's part.  The same goes with Jean Shepherd.  Although he is not acting, just narrating, he describes Ralphie's childhood so well that it almost seems as though we are growing up with him. Similarly, the supporting actors and actresses, Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin, Ian Petrella and Ralphie's friends, Schwartz and Flick who are played by Scott Schwartz and RD Robb, add a lot of humor to the story.The reviewer would rate this movie a six out of five star rating.  No matter what happens in the movie it manages to have a great plot.  Ladies and Gentlemen.  Make room for this movie on your video or DVD rack at home!

Well, my first hope was overfufilled.  Jar Jar is not only almost never on screen, but he is responsible for single handedly screwing over the entire universe.  Nice one George.  My favorite part was Jar Jar convincing the Senate to give Palpatine those 'Emergency Powers,' I kid you not. Unfortunatly, my second hope went only moderatly fufilled!  Hayden Christensen's preformance was only slightly better than that pug-faced little brat Jake Lloyd's. Hayden did have a terrible script to work with, but that's no excuse.

Hayden just sounds like a whiny little brat, like what Jake Lloyd would grow up into maybe, but not Anakin Skywalker.

Good effects and CGI.  Obviously the acting and the dialogue are the worst aspects.  I think that the plot is sound, and can't wait to see how it unfurls in Ep 3.  What I won't be looking forward to is more mediocre acting, bad dialoge, and more Jar Jar Binks.  When I make my millions, I'm going to hire a good twisted director like Tim Burton and finance the remaking of the pre-tril.

On the surface, it is indeed a somewhat illogical and tedious, but underneath it all, it is a deep and meaningful journey of catharsis and rebirth of the human psyche.For all intents and purposes, this was more of a play than a movie. There were only a few characters and a lot of dialog; therefore we cannot expect the big bangs and simplified plot lines of cinema.  Instead we must search for the underlying meaning played out through the characters' experiences.I am not quite sure about the exact meaning of it all, and I was hoping for some insight relayed in user comments, but it looks quite solitary in here. The best I can come up with by myself is that this was a story about humanity's struggle to get to the top, and dealing with the consequences of cheating your way there.  The characters cannot be content with their lives because they haven't come to terms with the sacrifices they made.  The horse, Simpatico, is representative of the house built from their sins.

I liked the humour in the situation being swapped - Jones is clueless, Smith is the expert. This makes for a number of very cool jokes (old and busted - new hotness).--Frank, the talking dog, really stole the show. He was a hoot and a half. I loved him wearing the MIB seat, and the hysterical sing-along to Who Let the Dogs Out?--The best jokes in the movie are the ones that are intelligent and not just humorous one-liners. For instance, the post office sequence I found to be very clever and also absolutely HILARIOUS. The final scene in the movie was very impressive, funny and had a bit of philosophy mixed in there too!--Men in Black II shows us a little more about actually being a man in black, other than you are an ultra-cool kick-ass alien fighter. In some very effective scenes we get to see the loneliness that comes with this job, and consequences and prices are always a subject I'm open to. Very cool&#133;one of the strengths in the film other than some terrific jokes.THE BAD--The slapstick, clichéd jokes brought down the quality of the movie sufficiently. I didn't really like those chain-smoking, martini-loving warm aliens; their jokes were just TOO obvious for my liking.--The villain of the film, played by Lara Flynn Boyle, is very stupid. I just don't really like Flynn Boyle as an actress; I found her very boring in the role. She just didn't sell me on being funny, memorable or threatening. Perhaps part of the problem with her not holding up as much of a threat is because all she does practically is stay in a building for the majority of the movie. She doesn't have any interesting or important characters to interact with therefore she can't say or do anything thrilling making her one of the most dull villains of 2002.--There were too many plot holes in this film. I would like an explanation as to how the baddies always get fired down, shot, burnt, but then a scene later they appear right as rain and ready to kick ass? Also, what the hell happened to Johnny Knoxville's rather entertaining character? He could've made it, because one head was trying to resuscitate the other head but he didn't get much of a send off, he just never came back. And what the hell happened to Linda Fiorentino's character from Men in Black?--The final scenes of the film speed by with not much imagination, a lacking atmosphere and a very dull wrap up in general to the storyline of the film.--Too much repetition from Men in Black. The upside down car thing was used again, and the storyline doesn't bring much new plot-wise.

These films are released and then I hear that gang rape amongst French youth is on the increase in the ghetto areas. Are there too many people working at the post office or what? I thought French people lazed around reading Sartre and drinking red wine. Not brutalizing each other so badly that they will be traumatised for the rest of their lives!   When I went to see this, the idiot ticket vendor would not sell the damn ticket to me because he was Christian and believed that I would be condemning myself to hell by watching this film. They also looked at me as if I was forcing the female person I was with to see it! I was not! GROAN!!! Also why do Christian politicians insist on banning films? Both Ken Park and Baise Moi were banned and then released. This then had the effect that everyone 18+ in Auckland came out and saw the two films. In fact Ken Park was probably more popular than Attack of the Clones here! 'Baise Moi' is really bad. It is shocking but that does not make a good film.  It seems like a porn director wanted to make a bad Tarantino knock off. It is paint by numbers Tarantino, but without any of Tarantino's talent. The acting is bad and the story weak. It is exploitation and well...it's violent porn essentially. I mean Russ Meyer made films that mixed sex and violence but his films were way more entertaining. The whole film looks like a bad home movie. It seems like the people involved just wanted to make some easy money by shocking everybody. What irritates me about films like these is that they try and attempt to present themselves in a sought of arty-indy veneer. This way it gives the film more street credibility. One reviewer here states this is punk rock film making. No, this is just very bad film making. This is certainly not 'art.'  The fact that it was made by two women just adds a kind of Annabel Chong self loathing to the whole exercise. I mean it is a film that literally goes from one violent\/sexual scene to another. The characters are psychotic and well...jaded beyond belief. But with the constant bombardment of violent images, this just jades the viewer as well. For example after having being delivered a horrible scene of rape. The two women go and stomp a guy to death for being a 'condom dickhead,' yawn... I mean 'Henry, Portrait of a Serial killer' got its point across much more effectively. The serial killer at the bottom of society, travels around the country killing because he has nothing else. It was also not glorified porn. The viewer knows that this is cheap exploitation when the murders get more and more grand. By the end of the film you observe them taking out a whole swingers club! Then one of the woman puts a gun to a guys chocolate starfish and pulls the trigger! I almost hid under my seat when this happened! It also seems that this is an attempt by the film makers to offend people and thereby causing more people to see it. They  probably made the scene thinking, 'man heaps of people are going to come out and see it for this.' What troubles me is that if this was made by men there probably would have been a bigger outcry. But because it was made by women it probably went under the radar a little more. Is there a double standard out there? Also one of the main characters looks shockingly like Darlene from that old sitcom Roseanne. Is this what she is doing now? If it is then please somebody get her some decent work!     Finally I found this film to be puerile, juvenile and as dumb as a box of hair. The film is extremely annoying and like a little kid that swears for attention it should just be ignored. I give 2 out of 10.
