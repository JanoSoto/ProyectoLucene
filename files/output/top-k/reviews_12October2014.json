If you don't know what I am talking about, there is a good chance that after watching it you will say, Oh, it's THAT movie. That is, unless you are one of the many whose viewing pleasure has already been spoiled by popular culture. Watching this movie today would be akin to watching a documentary on the O.J. Simpson trial and wondering how it came out. I feel fortunate in that I was able to watch from an uninformed viewpoint. I vaguely recalled there was something significant about the movie (which was why I checked it out from my local library) but couldn't remember what it was. Then when it was over I said, Oh, it's THAT movie. With no expectations, the end was mildly shocking. Probably very much so in 1973, but less so 40 years later. I don't really think we are capable of being shocked any more.Unfortunately, it felt like someone thought up a great ending for a movie and then tried to put in enough filler to get there. Maybe that is why, with 10 minutes left, I actually said to myself How could this possibly wrap itself up in 10 minutes? Then it ended and I said, Oh, it's THAT movie. Granted, working backwards from an ending is not a bad recipe for success, and even authors will tell you not to start a book unless you know where you are going. But it was a somewhat disjointed journey. The movie paints an overall bleak picture of the future, illustrating its premise with a few insights on how we've digressed.

All of the vital philosophy and theory of Orwell's seminal work is lost in this adaptation. Orwell's deep understanding of both human nature and the operation of totalitarian states make the book a chilling read which makes a very convincing argument for why '1984' shows the natural conclusion of state power. All of this is absent from the film, as we have none of Winston's narration or Goldstein's book, and a very short version of O'Brien's monologue, which, I would say, are the most important aspects of the book. Both the narrative and character development are dreadful. Had I not read the book, I doubt I would've had any idea what was going on. The Two Minutes Hate, the Ministry of Truth, the memory hole, Newspeak, Doublethink and Thoughtcrime are explained either insufficiently or not at all, and without these concepts, the story is nothing. As for the characters, there is no explanation of Winston or Julia's thoughts toward the Party or their histories, and no real connection is established between the two.

It is saddening to think that some people may think of '1984' primarily as a film.

I read that it was about Jesus's humanly struggles, living life as a mortal man and fathering children. I am a Catholic and knew the whole thing was a croc and the book and movie were made for controversy and shock. And boy, was I shocked in some parts. Some were simply weird and most were blasphemy.

So there's no reason why anybody else should feel angry when two major Catholics made this movie possible. I tried to put my religion aside and focus on the movie aspect, that's what it's all about. In every aspect of a movie, this rides high, some higher than others. The biggest achievement was the acting. Acting is one of my biggest concerns and one that I usually judge most. The entire cast was sensational, but of course, Dafoe shines the most as a doubtful Jesus Christ. He really deserved an Oscar win for his powerhouse performance.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"12 October 2014","score":"","review":" While I was watching All That Jazz, I was reminded of a quote that Howard Hawks said. Hawks said that in order to make a good movie, you must have 3 good scenes and no bad scenes. Bob Fosse's All That Jazz has, what I believe, three good scenes and no bad scenes. However, the move itself has a depressing mood to it, which is similar or not with Fosse's other works like Cabaret and Sweet Charity. The movie centers around a deeply troubled dance choreographer, (Roy Scheider), who spends most of his life dedicated to his work in the theater. Yet, outside his life, his wife, (Ann Reinking), and his daughter are seeing himself fall into a world of self-destruction. Scheider is trying to create a Broadway show called Airotica, which will debuted in the beginning of February. Scheider's character is a drug addict and cigarette-smoking womanizer, who tries to do the best he can by putting on a show. But, as he begins to put the show together, his life starts to take a turn for the worse. Edited in between the movie are moments when Scheider speaks to an angelic woman, (Jessica Lange), about his troubles and his virtues.The movie is torn apart by its portrayal of a man that is not only falling under the spell of self-destruction, but also falling into a near-death experience. This creates the movie's depressing tone, yet it does make us feel bad that Scheider is hurting himself more and more as he feeds his life and heart into his production. Toward the end of the movie, without giving much more away, the main character finds exactly what he is looking for. Like most of Fosse's work, this movie centers around the dark side of show business. What Fosse shows us in this movie is his own vision of his life in the showbiz industry. We understand fully throughout the movie that for all of the razzle and dazzle specialty that this movie has to offer, there's a dark undercurrent lying underneath the movie. The three scenes that I think makes the movie worth watching are when Scheider shows his agents his idea of the show and he lets the female and male dance performers do the number, which is called Take Off with Us (Reprise). That scene is so energetic that as the scene went on with the dancers moving their bodies suggestively in the light and especially in the dark, I realize that Fosse's direction creates much of the scene's energetic mood. The movement of the hands. The way the female dancer move to the left and right of the room. The scene oozes with a sense of extreme sexuality that we get completely lost in a world that is showered by movement and energy. That is one of the three scenes that I like in the movie.The second scene that I like so much is when Scheider's lover and daughter dances in his apartment. The musical number in this scene is called Everything Old is New Again. I thought that of all of the scenes that were in the movie, this one was probably the best one in the movie. That scene is so well shot by Fosse and so well choreographed that it breaks through the depressing mood of the story. That's why the movie works for me. It has that ability to breaks through the depression and somehow feeds us a happy moment in the movie. Not only happy and jubilant, but also tragic.

The wife and daughter do a number together, called After You've Gone. The three scenes for me illustrates how much life and also feeling is being into this musical.

For a while, Scheider has been remembered as playing the police chief in Jaws or playing Gene Hackman's police partner in The French Connection. His performance make us want to care for him even though his response to the audience and to the supporting characters in the movie is ignored. This is a man who is walking on fire. He doesn't whether he makes it or not. I think what Bob Fosse shows us in this movie is that show business isn't about the stars and the razzle and dazzle.

","genre":null},{"date":"12 October 2014","score":"","review":" While I was watching All That Jazz, I was reminded of a quote that Howard Hawks said. Hawks said that in order to make a good movie, you must have 3 good scenes and no bad scenes. Bob Fosse's All That Jazz has, what I believe, three good scenes and no bad scenes. However, the move itself has a depressing mood to it, which is similar or not with Fosse's other works like Cabaret and Sweet Charity. The movie centers around a deeply troubled dance choreographer, (Roy Scheider), who spends most of his life dedicated to his work in the theater. Yet, outside his life, his wife, (Ann Reinking), and his daughter are seeing himself fall into a world of self-destruction. Scheider is trying to create a Broadway show called Airotica, which will debuted in the beginning of February. Scheider's character is a drug addict and cigarette-smoking womanizer, who tries to do the best he can by putting on a show. But, as he begins to put the show together, his life starts to take a turn for the worse. Edited in between the movie are moments when Scheider speaks to an angelic woman, (Jessica Lange), about his troubles and his virtues.The movie is torn apart by its portrayal of a man that is not only falling under the spell of self-destruction, but also falling into a near-death experience. This creates the movie's depressing tone, yet it does make us feel bad that Scheider is hurting himself more and more as he feeds his life and heart into his production. Toward the end of the movie, without giving much more away, the main character finds exactly what he is looking for. Like most of Fosse's work, this movie centers around the dark side of show business. What Fosse shows us in this movie is his own vision of his life in the showbiz industry. We understand fully throughout the movie that for all of the razzle and dazzle specialty that this movie has to offer, there's a dark undercurrent lying underneath the movie. The three scenes that I think makes the movie worth watching are when Scheider shows his agents his idea of the show and he lets the female and male dance performers do the number, which is called Take Off with Us (Reprise). That scene is so energetic that as the scene went on with the dancers moving their bodies suggestively in the light and especially in the dark, I realize that Fosse's direction creates much of the scene's energetic mood. The movement of the hands. The way the female dancer move to the left and right of the room. The scene oozes with a sense of extreme sexuality that we get completely lost in a world that is showered by movement and energy. That is one of the three scenes that I like in the movie.The second scene that I like so much is when Scheider's lover and daughter dances in his apartment. The musical number in this scene is called Everything Old is New Again. I thought that of all of the scenes that were in the movie, this one was probably the best one in the movie. That scene is so well shot by Fosse and so well choreographed that it breaks through the depressing mood of the story. That's why the movie works for me. It has that ability to breaks through the depression and somehow feeds us a happy moment in the movie. Not only happy and jubilant, but also tragic.

I love both the Bernie films. You really have to turn off your brain to enjoy them. They are really stupid and silly, but lots of fun. The film actually got a lot of quite loud laughs from me. Directed by Robert Klane, the movie leaves off from the events of the last movie. After returning from vacation with their recent deceased boss, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser); Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) find themselves blamed for Bernie's theft of two million dollars and fired. They investigate even more and discover that the money is somewhere in St Thomas in the Virgin Islands. Meanwhile, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a voodoo witch doctor Mobu (Novella Nelson) is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole as well. She sends two idiotic henchmen&#x96; Henry (Steve James) and Charles (Tom Wright) &#x96; to go to New York, get Bernie's body so they can use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, as an attempt to get Bernie to show them, where he hid the money. Unfortunately they mess up and Bernie can only move when he hears music, and they lost the body to Larry and Richard. Unbeknownst to Richard and Larry, a company security officer, Arthur Hummel (Barry Bostwick) who believe Larry and Richard knows where the money is, is also on their trail. Now it's a rat race to the hidden treasure, as the three groups try to outsmart each other, and claim the prize in the end. A lot of people thought, a sequel to an unlikely comedy would be impossible to make, without it, feeling old. Surprising, the producers actually pulled it off, and it is funnier that the original. Yes, the dark humor is tasteless and plot is ridiculous as hell, but still, it's funny as hell to watch. The slapstick humor is some of the best. I love the whole carriage scene. I was laughing my head, off. I love the cartoon opening to the film. It really establish, how cartoony the film will be. Too bad, it was kinda half-assed made. The animated studio that did it, didn't even bother to animate the crew's production titles. This creates for a really bad effect where the names are animated but the production titles are obviously added in. It's really off-putting. Like an old school cartoon, Bernie's body is never gory after all the violent acts that his body takes throughout the film. In many ways, you have to suspense your disbelief, to buy into the fact that Bernie doesn't rot away or fall apart in this film. After all, the film is full of dumb moments. It's funny, how much the movie tries to get away with logic. Good examples of theses, are how Bernie's body able to be flew to St. Thomas in the first place or how Bernie able to hear music through a normal Walkman in deep underwater. Others things like the whole voodoo curses are just weird. Why does a blood of a virgin stop a man from dying? How does a pigeon cause a dead man to dance? The movie makes little to no sense. Maybe, I'm looking too much into it, but the movie could be a metaphor for itself. The voodoo ritual represents the producers trying to bring the idea back to life. The movie theater where the ritual is performed represents the movie theater where the audience is sitting, because it's where the producers are trying to recapture the 'magic' of the first film. The people who fight over Bernie's corpse so they can find the hidden millions are representative of all the people trying to cash in on the success of the first movie. The beatings that Bernie receives are probably supposed to be reminiscent of 'beating a dead horse,' which has obvious significance. The acting in the film is mediocre at best. It's not the worst, but clearly, could had been better. The music score is pretty catchy. I love how the movie influence a dance movement. Inspired by the movement of the movie's namesake, a style of dance was created called Movin' Like Bernie. Homemade movies went viral on the internet, from children to soldiers serving overseas.

The first time, I had no complaints, the fifth time it got old.I'm not saying that I expected any less from a movie based on the video game adventures of a buxom heroine born one part Bruce Wayne, one part Indiana Jones and six parts John Woo but judging by the casting I expected more. It's not hard to make a video game icon into a real flesh and blood character because, after all, video game character never really come equipped with a personality in the first place so there is a lot of room to build a character. Not that she is totally lifeless, Jolie hints once or twice in the movie that Lara could have some real emotion but they are gunned down by the digital soundtrack. We know that the reason for the young teen male to attend is to gawk at the gift of Jolie's ample bosom. About that I would say that she handles it with a lot more decorum then Pamela Lee in 'Barb Wire'.What is so baffling about Tomb Raider, is that it stars Angelina Jolie, one of the best, most intuitive, most talented actresses that we have right now and she never seems willing to give Lara a soul. Watching a great actress play such an empty character is, for the serious film fan, like being peppered with fleas. But I'm overstepping, this isn't a movie for serious movie fans, it is eye candy for those who want their summer movie thrill ride. At that, I guess, the movie gets the job done.Director Simon West is able to accomplish something that I had previously thought impossible; He takes a jelly-bean sized plot and overcomplicates it until we in the audience simply give up asking questions and just admire the set design (or Jolie, depending on your gender status).Not to say that Lara is unoriginal but she is a bachelorette billionaire (Bruce Wayne) and a globe trotting archaeologist (Indiana Jones) and her father has died many years ago and she is alone (any Disney hero). She lives in one of those three mile estates complete with it's own Q-like robot programmer (Noah Taylor). Her father was also an archaeologist and has been gone for lo these many years (his headstone on the grounds reads 'Missing in the field &#x96; 1985'. Even though dear old dad is gone he neglected to fill Lara in on a secret society who has figured out how to control time and space. A clock buried in the wall of Lara's mansion begins ticking (she hears it from three floors up). The clock is counting down to the time of the planetary alignment so that when three pieces of an ancient artifact are brought together the Illuminati can control time but Lara ends up with one piece of it and she and her arch nemesis have to battle over it before the alignment passes and won't appear again for 5,000 years and blah blah blah bling bling bling blah! Did I mention that Lara hits a guy in the face with a motorcycle? It was cool.I guess maybe I'm looking for too much. My standard, obviously for a film like this is 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' which was so full of characters and so intelligent and so awe inspiring. Lara doesn't live up to the standards of her heroic forefathers but she does have some spunk and I'm hoping that the next installment (which I fully expect) Jolie will use more intuition.

What we find out leads us to have a new affinity for those able to survive in such a world (bevause grifting is all about survival) or at least a better understanding of the survival mind set. After watching The Grifters I have very little of either.

To make matters worse, Carrie has a target on her back from Chris Hangensen because Chris got in trouble for picking on Carrie. Sue Snell feels bad for Carrie, decides to make Carrie feel welcome by making her boyfriend, Tommy Ross take Carrie to the prom. Things start off well, but things go awry when Chris Hangensen decides to get revenge on Carrie. Big mistakeI've never understood the fuss over this movie! I don't like to use the word overrated, but Carrie falls into that category. I will admit that the storyline does evoke sympathy from the viewer. The emotional turmoil and abuse Carrie goes through is disheartening and riveting at times. Carrie is a girl we can all sympathize with and relate to as well. How many of us have been chastised and bullied for marching to the beat of your own drum...or being different? The judgment and teasing about this sort of thing still goes on today. Carrie automatically garners sympathy for this. Watching her be normal for a little while at the prom before chaos erupts is very rewarding and touching. My problem is that everything seemed so rushed! There was so much more they could have done with the storyline. More on Carrie's telekinesis would have been ideal. It's all subdued and somewhat vague until the infamous prom scene and the ending. The reason this movie gets the classic reputation, is because of the last 30 minutes or so. Yeah, it packs a wallop, but it wasn't anything that deserves all the praise it has gotten over the years. There are powerful scenes scattered here and there (The shower scene with Carrie freaking out about her period is very disturbing) but I don't think this movie deserves to be hailed as a classic. The acting is pretty good. Sissy Spacek is a revelation as Carrie. She is alternately creepy and sympathetic, exactly what I wanted. She really makes this movie better than it is. Piper Laurie gives an unbearably hammy performance as Carrie's Mother. She is WAY OTT! I have no idea why people love her performance. It's highly overrated if you ask me! Her constant babbling made me wanna smack her! Religious fanatics like her are a reason why I frown upon religion at times. Nancy Allen steals the show with her vindictive performance. She was the perfect antagonist for Carrie. William Katt is very charming as Tommy. His hair was pretty cool, too. Amy Irving is decent as the girl with a heart. I thought she was off and on. John Travolta is a hoot as Nancy Allen's boyfriend! Horror legend, P.J Soles does well as Nancy Allen's accomplice. Stephen King adaptations are often a mixed bag.

Why you ask? Well, let's just say it burns them up a bit. 1997's The Night Flier is one of those films whose story of a vampire pilot flying from one tiny airport to another using a private plane might sound a bit silly at first but once you start watching it, you simply can't stop. A mysterious pilot flying a black Cessna Skymaster and using the name Dwight Renfield is stalking rural airports, leaving behind mutilated corpses, with no one having the faintest idea where he comes from. It's a story that egotistical, tabloid reporter Richard Dees (Miguel Ferrer) is put on to investigate. Dees doesn't initially think there's much to the story at first, but after a while, the usually uncaring and cynical reporter starts to wonder if there's more to the story than meets the eye with Renfield. Made for HBO, The Night Flier works for several reasons, First and foremost is the good job here of expanding upon the short story by horror maestro Stephen King. Mark Paiva's smart direction, combined with composer Brian Keane's soft-piano but creepy score, serve the story well by keeping the viewer enthralled scene by scene. Another plus is lead actor Miguel Ferrer's performance of Richard Dees. Richard Dees is not at all a likable person; he doesn't seem to care about anyone at all and his only concern is the story, the story, and the story. It's only at the end that Dees discovers what it's like to be at the other end, in a very spooky kind of way. Yet at the same time, Ferrer has that ability to keep us fascinated by the character's journey, no matter how low he goes. It's a real testament to Ferrer's ability and only makes me wonder why he isn't in more leading roles. Supporting him is Julie Entwisle as newbie reporter Katherine Blair, Dan Monahan as Dees' slimy boss Morrison, and Michael H. Moss as creature of the night Renfield. And what good would a vampire movie be if we didn't have an awesome creature to go with it. Michael H. Moss plays Renfield as vampires are supposed to be played, as vile, evil beasts that are from your worse nightmares. Helping in that regard is the makeup department, who manage to create one of the coolest and scariest looking blood-suckers ever. The Night Flier is dark tale done well with everything you'd expect in a Stephen King story. I don't know what the King thought of this film (Mr. King is somewhat notorious for not liking a number of film adaptations of his work and truth be told, some of them are pretty bad). But as for me it has to rank as one of the better Stephen King adaptations made and also makes me want to read the story it was based off of. So with all that said, if you're in the mood for a little darkness and a little spookiness, check out Stephen King's The Night Flier. P.S. It's on you tube.

Richard Dees is not at all a likable person; he doesn't seem to care about anyone at all and his only concern is the story, the story, and the story. It's only at the end that Dees discovers what it's like to be at the other end, in a very spooky kind of way. Yet at the same time, Ferrer has that ability to keep us fascinated by the character's journey, no matter how low he goes. It's a real testament to Ferrer's ability and only makes me wonder why he isn't in more leading roles. Supporting him is Julie Entwisle as newbie reporter Katherine Blair, Dan Monahan as Dees' slimy boss Morrison, and Michael H. Moss as creature of the night Renfield. And what good would a vampire movie be if we didn't have an awesome creature to go with it. Michael H. Moss plays Renfield as vampires are supposed to be played, as vile, evil beasts that are from your worse nightmares. Helping in that regard is the makeup department, who manage to create one of the coolest and scariest looking blood-suckers ever. The Night Flier is dark tale done well with everything you'd expect in a Stephen King story. I don't know what the King thought of this film (Mr. King is somewhat notorious for not liking a number of film adaptations of his work and truth be told, some of them are pretty bad). But as for me it has to rank as one of the better Stephen King adaptations made and also makes me want to read the story it was based off of. So with all that said, if you're in the mood for a little darkness and a little spookiness, check out Stephen King's The Night Flier. P.S. It's on you tube.

Why you ask? Well, let's just say it burns them up a bit. 1997's The Night Flier is one of those films whose story of a vampire pilot flying from one tiny airport to another using a private plane might sound a bit silly at first but once you start watching it, you simply can't stop. A mysterious pilot flying a black Cessna Skymaster and using the name Dwight Renfield is stalking rural airports, leaving behind mutilated corpses, with no one having the faintest idea where he comes from. It's a story that egotistical, tabloid reporter Richard Dees (Miguel Ferrer) is put on to investigate. Dees doesn't initially think there's much to the story at first, but after a while, the usually uncaring and cynical reporter starts to wonder if there's more to the story than meets the eye with Renfield. Made for HBO, The Night Flier works for several reasons, First and foremost is the good job here of expanding upon the short story by horror maestro Stephen King. Mark Paiva's smart direction, combined with composer Brian Keane's soft-piano but creepy score, serve the story well by keeping the viewer enthralled scene by scene.

While many stories by Disney are know to be inappropriate in their original form, Hunchback is the one film that's still too mature after adaptation. This isn't really a kid's film. There's not enough action, not enough comedy, not enough fun. The themes the movie presents will just fly over their heads. Hunchback hurts itself by including comedic relief characters, especially the gargoyles.However, I think that Hunchback can get away with that because it's the greatest movie ever made.I love this movie. Its perfect in so many ways, I can tolerate the occasional sight gag or odd music number. Its beautiful, its emotional, it transcends what you'd expect from a Disney film. It explores the themes of religion, discrimination, and love without resorting to the tropes found in other movies, both cartoon and adult.The main cast has great characters, who show off the full range of emotions. The villain is especially good - Frollo is despicable...but self-righteous and conflicted. He rings much truer to real life than any other Disney villain. And it makes him so much more compelling...and frightening. But let's not forget about the shy, kind Quasimodo, the heroic Phoebus, and the feisty Esmeralda. They're all good, with perfect voice acting. And we see them in both calm and dramatic moments.And the music! God, how isn't this recognized as the best soundtrack of all time!? The songs range from whimsical, somber, uplifting, even epic. The chorus dominate the mood, and make Hunchback feel gigantic. The music isn't just their to sing-along with your kids. It helps tell the story, and delves into the bottom of the character's hearts. Its the exact stuff to add goosebumps to my skin. The animation is top quality, especially on the cathedral.I could write an in-depth analysis on Hunchback. And I hate such film school seriousness! Its the best movie I've seen, and will be almost impossible to top. I know comedic relief can be distracting, but its less than 10 minutes of mild slapstick vs 80 minutes of masterpiece. I recommend this highly to everyone that asks.

Adapted from the novel by the late, great Richard Matheson, the story centers around everyday man Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon), his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and their young son, Jake (Zachary David Cope). They seem to have the perfect life in their Chicago suburban home until one night at a neighborhood block party Tom, ever the supernatural\/otherworldly skeptic, agrees to be hypnotized by his mystic-minded sister-in-law. He doesn't remember much about what happens during the hypnosis, but what follows next is anything but child's play as strange images involving a ghostly, teenage girl and past events of the house they live in start appearing in his mind. It turns out Tom has become a receiver, someone whose mind is open to visions of the future and communication with the dead, and that's not all. Tom's son, Jake, already has this sixth sense, if you will, and he too has visions of the girl he calls Samantha. It doesn't take long for Tom to discover that Samantha was a real person who disappeared from the neighborhood but no one in the community knows why or seems to care. From there, it's a race for the truth as Tom tries to uncover what really happened to the young girl who haunts his mind before it tears him apart.I had heard of Stir of Echoes through this site long before I saw it. It was not until recently I finally got my chance to see it and needless to say, I was not disappointed. The story is beautifully crafted right from the beginning, where we first meet Jake taking a bath and seemly talking to his father in the next room. It's only after his father leaves the room and he's drying off that we find out (I won't reveal exactly how we know as to not spoil it) he's talking to someone else. The scene gives me chills just thinking of it and there are plenty more to come. Writer and director David Koepp should be congratulated for being to combine scenes that scare and disturb with a good, strong story. As for as characters, each of the actors give solid performances, be it Kevin Bacon as skeptic turned (almost dangerously) obsessed believer, Kathryn Erbe as Tom's devoted wife, Illeana Douglas as the sister-in-law, Kevin Dunn as Tom's friend and neighbor Frank, or Zachary David Cope as young Jake Witzky. Mr. Cope's performance has to be one of the most brilliant I've ever seen from a child actor or in general due to his ability to be sweet but also a bit other worldly due to his ability to see things we can't. Plus there's a whole lot of amazing supporting actors and actresses, such as Jennifer Morrison as young Samantha, that should be congratulated for their work. I'm not sure what Mr. Matheson thought of this film but as for me, I can't praise it enough. Stir of Echoes is a film that works, not only for the reasons above but in addition, it will make you wonder how well do you really know your neighborhood or the house you live in? And on that note, don't let this gem of a film pass you by. Watch and be prepared for some unsettling truths.

On one sound stage they could film 'Urban Legend'.On the other they could film this movie A group of kids go to college and have the normal problems that most young people have like deciding on a major, cramming for exams, dealing with pressure to get work in on time and trying to please their demanding professors. We could also get to meet them as individuals and see how they react to one another with personality clashes, romantic entanglements, sexual pressures etc. We could get to know them and follow them through one year of college . . . Oh wait, that doesn't sell does it?

In fact, that's perhaps one of the things that did not seem dated, in terms of narrative at least (again, gradually stretching over the movie's substantial runtime). I confess to getting restive with the flashback cuts in the beginning, which, in hindsight, was essential, and perhaps the perfect way to introduce everything. The choice made about how the filmed ending differed from the book its based on, to me, smacked of being one of those choices a mainstream filmmaker typically makes, a feel-good cop-out. I'm sure the movie would have withstood the passage of time better if they had stuck to the tone of the book, but for those who're unfamiliar with the written work, this should work just fine.Kim Basinger plays the moll as she knows how, and though her character's trajectory is unsurprising on the whole, casting did matter, and perhaps the overall effect is better for that. Robert Duvall, almost always great in his everyman-playing career, in this flick, has to have played the most despicable character (not surprising, since it hits close to the scruples held by a true-to- life media-person) in his career ever as Max Mercy (observe his drawings in a key sequence, and his own rationale of his place of power in the baseball-playing world, completely undeterred when another key character wants to tear down what he does - he Never Backs Down, in spite of us hating him, not 1 inch), along with an uncredited Darren McGavin (Mike Hammer from late-50s TV - mroe on him in a bit). I've never been a fan of Glenn Close, but respect her talent, and in this one, she does what she needs to, although her portion lends itself to some muted melodrama that gains some traction as her portion increases its relevance to the overall plot. The best part is the one performed by the uncredited Mike Hammer himself, McGavin. A veteran of TV and the silver screen, the entire movie is elevated due to what he brings to the filmed work, and the 1 scene in which he and Redford's character trade-off one-upmanships is a treat to behold (and the other scenes in which they play off one another). One of the more menacing antagonists, always lurking in the shadows, and more powerful in the dark.Wilford Brimley due his thing, and it's always a nice thing to watch him in play. The raggedy old bear who we slowly grow to like, with his tough exterior also softening over the course of the movie's running-time is perhaps one of the oldest clichés in the book, but not such a bad thing with a master like Brimley bringing him to life.Redford doesn't have to stretch much like a few of the other roles he'd tackled in his past, but he puts in his efforts, and they do bear fruit - doesn't get a note wrong. All in all, in spite of most of the material being dated, and the cop-out of an ending, this one's still a better-than-good watch - we'd do even better to watch it with like-minded aficionados on the big screen, given the opportunity.

There Frank's mild-mannered single dad Ed Harris falls for V, not realizing her background.I am really hard-pressed to figure out who the audience for this film is. It is entirely too smutty for a family film and no where near smutty enough for the adults that may find this theme appealing. Director (and former actor) Richard Benjamin continues to be a director of limited merit. It is absurd that in this day and age kids like Frank and his friends could not see bare boobs by sneaking into a movie theater or looking in art books or Playboy, but would resort to traveling to the Big City and being slapped by offended women who they approach in their naive and guileless way with their sordid offer. And am I the only one tired of the Big City being depicted as a morass of immorality while the Small Town gets idealized into some romantic bubble of innocence? How innocent can it be with kids like Frank running loose (not to mention the one kid's dad who knows V from past experience)? Harris is adequate as Frank's clueless dad, but how disheartening that in a few years time Melanie Griffith went from her Oscar-nominated peak in Working Girl to this dismal development. Griffith looks tired and blowsy as V. She is also reduced to playing one nonsense scene (which truly makes no sense at all) wherein she shows up at Frank's school in a tight outfit so he can give an anatomy demonstration in class. The scene comes out of no where narratively, is not funny at all, and since the film has no nudity it serves no titillation purposes. One is just incredibly embarrassed for all involved.Naturally, all of this ends with a madcap, badly done car chase with the kids frantically driving V to safety from associated villains, because what cheesy film does not have a car chase for no good reason.
