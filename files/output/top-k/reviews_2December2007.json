What were they thinking?!!!!!)? As you know, Disney's Dinosaur is a forgotten, ill-fated, but awesome animated masterpiece. Well, For all the bitching and moaning that has been raging over the plot, characters, and scientific inaccuracies of the film, you folks find Dinosaur lacking in the soul and spirit of the earlier 1988 screenplay and you thought it was way too Disney. You even thought it is the Plan 9 From Outer Space of Dinosaur movies. They all make mistakes, but Dinosaur was a honest one.A Critical And Commercial Disaster, Dinosaur is a movie that all of you who went to see Jurassic Park in the theaters and Watch Walking with Dinosaurs on TV would like to forget.You consider Disney's Dinosaur as the worst Disney 3D cartoon of all time. And it even put you, the fans and critics off even more than Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace. Well, there are a lot of you out there who are purist about Dinosaur (2000). There are praises for the CGI and Live Action Backgrounds, but the main blasts came from all of you who are opposed to the plot, the characters, the inaccuracies and such.This was Disney's great dream of making a dinosaur movie, but when it was released on May 19, 2000, and died a dog's death, the trust you put to this company is now broken. Dinosaur's critical and commercial failure led to the bankruptcy of the Secret Lab. In your eyes, Dinosaur is not a great blend of CGI and Live Action Backgrounds--It was a failure to you, plain and simple. And that film is not a mistake that Disney or the others will eager to repeat!!! None of you wanted it. But the CGI, the Live Action Backgrounds kick ass! But...I Have a question. What Shall Disney do to improve and make over Dinosaur and to answer all of you who hated this, Disney's Dinosaur? Well anybody answer my question, please.

Being from Scotland, we don't celebrate Thanksgiving, although I think we should - America looks like so much fun. And it's a great start to Christmas.I've previously done a review for this. Looking back on it, it had to be deleted. Straight away. It was five lines long, so hopefully this one will be better.I have to admit, this movie is better on a second watching. I can't remember really enjoying it the first time round as I did this time. I found myself giggling a lot more, but also, maybe I was feeling really emotional that night watching this, but I also ended up crying at a couple of points. It's actually, beneath all the funny moments, a really sad movie. The scene in the motel bedroom where Steve Martin's character points out all John Candy's bad points is utterly convincing, and that's the point I did start crying. John acted it really well, with his bottom lip quivering. But his comeback just makes it all the worse You wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah, you're right, I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. Well, you think what you want about me; I'm not changing. I like... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get. The other scene I started crying at, was when Del couldn't get a room at the motel, cos he only had $2, and a Casio watch, and he had to sit in the burnt out car. Talking to his wife who wasn't there. Yes I did cry again. It's such a sad movie.But it's also hilarious. It's definitely one of Steve Martin's best movies, and he agrees it's his favourite movie of his own. He comes out with some absolute classic lines in this, but I'm not going to repeat them all here. If you've seen the movie, you know what they are. Roll on Christmas is all I can say after watching this movie, and now I want to start wrapping presents. Just hope I've still got someone to wrap presents for. Hehe. I love this movie. John Candy is brilliant, and him and Steve are like a modern Laurel & Hardy. He died too soon didn't he?

We left the back entrance of the movie theater wondering what the heck just happened and if we should brag to our school chums about what we just viewed. Needless to say, we did and we got ridiculed. But I loved this movie anyway. A bit graphic and weird, but a great movie nonetheless.This was another great cheesy, sleazy 80's slasher film that would forever strike me as one of the best horror movies with a great twist ending. Essentially this movie is about a girl who falls for a boy while she is at camp, then thing begin to go horribly wrong and people begin to die. Oddly enough, the romantic rivals of this girl are the ones being offed. The end when she is stroking the head of her lover and she is holding his head aloft just gets you. You aren't not expecting at any stretch of the imagination, and its just completely out there that it's haunting. As one critic once put it Before Crying Game brought it to art houses, Sleepaway Camp brought it to Grindhouses, and boy was he ever true. It vaguely hints towards it near the beginning but even still it's a great twist. I also want to mention that the face that Angela makes at the end has left an imprint in my head forever.As far as the technical details are concerned, the acting is pretty good, the screams were ear piercing and the scares were pretty good but it had the feel of Friday the 13th, but because of the ending, it was masterfully turned around into a great American cult classic with an unforgettable twist ending. This movie hit me hard and introduced me to a special kind of B-movie that I never knew existed and it ranked up there with The Rats, Scream, The Usual Suspects and Planet of the Apes. The flashbacks, especially near the end had a feel of a Broadway play or musical with a disturbing 1950's feel to it and the mother of Angela is so horribly creepy with her sweet talkative voice and her nicely dressed body. I think that some of the acting was a bit over the top (i.e. when the kids put shaving cream on some other kid and he poorly attempts to kill them with a knife). So thank you Sleepaway Camp for not letting me forget that classic ending. I Think it's one of those movies were you have to watch and be amazed at how cheesy this movie is but it all leads up to a fantastic ending. I think that it's just a great B-movie with some campy, no pun intended, humor and great yucks and chucks.

But her lover is actually aging and dying fast, since they don't have the same life-line as her. Now Miriam is looking for a new lover, which she becomes interested to a attractive woman named Dr. Sarah Roberts (Oscar-WinnerSusan Sarandon).

After Miriam and Sarah make passionate love together after one night. Miriam has giving Sarah her to dark gift to live for many years. But Sarah isn't prepared for it and it seems there's no way back to her former self.Directed by Tony Scott (Beverly Hills Cop 2, Enemy of the State, Revenge) made an fascinating horror drama that has its share of some erotic moments and strong visual sense to his strong premise. Which the film is based on a novel by Whitley Strieber (Communion, Wolfen). This is actually Scott's first theatrical film and he does an fine job with this intriguing if flawed movie. This has excellent Widescreen cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt (Batman Forever, Closer, Rent). It also has genuinely well done make-up effects work by Oscar-WinnerDick Smith (Altered States, The Exorcist, Ghost Story) and Carl Fullerton (Friday the 13th Part 2 & 3, My Demon Lover, The Silence of the Lambs). Bowie is a standout in his strong supporting performance and he's steals the show, when he is on-screen. Deneuve and Sarandon gives good performances as well. After reading some reviews, it seems the most remember sequence was the tasteful love scene between Deneuve and Sarandon. Which it is tastefully done and quite erotic. But the main problem of the picture, it never really catches fire. There's many fine scenes but the movie lacks heart. Some viewers will be extremely confused by the storytelling, especially towards the end. It is one of those films that you have to watch and pay attention to the story. It is not as great as i would expect. But overall, it is a good picture. It is certainly fascinating if not the best films of Scott's great movies. Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit parts and in cameos. Followed by a TV Series that is loosely based on the film. Worth a look. Panavision. (*** ½\/*****).

I will not tell you too much about the story as it might spoil the movie...but just watch it.Highly recommended noir\/crime. -) ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"2 December 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Much like 'Following', Bound is a brilliant debut film of a soon-to-be-world-famous writer\/director. Although there are actually two of them Andy and Larry Wachowski. For those of you who are not familiar with them they're the geniuses behind The Matrix Trilogy.Bound is a very dark crime film, with a stellar Pantaliano (whom you might remember from 'Memento).

And, I must say, I was very surprised! I think this is an excellent film! The further the film goes, the more serious it gets. In the beginning, it's not that memorable, but the film gets better! The acting is very good by Shane West and Mandy Moore, Mandy Moore who also sang the songs in the movie. This film will really touch you, I can guarantee that! A Walk To Remember is an excellent film by Adam Shankman. Everyone should check this movie out! It's amazing! Don't be mistaken, this is not a romantic comedy, it's a romantic drama.
