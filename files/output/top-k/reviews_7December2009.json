[{"date":"7 December 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Requiem For A Dream is not for the faint-hearted. It's brutal, stark, stomach-churning and unglamorous. It depicts different forms of addiction, leading to the characters' imprisonment in a dream world of delusion and reckless desperation that is subsequently overtaken and devastated by reality.The film is a bleak drama about four wasted lives, shot in a manner that mirrors their alienation and despair. Craftsmanlike, and a laudable attempt to extend the grammar of film, but one feels cornered by its pervasive hopelessness. Still, the wonderful performances and the bleak imagery are hard to forget. The soundtrack has been widely praised and has subsequently been used in various forms in trailers for other films and series.
