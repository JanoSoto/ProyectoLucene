[{"date":"22 May 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  'Dinosaur' is a good and very entertaining movie. It has a nice story although it is very predictable. The movie didn't feel completely like a Disney movie, which it is, and I still haven't figured out why that is. I think it just looked too real. Especially the scenery is so perfect and beautiful it felt more like a real movie. The dinosaurs look more animated but they still look very much like real dinosaurs. In 'The Lion King' the animals were beautifully drawn, but it was not computer animation so it felt right. 'A Bug's Life' has beautiful computer animations but the insects didn't look like the real (creepy) insects. Of course it was close enough to see what insect we were talking about, but you know what I mean. It says much about the animations in this movie and I would say that is the main reason you should see this one.
