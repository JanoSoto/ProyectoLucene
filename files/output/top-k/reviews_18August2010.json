This is simply stuff that the kids will enjoy watching. It tells the entire story from the viewpoint of a 12 year old boy, which means that the entire perception of the world and the people that are living in it are also costumed to that of a 12 year old. And I like that in all honesty. It's what makes this a good kids movie, which makes me wish more movies would had picked this approach. Hollywood these days seems to have no idea what kids like and how they should market and make movies for them. Just go back to some '80's movies and take notes.But having said all that, this movie is definitely not a great one. It had really a potentially great and adventurous concept but the movie did far too little with all of it. There is just not a whole lot happening in this movie movie. Story- and character-wise it's a quite poorly developed one. There is no villain, there is no real danger or conflict and the good original ideas that this movie had did not get developed or wrapped up properly. If the entire movie had been more like its first half the movie and its story could had really gone somewhere good and interesting. It could had been an E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial kind of movie, which this movie also seemed to have been really 'inspired' by in the first place. But instead of developing some more depth and interesting real emotions, the movie decides that it would be fun to set the movie aboard a spaceship, that's flying around the world, without ever letting anything exciting or tense happen.The story just doesn't make much sense. Not that that seems to matter much for a kids movie but it of course does. Children are not stupid and they just don't take anything for granted, which is something this movie doesn't really always seem to take in consideration with its story. They didn't put enough effort in it, which makes the movie a mostly bland one.Nevertheless the movie remains a fun, light one, especially for kids, since of its approach, that tells the story from the viewpoint and perspective of an 12 year old. Therefore I can say that the movie serves its purpose and for the right audience it's simply being a good one.It's also a real decent looking one. It's a Disney movie, who always knows how to spend some real money on these type of movies. The fact that this movie had the money and the backing of a big studio behind them means that this movie can do more than the usual average one, within this genre. They did not only got some big name actors to star in this movie but they also spend some money on its good looking effects. When you take into consideration that this is an 1986 movie. you have to conclude that the special effects in this movie were being quite good for its time. So nothing wrong with its cast or crew basically.It's good and entertaining enough throughout, especially for kids but yet it seemed to had some far more potential, which got wasted by a below par and not adventurous or fun enough script.6\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"18 August 2010","score":"","review":" As a kids movie, this one is definitely one of the better ones out there.

The film starts out with Donnie Brasco (Depp) at a jeweler and how he is looking at a made man in the mafia, Lefty (Pacino), and Lefty takes him under his wing after one meeting and no background info on Brasco. Brasco then becomes Lefty's right hand man and the two of the work under Sonny Black (Madsen) and do all the usual mafia things. The main struggle of the film is how Brasco has to keep in his undercover while having a family at home and he grows very attached to Lefty as well. This film is a Mafia film with a stronger police part than in other Mafia films such as The Godfather or Goodfellas which is what makes it unique.The Directing in this film was poor for two main reasons. Reason #1 is that as a viewer I felt no attachment to any of the characters. I never cared that Donnie Brasco's normal life was falling apart due to his career, I never cared that his life was in danger due to his career, I never really cared about his career. Nor did I care about how Lefty wasn't being taken seriously anymore and was passed up for promotion. Reason #2 why I thought the direction was poor is because these men are in the Mafia they are powerful men and the direction did nothing to show that it just made them look like a normal person which in my opinion was a mistake. If this movie was better directed it could of easily been considered a great film.The acting in this film was decent, the best performance being by Depp. This is his biggest early role in his career that he did not work with Tim Burton and he proved here he can act well without being such an odd character which I truly enjoyed. But again as I said in the previous paragraph I felt no connection to him which is not entirely his fault but still. Pacino I thought was not very good in this film he always seemed on the same emotional level and just was sad, really I thought nothing special. Madsen I thought was very good in this film as Sonny Black. He did great portraying himself as a tough, impulsive Mafia boss and every time he was on the screen was extremely enjoyable. Now was he as good as he was in Reservoir Dogs, no. But still he is an actor that I wish I could see more of.The score of this film I thought was inappropriate. It sounded like music that would be used in a drama, not a Mafia film and this often distracted me and annoyed me. I really thought this was a mistake.My overall reaction to this film is that it is not very good, a strong 5\/10 I would say. It had potential to be much better in my opinion. I'm not going to tell you to stay away from this film because it is pretty well reviewed I would recommend this film to those who enjoy Mafia films, just go in knowing that this is no Goodfellas or The Godfather.

This 1939 animated film mayn't be the best, definitive or the most faithful version, but can I be honest, it's actually my personal favourite. I don't know why, maybe because of nostalgia, this was a favourite of mine when I was a kid and I still love it. It is so warm, entertaining and beautiful, and might I say I consider it timeless too? The animation is actually really lovely, not tedious, undistinguished or dated as it has been criticised as. Instead it is beautiful and colourful. The colours are lavish, the backgrounds are mellow and the character designs are typical Fleischer, while the use of the Roto-Scope is incredibly effective.I also love the story. As I have said it is not the most faithful to the original story, but it is still a great and sweet one. It is one that tells of love, hope, friendship, adventure and even humour, all those qualities that makes an animated film so great. In some ways the first half-hour is better than the rest of the film, however the film is full of charming moments such as when Gabby pleads not to be eaten, when Gulliver brings David and Glory together, there's a giant on the beach, the interaction between the spies and of course my favourite the really touching ending. There is a bit of Romeo and Juliet too, with the idea of the feuding kingdoms and I think it works.The script is really nice too, I admit I've heard better dialogue but there are much worse as well. Anything Gabby says cracks me up and Gulliver says some interesting things too. In fact, there is a perfect balance of humorous lines and touching sentiment. And I love the characters as well.Gulliver apparently was made to look like a real person, a bold and ambitious move and one that pays off, is it me or isn't he handsome and I love his rich baritone voice, reminds me of Emile from South Pacific. The King of Lilliput is also a nice character, bumbling and humorous, same with Bombo who appears to be rather mean but there is a small part towards the beginning that suggests otherwise. David is someone we don't see much but he is very handsome with a kind presence with a voice that takes you to another world. My favourites though are Princess Glory and Gabby. Princess Glory is absolutely beautiful, and while she has a quivering vibrato(like Snow White does) she has a very limpid and pleasant voice. And what do I need to say about Gabby? There may be times in his cartoons where Gabby comes across as selfish, mean and unapologetic, but we see a different Gabby here. A somewhat funnier Gabby, and in some ways you feel sorry for him too.The voice acting is also top notch for the time. Pinto Colvig, the wonderful voice actor he was, is great as Gabby, and Jack Mercer has fun as the King. Jessica Dragonette and Lanny Ross provide the voices of Glory and David beautifully, while Sam Parker is interesting as Gulliver. The pacing is brisk too, so the film never feels tedious or draggy, and while Gulliver's Travels is short it is very fulfilling.But do you know what my favourite part was? It was the music. It's all an acquired taste of course, but I absolutely love this sort of music, the mellow and rich sounds that are almost reminiscent of Rodgers and Hammerstein. All's Well has had me humming the tune for days on end, It's a Hap Hap Happy Day is quirky and upbeat and We're All Together Now is wonderfully uplifting and memorable. Come Home Again is hauntingly beautiful, while Forever and Faithful are sweet and romantic.In conclusion, beautiful, timeless and I think underrated film. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"18 August 2010","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I haven't read Jonathan Swift's story for a long time, but I remember loving it very much.

It's all an acquired taste of course, but I absolutely love this sort of music, the mellow and rich sounds that are almost reminiscent of Rodgers and Hammerstein. All's Well has had me humming the tune for days on end, It's a Hap Hap Happy Day is quirky and upbeat and We're All Together Now is wonderfully uplifting and memorable. Come Home Again is hauntingly beautiful, while Forever and Faithful are sweet and romantic.In conclusion, beautiful, timeless and I think underrated film. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"18 August 2010","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I haven't read Jonathan Swift's story for a long time, but I remember loving it very much. This 1939 animated film mayn't be the best, definitive or the most faithful version, but can I be honest, it's actually my personal favourite. I don't know why, maybe because of nostalgia, this was a favourite of mine when I was a kid and I still love it. It is so warm, entertaining and beautiful, and might I say I consider it timeless too? The animation is actually really lovely, not tedious, undistinguished or dated as it has been criticised as. Instead it is beautiful and colourful. The colours are lavish, the backgrounds are mellow and the character designs are typical Fleischer, while the use of the Roto-Scope is incredibly effective.I also love the story. As I have said it is not the most faithful to the original story, but it is still a great and sweet one. It is one that tells of love, hope, friendship, adventure and even humour, all those qualities that makes an animated film so great. In some ways the first half-hour is better than the rest of the film, however the film is full of charming moments such as when Gabby pleads not to be eaten, when Gulliver brings David and Glory together, there's a giant on the beach, the interaction between the spies and of course my favourite the really touching ending. There is a bit of Romeo and Juliet too, with the idea of the feuding kingdoms and I think it works.The script is really nice too, I admit I've heard better dialogue but there are much worse as well. Anything Gabby says cracks me up and Gulliver says some interesting things too. In fact, there is a perfect balance of humorous lines and touching sentiment. And I love the characters as well.Gulliver apparently was made to look like a real person, a bold and ambitious move and one that pays off, is it me or isn't he handsome and I love his rich baritone voice, reminds me of Emile from South Pacific. The King of Lilliput is also a nice character, bumbling and humorous, same with Bombo who appears to be rather mean but there is a small part towards the beginning that suggests otherwise. David is someone we don't see much but he is very handsome with a kind presence with a voice that takes you to another world. My favourites though are Princess Glory and Gabby. Princess Glory is absolutely beautiful, and while she has a quivering vibrato(like Snow White does) she has a very limpid and pleasant voice. And what do I need to say about Gabby? There may be times in his cartoons where Gabby comes across as selfish, mean and unapologetic, but we see a different Gabby here. A somewhat funnier Gabby, and in some ways you feel sorry for him too.The voice acting is also top notch for the time. Pinto Colvig, the wonderful voice actor he was, is great as Gabby, and Jack Mercer has fun as the King. Jessica Dragonette and Lanny Ross provide the voices of Glory and David beautifully, while Sam Parker is interesting as Gulliver. The pacing is brisk too, so the film never feels tedious or draggy, and while Gulliver's Travels is short it is very fulfilling.But do you know what my favourite part was? It was the music.

Small parts like the ending scene and the beach scene flickered through my head when i began watching it. My first thought was that if i didn't remember it all, it couldn't have been very good at all. I was so wrong.The real gem in this movie is the multiple, only slightly related story lines. With many other disaster movies, i find myself looking forward to the doomsday event, or the huge E.L.E. In this i found myself actually worried for the characters. Its so easy to relate to them. If you try and put yourself in the situation, i found it difficult to think what i could do differently. The message behind the disaster is love for family, friends and for the people even closer than them and multiple touching scenes that almost bring a tear to the eye really make you care for what happens. By far the most emotional moment comes from Jenny Lerner and her father, but i'm not giving anything away.Currently on IMDb this film has a 6.0\/10 rating which, as the review title suggests, i think is ridiculous. This film has it all and simply put, deserves a hell of a lot better than its getting on here. Its an unmissable movie.

If I could write a novel with a smidgen of one hundredth of the source material, Wonder Boys by Michael Chabon, I'd have died and gone to literary Heaven.This movie is literally perfect and is directed by Curtis Hanson, director of another one of my all time favorite movies L.A. Confidential. I love stories that take place in 24 (or less) hours, but willing to accept movies that span a life-altering weekend, in which this is.This movie is about growing, realizing, waking up, making choices&#x85;but mostly about characters.I side mostly with Prof. Grady Tripp, played elegantly by Michael Douglas. NO ONE could have done better. He's the college professor who everyone wants, who I would want. Not perfect by any means He smokes more pot than he eats munchies, he had a one-hit wonder (hence the title of the movie, a true wonder boy) but has hit a brick wall since and he's attempting just to make it through life without making a choice to make him think. Though it appears on the surface he doesn't care, he does have a dash of humanity left. There's something in him, some spark that's still alive, but barely.I see a lot of myself in him &#x96; even though I don't partake in the pot smoking. We both carry the empty shell of the person we were once. Only, this is fiction and in his life-changing weekend, as portrayed in the film, he grows and the spark gets brighter. If only we could imitate fiction.Then there's Terry Crabtree, the sometimes gay played beautifully by Robert Downey Jr. This is LONG before his career began, again that is. I admired him so much in this his quick wit, his never-ending believability in his acting and that all shot Downey Jr. straight to the top ten of my Best Actors list. In addition, I began noticing another up'n'comer little closer Tobey Maguire. Though he was really good in his James Leer role, he seemed like he wasn't quite there yet. Read the book and you'll experience the depth this character really had. In Wonder Boys, Maguire did add humor, humility and originality, but he eventually would show all of those qualities greater in later projects.The remaining crew were good but were always in the shadows of the above mentioned characters.

Prior to this his wife has left him, for good, supposedly. His mistress is both pregnant and married to his boss and she disavows not only his pot smoking lifestyle but his aimless ambition. He tries to make the right decisions, but fails, then just acts like someone half his age to make up and continue what his younger self would've done. Have a fun adventure.His mission is to save James Leer from self destruction. It's painfully obvious; he's really in it to save himself, but nevertheless leaves a good enough impression on the boy (Leer) to do some good in the world while balancing his love (Sara,) the nagging of his failing publisher, keeping his job and his roommate at bay. Heck, I didn't even mention the dog or car. There really is a lot packed in to this movie and in reality, if he were to step back, this would not have been the weekend to change. But&#x85;there we go.All this depth, all this wonderful filmmaking with heart and yet, it still manages to fit in a fantastic soundtrack which includes one of my all-time favorite songs, let alone one of my all-time favorite movie-songs Things Have Changed by Bob Dylan.

NO ONE could have done better. He's the college professor who everyone wants, who I would want.

As much as I love Dr.No and From Russia with Love, I think Goldfinger is a serious contender for the best Bond film ever.For me Goldfinger is the slickest of the Bond films in terms of how the stunts are performed and how the story is told. The story mayn't be the most exciting of all the Bonds, but it is still very gripping. The direction is sly, the cinematography is stylish, the locations are stunning and I can never get enough of the theme song sung by Shirley Bassey.The script is sophisticated and humorous, while James Bond is still his suave and charismatic self, Pussy Galore is fabulously sexy and Auric Goldfinger himself ties with Blofeld as the best Bond villain, and a deliciously bizarre one he is too, being obsessed with gold and everything.Other than the theme song and Goldfinger, the action is what makes this film. I love the gadget designs which are wonderfully over-the-top, while my favourite scenes include Shirley Eaton's legendary gold-plated death, the duel with the bowler-hatted sidekick Oddjob and the midair showdown between Bond and Goldfinger.The acting is superb. Sean Connery gives his best performance as the character of Bond, although Connery is the master of suavity and charisma he is even more suave and charismatic here. Honor Blackman is sexy and enthusiastic as Pussy Galore, while Gert Frobe is amazing as Goldfinger. Overall, a golden treasure and a serious contender for the best ever Bond. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"18 August 2010","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I am a fan of the James Bond series, and Goldfinger is just amazing for so many reasons.

An amazing screenplay keeps up tension throughout. After you see the ending, and the twist hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. It's the kind of film you need to watch twice in a relatively short period of time to truly understand the script's mastery.The plot keeps you engaged throughout and let you think about what could be the end When i first saw this film, i understood 75% of the film. I had to watch it again, to recap on what happened earlier. After the second time i watched it, i realized this is a Superb movie with a fabulous twist. It starts out just like a crime film, but evolves into mystery One thing I can surely say about it is, you can watch it over and over again and you can keep on finding key features each and every time.
