Sheen acts like he was in an innocuous John Hughes comedy, Caulfield acts like he's in Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer. They play two dim-witted and mean high school losers who, on their last day of school, decide to drive to L.A. for one last weekend of freedom before starting their factory jobs. What starts out as a fun time quickly devolves into a killing spree as Caulfield vents his anger on anyone who gets in their way. The duo's first crime is savagely beating a gas station attendant (Caulfield beats the crap out of him while Sheen steals gum. GUM.). Just like in the real world, the LAPD immediately put two detectives on the pretty minor case (one sensitive cop is played by Christopher McDonald, before he got type-cast in mean guy roles.). Later when a cop is drawing a chaulk outline around a body he nudges a gun out of the way.The movie veers wildly in tone from goofy scenes like Caulfield peeing in a pool to disturbing scenes like the brutal beating and killing of a friendly gay man. The whole movie has a schizo air about it, like no one knew what kind of movie they were making. Knowing that director Penelope Speeris later went on to make the Little Rascals and Beverly Hillbillies movies makes the killing scenes in this all the more bizarre. But is it entertaining? I guess. I was never bored, and there is a great scene where the guys toss a beer bottle and it hits an old lady in the head. I liked the climactic chase scene at an empty shopping mall (shades of Dawn of the Dead) and the soundtrack is eighties-licious (The Cramps are heard during a party scene). But the movie, like it's main characters, seems to have no soul and is ultimately an empty experience. There is a dog named Boner the Barbarian, though, so it's not all bad.

He's not like the other teachers, who simply lecture information. He displays his lessons through charm, spite, and action, encouraging his students to Cease the day! Make your lives extraordinary! He tries to encourage free thinking among his students when the other teachers try to shoot that down.He especially garners the interest of Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), a free spirit who's held down by the rules and hardness of his father (Kurtwood Smith), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), who lives somewhat in the shadow of his brother and has a timid, shy streak, Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), the rebel of the group, and their friends. When they find that Mr. Keating was once in a mysterious club, called The Dead Poets Society, they decide to resurrect this club among themselves. This club, Mr. Keating, and their friendship arouse unknown talents and creativity from inside.This movie was great in every possible way. Robin Williams once again showed us his versatility playing fun-loving but serious at heart John Keating. My personal favorite was Robert Sean Leonard, who perfectly displayed for this movie's audience the ambition and spirit that Neil had within, but which would immediately go into hiding when he'd be intimidated by his father. All of the teenagers were excellent in this movie.The camera work was beautiful. The turns, the angles, everything just made you get into the story. The musical score had the same effect. Whatever emotion was supposed to be making up the scene, you felt it when that score was played.This is Peter Weir's masterpiece at the moment. Truly a great film.

The point is Psycho was the only film from 1960 that people really remember no one remembers that The Apartment won best picture that year, and I believe that in years to come The Truman Show will be the most remembered film of 1998. The Truman Show is a great drama that tells the story of a man whose entire life has been filmed on camera and broadcast as a 24 hour a day show of which has millions of viewers addicted.  What makes this film most memorable is the direction by Peter Weir he turns it into a film that is at times funny but then quickly becomes sad because you feel Truman deserves an uncontrolled environment.  The cast is perfect, Noah Emmerich plays Truman's seemingly best friend who is a slave to whatever the shows creator tells him to do to keep Truman from thinking of traveling.  Laura Linney (who is finally beginning to get the attention she deserves) plays Truman's wife who tries to control Truman by telling him of his family obligation.

But I like what I saw, and that was a nice, slow-paced and epic trilogy, with a lot of attention for the story and characters. It was even so slow-paced that my father managed to fall asleep in the cinema in those days. But that easy way of telling a good story is the reason that people nowadays still love or are beginning to love the old Trilogy...What a difference with The Phantom Menace. The only things that kept me interested in TPM were the truly magnificent computer graphics. They are detailed and often funny, except for Jar-Jar, who makes me wish my remote control had a built-in digital eraser. But the really bad thing is that the acting of the humans is horrible too. For weeks after seeing the movie I couldn't stand Liam Neeson when I saw him on TV. He acts like he has constipation or something and is saying his lines with no expression at all; just watch the scene where he and his friends are chased in their craft. Jake Lloyd (Anakin) has obviously not much acting talent (yet). Why didn't the makers contract Haley Joel Osment (from the Sixth Sense) or another natural talent for an expensive movie like this? He's the main character, for heaven's sake.I'm afraid I'm still not done, although I did my best to like this movie. I think it's really, really too bad that this new trilogy has kicked off like this. There aren't that many hard core sci-fi movies made nowadays, let alone trilogies, so as a sci-fi fanatic I thought that this trilogy guaranteed me a good time in the cinema. Of course, you can always find a reason to like a film, such as beautiful graphics, but an exciting story and brilliant acting would add so much more. I mean, when I want to see nice computer graphics, I'll just start a video game. Now, after seeing TPM, I really don't give a thing about what's going to happen next. I'm still going to watch the next movie, but I can't image that the acting and the story are going to be better all of a sudden.What keeps me wondering is why the makers succeeded in messing up a film and likely a whole trilogy, when there are millions of (of course critical) fans waiting to see it!

But I love Americans when they make films like Keeping the faith, cause I still think it is what they do best. Descending from the Billy Wilder school, this movie has it all. Wonderful acting, perfect character chemistry, nice directing, a clever script, hints of more serious matters (religious differences -if such things appeal to you), all in a New York setting which is always welcome. Of course Edward Norton is talented -if there was any doubt, it was settled after American History X. But this directing debut, shows he can do other things as well and personally I'd be glad to see his next move. Ben Stiller is a personal favorite, and Jenna Elfman is adorable -I haven't seen her before but I would like to see her again. Especially when she looks the lover-to-be with that special I have something in my mind look, I believe anyone could fall in love with her instantly. Having a thing for religions I especially enjoyed the first twenty minutes of the film, where Stiller and Norton discover their talent and become holy men. I believe that introducing religious matters in such a light and playful way (through a romantic comedy) can help people realize the real meaning of religions and thus make people from different denominations understand each other. But this is an added bonus. The movie is joyful, funny and guarantees a nice evening home with your S\/O. I hope more films of this kind are made so as I can add them to my collection and watch them again and again. 8\/10 overall -it could be 9\/10 if Norton was a little more experienced as a director. But I bet he will soon be.

I was happily surprised at what I saw.  Guy Ritchie is another director who knows how to use high quality music video style, snappy editing and directing.  Ritchie has written another wild, snarled plot in the tradition of Pulp Fiction.  Actually, this film is extremely similar to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels - identical would not be a stretch.  But Ritchie is not plagiarizing - L, S, and 2SB is his film also. Like Run, Lola, Run, the music video style is used here only where it helps the film, not impedes it.  The most inventive use takes us across the Atlantic in about 3 seconds - you'll have to see it to know what I mean. Almost all the characters have incredibly thick accents, requiring complete attention on the part of the viewer to catch the dialogue.  But that only adds to the overall quirkiness of the film.  All the actors are fairly good. The one who really shines, though, is Brad Pitt.  He wallows in his seediness in this film, and appears to love doing it.  His impenetrable Irish accent is really impossible to decipher, and creates some very funny moments. The other thing Ritchie plays with is time.  A spectacular scene where three cars and three story lines interact is done in reverse.  This scene is absolutely hilarious and very inspired. Warning note to guys  This is quite the guy's film.  Think twice about taking a date with you to this one. With that said, I need to go reserve my copy of the video before it comes out.  10\/10!!!
