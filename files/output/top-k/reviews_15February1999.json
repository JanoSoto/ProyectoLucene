It also bears his trademark; a sinister soundtrack running throughout the film, which regularly reaches unbearable crescendos, before sudden silencePart one sees a bunch of apes getting the low-down on rapid career development from a 10ft-tall headstone. Thus using a combination of tools, co-operation and a great deal of shouting, they are eventually able to step off-planet. Around this time, another slab is found on the Moon and 20th Century mankind suddenly gets a very real sense of being close to a great and long sought-after discovery (a very 60s notion &#150; all that &#145;Age of Aquarius' stuff). I like the shot where the astronauts are crowding round the slab looking very similar (obviously with the addition of spacesuits) to their earlier chimpanzee counterpartsPart two of the movie moves on to tackle AI and whether we're just machines. Great, great cinematography. Hal steals every scene with his Prozac-happy delivery style `I honestly think you ought to calm down; take a stress pill and think things over, Dave.' Awesome amounts of irregular breathing.Part three is the final FX sequence followed by the `let's put that thing in a zoo' type ending, with smatterings of reincarnation as Dave becomes Starchild.Several devices run throughout the film. One is the extensive use of long pauses in the dialogue and the other is the abundant use of distressing sound effects (like the heavy breathing, the chimps screeching, alarms, etc). A possible third being the intense use of colour in deep space.

Morgan Freeman is wasted as an abolitionist, and there are some scenes which don't come off (the give us free scene, for example).  Also, this is an enormously complex tale, and sometimes it seems too complex for Spielberg.Still, those flaws, for the most part, pale beside the power of the film. Particularly the opening sequence when the slaves are captured, which ranks with the storming of the ghetto in SCHINDLER'S LIST and the D-Day sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as Spielberg's most powerful sequences on film. Although most of the film is a courtroom drama, it never feels slowed down or like a TV movie of the week, because Spielberg doesn't always go for the easy answer.  Many were not fans of Matthew McConaughey's performance, but not only did I like him here, I also liked how his character was portrayed, as you don't think to find a character as pragmatic as his is in a tale like this.  Of course, the real stars here are Hounsou and Hopkins, and they both deliver the goods.

I can't think of another movie in which a close community has been represented so real, so convincing. The Deer Hunter really takes its time observing these people, living their ordinary lives. Some viewers complain that these scenes are much too long, that there isn't happening enough. I don't share their opinion. The strength of this movie lies in the fact that you know the three friends, that you empathize with their feelings and their way of thinking. And all this is accomplished thanks to this first, absorbing hour.The Russian Roulette-scene is very famous. When I first saw it, not yet 20 years old, I was extremely shocked by it. Never before had I seen such brutal violence in a movie. The tension is so perceptible. The confusion, felt by Nick. The heart-rending fear of Steven. The almost maniacal determination of Michael to get them out.I'm twice as old now. Lots of movies I liked when I was 20, lost its power of attraction as I grew older. But not The Deer Hunter. The Russian Roulette-scene still is one of the most compelling pieces of movie I've ever seen.When Michael returns to the United States we witness several other great scenes. Because the first hour gave us the opportunity to get to know the friends who stayed behind in the US, we now understand the enormous gap between them and Michael. Although it never becomes overly sentimental, Michael's coming-home is an emotionally shattering piece of movie.The actors all are sublime. Lesser actors never could have shown us this much, with so few means. It's absolutely great how they created these real, convincing characters. I'm still amazed that Jon Voight won the Oscar for best actor. I'm sure lots of actors could have created his role in Coming Home as good as he did. But very few are capable to do what Robert De Niro did in The Deer Hunter, it's his best role ever. I also was touched by the hardly ever mentioned part of George Dzunda, who played John. It was small, but great!Unfortunately, I also do have some comment. I really can't understand how Nick could possibly have sent money to Steven. Neither of them knew the other one was alive. Nick never could have known where Steven was staying. I think this is an enormous blunder in the script. I also had some difficulty with the last scenes in Saigon. When you consider what chaos Saigon was in at that moment, the events happening there weren't very realistic.If these flaws wouldn't have been there, I surely would have given The Deer Hunter 10 out of 10.

The majority of the people in the world DO NOT analyze films to death..what you see is what you get. And that's how you have to view The Truman Show. What makes it so amazing is that it satirizes (albeit DARKLY) so many unlikely cultural staples gated communities, the viewing audience and media stardrom. Yet... you can't really see this unless you look at the film as a whole. Anyone understand what I mean? Jim Carrey gives us a wonderfully restrained, yet manic performance as Truman Burbank. Ed Harris' megalomanical Christof also adds greatly to the film. My one complaint? Overly saccahrine Meryl. Although I suppose that goes along with the satire. One of my favorite films ever. Period.
