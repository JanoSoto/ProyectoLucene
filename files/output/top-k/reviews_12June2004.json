Even to this day, six years after seeing it for the first time, I can't get over the freshness, originality, and overall boldness of Alex Proyas' visionary masterpiece. Now that Proyas is getting a larger budget for I, Robot this year, I felt that it would be time to credit Proyas' earlier science fiction masterpiece in anticipation that I, Robot would only live up to this film. From the opening shots of this film, the viewer is instantly plummeted into a bold and grand setting of an indistinct city that seems that this is how noir films of the forties would look if they were in color. After a display of the bizarre occurrence that happens to the city around midnight, we are introduced to the film's protagonist, a man named John Murdoch, who awakens in a bathtub, with no memory of his life or how he got where he was. Needless to say, what happened to the dead woman next to his bed. After a few clues that seem to trigger brief glimpses of his childhood, he is chased from his room by three odd looking figures, looking for him.As Murdoch wanders the city, trying to find his identity, we learn that not only are the strange people (who are appropriately named The Strangers) looking for Mr. Murdoch, but a police officer named Bumstead is as well, searching for the killer of not just the woman in the apartment, but six other women who were murdered in the same manner as the woman from Murdoch's room. Also is Murdoch's estranged wife, who is trying to make a reconciliation with him after a falling out. Even a therapist that Murdoch has been seeing because of his wife's infidelity is searching for him as well. Everyone seems to have their own reason to be searching for Murdoch, and Murdoch is trying to figure out why, since he has no clue as to who he is. In a sense, Murdoch's quest becomes a search for identity in a world that is trying to label him. Is he a murderer, is he a jilted lover, is he psychologically damaged person, or is he a like the strangers who are pursuing him?But that becomes the center question of Dark City itself, do we make up who we are or are we made up of experiences and memories? We realize this question when we realize the purpose of the Strangers' inhabitance of the city. They are actually aliens, whose race is dying out and they need to observe the human race to see what has made us thrive so much. So, we enter their experiment, which revolves around making the inhabitants of the city fall asleep at midnight while the strangers give them new lives by implanting new memories in them and changing the environment around them.Murdoch also discovers that the reason the Strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does. He has also begun to take on the traits of the strangers as well, gaining their power to tune, which is the ability to alter their environment by will alone. This whole concept suggests two things, the first being that humanity has the ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment and the other is that as an individual, humans have the ability to shape their world to their own desire once they are fully aware of themselves and their desires.The movie in itself is a brilliant commentary on our society as a whole which is displayed in the beginning with Dr. Schreber's rat experiment in the lab, which comes to symbolize a smaller scale version of the strangers' experiment for us, putting rats (humans) in a maze of a city (life) and seeing if they can find their way. Which also seems to suggest that as a society, we are merely just rats in a maze, wandering around until we come to the end. The strangers' insistence on doing everything as a group also brings up another interesting point about the human race is that our ability to be individuals is what makes humans thrive rather than conformity and similarity. Dark City takes such bold and brilliant concepts, suggesting so much about our society as a whole and even the importance of individuality over conformity. The themes, once read into, take on such a strong and complex turn, unheard of in most science fiction films of recent years.Then there is the matter of the setting itself, for no science fiction film can be complete without a strong and symbolic setting. The setting is vast and detailed, and this isn't just the city, which is a sight to behold in itself. The underground world of the strangers themselves is claustrophobic, atmospheric, and actually is the most alien in architecture, suggesting a twisted, surrealistic world, yet one that is dependent on the world above them. The city above ground displays a rich noir feel in which one feels that there is something sinister lurking underneath it's surface. Even the blending of the time periods, seeing 30s architecture around 60s cars driven by people in 50s suits is even a hint off that the city has been fabricated out of different eras and pasts as one of the strangers even seems to suggest.Dark City is a film rich in ideas, concepts, visual splendor, and atmosphere. It's the kind of film that one seems to enjoy being lost in, despite the danger that lurks in it's atmosphere. It's a film that reassures it's viewers that a strong understanding of oneself and staying true to yourself that one can conquer any world they are placed in. And as I, Robot approaches, one can only hope that lightning can strike twice with Proyas and his unique blend of visual grandeur and his depth will emerge and be embraced by a larger audience, who might seek out this film.

Actually, before I go that far I should say that the story is, in fact, fairly complex and operates on several levels, but it is executed so badly and downright grotesquely that the story is often completely irrelevant, as though each scene is trying to outdo the last in distracting the viewer from what the whole movie is about in the first place.Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the part of Allegra Geller, a star video game programmer who is just about to come out with the most technologically advanced video game ever created. Evidently, the game is able to tap into players' minds so that they actually LIVE the video game in virtual reality. Needless to say, that fine line between reality and virtual reality becomes more and more blurred until all sorts of crazy havoc ensues. The danger of the game is first hinted at in an early scene where Allegra is conducting a closed-door demonstration of her new game and some nutcase attacks her with an alarmingly ORGANIC weapon (for lack of the NEED for a better word, as it turns out), which initially seems like some crazed weirdo raised by video games but, after a moment's thought, is probably more likely someone who has had contact with the game. Sort of like Vincent Grey in the Sixth Sense.At any rate, I would say that the movie takes it's first precipitous plunge when we see the video game controllers which, like the weapon that nutcase used to try to kill Allegra, are not only disturbingly organic to the point that they are more like creatures than controllers, but they are operated through the use of equally disturbing fondling motions, as though the players compete with each other by trying to pleasure their controller better than their opponents. And don't even get me started on the bio-ports. Very few times have I ever seen such things in a movie, although it's not necessarily new from director David Cronenburg, who has a history of putting weird sexual things in his movies (see Crash, which he directed just before taking on eXistenZ). In my personal opinion, a lot of things in eXistenZ were unappealing simply because they were not necessarily offensive, but simply distasteful in a pretty literal sense. Consider, for example, the scene where our heroes, Allegra and Ted Pikul (another great performance from Jude Law) are eating in a suspicious restaurant, and Pikul gradually discovers that the hideous piece of meat that he is eating can be assembled into a greasy gun much like the one used to attack Allegra near the beginning of the movie. Maybe I was just completely put off by that scene because I was eating barbecued chicken while I was watching it. I was absolutely horrified, I almost had to turn the movie off. Interestingly enough, the video game plot is complex and simplistic at the same time. It reveals either a deep understanding of Allegra, the main character, or an excessively weak script, or both. Maybe the former was a lucky byproduct of the latter. While inside the game (which gradually becomes increasingly difficult to determine), they follow a rather childish path, following cues that sound like something a little kid would make up while writing a story for a homework assignment. A creepy country gas station attendant named Gas tells them to look for a Chinese restaurant in the forest, and order the special, while turning down such immensely appetizing dishes as mutants and reptiles. But then, of course, we have scenes like the one where Ted performs cunnilingus on Allegra's bio-port. I think it's safe to say such things don't turn up in many homework assignments. Clearly, the movie's message is mostly about the dangers of extensive video gaming and the addictive nature of the way they detach us from reality. Movies do the same thing, but good movies cause you to use your mind, to think about things (much like good video games, and both are unfortunately rare). So this is not a new idea, but where the movie really suffers, aside from a lot of its stomach-turning imagery, is in the fact that it is lost in the wake of the massively superior Wachowski brothers film The Matrix, released the same month. Big movies have a tendency to arrive in pairs, and one always seems to be hugely superior to the other. Independence Day and The Arrival, Armageddon and Deep Impact (the latter being the vastly superior, obviously), Antz and A Bug's Life, Volcano and Dante's Peak, etc. There was a big difference in likability between Antz and A Bug's Life rather than in quality, but in this case, while it has been hailed by many critics and fans alike, I found eXistenZ to push the envelope of bad taste past the breaking point and into the realm of weirdness with its often revolting mixture of ham-handed, graphic sexual imagery and what Roger Ebert described as showing `characters eating things that surgeons handle with gloves on.'

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"12 June 2004","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  ExistenZ is an exercise in bad taste combined with a reasonable budget, which was acquired despite an almost total absence of any sort of interesting story. Actually, before I go that far I should say that the story is, in fact, fairly complex and operates on several levels, but it is executed so badly and downright grotesquely that the story is often completely irrelevant, as though each scene is trying to outdo the last in distracting the viewer from what the whole movie is about in the first place.Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the part of Allegra Geller, a star video game programmer who is just about to come out with the most technologically advanced video game ever created. Evidently, the game is able to tap into players' minds so that they actually LIVE the video game in virtual reality. Needless to say, that fine line between reality and virtual reality becomes more and more blurred until all sorts of crazy havoc ensues. The danger of the game is first hinted at in an early scene where Allegra is conducting a closed-door demonstration of her new game and some nutcase attacks her with an alarmingly ORGANIC weapon (for lack of the NEED for a better word, as it turns out), which initially seems like some crazed weirdo raised by video games but, after a moment's thought, is probably more likely someone who has had contact with the game. Sort of like Vincent Grey in the Sixth Sense.At any rate, I would say that the movie takes it's first precipitous plunge when we see the video game controllers which, like the weapon that nutcase used to try to kill Allegra, are not only disturbingly organic to the point that they are more like creatures than controllers, but they are operated through the use of equally disturbing fondling motions, as though the players compete with each other by trying to pleasure their controller better than their opponents. And don't even get me started on the bio-ports. Very few times have I ever seen such things in a movie, although it's not necessarily new from director David Cronenburg, who has a history of putting weird sexual things in his movies (see Crash, which he directed just before taking on eXistenZ). In my personal opinion, a lot of things in eXistenZ were unappealing simply because they were not necessarily offensive, but simply distasteful in a pretty literal sense. Consider, for example, the scene where our heroes, Allegra and Ted Pikul (another great performance from Jude Law) are eating in a suspicious restaurant, and Pikul gradually discovers that the hideous piece of meat that he is eating can be assembled into a greasy gun much like the one used to attack Allegra near the beginning of the movie. Maybe I was just completely put off by that scene because I was eating barbecued chicken while I was watching it. I was absolutely horrified, I almost had to turn the movie off. Interestingly enough, the video game plot is complex and simplistic at the same time. It reveals either a deep understanding of Allegra, the main character, or an excessively weak script, or both. Maybe the former was a lucky byproduct of the latter. While inside the game (which gradually becomes increasingly difficult to determine), they follow a rather childish path, following cues that sound like something a little kid would make up while writing a story for a homework assignment. A creepy country gas station attendant named Gas tells them to look for a Chinese restaurant in the forest, and order the special, while turning down such immensely appetizing dishes as mutants and reptiles. But then, of course, we have scenes like the one where Ted performs cunnilingus on Allegra's bio-port. I think it's safe to say such things don't turn up in many homework assignments. Clearly, the movie's message is mostly about the dangers of extensive video gaming and the addictive nature of the way they detach us from reality. Movies do the same thing, but good movies cause you to use your mind, to think about things (much like good video games, and both are unfortunately rare). So this is not a new idea, but where the movie really suffers, aside from a lot of its stomach-turning imagery, is in the fact that it is lost in the wake of the massively superior Wachowski brothers film The Matrix, released the same month. Big movies have a tendency to arrive in pairs, and one always seems to be hugely superior to the other.

This may be an unconventional style of film-making, but the result is triumphant.'Lamerica' is both epic and comic, some elements bring to mind David Lean and others Mike Leigh (a feat otherwise only managed, in my opinion, by the films of Emil Kusturica).  The acting is superb, the comedy dry, laced with sad irony (even the occasional Albanian mis-translation of Italian is inspired).  At the centre of this film is a conventional road-movie, a story of an odd couple who bond; but it's put into a wider context by the extraordinary scenes, set in Tirana, that top and tail the movie this film is political as well as personal, addressing not just the contemporary Albanian reality but also wider questions, such as racism and the relationship of the affluent west to the poorer world. But what stands out most of all is the remarkable visuals, both of the stunning Albanian landscape and also of the people few directors make as much use of the widescreen format as Amelio, and the way he creates landscapes from faces so expressive they are almost fluourescent is in a class of its own.  In some ways, he is almost too effective in doing so the film feels manipulative because of the power of the images in making its point (and one wonders, can life in Albania really have been this bad?).  This is a film that might almost be silent, the pictures tell the story.  When, for example, Enrico la Verso's character drinks the milk, the significance of this simple act hits home with the force of a sledgehammer.Now released on DVD, 'Lamerica', one of the least typical but best films of the 90s, is well worth seeking out.
