Not that I've re-watched Ace Ventura When Nature Calls again I can see why they stopped with the series after this one. (I'm not really counting in the upcoming movie Ace Ventura Jr Pet Detective, since it obviously features a different main character.) Well, it was not like its predecessor Ace Ventura Pet Detective was brilliant but it showed some good potential for more. This potential gets basically all ruined and wasted within this movie.Thing I simply hated about this movie was its absolutely dreadful script. It's such an incredible childish and simple written script, that features nothing original, nothing surprising and very little funny actually. Most, if not all the fun from this movie comes from Jim Carrey's performance. It's an annoying story, that is set too much at the same locations. All of the other characters within this movie also just don't work out, due to its very poor story and writing in general.The movie is supposedly for most part set in Africa but its obvious that not one step get set on African ground during the production of this movie. It's obvious studio work and the movie for some parts got shot in wild life park(s), I would imaging. It gives the movie a cheap look and feeling as well, even though of course this wasn't a low-budget production.Yet, still it's a movie that will make you laugh. Jim Carrey is totally crazy as Ace Ventura and he's actually more hilarious in this role than he has been in any recent movie of his. The first Ace Ventura movie launched him to stardom, which allows him to in this movie go even more over-the-top with his character. It provides the movie with some great laughs, due to sheer stupidity. Yes, the movie and its comedy is at times so stupid that you can't help but laugh.So, watch this movie a get a few laughs from Carrey's performance.

Well, it was not like its predecessor Ace Ventura Pet Detective was brilliant but it showed some good potential for more. This potential gets basically all ruined and wasted within this movie.Thing I simply hated about this movie was its absolutely dreadful script. It's such an incredible childish and simple written script, that features nothing original, nothing surprising and very little funny actually. Most, if not all the fun from this movie comes from Jim Carrey's performance. It's an annoying story, that is set too much at the same locations. All of the other characters within this movie also just don't work out, due to its very poor story and writing in general.The movie is supposedly for most part set in Africa but its obvious that not one step get set on African ground during the production of this movie. It's obvious studio work and the movie for some parts got shot in wild life park(s), I would imaging. It gives the movie a cheap look and feeling as well, even though of course this wasn't a low-budget production.Yet, still it's a movie that will make you laugh. Jim Carrey is totally crazy as Ace Ventura and he's actually more hilarious in this role than he has been in any recent movie of his. The first Ace Ventura movie launched him to stardom, which allows him to in this movie go even more over-the-top with his character. It provides the movie with some great laughs, due to sheer stupidity.

'American Beauty' is really a magnificent story, but it's more than that. It displays a dirty part of the world that we all know is there, but we just don't want to think about.The dreary gray world that Lester Burnham lives in would make Tim Burton so very proud, but it's Kevin Spacey's ever creepy monotone voice that gives Lester his personality. The childish, stupid way that he changes himself to try and impress his daughter's alluring friend Angela is the focal point of most of the story, but not the main draw.The reason this movie won Best Picture is because of Wes Bentley. Though he has almost no other desirable credits, Bentley's portrayal of Ricky, the insightful, eerie next-door neighbor, lights the movie aflame. And that scene. That single scene that gained so much mockery over these nine years-- it's what got me. Something as simple as a white, plastic bag floating up and down in the air, that's all this movie needed.Annette Bening gives a shudder-worthy performance as the fed-up wife. But more than that was the absolutely chilling and spot-on Frank Fits, played by Chris Cooper. There are no words for that performance. The look on his face when his secret is revealed is something that stays with you forever, but that you awkwardly will try to suppress from your mind.The ending is something so truly poignant and beautiful, something that, in attempting to state that nothing ever ends nicely and nothing is perfect, made the movie perfect.

A true classic surprisingly underrated and overlooked in history. It is in full swing every way you look at it, it\u2019s flawless. I call it perfection. The pinnacle of Luc Besson film-making career. Direction was superb as well as the soundtracks and scores (by Eric Serra). The scores was one of the pivotal element of the movie which add to the depth and dense atmosphere to the movie. Besides the movie is highly stylish and original.

In the art of killing, Léon is a Pro. But in real life, he is a loner. Like DeNiro in Taxi Driver. His best friend is his plant. Deep down, he is a child. He is mentally slow and do not know how to read nor write. Then there is Mathilda, a 12 years old girl who lives in a dysfunctional family, on the verge of committing suicide. She has endured the hardships of life that had made her mature at her young age. Her entire family was wiped out by a corrupt DEA Officer and his men because of drug problems. She had no other place to turn to except his next door neighbor, Léon.Then the tone of the movie changes completely which breaks the stereotypes of other action movies. This is where the movie caught me by surprise. I thought it will become just another boring movie and how wrong was I! Prepare yourself for awesomeness! This is something I never experienced before in any other movie. It was that exceptional. The way it\u2019s constructed & layered or in short put together was a work of genius. Arty like.

The role was crafted for him and he delivers the goods. He played on his facial expressions more than words actually throughout the movie. He portrayed the character as exactly Luc wished it to be. This is his breakthrough and famous movie.- Nathalie Portman was so versatile in her role as Mathilda. She pulled up into a complex and difficult role. She was wonderful and prolific considering her age (12). She shifted between different moods seamlessly (An uncontrollable burst of laughter in the Restaurant scene and a burst of tears in the ending moments of the movie). She is lovable, cute, touching and has a lovely innocent voice.

From the attack on the base camp that they completely demolish, to the destruction of a square block of jungle with the mini gun scene. But this movie true message is the fact that Dutch is left to fight the Predator without the use of military weapons, but has to make his own out of the supplies and natural surroundings around him, which completely throw the Predator for a complete loop, or does it!After screening this movie to many times to count I have come up with a conclusion about the end. I believe that Poncho (Richard Chaves) the soldier with the automatic grenade launcher, Survived at the end. Well I believe he was in the lap of Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) in the helicopter at the end. Because you can see the hair of someone laying down but no face. And the only one with that short of hair at the time was Poncho, and heck I think Anna came back for him, granted he did get hit by a huge log, but who the hell else could it be. Also on another note in Predator 2 they talk about only two special mission force members survived and I don't know what this means to you, but Anna is no special forces member! This is truly something that has bothered me for some time. But this movie had given me days of satisfaction and a must watch for anyone who likes Sci-fi\/Horror\/Action.

Some commentators (including Baudrillard) have said that Independence Day (1996) foresaw the events of 9\/11 &#150; that it gave an insight into the subconscious hatred of American hegemony.I've just seen The Day The Earth Stood Still (2008), Keanu Reeve's latest sci-fi vehicle. It seems to me, that ever since Independence Day in 1996, Hollywood has been producing and exporting a wide variety of disaster movies which centre around the theme of destruction of the earth. Communications Theory can be seen as an offshoot of Sociology &#150; what this means is that, for a Communications theorist, newspapers, magazines, books, television, cinema and advertising are all open to interpretation. The hope is that, by interpreting or deconstructing these media, we gain a deeper insight into our society, and possibly human nature.In the 50s, Hollywood was obsessed with aliens and monsters wreaking destruction upon the earth. These images are said to have been manufactured as a conscious effort in the propaganda war against Communism &#150; Communism being the destructive alien or monster.But it's too simplistic to say that in the 50s, Hollywood alien movies represented communism and now alien movies represent the threat of Islamic terrorism.The Day The Earth Stood Still is a remake of a 1951 movie, but the alien depicted in the original was hardly threatening. Actually, he brought with him a message of pacifism, calm and logic. His message was one of peace not subversion and war. Also, Independence Day was made before 9\/11.The events of 9\/11 temporarily abated film projects involving urban destruction, but only briefly. Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005) and Cloverfield (2008) have definitive, obvious references to 9\/11.There are several references to 9\/11 in the The Day The Earth Stood Still people running from smoke and dust in Manhattan, the dead father of the child in the film, who went to war to build, the child constantly shouting why should we help them? (the them being the aliens &#150; representing Muslims). More telling still, The Secretary of Defence now represents America &#150; not the President.The film reads like a party political broadcast for Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth, and is one a growing number of films including The Day After Tomorrow (2004), and M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening (2008), that purports to warn us about the dangers if we don't treat our planet right. Nature is literally fighting back in these films.What else do all these films have in common? They consistently show the destruction of structures. Starting with Independence Day, notice the buildings that get blown to smithereens most notably The White House and The Empire State Building. The first building signifies the destruction of democracy, the second, the imminent demise of the American empire.In The Happening too, Shyamalan shows us that only the North East of America is affected &#150; why? The North East represents the centre of Finance, Print Media, Television and News in America. Along with California, the North East is the wealthiest part of the US. It is as if Shyamalan is saying, all these structures have gone to ****.The Brooklyn Bridge has been destroyed twice once in I Am Legend (2007), and once in Cloverfield. Could this signify souring relations between those in Manhattan and those in Brooklyn? Or, is it as some critics have said, that Manhattan is America and the destruction of the bridge signifies a wider chasm of American separateness.Liberty has been under attack several times in The Day After Tomorrow, we see The Statue of Liberty buried in snow &#150; frozen; in Cloverfield, J. J. Abrams violently decapitates Liberty, hurling it like a weapon. Like in 1968, when we first saw Liberty damaged, buried in the sand in Planet of the Apes.Let us now look at the social representations in the films. Many of the films allude to the separation from loved ones The Day after Tomorrow, The War of the Worlds, The Happening, Cloverfield, Independence Day, Armageddon (1998), I Am Legend and Deep Impact (1998) to name a few. But these films do not only show separation; they also reveal complex relationships and themes of adoption and surrogate parenting.In I Am Legend, Will Smith finds a wife and child that are not his own; in War of the Worlds, Tom Cruise is estranged from his children &#150; a useless dad. In Armageddon, Liv Tyler has no mother; in the Happening, Mark Walberg is chasing his own wife and is forced to look after a friend's child. In Independence Day, Will Smith is going out with an exotic dancer who has a child &#150; he has taken on the child as his own. In The Day The Earth Stood Still, it gets more complex still the female lead is forced to look after a child that is not her own after the father and mother have died. What does this all mean?Hollywood would never have made films like these twenty years ago. What we can see is an obvious breaking down of the traditional family units of the last 100 years; traditional society is literally being torn apart, with a new restructuring of family and community taking shape.Former Mayor Ed Koch, who now keeps himself busy by reviewing movies for several newspapers in Manhattan, has attributed the persistence of the destruction theme to edifice envy. They want to see our skyscrapers destroyed because they are envious of them, Mr. Koch has said. We can only assume the they is the rest of the world.Then again, all these theories could just be a lot of bull.

Maybe if viewed after the television series this film is based off of, this movie would be easier to understand, but without any prior viewing of the show, this movie makes very little sense. Though it makes no sense, at the same time, it is so weird that it might make you want a second or third viewing to try and analyze it.Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) is a popular high school girl, and this movie is about her death. It's not a mystery to any fan of the show, or to anyone else, they state that she will die in the picture. Laura has an odd relationship with her father, Leland (Ray Wise). She has a man who comes in at night and rapes her. She goes to clubs to have sex with the patrons and walk around topless. She snorts coke. Her life and death are the main plot, and it is easy to understand. It's the side characters and sub-plots that make no sense.The most confusing scene features David Bowie in a strange cameo appearance. Kyle MacLachlan appears in this scene as Special Agent Dale Cooper. Cooper stands in front of a security camera and then walks into the security room to look at the camera monitor. He walks back out, and walks back in the room, only to find himself still in front of the TV, and Jeffries walks by. Jeffries claims that this is not Cooper, and then the screen goes into a dream, and then Jeffries disappears. This scene makes no sense at all, and probably requires the television show to make sense of it.The acting in this movie is very good. The musical score is nice. The direction is very stylish, with some interesting shots. The writing for the characters isn't bad, but this movie could make about 100 times more sense. This movie might not have been made for anyone who isn't a fan of the show, but nonetheless, as a stand alone picture, this is not an easy watch. It just doesn't have enough of an explanation behind it.Maybe to fans of Twin Peaks, this is everything you could want from a movie and more, but to someone who had never watched the show, this movie is both interesting and confusing.

In Annie Hall, one of Woody Allen's first films, we can sense the application of that common phrase. Allen and Marshall Brickman wrote the script of the movie, but we can never imagine Brickman's collaboration or influence. I say this meaning no disrespect, but Woody is the man we've always seen; the beautiful neurotic we've learned to love and recognize in many characters he never even played (Mia Farrow's character in The Purple Rose of Cairo or Jason Biggs' in Anything Else, to put to examples distant in time). And that man is the same Alvy Singer, the protagonist of this movie, to whom Allison (Carol Kane) says You're cute.And how can he not be? A comedian who divides life between the miserable and the horrible, Alvy looks at the camera and talks to us, wondering why Annie (Diane Keaton) left him; trying to understand what he did wrong. So he takes us through their relationship, and we learn that once he tells Annie about his division of life You should be happy that you're miserable. We learn about Annie and about him, but mostly about him, and we instantly understand what went wrong. There are a million ways to look at it, but Alvy, an irreparable egocentric, passed his depressive view of life to Annie he bought her books about death, told her to visit an analyst, shut down her social life little by little. But that's not the point, because Alvy we'll never admit it, and he'll never understand. His prejudiced view of everything, his need to always teach the rest something and the thought that he knows better will never change. He tries hard to show us his childhood, which he revisits once in a while as if he was daydreaming-by himself, with Annie or with his best friend Rob (Tony Roberts)-, his previous relationships and a mix of what he did as a comedian in the past and what he does now. In a monstrous editing work by Wendy Greene Bricmont and Ralph Rosenblum, we share Alvy's disappointment in life. He looks at the camera in the middle of conversations so he can analyze a situation, and stops people in the middle of the street to look for solutions.As I already said, it's in vain; and maybe Alvy's relationship with Annie was doomed from the beginning. We also get a look at Annie's previous relationships and we can understand what drove her to a man like Alvy (yes, he's a man in his forties, who tells us about being in the middle of a life crisis as he looks for explanations to what occurred to him). So if everything was lost, what is it there to find? Well, contradictorily, everything. I'll tell you...The first encounter they both share, which involves a whole afternoon, is a lesson of cinema; of character creation and writing in a genre that exists no more. The romantic comedy we watch today and that I love is so different from this fantastic piece that shares its genre definition, that if you walked today into Annie Hall and they told you what kind of movie it is, you'd come out of the theater saying you've been fooled. The psychological reflections, the moments of quiet observation, the scary plausibility of the performances and the risk of making something so seemingly autobiographical (that makes you hate and love a character\/human being in different moments of the ride) and re- declaring it again inside of it make Annie Hall the masterpiece it is. And it's also a masterpiece because it's the essence of a cinema that has disappeared or is at least in extinction, and that Woody Allen tried to keep alive.Never taking the easy way out, always in the search of an unpredictable surprise, the writer\/director bet on characters, writing about what he knew, knowing that, that way, he could never go wrong.
