After a brief tussle Columbia realised the fight wasn't worth it, and backed out.  Crisis in the Hot Zone was never made.Probably a pity, for Outbreak shows every sign of being conceived in haste.

The real problem is that things are done just too easily.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"2 August 1999","score":"","review":"  This film should have been more engaging and intellectually stimulating than it was. As it is, only Oleanna stands out as a more poorly acted and directed Mamet film (Note to IFC LOSE that film already ! ) What failed ?  The dialog is often stilted and forced-- especially Rebecca Pidgeon, who was just wrong in every way imaginable.  Especially in early scenes, one gets the impression that Mamet was trying for staccato back-and-forth dialog that is more suited to the stage.  On film it comes across as forced and overly artful.  The hints dropped about no one ever being who they seem are about as subtle as a brick through your window at midnight.  Any suspense that remains lies solely in figuring out whether the plot is as incredibly obvious as it seems to be.  ... and while we're on that subject, those of us who figured out the major event of the plot during the first reel are NOT even rewarded for watching closely (numerous times, even in slow motion) to see how the bad guys pull it off.  In fact, one can reasonably conclude that some off-screen science fiction device was used. As the protagonist, Campbell Scott never succeeds in making me like him or care about what happens to his character.  That is largely the fault of the script and the directing moreso than his acting.  For us to believe that he could be so badly duped by others, his character needed to have been developed earlier on as a distracted professor type who understands only abstractions, not people.   Anyone who knows a scientist knows how paranoid s\/he is about protecting her\/his work-- it is INCONCEIVABLE that he would risk his intellectual product as recklessly as he does.   For that plot device to work, he needed to have something more at stake than simply a pile of money-- a mother dying of a rare disease for wont of funds to pay for an expensive operation, or maybe we learn that he wants the money to support an orphanage full of poor, pathetic children.   If just the money is at stake,  then we need to be convinced that this guy is a real fanatic about gaining wealth, not that he simply wants what he deserves.  As it stands, the story flunks a basic test of realism and fails to make the audience care about the character.A small but annoying point.. am I the only one who wonders why he was ever wearing glasses when he could leave them behind at a critical point and do just fine without them for the remainder of the movie ???  I think they were included as a stereotype for the scientist character, and for a single close-up shot.Having said all of this, I still found the movie a small cut above the rest in the mystery\/action\/noir genre.  This is hardly the first film of this type to telegraph its plot twists-- and this one does it in pursuit of a more stylish and intellectually engaging storyline.

And now I am really sorry, because it obviously would have been even BETTER on the big screen and in surround sound. But what REALLY got me was the story. It's a thinly disguised (very thinly -- for Iggy fans, Bowie fans, or fans of both -- and speculative by necessity) story of the David Bowie\/Iggy Pop collaboration which resulted in Bowie producing some Iggy stuff (and rather poorly, I might add; the mix on some of Iggy's best songs, like Funtime, is horribly muddy) and the cross-pollination of their musical talents (songs such as Red Money by Bowie and Sister Midnight by Iggy are note for note exactly the same; only the lyrics change, though Bowie does not credit Iggy on his Lodger album). What this movie explores is what may have gone on *besides* the musical collaboration, which I always wondered about. After all, there was that one famous (infamous) Mick Rock photo of Bowie and Lou Reed leaning across Mick Jagger for a sloppy wet kiss at the table of some cafe or club... So I figured something went on between Iggy and Bowie, but I never read far enough into the Iggy or Bowie literature to find out. From what I *have* read over the years in magazines like Rolling Stone and Creem (okay, showing my age), neither of them would talk about the other. So that aspect of the film certainly seems accurate.I've been wondering why Ewan McGregor was supposed to be such a big deal -- I mean, he seemed a serviceable actor, from what I had seen in Trainspotting; Phantom Menace, I'm afraid, made everyone too wooden to make McGregor stand out at all, to me. BUT having now seen Velvet Goldmine, I now know what was the big deal about Ewan McGregor. Man, can he act. He *became* Iggy in the live concert sequences -- I was astonished. (I've seen Iggy live, and McGregor really nailed Iggy's vibrating, spastic style of moves -- plus a few of his infamous moments, such as dancing 'til his pants fell down, feeling himself, etc.) And I think he did a very good job of conveying the frustration of someone who is what he is, is not the image that his partner\/friend wants to see or wants him to be, and knows he can't live up to it.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is impossibly pretty and plays the part of Brian Slade very well; he pretty much *is* Bowie, as much as McGregor *is* Iggy. I've never seen him in anything before, but he did seem a bit wooden in parts; but then, from what I've read, Bowie was very detached from people at certain points during the Ziggy Stardust\/Aladdin Sane\/Thin White Duke times in his career. Toni Collette was incredible as Mandy Slade, the fictionalized version of Angie Bowie. I would have liked to see more of her, but that wasn't really the scope of the film; I will definitely check out anything she appears in, in the future.The soundtrack was incredible, hearkening back to all the incredible glitter rock songs with original songs, and remakes (20th Century Boy, TV Eye) that didn't make me shudder but got the spirit of it right.Lastly, of course, this is a film of visual spectacle (as well as sound -- damn, I hope one of the art theaters by me plays it as a midnight flick!). I've seen Todd Haynes' previous films Poison and Safe, and these were visually arresting -- but Velvet Goldmine takes the cake for sheer beauty, artistry, and gorgeous strangeness. Everything Haynes does has a kind of compelling watchableness to it. I think Velvet Goldmine might possibly been in need of some tighter editing; but then again, maybe not, since it is much more a European film than an American film, in terms of the pacing and editing. It's not cut-cut-cut like so many US Hollywood films -- and I for one was glad. The stylization and formality of some of the visual composition -- and I'm not even talking about the glam scenes -- really sets the scenes apart and makes what the characters have to say that much more interesting.All in all, this is well worth seeing, at least if you know and appreciate Bowie, Iggy, and the whole glitter rock era. It also made me eager to see the main leads -- McGregor, Rhys-Meyers, Collette and Bale -- in future work. And I'm anticipating Todd Haynes' next film with glee... as well as any possible future showings of Velvet Goldmine as a midnight feature in the art theaters around Chicago.

To enjoy this film, you have can't set yourself above it an expect to be entertained.I saw the movie with a friend who found it plenty disturbing.  His summary was the perfect example of how three inexperienced people who have NO business being in the woods in the first place royally screw themselves over.  I agree.  I almost burst into tears along with the students when they encountered the log crossing they'd been at earlier in the day and realized they'd been going in circles.  Witch legend or not, this should be a testament to anyone who wants to go jaunting off into the deep woods without any serious preparation or at least a local guide in an unfamiliar area.As for whatever was stalking them, well that was the truly disturbing part.  The ending was terrifying, and utterly confusing at the same time.  Those who didn't like the ending&#133; well, the film said that these students disappeared and were never found.  It didn't say that they died, although I'm certain that's what happened to them.  People don't disappear and leave tidy explanations as to what happened to them.  I found myself haunted by this film long after I left the theater, and I had anxiety dreams about it all night.Bravo to Haxan Films.  Maybe this will be a wake-up call to the Holly-hacks that have reduced the so-called horror genre to cheap scares, gore, CGI unbelievability, and gratuitous wise-cracks and laugh lines.

The three actors in the film give one of the most realistic performances I've ever seen in a movie.  Yes, some of the things they do are just flat out stupid, but the dialogue between the three of them is excellent.  If it wasn't for the chemistry, or lack there of, between these characters this film wouldn't be worth putting in theaters at all.  As I said before, the acting was the only thing I enjoyed about this film.  Simply put, the rest of the movie was terrible. There was nothing in the movie that was really scary.  As a matter of fact, I wasn't frightened for a second.  Don't get me wrong.  I went to this movie wanting to see a really scary movie, but the film just didn't deliver!  That's really my main problem with this movie, it just isn't scary, and that's what it was pawned off on everyone to be.  Another problem with the movie was the camera work.  Yes, it was cool to present the film as clips from the cameras they we're using, but the camera work was enough to make you sick.  BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE.  It was almost more annoying than it was effective.  Along with the picture bouncing all over creation, I thought the lack of music throughout the movie was a bad idea.  Music adds a great deal to any movie, especially horror movie.My final problem with the movie is the lack of common sense. I know there isn't very much common sense to any horror movie, but let's think about a few thing here.  One, how long can a battery in a video camera last?  Honestly I don't know, but three or four days plus seems to be pushing it without a good re-charging.  Two,  why would you continue to stop and sleep if you know something is after you?  You might as well just walk away from your friends and say, I'll be right back.  I thought most college students were suppose to be smart.  I guess being smart has nothing to do with common sense.  Three, why wouldn't you just follow the that you ran into on five different occasions?  Everyone knows that if you follow water down stream it eventually comes out someplace, and that beats being lost in a woods any day.  The move just didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.In conclusion, this film just didn't do much for me.  It wasn't that scary, and the characters weren't very bright.  For me the only thing that saved the film was the acting!  I can only give it 4 out of 10 stars.  And that's simply for great acting.

After the first viewing, I was in complete awe at the way the events lead up to the final events with Andy. The second time, I realized that the prevalent theme is hope.  The third, then the fourth, then the fifth... etc.... forever, I realized that this movie has so many elements, that a review such as this doesn't provide ample space to discuss them all.I think that what makes this movie so unique, is its portrayal of prison life.  Most of the time, prisons are either romanticized in that they don't portray all of the harsh elements of it.  The other times, the writers try too hard to prove how harsh a prison is.  They portray them as places where the convicts should give up hope because its Hell on Earth until you die, and everybody begs to come out as soon as the parole board gives their say-so. This movie, however, completely illustrates the harsh realities of prison, as well as a place where one learns to hate it, but then gets used to it (as Red said).  Andy made a best friend there.  Had he not gone to prison, he never would've met Red.  Besides, the prisoners (for the most part) seemed to be having a fairly good time most of the time and probably couldn't imagine being anywhere else.Stephen King also brings out an element of crime and punishment.  I find it very ironic that Andy, a fairly good man  is the only one that doesn't give up hope of living on the outside.  I think that one of the most important parts of the movie is when Andy talks about how whatever sins he has committed, has been paid for.  Andy is one of the only ones that doesn't give up hope because he doesn't belong there.One more thing is the way that Andy brings a form of salvation to others.  He makes prison more human.  He gets the guys the beers so that they'll never forget the freedom of the outside world.  In addition, he asks for the name of the fresh fish in the beginning.  As proven by a later movie, Saving Private Ryan, asking what a person's name is seems to prove as a very effective way of humanizing what is actually inhumane.There are a gajillion other themes, but I would exhaust myself trying to explain them all.  So if the thousand of other good reviews on this page don't influence you to watch it, hopefully this will.  The acting is incredible (as a guy, its hard to imagine that a two hour plus movie without an actress is bearable).  I don't think that you can compare this movie with any others because there aren't too many movies that inundate the watcher from the beginning with loads and loads of themes and concepts.  Furthermore, its impressive the way almost every element has some significance.  In the beginning, even the most trivial of details that evade the eye the first time become essential elements in Andy's final scene (in hope not to spoil the ending).But I must warn you.  The first time this movie is good, the second time its better, the third time its addicting.  Don't say that I didn't warn you.  Ten plus out of ten!!!  Thank you IMDB for finally putting this very underrated movie in its rightful place.  ","genre":null},{"date":"2 August 1999","score":"","review":"  This movie has gradually become my favorite.  After the first viewing, I was in complete awe at the way the events lead up to the final events with Andy. The second time, I realized that the prevalent theme is hope.  The third, then the fourth, then the fifth... etc.... forever, I realized that this movie has so many elements, that a review such as this doesn't provide ample space to discuss them all.I think that what makes this movie so unique, is its portrayal of prison life.  Most of the time, prisons are either romanticized in that they don't portray all of the harsh elements of it.  The other times, the writers try too hard to prove how harsh a prison is.  They portray them as places where the convicts should give up hope because its Hell on Earth until you die, and everybody begs to come out as soon as the parole board gives their say-so. This movie, however, completely illustrates the harsh realities of prison, as well as a place where one learns to hate it, but then gets used to it (as Red said).  Andy made a best friend there.

Some people in the theater were disappointed at the ending because the witch or whatever other horror was stalking the film students was never revealed.

Being an avid woods man, I was annoyed with the stupidity of the students and how they handled their situation, but I guess it was necessary in order for the movie to work. Using the 16mm film added an incredible element of realism to the movie. This in my opinion was the movies strongest asset. The movie feels so believable  that many people in the theater actually thought they were watching real, authentic footage. The Blair Witch Project was an interesting movie, and if one allows themselves to become one of the campers and accept what is happening on screen, the movie is pretty darn chilling.

One of the biggest hurdles to producing a good film about the high school experience - which seems to be a bigger factor in determining character to the average American than college - is getting a handle on believability. With so many seemingly overwhelming forces at work (academic demands, budding sexuality, growing peer pressure), teens lead unacknowledged complicated lives. Also, it is the last time many will be truly unique individuals, before society and its media bombardment flatten out the rough edges. American Pie scores on getting it right.Starting with the casting, this is a film where the writers and director have shunned the Hollywood version with every decision they made. Instead of a cast culled from the best looking members of (fill in teen-targeted TV show here), these are the people I went to class with. The central quartet has only one member of better than average looks. Yet Oz (Chris Kline) is so aware of it that it makes him try awkward come-ons only Sean Connery as 007 could pull off. The rest look like any student you could pick at random out of a yearbook. The central character, Jim (Jason Biggs), is the goofiest looking. Which, of course, is what we all thought of ourselves in high school isn't it?The biggest surprise of Pie to the uninitiated will be that it's antecedents turn out to be not Porky's and rip-offs, but The Waltons and Family. The four buddies learn that getting laid by the prom is not what they thought it would be. Each gets a different life lesson as they pursue unlike paths to that common goal. Those lessons give them and the viewer an unexpected warm-fuzzy feeling. In that regard, Pie will be a valuable political instrument for the next year. Say what, Mr Kotter?! Well, anytime you hear some blow-hard going on about decency and family values and decides to hold up American Pie as an example of Hollywood's moral deficiency, you'll instantly know he's full of s***.The only real deficiency is with a storyline centering on the four young men, the young women don't get much to do beyond interaction. Which is a shame, because it wastes the talent of Natasha Lyonne who I could watch for hours longer than the surface-only charm of Shannon Elizabeth's Hustler-loving Czech exhange student. Alyson Hannigan (who does star in one of those TV teen show, but don't hold it against her) is another standout whose brief screen time does make sense for her character's payoff. But this is a movie about four guys (any writers want to pick up that gauntlet and make one about four gals?).Admittedly, everyone's high school experiences are no the same. American Pie's depiction did mirror my own to a degree that surpasses the last benchmark of well-received school days angst, The Breakfast Club. It's a shame the R-rated comedy will turn off many of those bemoaning the lack of films about values and decency because Pie has those qualities proudly. It doesn't hurt it's also one f**king funny movie.
