This is an amazing story, however it doesn't go deep enough into the absolute squaller that most addicts face every day.

I loved sharks, and I loved movies, so sharks in a movie was just the bomb-diggity. For some reason, this mediocre movie has stuck in my head over these past years, coming up in my mind rather often. It's not even that I necessarily payed attention to the story all that much, I mean, I know that there are sharks with mombo sized brains, and they're out to kill the scientists that made them that way, and the one b*tchy scientist lady won't let the guys kill the sharks. I just thought that that was awesome. Deep Blue Sea really is just mindless shark action and a chick in her underwear, with a splash of a great story line. There really is so much potential for such an interesting story, but it was downgraded by the massive amount of unnecessary violence. I, personally, have a great fondness for this film, though I have not seen it since I was 6, so don't hate me if it sucks a lot more than I am leading you to believe. It really is a movie that you should take the time to watch at some point in your life.

Even though Leonard uses a system of Polaroid photos and tattoos to keep track of what he's doing, it's up to him to record whatever he considers important. At the moment of making a snap judgment, if he fails to find a pen, or if he's out of film, or if he just choose to not record the information, then he's out of luck.The movie starts by showing Leonard killing someone, and it is soon hinted that this person might be the killer Leonard was seeking. The movie traces Leonard's steps backwards to try to illustrate the logic Leonard uses in making his decision. In doing so, the movie also recants the story, in chronological order, of Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky), a person who Leonard investigated for insurance fraud and who suffered from the same condition as Leonard does, and how their wives (Leonard's and Sammy's) apparently meet their demise. This happens gradually and for the most part, both stories are very clear cut (which means it's too good to be true). The most damning revelations are made during the final minutes of the film, which illustrates the nature of Leonard's condition, as well as his circular quest (the tag-line gives a major clue some memories are best forgotten).While some people think of the movie as being rather ambiguous, I believe there are enough pointers to solve most issues (just view the movie backwards). For example, Leonard, our protagonist, is allegedly helped by Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who seems like a good person. However, towards the end, she issues a tirade which makes it clear exactly what her real motives are. The final sequences are the most telling, where another person who Leonard isn't supposed to trust, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), tells him what is really happening since he has been with Leonard since the beginning of his quest. Leonard's reaction to Teddy's truth, and a failure to record it, illustrates the motivations behind his actions.The movie's style of telling the story backward is interesting, but I'm beginning to discover that it's really not that hard to tell a story in this manner. Take a few your favorite books (or even this review), reverse all the chapters\/paragraphs, and with a bit of mental filler, you can easily follow the stories in most cases.Director Christopher Nolan has made a memorable film in Memento, which serves as a metaphor for forgetting everything we hold dear when humans embark on a quest and want to succeed at any cost. Don't miss this film. AWESOME!!!PLOT A backwards sequence is shown. It starts with the Polaroid photograph of a dead man. As the sequence plays backwards the photo reverts to its undeveloped state, entering the camera before the man is shot in the head. This is followed by interspersed black-and-white and color sequences, with the black-and-white sequences taking place chronologically before the color sequences.
