And my advice to Sean Cunningham is to either stop making the Friday films all together or get back to the old formula or what was once remembered as a proud franchise that pioneered the horror craze in the 80's is going to sink under it's own ineptitude.

It was the fact that first of all, Jason was scary but moreso he was also very phlegmatic, like Michael Myers was.  He didn't take things personally, he just killed without passion.  He was the ultimate killer.  In the first four films, Jason was nothing more than a boy who had grown up to kill with an insatiable need for blood and corpses.  Now the franchise has gone off on it's own little tangent and subjected Jason to a ridiculous folklore that just doesn't fit with who he was.  Part 9 dropped the ball by inundating us with that stupid special knife story and a sister angle when all of us know damn well that he was an only child.  Face it, unless you are George Lucas, you cannot introduce family members late into a story and get away with it.  So Jason goes to Hell with Freddy bringing him there but now he in space and he decides that he has to kill again and again and again but with no real passion.  There is no stalking in this one, there is no desperation.  All we have is Jason rounding a few corners and killing the next person that no one cares about.  At least in the earlier ones we knew a little bit about who he was killing.  Think Tommy Jarvis, think Shelly, think of Chris, think of Ginny and Paul and Rick and so on.  There was at least a bit of character development to the people that Jason was slaughtering.  There was also a legend and most of all there was atmosphere.

Someone else commented that all of a sudden the film became interesting again when he was there.

Episode I, however, is a different story. The first time I watched it, I knew there were big problems, and with subsequent viewings--including the Fox broadcast just last night--I felt compelled to lay down my thoughts about why I disliked it. I don't want to be just some inarticulate naysayer; I want to give real reasons and justification, not to make people angry, but explain WHY. With that said, on with the show. P.S. I don't think I have included any spoilers, except for people who've closed their eyes and covered their ears to the first three films and the ads for the movies.We'll start with the cornball humor and its greatest avatar in the film, Jar Jar Binks. Decked out looking kinda like a snail with dreadlocks, Ahmed Best is at his worst as he makes three-year-olds titter and most others shake their heads. In the first trilogy, the comic relief was mostly from C3PO and his interactions with the characters, especially R2D2. I NEVER feel embarrassed watching the films as an adult when he's on the screen. However, Jar Jar is in a class of @$$ all his own, spewing Stephanie Tanner one-liners like How rude! when he should be saying Meesa bad character! C'mon, the Ewoks were NEVER this bad.But Jar Jar is not alone in the insanely lame-o humor. Mr. Lucas includes the Godawful two-headed Pod Race Announcer, whose silly voice destroys a good measure of the film's credibility. Boss Nass' lip-vibrating gurgles are equally nauseating, as well as all the lines Anakin employs in his starship ride, thrown in, I'm sure, to be cute. And no one, I mean NO ONE, should call ever Anakin Annie unless he's wearin a flippin' curly orange wig and saying Leapin' lizards! Watto, too, was misappropriate, the tubby flying alien nothing more than another excuse for Lucas to show how much money he has. If this is torture, fire me from the feelm!Next were the special effects. I'm not saying they were bad--actually, far from it. The problem was, they were EVERYWHERE. Now before you discount me as some neophobe, opposed to technology, I'll tell you what I mean. The original trilogy had great special effects for their time, effects that still hold up today. But they didn't inundate EVERY single second of EVERY single scene. When they did occur, they were SPECIAL. But in Episode I, EVERYTHING is a special effect. You can't have Obi-Wan tie his shoe without at least 10 CGI shots in the frame at all times. The Gungans live in a city that looks like God's chandelier, and they live on Naboo, a dinky little world in a far corner of the universe, in a SWAMP. George Lucas must have known his first trilogy couldn't jibe with the elaborately effects-laden flick he had in store, urging him to mangle them into those Special Editions where not but confusing and, actually, detrimental footage was added. Sy Snootles' song in Return of the Jedi is not only pointless, it made a once good film embarrassing. Making Greedo shoot first in A New Hope was just bewildering, and giving the Sarlacc in Jedi a beak just looked silly. In his lust for luster, Lucas constantly reinvented the phrase gilding the lily.The acting, of course, cannot be overlooked. I know, as another commentor put it, that the Star Wars are not supposed to have Oscar-caliber acting. But the original trilogy's acting, even at its worst, wasn't really bad at all. Han Solo's devil-may-care lack of emotion fit his character, and I never cringed when look whined about being unable to go pick up some power convertors. Despite the big talents brought into Phantom Menace, though, you have to agree after watching it that acting was secondary. Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan dealt quite stoically and dryly with almost being murderer and discovering Anakin's potential, and Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu's only emotion ever shown was exhausted disdain for testing Anakin. Jake Lloyd as Anakin was especially awful, his whoo-hoo!s and this is tense!s lacking any real emotion. I'm not slave! My name is Anakin!, his indignant insisting to Padme, was delivered poorly as well. I know he's a kid, but he's also being paid to be an ACTOR.Ewan MacGregor as Obi-Wan wasn't much better. Like Liam Neeson he seemed to, as my friend calls it, been resting on his laurels. People know he's a good actor, so he just decided to let the Star Wars name and effects carry the picture, spending most of his screen time either in either tight-lipped neutrality or tight-lipped disapproval until his smoldering rage near the end. Top draws on worst actor, though, must go to Natalie Portman, who for some reason absorbed an English accent to play utter ice-princess Queen Amidala. It was incredible! Amidala had only two moods indifferent, and LETHARGICALLY indifferent. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. I guess I care.A few plotholes also appeared in Phantom Menace. In Empire Strikes Back, the spirit of Obi-Wan mentions that Yoda trained him. I guess George fast-forwarded through that part, though, because in Menace it is Qui-Gonn Jinn who serves as his dashing mentor. Oops. And how about these midi-chlorians that represent the Force were also a silly plot device. No mention of them that I could remember occured in the original trilogy, and the fact that such an ethereal power as the Force is linked to little microscopic organisms ruined some of the awe and mystic surrounding the Force.While not really a plot hole, it was also strange that the Jedi Counsel of Coruscant were such cold jerks to Anakin and Qui-Gonn, wasn't it? I mean Yoda said that the Force binds and penetrates all the universe, that it is the Jedi's guide and a benevolent kind of ubiquitous energy. But the Jedi Counsel seem more bound to sitting in his comfy chairs and sanctimoniously crushing the hopes of potential candidates for knighthood. If they're so wise and good, why do they act like exasperated cranks? No wonder Vader wipes them out. And what about Obi-Wan's angry outburst near the end? I thought that was the path to the Dark Side.A few parting gripes are the silly as heck Amidala costumes that no one else on her planet seems to emulate in the least, the fact that there are barely any real fights save the end one, the stupid accents for every aliens (those Trade Federation guys-arggh!), and the superfluously ludicrous names of some of the characters. I can accept Luke Skywalker, Bibs Fortuna, and even Lando Calrissian, but in Episode I it seemed like George was just trying to ten-up himself. I mean Ki-Adi-Mundi? Rune Haako? Nute Gunray? How long until Episode II introduces Okie-From-Muskogie and Sqwilo Toothflake?Once again, I don't want to anger anyone, but merely express my disdain with the film in a reasonable light.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"9 May 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  First off, I'm a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, so I'm not some jerk who just hates everything about it and is just engaging in a rant about the new one. Episode I, however, is a different story. The first time I watched it, I knew there were big problems, and with subsequent viewings--including the Fox broadcast just last night--I felt compelled to lay down my thoughts about why I disliked it. I don't want to be just some inarticulate naysayer; I want to give real reasons and justification, not to make people angry, but explain WHY. With that said, on with the show. P.S. I don't think I have included any spoilers, except for people who've closed their eyes and covered their ears to the first three films and the ads for the movies.We'll start with the cornball humor and its greatest avatar in the film, Jar Jar Binks. Decked out looking kinda like a snail with dreadlocks, Ahmed Best is at his worst as he makes three-year-olds titter and most others shake their heads. In the first trilogy, the comic relief was mostly from C3PO and his interactions with the characters, especially R2D2. I NEVER feel embarrassed watching the films as an adult when he's on the screen. However, Jar Jar is in a class of @$$ all his own, spewing Stephanie Tanner one-liners like How rude! when he should be saying Meesa bad character! C'mon, the Ewoks were NEVER this bad.But Jar Jar is not alone in the insanely lame-o humor. Mr. Lucas includes the Godawful two-headed Pod Race Announcer, whose silly voice destroys a good measure of the film's credibility. Boss Nass' lip-vibrating gurgles are equally nauseating, as well as all the lines Anakin employs in his starship ride, thrown in, I'm sure, to be cute. And no one, I mean NO ONE, should call ever Anakin Annie unless he's wearin a flippin' curly orange wig and saying Leapin' lizards! Watto, too, was misappropriate, the tubby flying alien nothing more than another excuse for Lucas to show how much money he has. If this is torture, fire me from the feelm!Next were the special effects. I'm not saying they were bad--actually, far from it. The problem was, they were EVERYWHERE. Now before you discount me as some neophobe, opposed to technology, I'll tell you what I mean. The original trilogy had great special effects for their time, effects that still hold up today. But they didn't inundate EVERY single second of EVERY single scene. When they did occur, they were SPECIAL. But in Episode I, EVERYTHING is a special effect. You can't have Obi-Wan tie his shoe without at least 10 CGI shots in the frame at all times. The Gungans live in a city that looks like God's chandelier, and they live on Naboo, a dinky little world in a far corner of the universe, in a SWAMP. George Lucas must have known his first trilogy couldn't jibe with the elaborately effects-laden flick he had in store, urging him to mangle them into those Special Editions where not but confusing and, actually, detrimental footage was added. Sy Snootles' song in Return of the Jedi is not only pointless, it made a once good film embarrassing. Making Greedo shoot first in A New Hope was just bewildering, and giving the Sarlacc in Jedi a beak just looked silly. In his lust for luster, Lucas constantly reinvented the phrase gilding the lily.The acting, of course, cannot be overlooked. I know, as another commentor put it, that the Star Wars are not supposed to have Oscar-caliber acting. But the original trilogy's acting, even at its worst, wasn't really bad at all. Han Solo's devil-may-care lack of emotion fit his character, and I never cringed when look whined about being unable to go pick up some power convertors. Despite the big talents brought into Phantom Menace, though, you have to agree after watching it that acting was secondary.

It basically looks like a Fullmoon direct-to-video flick, but with a higher budget than any fullmoon film.

And get this, it takes place in space. Ok, you already knew that and so didn't I going into the movie.

I went and was expecting what I saw in the trailer, a roller coaster, horror cheese fest. Was I wrong though about it being somewhat decent. There is no suspense or thrills, like in the other Friday the 13ths, in this flick and the dialogue is dry and utter nonsense.  Its ok guys he just wanted his machete back. UGH!!!

The people who do like the movie are going on like it's gods gift to drugs. The people who don't like the movie are saying it didn't have a point and everything was bad. May I please enlighten you. First of all, Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro went out and did their homework, they read the book a million times and went out and got drunk together many times, they talked to Hunter S. Thompson and Oscar Zeta Acostas family. Terry Gilliam was, and always will be, the only director in the world who could've do this movie. It's also important to realize that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas(FLLV) is non-fiction, and there is no way in hell Hunter S. Thompson didn't bend the truth a little bit, so if the movies differs from the book it's no crime. The point of FLLV is not simple. The movie is not a comedy, it's more like a drama. It's not about a race in the desert, it's not about doing drugs, it's not about Cheech and Chong. It's an incredible representation of what was going on in the world. Proof of the chaos that can come and go on right under our noses. Did you notice that no one really tried to stop them, the state trooper let him off with a warning. It's funny that the narration says, This is what the whole world would be doing in the Nazi's had won the war. That WAS what the whole world was doing when the Nazi's hadn't won the war.

As others have pointed out, one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient. If you have the DVD of MD, you can cheat by looking at David Lynch's Top 10 Hints to Unlocking MD (but only upon second or third viewing, please.) ;)First of all, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. Not often are the comments on the DVDs very accurate, but Vogue's It gets inside your head and stays there really hit the mark.David Lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it - cinematography-wise, has great   acting (esp. Naomi Watts), a haunting soundtrack by Badalamenti, and a very dream-like quality to it -- but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (After all, when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?)Allright, enough about all that, it's time to justify those statements.Most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion\/a dream sequence.Of course, that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting traditional methods in which the story is laid out in a timely, logic and linear manner for the viewer. But for those expecting that, I urge you to check the name of the director and come back again. ;)MD is the story of the sad demise of Diane Selwyn, a wannabe-actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career, and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations. Upon realizing that Camilla will never be hers (C. becomes engaged with Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a hitman to get rid of her, and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces.The movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is some 50s dance\/jitterbug contest, in which we can see the main character Betty giving a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the movie) together with her, and applauding her.No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they view it. There's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving into an object (although blurry) and the scene quickly fading out. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream.The main characters seen in the first half of the movieBetty Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the dream-sequence - a positive portrayal of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of Diane). 'Betty' was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at Winkies. Notice that in the dream version, the waitresses' name is 'Diane'.Rita The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes that, through Diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car-accident, is turned into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then conveniently placed in Betty\/Diane's aunt's luxurious home which Betty has been allowed to stay in.Coco In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex that Betty stays in. She's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film.Adam The director. We know from the second half that he gets engaged with Camilla. His sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for Betty\/Diane, since she develops such hatred towards him.Aunt Ruth Diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she is actually dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for Camilla's murder.Mr. Roach A typical Lynchian character. Not real; appears only in Diane's dream sequence. He's a mysterious, influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair. He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks.The hitman The person that murders Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence (more on that below).Now, having established the various versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to delve into the plot. Of course I will not go into every little detail (neither will I lay it out chronologically), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to Lynch' hint-sheet.As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very intriguing with MD, is that Lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't. I've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo.Only one of the cars actually hit the limo; what about the other? Even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves, wouldn't they try to help the others, or at least call for help? My theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is just set aside, and forgotten about. Since, as Rogert Ebert so eloquently puts it Like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines.Shortly after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Mulholland Dr., and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away, staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera. This is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare.Although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to Betty, I think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). Perhaps she didn't know them all that well, and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and Diane's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life.A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman. Diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept Camilla's part in the movie (from Adam's party in the second half of the movie), and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of Camilla, a part of her wants him to miss, so she turns him into a dumb criminal.This scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt at totally screwing his audience over, since they're given a false pretence in which to view the movie.Gotta love that 'Something just bit me bad' line, though. )The next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at Twinkies, who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in. After a little talk, they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence, accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene.When reaching the corner, a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner, scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder. So, in short, her obessions translate into that poor guy's nightmares. The bum also signifies Diane's evil side, as can be witnessed later in the movie.The Cowboy constitutes (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchian landscape -- Diane only saw him for a short while at Adam's party, but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams, so can he be awarded an important part in her dream. We are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.)The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director, when he meets up with him at the odd location (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he (Adam) does good, or two more times if he does bad. Throughout the movie he appears two more times, indicating to Diane that she did bad. He is also the one to wake her up to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice), and shortly thereafter she commits suicide.The espresso-scene with the Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, as Luigi) is probably a result of the fact that Diane was having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement at Adam's party in the second half. It could at the same time also be a statement from Lynch.During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying in the bed is Camilla, but notice how she's assumed Diane's sleeping position; Diane is seeing herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although it had the same wounds on the face as Diane would have after shooting herself. This scene is also filled with some genuine Lynchian creepiness. Since Diane did not know where (or when) the hitman would get to Camilla and finish her off, she just put her into her own home.In real life, Diane's audition for the movie part was bad. In her dream, she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance.Also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for Camilla's murder now appears in Rita\/Camilla's purse. This is part of Diane's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back, as the murder now hasn't taken place.When her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, yet later when Camilla and Betty have their encounter on the couch, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table, suggesting that Betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy.The catch phrase of the movie Adam is auditioning actresses for is She is the girl; which are the exact same words that Diane uses when giving the hitman Camilla's photo resume.The blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie, and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. There's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent Diane's future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a Pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). Either way, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place). The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum.Club Silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s\/he is viewing is not real. It also signifies that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from, even in her dreams).During the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear, Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears.Anyway, that is my $0.02. Hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie ever' or something to that effect, without realizing the plot.As usual, Lynch is all about creating irrational fears, and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well.10 out of 10.

Upon realizing that Camilla will never be hers (C. becomes engaged with Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a hitman to get rid of her, and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces.The movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is some 50s dance\/jitterbug contest, in which we can see the main character Betty giving a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the movie) together with her, and applauding her.No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they view it. There's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving into an object (although blurry) and the scene quickly fading out. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream.The main characters seen in the first half of the movieBetty Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the dream-sequence - a positive portrayal of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of Diane). 'Betty' was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at Winkies. Notice that in the dream version, the waitresses' name is 'Diane'.Rita The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes that, through Diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car-accident, is turned into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then conveniently placed in Betty\/Diane's aunt's luxurious home which Betty has been allowed to stay in.Coco In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex that Betty stays in. She's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film.Adam The director. We know from the second half that he gets engaged with Camilla. His sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for Betty\/Diane, since she develops such hatred towards him.Aunt Ruth Diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she is actually dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for Camilla's murder.Mr. Roach A typical Lynchian character. Not real; appears only in Diane's dream sequence. He's a mysterious, influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair. He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks.The hitman The person that murders Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence (more on that below).Now, having established the various versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to delve into the plot. Of course I will not go into every little detail (neither will I lay it out chronologically), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to Lynch' hint-sheet.As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very intriguing with MD, is that Lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't. I've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo.Only one of the cars actually hit the limo; what about the other? Even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves, wouldn't they try to help the others, or at least call for help? My theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is just set aside, and forgotten about. Since, as Rogert Ebert so eloquently puts it Like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines.Shortly after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Mulholland Dr., and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away, staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera. This is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare.Although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to Betty, I think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). Perhaps she didn't know them all that well, and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and Diane's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life.A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman. Diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept Camilla's part in the movie (from Adam's party in the second half of the movie), and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of Camilla, a part of her wants him to miss, so she turns him into a dumb criminal.This scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt at totally screwing his audience over, since they're given a false pretence in which to view the movie.Gotta love that 'Something just bit me bad' line, though. )The next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at Twinkies, who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in. After a little talk, they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence, accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene.When reaching the corner, a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner, scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder. So, in short, her obessions translate into that poor guy's nightmares. The bum also signifies Diane's evil side, as can be witnessed later in the movie.The Cowboy constitutes (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchian landscape -- Diane only saw him for a short while at Adam's party, but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams, so can he be awarded an important part in her dream. We are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.)The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director, when he meets up with him at the odd location (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he (Adam) does good, or two more times if he does bad. Throughout the movie he appears two more times, indicating to Diane that she did bad. He is also the one to wake her up to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice), and shortly thereafter she commits suicide.The espresso-scene with the Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, as Luigi) is probably a result of the fact that Diane was having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement at Adam's party in the second half. It could at the same time also be a statement from Lynch.During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying in the bed is Camilla, but notice how she's assumed Diane's sleeping position; Diane is seeing herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although it had the same wounds on the face as Diane would have after shooting herself. This scene is also filled with some genuine Lynchian creepiness. Since Diane did not know where (or when) the hitman would get to Camilla and finish her off, she just put her into her own home.In real life, Diane's audition for the movie part was bad. In her dream, she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance.Also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for Camilla's murder now appears in Rita\/Camilla's purse. This is part of Diane's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back, as the murder now hasn't taken place.When her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, yet later when Camilla and Betty have their encounter on the couch, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table, suggesting that Betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy.The catch phrase of the movie Adam is auditioning actresses for is She is the girl; which are the exact same words that Diane uses when giving the hitman Camilla's photo resume.The blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie, and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. There's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent Diane's future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a Pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). Either way, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place). The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum.Club Silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s\/he is viewing is not real. It also signifies that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from, even in her dreams).During the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear, Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears.Anyway, that is my $0.02. Hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie ever' or something to that effect, without realizing the plot.As usual, Lynch is all about creating irrational fears, and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well.10 out of 10.

As others have pointed out, one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient. If you have the DVD of MD, you can cheat by looking at David Lynch's Top 10 Hints to Unlocking MD (but only upon second or third viewing, please.) ;)First of all, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. Not often are the comments on the DVDs very accurate, but Vogue's It gets inside your head and stays there really hit the mark.David Lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it - cinematography-wise, has great   acting (esp. Naomi Watts), a haunting soundtrack by Badalamenti, and a very dream-like quality to it -- but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (After all, when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?)Allright, enough about all that, it's time to justify those statements.Most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion\/a dream sequence.Of course, that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting traditional methods in which the story is laid out in a timely, logic and linear manner for the viewer.

I like both Travolta and Vaughn, so I thought I'd be OK.  Although it did at least pass my first test of movie engagement - that I care about what happens to one or more of the characters - I found quickly that I was disappointed in having to suspend disbelief to the extent the writers asked me to.  My companion was bothered when I became vocal with my objections to the weak plot, early on.  She chided me, pointing out that it's just a movie (never an acceptable excuse for me) and that things like this could happen in real life.  For her sake, I did my best to hold back, but it wasn't easy.  Suspending disbelief is one thing.  Ignoring gaping holes in the plot is another.The complete incompetence of the police department is by the far the most objectionable component of the impossible-to-swallow story line.  How quick they are to dismiss serious accusations of wrongdoing, how unbelievable in there unwillingness to even perform a simple background check on a potential murderer, how unprofessional in not employing routine forensic tools to search for evidence (they find no sign of wrongdoing in Vaughn's vehicle? Come on.).  It just made me angry.  There are plenty of other examples of poor writing, but they've already been pointed out (as has the police piece, but I just couldn't resist).Furthermore, I never bought the relationship between Vaughn and Travolta's ex-wife.

As such, her role in the plot quickly becomes inconsequential and superficial.I must admit reluctantly, though, that I did feel compelled to watch it all the way through.

Yes, the movie was successful in creating suspense, and both Travolta and Vaughn contributed to the sense of desperation that the writers clearly wanted to create.

For me that means it better be `ready for prime time', or I've wasted my time. Because I had no preconceptions about it and hadn't read any reviews, I was ready to give it a fair chance.  I like both Travolta and Vaughn, so I thought I'd be OK.  Although it did at least pass my first test of movie engagement - that I care about what happens to one or more of the characters - I found quickly that I was disappointed in having to suspend disbelief to the extent the writers asked me to.  My companion was bothered when I became vocal with my objections to the weak plot, early on.  She chided me, pointing out that it's just a movie (never an acceptable excuse for me) and that things like this could happen in real life.  For her sake, I did my best to hold back, but it wasn't easy.  Suspending disbelief is one thing.  Ignoring gaping holes in the plot is another.The complete incompetence of the police department is by the far the most objectionable component of the impossible-to-swallow story line.  How quick they are to dismiss serious accusations of wrongdoing, how unbelievable in there unwillingness to even perform a simple background check on a potential murderer, how unprofessional in not employing routine forensic tools to search for evidence (they find no sign of wrongdoing in Vaughn's vehicle? Come on.).  It just made me angry.  There are plenty of other examples of poor writing, but they've already been pointed out (as has the police piece, but I just couldn't resist).Furthermore, I never bought the relationship between Vaughn and Travolta's ex-wife.  Vaughn's character is so obviously shifty (and dangerous) that it's impossible to believe his new bride incapable of sensing anything wrong with him.  It's an insult to her character.  She only comes to her senses when the evidence slaps her in the face (which qualifies her to join the local police force, I suspect).  As such, her role in the plot quickly becomes inconsequential and superficial.I must admit reluctantly, though, that I did feel compelled to watch it all the way through.  Yes, I did care what ultimately happened to the characters (both good and bad).

The chief selling point is, of course, the special effects and relentless pace of the action that completely overwhelm the thin script and reduces much of the film to being something like a ride at a major studio theme park.Luckily we are treated to some wonderful acting moments by Tobey Maguire, but there is no acting at all when he's replaced by a CGI Spiderman. It's a shame, really. Christopher Reeve and Micahel Keaton at least got to act when in costume.William Dafoe is always a great actor to watch. (I initially had hoped that he would play The Joker in the original Batman film -- and I stand by my opinion that he would have done as good or better job than Nicholson.) The problem here, of course, is not a CGI issue, it's that you can't see his face behind the Goblin's rigid mask.The woman who played Aunt May was very good. Uncle Ben's part was way too syrup-y with heavy implications. I didn't know the story, and yet I could tell almost instantly that their conversation in the car was the fateful last conversation they'll ever have which shall cause emotional angst for Peter. Other performances ranged from good to mediocre.It's my personal opinion that the superhero genre is being milked by the studios because of their instant revenue via eye-popping effects, not because they make outstanding films.  Superman is still the best example of a superhero film that actually had a really good *story* to tell... but that was made back in the days when actors didn't have to compete with special effects.  If Superman had been made today, it would probably would have featured acting and writing on the scale of the Lois & Clark TV series with CGI battles and effects making up more than 50% of the film.  I suspect we won't see any more good superhero films until some studio has the balls to do Watchmen.  But hey, maybe that's why Watchmen hasn't been made yet -- so much story that it's hard to condense properly into a 2-hour film.Forget the standard 4-star ratings systems these days.  That doesn't provide any useful context in today's movie-going reality.  Here's a better systemWorth seeing at full price, worth seeing at matinee price, wait for video\/DVD, or don't bother even renting it.This movie rates between matinee price and wait for video.
