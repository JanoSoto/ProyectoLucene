I had heard about the O Captain! My Captain! thing and knew it was a very popular film, but what I wasn't prepared for was how deeply emotional it is, and how much it resonates with the passing of Williams. This is a movie that although could be described as trying too hard for emotion, still just makes you want to smile, you want these boys to break out of their closed off traditional world and do what they want to do in life.The story is about an elite prep boarding school and its students, where some are being worked hard as they await the day they enter college. But in comes Mr Keating, a new English teacher who's ways don't exactly impress the hard up parents and teachers, who's values are very much the underpinning of what the young students despise. The story has its ways of making Williams just great to watch; the young guys who act here work well alongside him and make this a movie that has no central character, but a central story to share.Directed by Peter Weir, the movie is not all about Robin Williams and the famous scenes that are involved. In fact Weir gives just a fine performance as any other, his directing is finely done and he knows how to control the emotion of the film so that it isn't always one tone. Tom Schulman whose experiences inspired this movie, creates a beautiful script, in fact I am not quite sure if is Weir or Schulman who make this special, but in any case both are on great form. The rest of the cast pitch in well too, a young Ethan Hawke as the painfully shy Todd is OK, I am not sure if he is good but in any case his more emotional side is fascinating when done. Josh Charles as Knox is also good and the other boys involved such as Robert Sean Leonard are good also. I found if any part of the movie stops this from utter perfection, then the acting is what it is, by no means bad but sometimes a little over the top. As for Williams's nomination for an Academy Award, well maybe I agree, I mean his acting is great here and although I've seen some criticise his comic side coming out here, I for one don't think it was a bad thing.When you get a film that just makes you think, you know it is fairly special, but one that adds into it emotion too, then it starts to become sublime. This film knows how to challenge perception, and even though this is set in 1959 and made in 1989, the ideas that Keating uses are still inspirational today, and the way in which he talks about poetry can at times be most beautiful. I think again a lot of praise goes to Schulman for creating a script that can mean a lot to someone, watch this at just the right age and this could blow your mind, it really could.Is it for everyone? well it should be, a movie I would highly recommend to someone even if they don't usually like this kind of movie, simply because of the thought process involved. It isn't even too long, I felt maybe for it to one of the best ever, it had to maybe have had an even better ending than it already does, which is a really fine ending by the way. It should keep you gripped throughout, it never made me feel bored or like I had better things to do, it was a rare movie that spoke to me and opened my mind as I feel the people behind this wanted it to do.

My favorite scene is where Hepburn tells him that he will get back up on that horse and together they will go go go. The movie models not only Norman's battle with imminent death and his terror of it, but also the hidden story, to be a caregiver of the dying. She is such a fortress of strength to him; he draws so much solace and comfort within her loving arms.

The hardest thing for the old and dying is what you hear Billy Jr. say,He creeps me out, what if he dies? The ones I cared for, all their friends and family flee from them. They carry death now, and no one but no one wants to be near death. Rydell puts plenty of humor in this sad film. Do not run away from it, it is not the depressing Going In Style from the 70s. The movie has great warmth, love and deals with a subject most repressed within our hedonistic culture death. It shows you, within its cute little story, how to care for a dying loved one. Ethel is patient with his fury towards everyone and everything about him, even the mail man. Fonda will surprise you with his comic ability. A dentist huh, want to see my teeth? Rydell works hard to put lots of great funny dialog mainly from grumpy old Norman's mouth. There is wonderful symbolism with the loons. The two together like Ethel and Norman.

This is what Ethel tries to explain, futilely, to Chelsea, underneath all that fear is a very good, loving man. She just cannot see him through the covering of terror of approaching death. Yes, it is sentimental, but as someone who took care of three people, all dead now, I can tell you it depicts this part of life very well. Two of the three had dementias and Norman's terror at his fading mind is not maudlin. I love the movie, despite all its flaws, because it models the hardest of all the duties of love hanging on when you will want to flee. Ethel stays with Norman, this is the depth of her love for him. The flight of everyone from them is the hardest for them to bear, nobody calls or visits anymore. Ethel is all he has, Norman clings to her and she makes the path much less dark.

Yet shockingly this movie isn't about Jones being an unstoppable tough guy, it kinda is him being a tough guy though, just not the dialog free tough guy he usually is. In this remake of US movie 'The Longest Yard' Jones plays the main role which does actually require some genuine acting on his part. Not a great deal of course, lets not get carried away here, but some emotion is required and displayed.The plot is a simple one, Danny Meehan is a top football (soccer) player fallen from grace. Done for match fixing, then caught drink driving, followed by an assault on two police officers. In prison he makes friends and enemies as you would expect, but its the prison guards and warden who are the real problem unsurprisingly. So to fix this solution, Meehan manages to organise himself as a coach for the inmates, so they can have a match against the guards, because that's just what you do in these types of situations. The perfect way to defuse all hostilities amongst everyone, problem solved. I mean honesty...what could go wrong?I think its pretty obvious not to expect a classy emotional drama here, this isn't award winning stuff. However, I do think its obvious to expect every single tiny prison cliché in the prison movie book. For starters Jones is pretty much playing himself here, when he played professional footie he was of course the tough nut (the Brit footie fans will be well aware of this), and here he plays a tough nut footballer, with a slice of emotion, but essentially its just Vinnie Jones. The prison is your standard British board and lodgings, typically looks a bit old school, almost like going to a boarding school of sorts, not that I know about that. The guards are of course a mean, abusive bunch, the gov is corrupt, and you have the stereotypical array of prisoners. The happy-go-lucky guy, the rasta type guy, the nut job, the psycho, the fat Middle Eastern guy, the wise old Irishman, and the head honcho with his personal enforcers. Needless to say its kinda obvious who does what, who says what, who gets beaten, who gets done in and what happens every step of the way.The cast are the shining light here though, its like putting a Guy Ritchie flick, a Matthew Vaughn flick and a Nick Love flick in a blender, and this is the result. You have virtually everyone from British comedy, film and drama here, Jason Statham (with more hair!), Danny Dyer, Ralph Brown, Vas Blackwood, Robbie Gee, Geoff Bell, Jason Flemyng and Omid Djalili. You're literately only missing Tamer Hassan, Dexter Fletcher, Frank Harper and Alan Ford for a full house. I don't even have to explain the characters they play, you can pretty much guess, Geof Bell is obviously a nasty guard, Brown is the head warden and the rest are a colourful collection of cockney inmates (what else).Its the films mood that swings from one extreme to the other and confuses you. Naturally the film isn't a serious drama, but it does have moments of realism that aren't anything to laugh at, nothing horrific or gory, but emotional and at times slightly cold. Again this does tie in with other Brit flicks by the directors I've mentioned, the movie has that edgy, twitchy side to it where you know anything could happen and it could be nasty. Yet at the same time its almost like a farce or spoof at times, with slapstick comedy, some characters are mischievous buffoons. Take Statham's supposed maniac character, he looks the part and for most of the movie you think he will do something violent, but he ends up being part of the comedic relief. On the other hand, one inmate character called Nitro clearly starts off as a bit of comedic relief, but towards the end he becomes a scary, dangerous and intense character. This guy seemed like he belonged in a Daniel Day-Lewis drama.A definite roller-coaster for your emotions which kinda works at times, ultimately feels very British (duh) and also kinda cheap looking. Nothing special to offer, nothing really new, but it does fit snugly into that now well known British cockney geezer flick genre, made famous by Guy Ritchie. So if you like that kinda thing then I'm sure you'll get a kick outta this (pun intended). It just about does enough to keep engaged...mainly to see Jones acting skills, and maybe the odd cameo by the odd ex-footie players. Bizarrely the director actually tries to portray Jones as some sort of super skilled ex-footie star in this movie, he does realise actual British football fans will probably watch this right?5.5.\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 August 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of Vinnie Jones early performances where the world had not yet tired of his gritty, cockney, tough guy act.

Bizarrely the director actually tries to portray Jones as some sort of super skilled ex-footie star in this movie, he does realise actual British football fans will probably watch this right?5.5.\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport"},{"date":"7 August 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of Vinnie Jones early performances where the world had not yet tired of his gritty, cockney, tough guy act. Yet shockingly this movie isn't about Jones being an unstoppable tough guy, it kinda is him being a tough guy though, just not the dialog free tough guy he usually is. In this remake of US movie 'The Longest Yard' Jones plays the main role which does actually require some genuine acting on his part. Not a great deal of course, lets not get carried away here, but some emotion is required and displayed.The plot is a simple one, Danny Meehan is a top football (soccer) player fallen from grace. Done for match fixing, then caught drink driving, followed by an assault on two police officers. In prison he makes friends and enemies as you would expect, but its the prison guards and warden who are the real problem unsurprisingly. So to fix this solution, Meehan manages to organise himself as a coach for the inmates, so they can have a match against the guards, because that's just what you do in these types of situations. The perfect way to defuse all hostilities amongst everyone, problem solved. I mean honesty...what could go wrong?I think its pretty obvious not to expect a classy emotional drama here, this isn't award winning stuff. However, I do think its obvious to expect every single tiny prison cliché in the prison movie book. For starters Jones is pretty much playing himself here, when he played professional footie he was of course the tough nut (the Brit footie fans will be well aware of this), and here he plays a tough nut footballer, with a slice of emotion, but essentially its just Vinnie Jones. The prison is your standard British board and lodgings, typically looks a bit old school, almost like going to a boarding school of sorts, not that I know about that. The guards are of course a mean, abusive bunch, the gov is corrupt, and you have the stereotypical array of prisoners. The happy-go-lucky guy, the rasta type guy, the nut job, the psycho, the fat Middle Eastern guy, the wise old Irishman, and the head honcho with his personal enforcers. Needless to say its kinda obvious who does what, who says what, who gets beaten, who gets done in and what happens every step of the way.The cast are the shining light here though, its like putting a Guy Ritchie flick, a Matthew Vaughn flick and a Nick Love flick in a blender, and this is the result. You have virtually everyone from British comedy, film and drama here, Jason Statham (with more hair!), Danny Dyer, Ralph Brown, Vas Blackwood, Robbie Gee, Geoff Bell, Jason Flemyng and Omid Djalili. You're literately only missing Tamer Hassan, Dexter Fletcher, Frank Harper and Alan Ford for a full house. I don't even have to explain the characters they play, you can pretty much guess, Geof Bell is obviously a nasty guard, Brown is the head warden and the rest are a colourful collection of cockney inmates (what else).Its the films mood that swings from one extreme to the other and confuses you. Naturally the film isn't a serious drama, but it does have moments of realism that aren't anything to laugh at, nothing horrific or gory, but emotional and at times slightly cold. Again this does tie in with other Brit flicks by the directors I've mentioned, the movie has that edgy, twitchy side to it where you know anything could happen and it could be nasty. Yet at the same time its almost like a farce or spoof at times, with slapstick comedy, some characters are mischievous buffoons. Take Statham's supposed maniac character, he looks the part and for most of the movie you think he will do something violent, but he ends up being part of the comedic relief. On the other hand, one inmate character called Nitro clearly starts off as a bit of comedic relief, but towards the end he becomes a scary, dangerous and intense character. This guy seemed like he belonged in a Daniel Day-Lewis drama.A definite roller-coaster for your emotions which kinda works at times, ultimately feels very British (duh) and also kinda cheap looking. Nothing special to offer, nothing really new, but it does fit snugly into that now well known British cockney geezer flick genre, made famous by Guy Ritchie. So if you like that kinda thing then I'm sure you'll get a kick outta this (pun intended). It just about does enough to keep engaged...mainly to see Jones acting skills, and maybe the odd cameo by the odd ex-footie players. Bizarrely the director actually tries to portray Jones as some sort of super skilled ex-footie star in this movie, he does realise actual British football fans will probably watch this right?5.5.\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport"},{"date":"7 August 2015","score":"","review":" A number of scenes in the first half of this film left me wondering, What the hell did I just watch? I was wondering whether I was supposed to laugh or not. If a scene ended violently I guess it was meant as serious&#x85;*shoulder shrug*.In fact, there was something odd about the entire tone of the film and it dawned on me after a while Dances with Wolves feels like a kids movie. Whether that feel was intended or not is unclear, especially considering all the blood and violence, but the movie definitely has the feel of an adventure for kids. There is a subplot with befriending a wolf and another one about a loyal horse. This movie features farts, some slapstick and I swear at one point I heard a bouncing noise like in a Hanna-Barbera cartoon&#x85;but then someone had their scalp removed.Throughout the film, the main character is narrating his experiences on the frontier and his style of narration as well as the wording sounds like that of a curious child discovering the world.While there are a few scenes that drag on for too long or seem unnecessary all-together, overall this movie is interesting and well-paced. At almost 4 hours long, it does not feel too long because the story works. Intelligently, bits of story are introduced that do not resolve right away thereby making you want to keep watching to see how those seeds will grow. The movie gets better as it goes on and as you get more attached to its characters.There is another minor complaint the film attempts to be respectful to Native Americans, but a number of elements in the story damages the integrity of that respect. The natives who are friendly to the immigrants are portrayed as good. The natives who attack the whites are bad savages. The main character tries to train a wolf to eat from his hand and I cannot tell if this is intended or unintended symbolism but it sure is not a pleasant one. There is a white woman living amongst the natives (Mary McDonnell) because she was supposedly adopted, but was this character written into the movie to act as the English translator for the main hero or was this just another way of ensuring that the main hero's romantic interest is a relatable white actress. As always, the two main heroes are a white western couple. This is still a Hollywood movie.Kevin Kostner's main character is perhaps least interesting as he is the most wooden. His face is frozen in the expression of confusion for much of the movie. This performance fits the story as the character is mostly alone and remains cautious and unsure as he is pushing social boundaries on the frontier, but it does not make for interesting acting. The rest of the participants are more emotional and interesting, especially Graham Greene at the top of his game as the holy man.The music in this film is a soundtrack for epic exploration, some of it sounding like a tune that would accompany a scene of a kid discovering some magical house, and again contributing to the children's adventure movie feel described earlier.In short, what an odd film&#x85;I like it. It is not a great movie. Some of the acting is stiff and some scenes are questionable but the off-beat mood is curious enough and the story starts to really grow on you, so that it feels like a complete and rewarding experience after the movie is over.

The action stumbles and the only interesting side story to all of it was Helga playing as Deep Voice secretly helping Arnold out.The ending to the movie, is nothing but a horrible parody on the 1993 classic Speed with the wild goose chase sequence with jumping across a bridge and nearly hitting an old lady with a baby stroller of cans.Unlike other movies for kids like The Powerpuff Girls Movie, there are no moral lessons that relate to the audience or for kids to learn, once everything is said and done.What's worse is Helga finally revealing her deep affections towards Arnold (near the end of it all) and Arnold seems creeped out by it, essentially killing the love and chemistry the two had. Pathetic.A second Hey Arnold! movie was planned to be made involving Arnold finally getting to met his parents face to face, before it was scrapped because the first one was a failure at the box office.The cartoon was eventually cancelled by 2005 and for good reason.

I remember one of the guys who restored Spartacus for its 40th Anniversary saying that it was one of the reasons he got into movies. I can totally relate to that.There was just something more immediate, more intense, even something more modern about the movie. From Alex North's opening fanfares to Saul Bass's crumbling Roman statue behind the main titles, you knew you were in for something different.Just compare the costuming in Ben Hur with Spartacus. In Ben Hur, everything had a shiny, glitzy look that almost suggested costumes made by clever parents for a Christmas pageant while Spartacus had a more muscular, functional look. Then there were the actors. Kirk Douglas as producer had for the most part given British actors the parts of the Romans, and American actors the roles of gladiators and slaves to create an interesting language scheme; it worked well. Ustinov and Laughton got the most out of Dalton Trumbo's urbane and often witty script while Olivier conveyed much with just a look. You sense that although his Crassus knows he will defeat Spartacus in battle, he will never defeat his spirit.And Douglas stands up to all those esteemed British actors, gutsy really, but he wasn't outclassed at all and such intensity, I believed him; he was Spartacus. Now this was a pretty adult movie for it's time (some scenes were cut), and the audience went very quiet indeed during the heavily-shaded scene where Jean Simmons took off her clothes in Spartacus' cell. I'm surprised they even let a 12-year old in; it was such a tightly-buttoned era. There have been other attempts at Spartacus. A version with Gorin Visnjic was so lacklustre I don't know why they bothered. Then there's the recent Kiwi mini series. I know some like it, and it does weave more of the real history throughout the series, however, it goes for a graphic novel approach, which I find very repetitious. Along with everyone yelling like they are dealing with strangulated hernias, I didn't see one scene in all its monochromatic, CGI weirdness that remotely approached those sunlit scenes in the 1960 version of the slave army on the march propelled along by Alex North's stunning score.As for all the political criticism levelled at the film at the time; 'Marxists in togas' etc., it just went straight over my head &#x96; it still does to be honest. I know there were battles between Douglas and Kubrick behind the scenes; two strong characters butting heads, but between them they achieved something unique even if they didn't go to each other's dinner parties ever again.

It really does screw up when it turns from a greatly constructed thriller from the mind behind the most terrifying novels that have sold million. Turns into a badly leaded, and cheaply constructed court room movie. A girl has to go to her hometown. In small pieces of sea-bedded land, in a small community. Where her hardworking mother has been arrested for killing someone. But when she returns, she opens a door to old memories, about nasty little things she had forgotten that had really happened. She hated and judicated her mother for it. Its a dramatic movie, that moves, loses and scares the viewer in ways the contemporary audience would'nt have expected from a King inspired story. Its ending is its only flaw. It dribbles on too long when the film should finished, but it had to tell what happens to the protagonists. Before that, it feels like a film directed by Sam Raimi with close ups and inventive shots of painted scenes and dark subject matter scenes have the contrast liquefied. And the film is always jumping into the past with injecting the colorful years back into the shot as it tells its story non-linearly in flashbacks.Its story is its attraction. So I will not spoil it in this review. But give you idea of what you're going into; get ready to be uncomfortable, both for an old film that has a slow start; and pathetic characters who wont be easy to like. Now to contradict that, this must the best casted film I've seen in awhile. Kathy Bates as Dolores Claiborne; she showed how good she is as a frighting number 1 fan in Stephen King's Misery and she is just as phenomenally entertaining in this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh is probably the worst casted member, she falls through most scene and makes it when its counts.But to be honest she playing a pretty messed up and broken, conflicted young woman in world where she has no control over what she wants or has any idea how bad thing really are. Christopher Plummer is easily the best performance and Judt Parfitt. But more memorable is the supporting role by John C Reiley; he's easy to dislike but makes the final scene a bit more bearable when his character finally makes sense.It has a cut-off small town in New England with each actor giving away that, with a borderline accent. It has two main plots, one about the past and redemption and revelation and the present that is like I said always coated in a dead dark and dramatic aesthetics that makes the well tolled tale more moving. A long time housekeeper is the main suspect to a murderer, but of course its not all that easy; its find by Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that in fact they loved each other and even help each other in terrible moments in the past. Then the second plot is about Selena herself taking control of her life by reciting her abusive alcoholic father and accepting her mother has always been there for her. A very sweet film when you don't think about some moments that are really dark, but King and the director Taylor Hackford; mash up their story telling talent with some really great filmmaking. with scenes like this; when the character is effortlessly looking into the past without prompt to whether the audience is ready. Or this scene when the mirror resembles how ruined their lives are. And this just amazing looking transcendence scene from the second act to the final act with a polarizing moon eclipse.But again; the only thing that would stop me from watching this stylish mystery drama is the ending. It could have ended somewhere before the final moments, before Jason Leigh gave the whole second degree in an unshabby courtroom scene and makes the other actors seem like they're saying your ruining this film. But I digress, a nice film is a nice film. And Dolores Claiborne is a Stephen King film made by Sam Raimi -- that's what the film felt like for me.

Brendan Fraser is perfect as Adam, a Renaissance man with superb theoretical social skills but inexperience, so initially comes off as nothing more than a likable doofus, but gradually grows into the gentleman he was trained to become. His character's innocence, naïveté and tendency to view issues as B&W dichotomies represent society's world view in the 1950s and 1960s. Christopher Walken delivers an unusually understated performance and steals the film in the very last scene. Alicia Silverstone does as well as can be expected with the material she was given, but her Eve character is underdeveloped. She seems like an okay sort of girl next door, but doesn't offer enough to justify Adam's fascination with her to the exclusion of several other girls who superficially seem more obvious choices. She has a competing love interest in Cliff, but it never seems clear why she loved him before and doesn't love him now but is still a bit fixated on him. The relationship seems a bit contrived. He's there when the plot needs a low point for Adam but conveniently absent at other times. And it doesn't make much sense that alpha male Cliff would have moved in with her rather than inviting her to move in with him, or that he wouldn't park in front of her house. Eve's entire character also seems contrived. She doesn't seem the type who would frequent the trendy nightclub they visit or to have a gay roommate. While the film is amusing, it falls short of hilarious. Much of the humor is fairly subtle. Many jokes and gags require lengthy setups. The writers don't fully utilize all of the comic tools in their arsenal. There aren't many sight gags other than Adam's unstylish suit. Recurring and 1-2-3 gags aren't used very effectively. The baseball cards and baseball game don't escalate the humor. There are a few verbal gags and double entendres, such as gay\/happy, but there's room for many more. The foreground and background aren't used effectively. At one point Eve and her gay roommate Troy enter a porn shop looking for Adam. They jump up and down on the floor, to determine if there's a basement, but it's done very seriously. Cut twice to a customer clutching an armload of VHS tapes and backing away as if they are weird. The Pakistani shop owner approaches, wearing a lot of gold jewelry in what may or may not have been intended as a politically incorrect commentary on the influence of immigrants growing rich by peddling porn. They have an exchange that includes one of the best jokes in the movie, then ask about a rear entrance. Including the setup, the scene lasts for about eighty seconds. It could have been shortened by showing the customer in the background instead of in separate shots. The customer is overweight and looks a bit nerdish or borderline weird. There are a number of things they could have done to make the scene funnier. He could have dropped a tape at Eve's feet and she could have picked it up for him only to have him deny it was his. He could have hurriedly replaced a movie and asked the shopkeeper if he carries any historical documentaries. He could have approached Eve and asked her if she was Dixie Normous, the famous porn star, and asked if she would autograph the box for him. Troy does a little dance step in an effort to see if the floor sounds hollow. He could have gotten on his knees and put his ear to the floor. That could have led to a sight gag and physical comedy. Except for the one joke, which was admittedly one of the best in the movie, the setting could have been changed to a barbershop or grocery store. They didn't push the envelope or try to squeeze every laugh they could out of the scene. In part, they seem to have tried to be inoffensive, going as far as to blur the images of bare breasts on the video jackets, possibly trying to maintain the tone and sensitivities of the 1950s and 1960s. For their efforts, the film still got a PG-13 rating. But what's the point? Viewers who would be most likely to appreciate the references to manners, mores and cultural references of that period would have been in their forties or fifties in 1999 when the film was released. Much of the humor would have made no sense to younger viewers. Some aspects of the movie are simply not funny. A character becomes alcoholic. Another character goes stir-crazy. A plane crashes in a residential neighborhood. While they take pains to suggest there were no casualties, including having the plane go vertical before nosediving, plane crashes simply aren't funny. Consequently, the film has an uneven tone. But the trade-off is a cinematic billet doux to a lost age of innocence.

Bond strapped to a table with a laser moving up his groin. Oddjob, the henchmen who wears a steal rimmed bowler hat that can decapitate a statue's head. The leading lady named Pussy Galore. Bond's Aston Martin DB5 sported with gadgets. The villain Goldfinger, who plots to break into the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository in Fort Knox. Everything that ultimately made the series what it is, it's all here.It carries a lot of what the first two films introduced, now mostly refined. This time the pre-title sequence is entirely separate from the main story, as if it were a short film giving audiences an idea of what's in store. The main title sequence now features the song of the film, this time sung by Shirley Bassey. The dynamic between Bond and Q is now defined with banter, as Bond is presented his gadget laden car. These kind of refinements are what would establish the Bond formula that would from this point be used in Bond films in various ways, for better or worse.This installment is based off of the seventh novel written by Ian Fleming. As an adaptation, it stays relatively true to the source material. However, vital alterations were made for the film and I can say that they were largely an improvement. In the original novel, Auric Goldfinger actually plots to rob all the gold bullion from Fort Knox, which would have been very improbable, even for a Bond adventure. The film finds a more clever solution, which I'll leave unspoiled. Other changes worked in the same nature or were simple novel to film translations in telling the story.Guy Hamilton directs this installment. Where the previous director Terence Young treated the first two films more as spy thrillers, Hamilton aims for a more comic book flavor with a breezier tone and emphasis on humor, whether through visual gags or interaction between characters. This is another factor that would play a big role into how future Bond films would proceed, some succeeding while others going too far.Sean Connery is as comfortable as ever in the role of Bond. He plays Bond much more smarmy for a lot of the film, but that's mainly to get under the skin of the villain's boisterous nature. Gert Fröbe is truly fantastic as the villain Auric Goldfinger. What's remarkable is that he was dubbed by a voice actor, because he didn't speak very much English. On set he would actually speak German, but mouth the words close to English as much as possible. Despite being dubbed, he still carries a lot of the performance through his body language and the voice actor Michael Collins does a great job of matching that performance. His character is aided by the henchmen Oddjob, who's possibly the most iconic of all the henchmen that Bond had to face. A simple gag has him crush a golf ball with his bare hand, setting him up as a tough opponent for Bond to fight later in the film. Honor Blackman plays the Bond lady Pussy Galore, who's known not only for the silly and suggestive name but for also for initially not being easily swayed by Bond's charms, telling him you can turn off the charm, I'm immune.GOLDIFNGER is often cited among the best of the Bond films, if not the best. While it's certainly iconic, it also known for weaknesses like Bond being mostly held captive for the second half of the film. The argument being that he comes off as someone that doesn't effect the plot so much. That may be true, but then again that same argument is being made about how Indiana Jones wouldn't have changed the outcome of the plot in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. It's an oddity in stories about heroes, but I suppose what ultimately matters is if the film's adventure is fun and engaging. This one definitely is.

Other changes worked in the same nature or were simple novel to film translations in telling the story.Guy Hamilton directs this installment. Where the previous director Terence Young treated the first two films more as spy thrillers, Hamilton aims for a more comic book flavor with a breezier tone and emphasis on humor, whether through visual gags or interaction between characters. This is another factor that would play a big role into how future Bond films would proceed, some succeeding while others going too far.Sean Connery is as comfortable as ever in the role of Bond. He plays Bond much more smarmy for a lot of the film, but that's mainly to get under the skin of the villain's boisterous nature. Gert Fröbe is truly fantastic as the villain Auric Goldfinger. What's remarkable is that he was dubbed by a voice actor, because he didn't speak very much English. On set he would actually speak German, but mouth the words close to English as much as possible. Despite being dubbed, he still carries a lot of the performance through his body language and the voice actor Michael Collins does a great job of matching that performance. His character is aided by the henchmen Oddjob, who's possibly the most iconic of all the henchmen that Bond had to face. A simple gag has him crush a golf ball with his bare hand, setting him up as a tough opponent for Bond to fight later in the film. Honor Blackman plays the Bond lady Pussy Galore, who's known not only for the silly and suggestive name but for also for initially not being easily swayed by Bond's charms, telling him you can turn off the charm, I'm immune.GOLDIFNGER is often cited among the best of the Bond films, if not the best. While it's certainly iconic, it also known for weaknesses like Bond being mostly held captive for the second half of the film. The argument being that he comes off as someone that doesn't effect the plot so much. That may be true, but then again that same argument is being made about how Indiana Jones wouldn't have changed the outcome of the plot in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. It's an oddity in stories about heroes, but I suppose what ultimately matters is if the film's adventure is fun and engaging. This one definitely is.

Bond strapped to a table with a laser moving up his groin. Oddjob, the henchmen who wears a steal rimmed bowler hat that can decapitate a statue's head. The leading lady named Pussy Galore. Bond's Aston Martin DB5 sported with gadgets. The villain Goldfinger, who plots to break into the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository in Fort Knox. Everything that ultimately made the series what it is, it's all here.It carries a lot of what the first two films introduced, now mostly refined. This time the pre-title sequence is entirely separate from the main story, as if it were a short film giving audiences an idea of what's in store. The main title sequence now features the song of the film, this time sung by Shirley Bassey. The dynamic between Bond and Q is now defined with banter, as Bond is presented his gadget laden car. These kind of refinements are what would establish the Bond formula that would from this point be used in Bond films in various ways, for better or worse.This installment is based off of the seventh novel written by Ian Fleming. As an adaptation, it stays relatively true to the source material. However, vital alterations were made for the film and I can say that they were largely an improvement.
