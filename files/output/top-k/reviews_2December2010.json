That's if the quality of the acting and writing had remained the same. The musical quality, on the other hand, never went down--except of course for the fact that the music early on was more sophisticated and much of what came later was mindless but fun dance pop. If you like the kind of music Mariah Carey is known for, Glitter delivers. Most of the time I would consider a lot of that music to be garbage. But Mariah is one of the few singers of her style I can stand to listen to, and given that this style of music would be dominant in this movie, I actually found myself enjoying it. All the musicians were talented--except, of course, Sylk--who was secretly replaced by the phenomenal Billie as lead singer and didn't seem to know it as her mike was turned down and Billie's was turned up.I didn't think this movie was so bad overall. Sure, it's depressing, but plenty of good movies are. This wasn't outstanding, but it appeared to be telling a good story. Most of the actors were doing a good job. Toward the end, though, I realized this movie wasn't going to finish what it started, because it was only supposed to run for two hours including commercials. So the finish seemed kind of abrupt, and shocking. Nevertheless, the ending turned out to be satisfying.Of course, everyone seemed to point to one weakness in this movie. Yes, it was obvious Mariah had little acting experience. But in some scenes, I felt she did just fine. In others, where she had no challenge, she seemed capable of only three facial expressions, and one in particular. Wow, if she had really been that happy, this would have been a fun movie. Mariah probably was enjoying herself. Billie, maybe.

As every country in the world has its own stories on abuse in military schools, this movie doesn't bring us foreigns ANYTHING. The Godfather, Apocalypses Now, The Exorcist, those are great American movies, artworks with universal value, not this. BTW, the 2010 Nobel Prize of Literature, Vargas Llosa wrote his masterpiece novel precisely about abuse in military schools en Peru. Now to my original review...the film looks cheap from beginning to end, as if SK had been perennially short of funds (BTW is Hartman the only military man in that barracks? Couldn't they afford a single Capt. besides him?) And things become worse when they move to Vietnam. That editorial war council is one of the lamest I have ever seen--equal only to that inquiry in Aliens and capable of making one similar of the Franklin at Chilton's--Gilmore Girls--a masterpiece in psychological tension; even more so, considering than we are here at the eve of the greatest story of the whole war, the Tet offensive. Yet you don't feel any of that in the air, far from that. That S & S editor looks more like just coming out of modelling tennis shoes for a men's magazine than a newspaper boss in the thick of the action and the reporters more like kids preparing for a camping trip. The later sorties, encounters, look contrived, prepared and what is said there is cliché ridden--especially that dialogue between Joker and that Col., in which every cliché seems to have come up. Not to mention that ridiculous stand off with Animal Mother that some call a classic but which looks more like your usual schoolyard I-piss-farther-than-you piece of bravado. Then, the Hue battle, which is one of the worst war sequences I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot. Mediocre acting, cheap scenery, complete lack of atmosphere. Now I could appreciate the genius of Coppola--I'm thinking about that night battle. Those guys look truly battle weary, exhausted, pushed to the limit, that's the mood every soldier who was in Hue talks about. Instead, these Animal Mothers and Cowboys look more like street urchins playing war in an empty city lot while keeping an eye for the police. Phony, that's the second word that comes to mind. Then, third....how about racist? Or misogynistic, maybe? Because once again Kubrick shows his complete inability to portrait women in roles other than in subservient, even humiliating ones. At best as victims. When not absent or doing obscure jobs--as in 2001 or Dr Strangelove--they are cold, castrating--as Alex's mom in C.O. (or even rotting corpses!) And don't get me started with his treatment of racial minorities. The action unfolds in Vietnam and what women we have here? Two whores and one sniper (i.e. one who kills treacherously.) Also two males, one pimp and a thief. Once again, only demeaning stereotypes. The truth is, SK is incapable of giving human faces to his characters of ANY race. Just remember the astronauts in 2001, besides which HAL was a portent in humanity. And which other filmmaker is so incapable of giving a human face to an African American; who's so out of touch with the realities of the 60s, that the only way he can do that is by recurring to the old stereotype of the big black d**k'?. And the same thing for the Vietnamese. Coppola didn't know a thing about them either, but he didn't have any problem humanizing them the mother who runs to Kilgore with her wounded baby, the girl who tries to retrieve her dog and so on. Instead, what we see here, in the boys' faces when they confront the locals, dead or alive, is just what Kubrick himself is capable of saying, doing, i.e. nothing. He is even incapable of giving a human face to a dying girl, FHS! When a simple picture of a baby, a boy, falling from her lap would have sufficed--as in a similar scene in Bridge over R.K., with a Japanese soldier. Had it been a dog dying there, it would have made no difference at all. At the end he simply pulls just another cliché the girl prays and then asks to be shot. And this is the movie maker that some hail as the greatest one in modern times and they even call this film a masterpiece! This is a bad film that has been set on a pedestal by the artsy crowd and there worshipped for all the wrong reasons. And while I agree it adequately portraits the dehumanizing effect of training in a boot camp on people and the futility of war, it still remains a clunker; and that because it got nothing going that may be construed as fruit of imaginative, creative work. The cinematography is ordinary, the atmosphere nonexistent, the acting mediocre and the characters stereotypical; dialogues are cliché ridden and, most of all, it all looks incredible cheap. So, no matter if I'm in agreement with its point of view, it's still a turkey. Kubrick offers nothing new, groundbreaking, here--he just reminds us once more of his own pathological misogyny and of his complete ignorance, or contempt, of racial minorities. All the rest has already been done, and better, in other movies. In all, 2 pts. for the effort and the time and 2 for the good intentions.

Unfortunately, Tony Wilson also came across as a pompous ass occasionally. I'm not sure if that judgement is fair Wilson was a highly educated man who never seemed to fit into the music business life style. Steve Coogan , who is a brilliant comedian, does not really play him in this film. He delivers more of a parody of the man although to be fair he does give him some moments of dignity like when the Joy Division leadsinger kills himself or when he tells his punters to loot the offices when the Hacienda is closed down. I just feel there is more to Wilson then just the pompous wide eyed boy. From my perspective Wilson would be a very good subject for a docu-drama because he has the depth to be taken seriously and he deserves it. As a comedy drama 24 hour party people works quite well. The cast is great, Coogan is very funny (as always) although I find the idea that Steve Coogan in his Wilson persona actually comments on the film during the film a bit contrived. All in all it's hugely entertaining but I can't help feeling that after a very elaborate first half, the second half (when the really exciting things are happening) is a bit rushed. All in all the film is well worth watching but I feel that there still is a story about Tony Wilson and the Madchester movement that waits to be told.

Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the me against the world persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of greater good at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.)There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati.Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.

In 1980, the same team finally put their comedy into mainstream movies as to what would become a milestone in comedic film history....Airplane ! The film starring some well known celebrities such as Robert Hays, Robert Stack, and Lloyd Bridges, but one familiar, yet unknown actor, Leslie Nielsen was cast as a leading role. Nielsen had done previous serious acting roles in the 50s sci-fi classic, Forbidden Planet, and in the 1972 epic disaster movie, The Poseiden Adventure as the captain. Leslie's serious delivering of comedic lines is what earned him his trademark and an entire audience crazed about his style of acting. Nielsen became such a huge hit that Paramont put him as the star of a short-lived t.v series Police Squad. Written by the Kentucky Fried Theatre group.

Kyle McLachlan is a bland lead, while the rest of the cast try to make amends for the script and fail spectacularly.All in all, a big disappointment and a (interesting) failure. 4\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"2 December 2010","score":"","review":" Despite mounting pressures on his presidency caused by reckless judgments and poisonous associations, Richard M.

Awkwardly dropping to his knees alongside Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Nixon tells him, Never be too proud to get on your knees before God. Amusingly, this is the fist time in the picture that God is even mentioned. After a beat, Nixon says, I hope this doesn't embarrass you, Henry. To which Kissinger replies (in the wake of the New York Times leaking 47 volumes of top secret tapes to the public), No, I don't mind. This isn't going to leak, is it? Producer-director Oliver Stone, working from an original screenplay by Stephen J. Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson, and himself, has tackled the practically insurmountable task of covering Nixon's roller-coaster political career from the 1960 Presidential debate alongside John F. Kennedy to his final walk from the White House in 1974 (with high-contrast black-and-white flashes of his childhood on a California lemon farm). There's so much to take in, so much minutiae to absorb, that Stone's inconsistent filmmaking style becomes a burden rather than an attribute (the indifference to the visual compositions and the hectic editing is noticeable almost immediately). As Nixon, Anthony Hopkins has just as many hurdles to conquer; the actor gives a consummate performance, yet he looks and sounds nothing like the real Richard Nixon (his camouflaged British accent at times lapsing into Irish). Nixon's connections with Cuba, and his naming of the Watergate burglars as Cubans with ties to the Bay of Pigs, isn't sorted out for us in layman's terms (much of the picture is mind-bogglingly complicated), and so huge chunks of the production fail to have the kind of impact which can make a political film great, a masterpiece. Nixon doesn't have the depth for that. Stone's elaborate, artistic gestures are felt, but they cannot compensate for moments when the movie bogs down in its own rancid talk, or dead-end scenes between Nixon and long-suffering wife Pat (Joan Allen, who alternately looks pained or smugly vindicated). Stone has gathered together an amazing group of actors here, but several of the key performers fail to come through with their reenactments (part of which is Stone's fault, who turns Nixon into Zelig--or Forrest Gump--interacting with newsreel footage of real-life political players; no actor can compete with the real thing). The underlining insistence on a new conspiracy 'round every turn is wearing, and the final assessment isn't especially profound or moving. **1\/2 from **** ","genre":null},{"date":"2 December 2010","score":"","review":" Despite mounting pressures on his presidency caused by reckless judgments and poisonous associations, Richard M.

I, as a pastor, have no difficulty believing in evolution as the process set in motion by God. I have no difficulty in understanding the Genesis story as an attempt on the part of its author to come to terms with the miracle of creation, and what the account affirms is that what exists exists because of God. I start with those comments because it seems to me that a review of this movie needs to state outright the author's own biases.This is a good movie. It's highlighted by powerful performances from Spencer Tracy and Fredric March. It's based on the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial in which Tennessee school teacher John Scopes was tried for breaking a state law forbidding the teaching of evolution. The story changes all the names. In the actual trial, 3 time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan argued for the prosecution, and famed criminal lawyer Clarence Darrow argued for the defence. Here, Tracy plays Henry Drummond (based on Darrow) and March plays Matthew Harrison Brady (based on Jennings.) Dick York has a less central role as Teacher Bertram Cates (based obviously on Scopes.) Why were the names changed? There may have been some legal reasons, but I also suspect it was to allow the writers of the original stage play to play somewhat loose with the actual events of the trial. (Might I suggest therefore that this movie not be taken literally?)The movie is clearly sympathetic to the evolution side of the debate. The prosecutors (and those who supported them) are portrayed in rabid and fanatical terms, the local minister at one point publicly damning his own daughter to hell for supporting Cates. The defence team is shown in a much more sympathetic light, bristling under restrictions placed upon them that forbade the introduction of scientific evidence into the case. March, I thought, was better than Tracy - probably because, at least in the minds of the writers, he had a more interesting character to work with. Brady seemed from the beginning to be a guy living on the edge of reality, desperate to get himself back to centre stage in the public eye but who finds himself increasingly at odds with the changing nature of public opinion. Tracy was good (although at times he looked a bit grizzled, and he seemed older in this movie than he would some years later, for example, in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.)The movie - which features supporting performances from folks such as Claude Akins as the local minister and Harry Morgan as the judge - remains surprisingly relevant, with the continuing strength of some of the fundamentalist churches in parts of the United States especially and continued debates over the teaching of evolution in schools. It's not a movie that portrays people of faith in a positive light (pretty much all of them are backwards and fanatics) although the character of Cates seems to be the mediator between the two extremes. He doesn't reject faith or the Bible, but reconciles it with evolution, which increasing numbers of Christians today (including myself) are quite capable of doing in a systematical, coherent and completely logical way that in no way undermines their faith. The closing shot of the movie (in which Drummond picks up both the Bible and Darwin's book and carries them out together) does seem to be making that point as well.

Basically you have six characters who without either explanation for the viewer or understanding for them awaken in a room that's essentially a cube. Upon exploring, they discover that the room leads only to other rooms shaped like cubes (some of which are booby trapped) and they finally realize that all these cube rooms are located inside what must be a gigantic cube. The challenge is to find a way out or die of starvation, because there is no food.

The supporting cast is what amazed me. It seemed like they all starred in Harry Potter in one film or another. Miranda Richardson character is pretty sinister.Overall, this is what I call a classic horror film. I would want to see this again. I rate this film 9\/10.

Greta Scacchi is simply stunning and she just has a nice aura about her on screen.

This is a movie by a filmmaker who knows a particular style and sticks to it without really bringing anything fresh to the party. If you don't know the premise, go read it on the IMDb page. Suffice to say, the performance by Willem Dafoe as a homosexual Federal investigator is one of the films saving graces. A rather shocking and brutal moment when a cat is accidentally killed (nay, splattered against a wall) was the point where I almost turned this film off. I wish I had.

The plot is shallow, unrealistic and above all absurd. Not just that the pretentious and so called emotional moments in the film aren't moving and touching, but they are also laughable and ridiculous. The scenes featuring the mouse (Mr. Jingles),Percy Wetmore and 'Wild Bill' Wharton reminded me of the cartoons I used to watch in my childhood. To put it simply, its a bad combination of mawkish sentimentalism and make beliefs. I don't care if the film is predictable but the pathetic attempts of audience manipulation and superficial treatment should keep this movie out of the top 250 movies in IMDb.Some of the scenes were too dragging, meaningless and hollow. Some others were too chaotic and deranged. Overall the film is a classic example of bad filmmaking. We cant really rate the actors as there is no scope of performance in such a poorly directed film.

The Hitch-Hiker is one of the first ones and it's actually the first film-noir directed by a woman - so the film has quite a lot of historic value. British for her descent, Ida Lupino had already some experience of film-noir she had starred in High Sierra (1941) with Humphrey Bogart and later on in On Dangerous Ground (1953) by Nicholas Ray. The Hitch-Hiker is very unconventional and daring, it borough up subjects many would've left behind but Ida Lupino was no coward. She openly and realistically dealt with themes like illegitimate mothers, twice married chumps, rapes and the consequences of it in her movies. In The Hitch-Hiker she took film-noir into her hands and shaped something of her own out of it.Two men are going out of town for fishing. During their journey to Arizona they pick up a hitch-hiker from the road, who quickly turns out to be a psychopath who is being searcher by the police. The agonizing journey starts in a narrow car when the men are forced to change their direction from Arizona to Mexico and realize that they're facing death. The only question is when and how.In 1950's film-noir was quite a phenomenon of the past and filmmakers had taken everything out of it that they were able to; at least that's what they thought. Private eyes, dangerous women and desperate men were characters everyone were familiar with. Big cities, cold streets, waterfronts and exotic milieus were landscapes all had seen. Desperation, loveless love, exploitation and moral complexity were themes filmmakers had dealt with for several times. In 1950's many brought something new to this amazing genre; Nicholas Ray gave us a chance to see it in a very different landscape, Orson Welles took the whole philosophy of film-noir to a new level in Touch of Evil (1958) and Alfred Hitchcock dealt with a true story in The Wrong Man (1956).Ida Lupino as the first woman to direct a film-noir obviously brought something new to it. The aesthetics, landscapes and milieus of film-noir were often related to big cities like Los Angeles and New York. In The Hitch-Hiker Lupino uses the claustrophobic place of a car brilliantly and the scenes outside the car take place in the deserts of southern states and Mexico. The whole film takes place in one car, the gas stations on the road and the deserts of unbearable heat. Only near the end the film culminates to one of the most classical milieus of film-noir a waterfront.The film was very untypical for its time. It portrayed two men in a true nightmare with no way out. The world view of it is incredibly dark and pessimistic, where the police is powerless against the world. In the beginning of the film it is announced that it is based on a true story, which could've happened to any of us. This of course makes the situation even more distressing and scary. What I know is that where I live, Finland this film was banned back in 1950's because of its darkness, psychopathy and pessimism.The Hitch-Hiker was made in 1950's - in the shadows of The Cold War so the themes of pessimism, disloyalty, paranoia, loneliness and psychopathy were current and hard for the people of the time. Ida Lupino reinforced the place of women as directors in Hollywood, which was seen (and still is) as a very masculine trade. The construction of the claustrophobic place is glorious and the simplified expressionistic images of the shadows of the characters and the endless roads are astonishing and unforgettable.
