I saw NO ONE who seemed thrilled by the film at the end. No buzz. No chatter. No excitement. Walked kind of limply out of the theater. Most seemed, like me and my wife, to be disappointed and left kind of hanging a bit.Script is often slow, a bit dull and, at times, muddled up. Acting is OK to good....nothing spectacular. It delivers just a very few suspenseful moments (about 3 or 4 tops) that perhaps 8 people (mostly under 12) in the whole audience screamed at. This hype of it being a very scary, edge of your seat, jump out of your seat film is just not true except as I've said above. And the claim that M.N.S. is the next Spielberg is a TOTAL joke!!! M.N.S. has NOTHING in common with Spielberg AT ALL! If anything, M.N.S. is more like Rod Serling or Hitchcock in that he tries to deliver surprise elements (even if getting there is very slowly paced). Even in his best film, THE SIXTH SENSE, the writing gets slow and dull during the first half or so...you know how M.N.S. is....but it paid off BIG TIME in the final resolution, as we all know. SIGNS has a LOT of the M.N.S. type of dullness and slowness throughout a lot of the film, but you TRUST that he WILL, in fact, lead the film down to another great resolve, etc,.....but it just does not deliver on that trust. And that will be enough to see this rating drop along with its gross. I predict it will end up with about a 6.5-7.0 rating at best and a domestic gross of about $140 mil-$160 mil with a total WW gross of about $250 mil-$275 mil.I wanted to like it...I'm a HUGE fan of THE SIXTH SENSE (I'd rate it a 10). I like M.N.S. and Mel Gibson a lot. By the way, SIGNS also seems to be somewhat of a WAR OF THE WORLDS rip-off in a couple of regards as well as a rip-off of other films. To me, it was nothing more than a much better than average flick (most flicks REALLY suck these days!), but I expected a major blockbuster. If you plan on dropping $40-$70 to take your family to this thing, you WILL NOT get your money's worth.

The characters are all as frustratingly inarticulate as the director.  It's not just that Field is understated, as some claim.  Watch Nanni Moretti's The Son's Room, an Italian film released in the same year, and you'll see an even more understated director working with even muter characters who nonetheless manages to keep his film alive and in good health from beginning to end - without resorting to gunplay, either.The ending worries me.  I have no doubt that most people will fail to realise what it's really saying.  On the surface, it's saying this Matt and Ruth, after futilely blaming each other, realise that they really need to get justice by concentrating their fire on their son's murderer - which means, since the law seems to be refusing to do its duty, shooting him.But this is a strained interpretation of events.  The event that sparks off the shooting is just this Ruth encounters her son's murderer in a convenience store, and says afterwards to her husband He smiled at me.  Suggestible people will probably believe her.  But he hadn't smiled at her.  Wearing the same inscrutable expression he always wears, he had caught her eye, hurried out of the store as quickly as possible, and (in an attempt to save some face) nodded as imperceptibly as possible not to Ruth but to the store's proprietor.The parents are angry that Richard Strout is being charged with manslaughter rather than murder, as if manslaughter is so much less serious than murder as to constitute an insult.  But manslaughter is a serious crime and the details of the shooting ARE murky (we never find out ourselves exactly what happened).  Of course, it ought not to matter if the shooting WAS an accident, since an accidental killing committed in the course of a bank robbery or a kidnapping is deemed murder under common law, and this case should be no different; but the law is the law, and if such a shooting as this COULD be manslaughter under Maine or US law, then we don't know that this particular shooting isn't.  What difference does it make?  Strout is still absolutely certain to go to prison, for five to twenty years - he thinks twenty, the prosecutor thinks ten to fifteen, the parents, on the basis of very little evidence, think five, but even five years in prison is hardly a slap on the wrist.  What do these people want, blood?  Alas, they DO want blood, and so, before the law has a chance to punish Strout itself, they shoot him.Ironically, as Strout is being held at gunpoint, he justifies himself in exactly the same way that the parents are presumably justifying themselves he says that Frank had wronged him terribly, that he simply couldn't bear to see Frank's smiling face while he, Richard Strout, was suffering, that he only wanted just revenge and no more - all the usual tripe.  The irony may be lost on everyone in the movie but it isn't lost on us.  Moreover, we know that Richard is himself someone else's son.Here's what really happened after months of evasion and grief, Matt and Ruth have a chance to be honest with themselves and begin to move on, and after their first open confrontation we think that they'll take that chance - right up until we see the second shooting, when we realise that they instead chose to retreat even further into blindness and bloodlust.  The film's concluding third (the only part with anything going for it) speaks eloquently AGAINST revenge.  It's a message that English-speaking audiences badly need to hear.  Few will hear it.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"3 August 2002","score":"","review":"  Spoilers follow...Until the surprisingly electric scene in which Matt tells Ruth exactly what he thinks of her - which is exactly what we'd been thinking of her, too - it's all as ordinary as it is possible for the director to make it; intended perhaps as a study in the banality of evil, it comes across instead as a tedious expression of the banality of absolutely everything.  The characters are all as frustratingly inarticulate as the director.  It's not just that Field is understated, as some claim.  Watch Nanni Moretti's The Son's Room, an Italian film released in the same year, and you'll see an even more understated director working with even muter characters who nonetheless manages to keep his film alive and in good health from beginning to end - without resorting to gunplay, either.The ending worries me.  I have no doubt that most people will fail to realise what it's really saying.  On the surface, it's saying this Matt and Ruth, after futilely blaming each other, realise that they really need to get justice by concentrating their fire on their son's murderer - which means, since the law seems to be refusing to do its duty, shooting him.But this is a strained interpretation of events.  The event that sparks off the shooting is just this Ruth encounters her son's murderer in a convenience store, and says afterwards to her husband He smiled at me.  Suggestible people will probably believe her.  But he hadn't smiled at her.  Wearing the same inscrutable expression he always wears, he had caught her eye, hurried out of the store as quickly as possible, and (in an attempt to save some face) nodded as imperceptibly as possible not to Ruth but to the store's proprietor.The parents are angry that Richard Strout is being charged with manslaughter rather than murder, as if manslaughter is so much less serious than murder as to constitute an insult.  But manslaughter is a serious crime and the details of the shooting ARE murky (we never find out ourselves exactly what happened).  Of course, it ought not to matter if the shooting WAS an accident, since an accidental killing committed in the course of a bank robbery or a kidnapping is deemed murder under common law, and this case should be no different; but the law is the law, and if such a shooting as this COULD be manslaughter under Maine or US law, then we don't know that this particular shooting isn't.  What difference does it make?  Strout is still absolutely certain to go to prison, for five to twenty years - he thinks twenty, the prosecutor thinks ten to fifteen, the parents, on the basis of very little evidence, think five, but even five years in prison is hardly a slap on the wrist.  What do these people want, blood?  Alas, they DO want blood, and so, before the law has a chance to punish Strout itself, they shoot him.Ironically, as Strout is being held at gunpoint, he justifies himself in exactly the same way that the parents are presumably justifying themselves he says that Frank had wronged him terribly, that he simply couldn't bear to see Frank's smiling face while he, Richard Strout, was suffering, that he only wanted just revenge and no more - all the usual tripe.  The irony may be lost on everyone in the movie but it isn't lost on us.  Moreover, we know that Richard is himself someone else's son.Here's what really happened after months of evasion and grief, Matt and Ruth have a chance to be honest with themselves and begin to move on, and after their first open confrontation we think that they'll take that chance - right up until we see the second shooting, when we realise that they instead chose to retreat even further into blindness and bloodlust.

The opening scenes of the film are very well done, its all realistic and horrible, showing how terrible war can be, but its not put into context, and from then on, it all just slipslides away into obscurity.The war more or less disappears, and the conflict is now between Jude Laws and Ed Harris characters. Law does an okay performance, and Harris is stone cold and good, and the scenes when they hunt each other are the only real suspense in the film, but all the silly coincidences and escapes they have to make up to make the hunt last through the film gets to stupid.**SPOILER** and when Harris is killed in the end, its just another stupid moment. This guy, who is so smart that he doesnt go for Pearlmans decoy, after shooting a guy who suddenly rises up in his view, thinks he`s gotten his adversary and crosses this huge open space. Yeah right. **SPOILER END**It is to much focus on things that doesnt help the story or ads to the suspense. The love story seems like an add on to attract viewers. There is never any question who gets the girl, the question is only why. The question about socialism and equality is entirely left out, even if that is why Weisz is in the war. The fact that this was the coldest winter in years and years is completely left out. Almost all historics are left out. The film is in part interesting when the two snipers chase each other, but the rest of the film can`t really decide if it is a war-movie or love-story, and there just is to many weak points.

No one does anything for any real reason, which is the strangest part, except Hannibal.Also, Hannibal is the only character that is cool, funny, and dare I say, human.  All the other characters seem more like caricatures, and Moore was terrible as Agent Starling.This movie got 6 stars JUST for Anthony Hopkins and he is certainly the best part about the film.  He makes you forget that the plot goes no where and after 2 1\/2 hours the movie was no closer to resolving itself than it was in the beginning.

Amusing moments, decent script, some nice production, the film begins with a girl who is raised alone and lonely, away from other schoolchildren, and as a result enjoys her solitude although she is fascinated by the world around her. She learns to love helping others and does so in creative ways, sometimes straining credibility. Designed to pull on the heart strings, it does so somewhat effectively.

It was an overall good movie, but there are just too many conflicting emotions to decide whether you liked it in the end.  It's a story about a young mother (Diane Lane), and her family in the late 60's Woodstock era.  She somehow feels unfulfilled and starts having an affair with the hippy blouse-man (even though the decision to have the affair made the viewer think she was all kinds of easy, Viggo Mortensen would certainly entice any restless woman).  So, as the story goes along, you don't know really what to feel towards Lane's character, Pearl.  In a way, you think she should just wait til what she sent around comes back her way, but there's something about her character that makes you at least understand why she did it.  But then, you realize the turmoil her husband has to go through, and you realize that it's not fair, moral, right, or anything, and then the film makes you think it's all his fault for being square and just boring or something.  When you think about the ending to this movie, which I will not say, you wonder why it ended the way it did. If you like this movie a whole whole bunch while you're watching it...when the ending comes, you won't expect it, and you won't agree with it.  It may not affect the way you feel about this film, but it certainly will make you think.  Overall, still a good movie despite its obvious flaws.  Great acting from all the cast, and a good feel for the free love environment of the 60's.  And some very nicely done love scenes that more or less reduce the screen to a slow simmer.  I would not recommend this to couples who want a romantic movie to watch together, because it will just make you feel all kinds of weird by the time it's over.

I knew that I loved THE SIXTH SENSE and that was enough to give M. Night Shyamalan's latest flick a try.  I'm glad I did.The movie is not about aliens in the way you might be expecting it to be--explaining their origins, their circles in the crops, why they're coming to earth, etc.  So if that's what you're wanting in a movie you're sure to be disappointed.  Rather, the aliens provide an excellent backdrop to the story of Father Graham Hess' (Mel Gibson) rediscovery of something very precious that he lost (what that is I won't divulge.)  Their coming to earth gives Hess the chance to understand some things about life and come out of the myst of sadness and despair that had clouded his life.That said, I'd like to point out some of the excellent points about the movie.  First of all--the acting.  It is very well done.  Mel Gibson is awesome as kind of a spooked out guy trying to find out what is real and what is imagination (reminded me of his character in CONSPIRACY THEORY in a way.)  Joaquin Phoenix, who plays his brother, also does a good job.  He was able to bring the quirky brother to life.  And the two kids are excellent...the best part of the movie I would say.  Rory Culkin isn't exactly Haley Joel Osment, but he had me hooked by the end of the movie with his believeable innocence.  And Abigail Breslin as his younger sister is also excellent in her believeability.  After the acting comes the humor. That was not something I expected to find in the film, but it was there....a silly quirky humor.  It made the film roll along.  The audience would literally jump out of their seats in horror and then be laughing till their eyes teared a minute later.  It was nice after the total seriousness and dryness of THE SIXTH SENSE.Speaking of which, THE SIXTH SENSE is the better of the two films, but Shyamalan still managed to create a winner with SIGNS.  Using the tension and horror of an alien invasion, he showed how a man was able to regain his soul.  Shyamaln definitely has a talent, and I will be sure to see his future films.See the movie, know it's a fun little flick, one that may make you think a bit.

But it is nearly impossible now to relive that 'Sixth Sense moment'. Am I Jaded ? Have I become so immersed in the mechanics of movie-making that I can no longer let myself go and be swept away by a seductive movie such as Signs? I pick out the lapses in logic, or the unnecessary soap opera-ish subplots, and I become aware that I am watching a high profile gimmick and hype movie that is trying to hypnotize me. Instead, I found myself groaning about three different times. The minor league hero who couldn't make it in the big time. The father who tries to raise his kids without his mother, 'I want to stay here because this is where Mom used to live'. Then there is Mr. Shyamalan playing the guilt ridden neighbor. Once I saw him, I recognized him from being on TV, or on the DVD extras. I believe many people recognize him by now. So when he was on screen, I am watching the director acting, instead of thinking of him as the character. But then there is the whole 'What does it all mean?' suspense. The more the film paraded all it's quirky characters and their obligatory hang-ups to pass the time, the higher the anticipation for the payoff for all this waiting and near misses. So ultimately I was disappointed due to the high expectations for a big payoff (you know - Close Encounters kind of stuff), that the scant hand or leg here or there just didn't satisfy. Alas, the whole subject matter of who 'they' are and what happens is side-stepped. (You may have heard that some trailers have given it away, which is it true, but not too badly)So I believe the story could have gone through another rewrite. I would've enjoyed less soap opera and more chasing the bogeyman. And a big warning for those who are hooked by the teaser commercials, don't expect to find satisfaction for your curiosity.The few goods things to say are - Good job to Shyalaman for telling a story in his unique vision, avoiding some clichés. - A ferocious soundtrack that provides most of the special effects. - Decent spooky stuff to give you a chill once in a while.This was no better or worse than Unbreakable. I give it a 6 out of 10.Update Upon second viewing, I was able to appreciate the terrific acting and cinematography to excuse the over-the-top quirky lines here and there (such as the now infamous The Happening).

","genre":null},{"date":"3 August 2002","score":"","review":" I have been digging all those DVD extras for a while now, and have fun learning about Mr. Shyalaman as a moviemaker. But it is nearly impossible now to relive that 'Sixth Sense moment'. Am I Jaded ? Have I become so immersed in the mechanics of movie-making that I can no longer let myself go and be swept away by a seductive movie such as Signs? I pick out the lapses in logic, or the unnecessary soap opera-ish subplots, and I become aware that I am watching a high profile gimmick and hype movie that is trying to hypnotize me. Instead, I found myself groaning about three different times. The minor league hero who couldn't make it in the big time. The father who tries to raise his kids without his mother, 'I want to stay here because this is where Mom used to live'. Then there is Mr. Shyamalan playing the guilt ridden neighbor. Once I saw him, I recognized him from being on TV, or on the DVD extras. I believe many people recognize him by now. So when he was on screen, I am watching the director acting, instead of thinking of him as the character. But then there is the whole 'What does it all mean?' suspense. The more the film paraded all it's quirky characters and their obligatory hang-ups to pass the time, the higher the anticipation for the payoff for all this waiting and near misses. So ultimately I was disappointed due to the high expectations for a big payoff (you know - Close Encounters kind of stuff), that the scant hand or leg here or there just didn't satisfy. Alas, the whole subject matter of who 'they' are and what happens is side-stepped. (You may have heard that some trailers have given it away, which is it true, but not too badly)So I believe the story could have gone through another rewrite.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"3 August 2002","score":"","review":"  Very few films today bring a true feeling of realism to the silver screen. Most modern-day efforts are made up of scattered plot points and cheesy popular culture, which leaves viewers with a hollow, bored feeling.(This applies only to serious movie-goers) But every once in a while, a film comes along that has characters that work so effectively that it literally consumes your thoughts and emotions. One such film, is Pulp Fiction. The plot of this film will totally envelope your interests and eventually bring you to a point of understanding why the characters do what they do.The cast of this film is one of the most impressive that I have ever seen. Everyone(down to the smallest player)in this film is a recognizible Hollywood actor\/actress. And each of the personas are remarkably believable. What I mean by this is that when you see Vincent Vega on screen,(mobster; Travolta's character) you don't see John Travolta performing as the character Vincent Vega, you see Vincent Vega. The same goes for the rest of the cast.The soundtrack is another high-note for this film. The music for this film sets the mood perfectly for every scene of this masterpiece. From the Spanish sounding, Tango inspired Miserloo beginning to the soulful sounds of Al Green's Let's Stay Together permeating in the barroom scene, this film's soundtrack soars high over any big orchestra crescendo.The story takes place in L.A., one of the most crime-ridden cities known to man. The story surrounds two hitmen, two disgruntled bank robbers, a crime boss and his wife, and a burned out boxer at the end of his career.I would love to blabber on about what happens in this brilliant indie film, but I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone who has yet to see it. All I can do as a faithful servant of the cinema is to highly recommend this film to all film-goers. It is quite a long film that is broken into chapters, so if you find it hard to follow the movie Memento (which I also highly suggest)you should just watch this movie several more times and pay closer attention!!! Please, do yourself the favor of a lifetime and see this movie!

I saw it cold, not knowing anything about it, on a flight home from London in late July 2002, and liked it so much that I plan to see it on the big screen and also to buy it as my first DVD!The film takes place in Paris and, though the folks speak with French accents, the dialogue in the American version is in English. A breathless narrator explains in a matter-of-fact style how Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is born into a family where the only physical contact she gets is from her father's monitoring her heartbeat; how her Mother dies in a freak suicide that unwittingly kills the unsuspecting Mother as well; the backgrounds of eccentric characters; and narrates on and off as necessary.Amélie is a quiet and lovable character from the moment we see her as a child.  Her childhood is covered quickly and the film is mainly set in Paris with Amélie in her, I suppose, 20s, working as a waitress.  Her innocent charm, those oh-so-large eyes, the curious characters, and her desire to anonymously help others (and the webs she weaves to accomplish this) all make for a delighful film.Don't miss this fairy tale of a film!  It has something for everybody - intriguing plot with an underlying quirky humor, fascinating characters, good soundtrack, and a heartwarming story. I'm surprised the film garnered an R rating; I can't see what would be offensive in the least even for a teenager or pre-teen (except possibly one well-done scene where the rhythms of a couple's sexual union are aurally evidenced in the cafe).  I would give it a 9.5 or 9.6 out of 10!
