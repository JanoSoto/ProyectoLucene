This is one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen it, if a friend comes over and it happens to be mentioned that he or she didn't, the movie is going in the DVD player.I like most all of wes anderson's stuff, but Rushmore is at the top of the heap in my opinion. They all have the same quirky humor (and most have bill murray too), so if you don't like one, you probably won't like another. But if you do like one, you'll like them all, and there are plenty.Bottom line, rent it, buy it, whatever, if you haven't seen it, see it somehow.
