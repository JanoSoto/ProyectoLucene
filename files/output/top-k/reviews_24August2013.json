They can't tell the truth, even to themselves.Rashomon was the first film from critically acclaimed Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa, that I got to see. I was expecting some great things from this film considering it ranks among the best films in history. The black and white cinematography was breathtaking and there were some great long shots, but the story fell flat and the performances here were a bit theatrical for my taste. The film is only 85 minutes long, but it seemed to drag forever. The film was made in 1950 so I can imagine there were several inventive elements incorporated here, but they really don't stand out today because we've seen those tricks so many times now. For example, it is claimed that this was the first time that a camera was pointed directly at the sun, but of course that doesn't have an effect on the viewer today. However, I've seen many other classic films which I thought still managed to seduce me and have timed really well, but it wasn't the case with Rashomon. The film focuses on different realities and perceptions about humanity, but in doing so it really never manages to find a deep meaning. It focuses on the lies we tell, our selfish desires, and our pursuit or need to believe in the goodness of humanity (reflected through the Priest in this film), but ultimately it plays down to discovering that sometimes reality is just a matter of perception and differing point of views. Rashomon is a reflection of life, and life does not always have clear meaning, is what Kurosawa would say about this film when approached about its meaning. What I can say about Rashomon is that the cinematography is great and the lighting effects were also astonishing for its time. The film takes place during a heavy rain storm (classic trade mark from Kurosawa) as a priest (Minoru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) are taking refuge from the rain and talking about a terrible crime that has been committed. A peasant (Kichijiro Ueda) who is unfamiliar with what they are talking about joins the conversation and the two men recount the events of what they consider the most horrific crime they have experienced. The woodcutter happened to discover the body of a samurai three days ago as he walked across the woods and was summoned to testify at a trial for the samurai's murder. The priest also has to testify since he had run into the samurai (Machiko Kyo) and his wife (Masayuki Mori) as they were passing through the town before the murder took place. The woodcutter and the priest then recount what they heard from the three direct witnesses of the murder the suspected bandit Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) who apparently raped the wife and killed the samurai, the wife, and the samurai himself who testifies through a medium. They all give different accounts of what took place, and each account is as unreasonable as the next. The story is told in the form of flashbacks through the perception of each witness.The main issue I had with the film is that the horrendous crime never felt like it was that terrible or memorable to begin with. It was just a common crime, a terrible one, but nothing to have an existential or philosophical debate about. Besides the main concern they had wasn't because a murder was committed but rather that everyone seemed to be lying about what happened. They couldn't find a reasonable explanation for an unreasonable act. The flashbacks were sort of interesting despite me not liking the performances, and I really liked the fighting choreography staged near the end between the bandit and the samurai. It was nothing you would expect from a Japanese samurai film. That was probably my favorite scene in this film and it had some funny moments as well. I can see the influence the director has had in modern films like Vantage Point or The Usual Suspects, but despite that I had a difficult time carrying about this movie. Well I guess I'm on the minority here, but Kurosawa would have to accept my opinion and the perception I had of this film because that is what this film is really about differing perceptions of what we believe to be real.

When people ask who we are, what do we say? What is our name, occupation, maybe we mention some hobbies. But what if they ask, no but really, who are you?, most people become lost. What do you mean, who am I? I told you my name and occupation. But I don't think our name shows truly who we are. I mean, there are a lot of people with the same names or the same occupation or both and they are still different. So what makes our identity? The main character Nikita is also faced with this question. After her crimes she is sentenced to death and later wakes up to be told that she will be enrolled into special agent training. That means she is dead to the outer world and belongs to the secret world of spies and assassins. So she has to create herself all over again, she has to follow certain rules, act in certain ways only to pass. Of course, at some point she is forced to change. She can't tell anyone what she does, not even her name. And that is quite difficult as our name and activity are usually the main keys that we use to define ourselves to the outer world.So what happens when you are stripped down from this luxury? Well, you become secretive, you have something like an identity crisis. You think you know who you are, other people think they know who you are, but those two do not match.

NO and he was proved to have a lasting impact with the success of FROM Russia WITH LOVE in 1963. The series officially found its stride with 1964's GOLDFINGER and followed it up with what many people consider one of the best 007 films in 1965 THUNDERBALL. I don't share this affection for Bond's adventures in the Bahamas. Instead, I was bored out of my mind. I hate to say it because director Terence Young is had a good track record with the character until this point. My belief is that THUNDERBALL arrived at a point where 007 movies were a cultural phenomenon and came with a massive budget (for the period) and he went a little nuts with the cash, foregoing substance for style. The movie kicks off with an elongated sequence in which, for once, we watch every major phase of SPECTRE's plan in action. Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi) has organized a hijacking of two NATO atomic weapons and SPECTRE declares that cities in both the United States and England will be destroyed unless a sizeable ransom is paid. James Bond (Sean Connery, returning) is dispatched to Nassau in the Bahamas to locate a woman named Domino (Claudine Auger) who might have ties to the men behind the hijacking. From there, we are subjected to more than two hours of mind-numbing investigations and an overwrought climactic final scuba battle between Largo's men and the U.S. military forces.THUNDERBALL is one of the harder 007 movies for me to comment on because, and I'm not exaggerating, this movie bores me to the point where I have a hard time paying full attention to it. So there is probably a good deal I might have overlooked that add to the quality of the movie. The first 45 minutes of the movie are pretty cool with the focus being on SPECTRE's operation. Normally, we might get a glimpse of the plan in action as the warheads are seized by enemy forces but THUNDERBALL gives us insight into a meeting of SPECTRE's top officials, the preparation stages of the heist, and even allows us to watch the full plan go into effect while we cut back and forth to Bond's recovery in a rehabilitation center where he's slowly made aware of the evil-doings going on in the next room. But by the time 007 arrives in the Bahamas, every sort of slows down. His investigation into the missing warheads and his run- ins with Largo and his minions, including the beautiful Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) and silent Vargas, are fun enough and are generally on par with the secret agent fun of the first three movies. The real problem is the entire final act of the movie where Bond and some U.S. forces engage Largo and his men in a long, drawn-out underwater battle. It's horrendously paced and essentially shot in slow motion with a single movement taking twice as long as men attack each other clumsily while trying not tangle their scuba gear.There are a handful of underwater sequences in the film, and this is where I believe Young went a little overboard. I imagine the sequences were meant to give the film an epic feel and an exotic look but all they end up doing is killing my interest. Maybe it amazed audiences in 1965 who weren't accustomed to seeing such detailed underwater choreography, but I was born almost twenty years after this movie debuted. Underwater battles don't amaze me, especially lumbering labors like the sequences in THUNDERBALL. It doesn't help that Largo isn't a villain as memorable as any that came before him. Dr. No was a seriously creepy dude, Red Grant was a stone cold killer, and Auric Goldfinger was overly extravagant and larger than life. Emilio Largo is&#x85;a man with an eye-patch. Celi does well enough giving him an evil vibe but he just doesn't leave any sort of impression. Honestly, for years after first seeing the movie I couldn't even remember who the villain of the film was without looking it up. I have the same problem with Claudine Auger as the movie's Bond woman, Dominique Domino Derval. She's definitely beautiful but she doesn't bring anything special enough to the role to help her stand out from the ever-growing list of beautiful Bond girls. In the end, THUNDERBALL is just a blend of mediocre ingredients mixed together to create a stylish adventure without any stand-out performances or memorable moments that sort of lazily rode the wave of 007-mania that was hitting hard in the mid-60's.

Normally, we might get a glimpse of the plan in action as the warheads are seized by enemy forces but THUNDERBALL gives us insight into a meeting of SPECTRE's top officials, the preparation stages of the heist, and even allows us to watch the full plan go into effect while we cut back and forth to Bond's recovery in a rehabilitation center where he's slowly made aware of the evil-doings going on in the next room. But by the time 007 arrives in the Bahamas, every sort of slows down. His investigation into the missing warheads and his run- ins with Largo and his minions, including the beautiful Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) and silent Vargas, are fun enough and are generally on par with the secret agent fun of the first three movies. The real problem is the entire final act of the movie where Bond and some U.S. forces engage Largo and his men in a long, drawn-out underwater battle. It's horrendously paced and essentially shot in slow motion with a single movement taking twice as long as men attack each other clumsily while trying not tangle their scuba gear.There are a handful of underwater sequences in the film, and this is where I believe Young went a little overboard. I imagine the sequences were meant to give the film an epic feel and an exotic look but all they end up doing is killing my interest. Maybe it amazed audiences in 1965 who weren't accustomed to seeing such detailed underwater choreography, but I was born almost twenty years after this movie debuted. Underwater battles don't amaze me, especially lumbering labors like the sequences in THUNDERBALL. It doesn't help that Largo isn't a villain as memorable as any that came before him. Dr. No was a seriously creepy dude, Red Grant was a stone cold killer, and Auric Goldfinger was overly extravagant and larger than life. Emilio Largo is&#x85;a man with an eye-patch. Celi does well enough giving him an evil vibe but he just doesn't leave any sort of impression. Honestly, for years after first seeing the movie I couldn't even remember who the villain of the film was without looking it up. I have the same problem with Claudine Auger as the movie's Bond woman, Dominique Domino Derval. She's definitely beautiful but she doesn't bring anything special enough to the role to help her stand out from the ever-growing list of beautiful Bond girls. In the end, THUNDERBALL is just a blend of mediocre ingredients mixed together to create a stylish adventure without any stand-out performances or memorable moments that sort of lazily rode the wave of 007-mania that was hitting hard in the mid-60's.

This film was a major, groundbreaking film during the late 70's and early 80's. MANY people hated it passionately, while many of us that were young and rebellious heralded it. As you likely already know, it was an adaptation for film from the musical, The Rocky Horror Show, but little was changed of significance during adaptation. For nothing else, this film deserves full stars for audience interaction like none other. It was and remains as the supreme cult classic. Today, one can watch similar risqué material on a cartoon channel, without being surprised. But back then, we didn't have nearly as much of the outrageous in our entertainment that we have today. Sure, 'Jesus Christ Superstar' and 'Hair' pushed some boundaries, but we didn't have the amount of competing stimulus as is present today. The media was very tightly controlled, and we were inhibited and repressed by this as to what was acceptable. This musical would not have been possible without the influences of the narrated Sci-Fi B movies (and the humor of how ridiculous they were), British programming of shows like Monty Python's Flying Circus, and the hippies and musicians of the late 60's & early 70's.I had long hair back then, and that was a radical thing to do, because family fought over such matters. Seriously, the television shows of our youth would not even show a husband and wife in the same bed without them having to keep at least one foot on the ground. We were raised to believe that sex was a dirty thing by our government and many of the social customs that seemed left over from the decisions made by the Council of Trent and the Inquisition of the Dark Ages.I admit that I tried my only hit of LSD in my life on the day of my first viewing of this film in a theater back in 1978. When those red lips came on the big screen singing, it blew my mind, because it was so novel. Then, the story continued to work away further at the constructs in my mind. When it transitioned us from a wedding in a conservative, rural setting, to entering the Frankenstein place with Dr Frank-N-Furter, a transvestite from the planet transsexual of the galaxy Transylvania, in a hot drag outfit, pushing boundaries about sexuality, music & dance styles, some of the mind-fabrications from our culture that needed to be questioned, were falling down. When the audience began shouting phrases, holding up umbrellas, throwing toast, carrying around virgins, it occurred to me that this was a profound moment in my life. We were up dancing together, as a community, to Let's Do the Time Warp Again, and I had never experienced anything close to it. Wouldn't it be grand if a new production had the ability to get people to unite together dancing in a movie theater?The scene where Janet wants to get dirty with Rocky, singing, Toucha Toucha Toucha Touch Me, tells much of the story on its own. She was overly repressed, and viewed sex as dirty due to her upbringing, and wanted to be dirty. She and Brad were exposed to events and people they could never have even imagined based on their upbringing. In some ways, we were rebelling and being dirty to a degree by just being at the show.The musical gets more ludicrous in the Sci-Fi, B movie style. I don't think the particulars of the story matter much, so don't be upset that you may miss some of the story due to the audience being radical. I am a major fan of both Sci-Fi and musicals, as that was what our generation had available Elvis, Bing Cosby, West Side Story, The Wizard of Oz, etc. I acted & sang my heart out in musicals. Plus, I grew up cultured by my parents with theater. But, the musicals were mostly wholesome. This musical was turning our definition of wholesome on its head. Now, when I watch it, it seems strange to me that it doesn't really contain anything I wouldn't want my grand-children to see. Similar risqué material is shown during regular family watching hours now. It really does not contain anything shocking for today, but back then, the shockwaves ran deep and long. If you are a Rocky Horror Picture Show virgin I read one of the top reviews that suggested that it should be watched on video first. I dissent with this, as I tried that approach with a RHPS virgin back in the 80's, shortly after I was married. I watched this film with my then wife (and current friend) on VHS. Seeing it for the first time on our television, without the audience, seemed lame to her. I tried to add to the experience with my shouts in the living-room, but no props in the house. It just fell flat. My suggestion for virgins to this show is to go to the theater, without reading any further reviews, and make certain everyone knows you are a RHPS virgin, so they can take care of you. Don't mind if you get carried around with your legs spread open, as happens in some places. You are in for a treat! DRUG DISCLAIMER Just because my LSD experience was profound with this picture, I am not promoting you to take any hallucinogens before you watch it. My only reason for mentioning it is due to the cultural significance of hallucinogens back then. Very shortly after my first viewing of this picture, I had a very bad trip when someone snuck some Angel-Dust into a bowl of weed we were smoking, and it messed me up for several very scary days that you would not wish to endure.

It is his story. Unfortunately, Luke's story tends to diminish the other character's stories in the first Star Wars trilogy.

Ferris Bueller just end up being just Ferris Bueller by the end of the film, while Cameron grows as a character. This comedy movie written, produced and directed by John Hughes tells the story of Ferris Bueller who decides to skip school and spend the day in downtown Chicago, while not getting catch by Dean of Students Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) or Ferris' sarcastic sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) . It's just another day in the life of Ferris Bueller. While, normal fans think that the movie is just that. A simple plot. Others think, the events of the day are really happening in Cameron Frye's mind. Ferris Bueller and even Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) might just be made up in Cameron's mind to feel the void of no- friends. This might be taken serious due to the fact that Cameron is clearly older (Ruck was 29 playing 17) have no girlfriend, lonely, and has a control freak of a father. Ferris is the total opposite of Cameron he's fun, spontaneous and has a loving family and sexy girlfriend. I don't really like Ferris due to his unrealistic nature. Truly he is unsympathetic prodigal son, leaping out of the nest at breakneck speed with flagrant disregard to everything except his own inner pleasure-seeker without judgment. It's Cameron that is the punching bag of events, taking all the risk. While, Ferris act sick to get out of school, Cameron is sick. This theory explains the more fantastic elements of the film such as the breaking of the fourth wall or unexplained events. For example, the whole city of Chicago rallies around the sick Ferris. This represents Cameron's dejected home life and how he yearns for people to care for him. This might also might represent what Cameron thinks the popular kids at school are like. The world revolves around them. Most of the film has Cameron wearing a medical insignia t-shirt. By the end of the film, the medical insignia, is inside out. Perhaps saying he doesn't need the medical help anymore, he has set himself on the path to correcting his life and facing his father. This film might be a comedy, but it's a thinking man comedy. There was the odd scene with Cameron was fixated on the little girl in Georges Seurat's 'A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte' painting. Does it any deeper meaning or just pointless. Cameron might see his life in pointillism, a technique of painting using small dots, hence the zoom in. That's kind of a discouraging thought. Unless, perhaps this was Cameron's mental journey towards understanding. In a way, that really works with this theory. The closer you look at the movie, the more everything looks like abstract blemishes on the fabric of Cameron's mind. When you're just observing the movie without thinking too deeply about it, it's just Ferris and his friends having a day running around Chicago. But the closer you look, the less things appear to be what we're shown. Actually, even before I did notice near the end that Ferris and Cameron had a bit of a role reversal when the car went over the edge. In that scene, Ferris, the always calm confident guy was scared and Cameron stepped up as the calm confident guy. Almost as though there was a momentary persona swap as though Cameron where beginning to reconcile himself, drawing Ferris strengths into himself and offloading his weaknesses into Ferris. Fascinating. Anyway, it's a cute theory, though probably not what John Hughes had in mind. The humor is so funny that it is often parody or use in other movies. The acting from all the cast is spot on. This movie is a tour guide of Chicago as it feature many famous Chicago landmarks including the then Sears Tower, Wrigley Field and the Art Institute of Chicago. I like how Wrigley Field had a Ferris Bueller's Day game in 2011. John Hughes wanted to film a scene where Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron go to a strip club. Paramount scrapped it. Honestly, that would have made the movie way more interesting than it supposed to have. I love the 1961 Ferrari GT California. I hope to get one, one day to drive around Chicago. Things I didn't like about the film no character development for Ferris. All fun, but no work ethic. It might be telling kids, it's OK to have fun, it's not like you have to work a little to have that fun. I dig the Danke Schoen and Twist and Shout songs, just not the over the top parade scene. It felt too cheesy. I did like the 'Oh Yeah' song as well. The soundtrack is amazing. The movie was so popular, it got a short live TV show in 1990's with a then unknown Jennifer Aniston, a 2011's documentary and even an Super Bowl commercial in 2012. Overall it has the spirit of effortless escapism. Like Ferris Bueller said on his day off, Find the joy in life, because Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it!' So don't miss out on seeing this film.

After the chilling opening with a narrator giving us some info on past serial killers with a creepy musical score, I was ready to dig in and go along with the ride, but what followed was a depressing disappointment. What was the background of Roy & Bo? We get very little insight as to what has made these guys snap, other than a difficult few years in High School, and parents who have neglected them. Most of the movie forces you to follow Roy & Bo around Los Angeles with a pointless killing spree. Despite top billing, Charlie Sheen is not the main star. He shares top billing with Maxwell Caulfield. The main problem I had was with Roy (Maxwell Caulfield) He is a whiny, unsympathetic person who I was begging to see get his. The movie tried to portray him as a sociopath with a screw the world type attitude, but instead they made him into an annoying loser. I think the world sucks some days, but am I suddenly gonna turn into a killer? Get real. Charlie Sheen is a little more bearable. He's a miserable soul himself, but not quite as bad as Roy is. We also get slightly obsolete terms such as Fag the gay subtext can't be denied, and stuff you would never see in movies today. An old lady gets drilled in the head and cut open with a beer bottle. It tries way too hard to be offensive, and in the end I just didn't care. We also get some idiotic symbolism at the end that ties in with the beginning of the film, but I was just glad it was over.

Both underperformed at the box office. While Emperor has gone on to be one of the most beloved modern Disney films, El Dorado is still only a cult film. That's a real shame, because it's a fun ride with snappy dialogue and cool characters.If I have any complaints, then it's that the mixing of traditional animation and CG has dated badly. Most of the musical numbers are forgettable and could have been done away with. Luckily, those issues don't hurt the picture much.

So I started with the famous Silence of the Lamb.If you are familiar with this movie, you probably know the plot FBI agent Clarise Starling plaeyd by Jodie Foster needs the help of an incarcerated prisoner Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins to catch a serial killer on the loose.So what was most interesting for me is that people aren't what they seem from the first impression. Yes, we see Clarise training but that is because she is the character with whom we are growing together, the main character. She is running through the forest what might be a metaphor that she is trying to defeat evil as forest always was a gloomy and scary place where monsters were hiding. But that is not how she is viewed by others. There are various scenes where she is the only woman in male company and everybody is looking at her as if she is not capable of anything, but she proves them wrong.On the other hand we see Hannibal as a calm person standing in his cell. You could not tell that this person is a heartless murderer who eats his victims. But that's what everybody knows about him. And that is why he is in the cell. Later we see his change when he attacks the guards, but I think more important is his entrance scene. It is just radiating with innocence, but you still have this feeling that something is wrong. Maybe it's not the cell, but most probably it's how he looks, how he smiles. But that you notice just a bit later.So that's what I saw in this movie &#x96; the difference between first impression and true people's nature. It's a bit scary how wrong can we sometimes be. Maybe next time we will regard the innocent looking person with more care.

An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance.There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'.I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996).The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more.Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat. If you love romance and are sick of the new age vampire romance bullshit and yearn for classic romance then this is the film for you.I've tried not to put any spoilers though one or two may have found themselves in.
