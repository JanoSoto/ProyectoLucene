[{"date":"5 January 2012","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" All Quiet on the Western Front was perhaps the first great war epic of the cinema- certainly the first great war epic of the talkie era. It was based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, published only the year before. (The phenomenon of film-makers raiding the best-seller lists for inspiration is nothing new). The familiar English title of both book and film is the one assigned to it by Remarque's translator Arthur Wheen, and is something of a mistranslation. Remarque's original title was Im Westen Nichts Neues, or Nothing New in the West, meaning no change in the military situation. The film opens in a boys' high school in a small German town in 1914. We see a schoolmaster named Kantorek giving his pupils an impassioned speech, urging them to join the Army and fight for their country. Kantorek ends his peroration with Horace's line Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori (It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country), a line which to English-speaking audiences in 1930 would have recalled Wilfred Owen's poem in which he describes this sentiment as the old lie. Almost to a man, the boys are persuaded to join up, and we follow their progress through the war, especially that of the main character, Paul Baumer. (In the novel his surname was Bäumer; perhaps the American actors failed to realise that the umlaut above the a makes a difference to the German pronunciation. Several names, in fact, are mispronounced; Mueller, for example, is pronounced to rhyme with colour). We see how early enthusiasm for the war was replaced by disillusionment, at least among those who actually had to do the fighting. One by one Paul's companions are killed or severely wounded, and the mood of the survivors becomes embittered. Their preoccupations are not honour and glory but firstly survival and secondly getting enough food. Only on the home front does enthusiasm for the war persist; visiting his home town on leave Paul is disgusted to see Kantorek giving the same speech to another class of students, who react with the same patriotic zeal as he and his classmates. In a film from this period one would not expect the same degree of realism in battle scenes as in a modern film such as Saving Private Ryan, although Steven Spielberg has stated that Lewis Milestone's film was an inspiration for his own. There is, however, one surprisingly good action sequence featuring a French attack on the German trenches, although the most effective scenes are often those, like the one in the hospital and the one where Paul addresses the dead French soldier he has killed, which do not involve any actual fighting. Although there are many grim moments, the film's tone is not unremittingly grim. Scenes of bloodshed and pathos are interspersed with those containing a certain, often satirical, humour, such discussion between the soldiers as to the causes of the war. (They conclude that the best way of solving international disputes would be for the kings and politicians to fight among themselves after stripping down to their underwear). Perhaps the best acting performance comes from Louis Wolheim as Stanislaus Katczinsky, a gruff, cynical older soldier who becomes Paul's closest friend and who, even in the early days of the war, embodies a spirit of sardonic disillusionment. (His surname suggests that he is an ethnic Pole who, while nominally a German citizen, has little loyalty to the German cause). To make a war film from a German viewpoint and which treats its German protagonists with humanity and understanding was, in some ways, a brave move in 1930, only a dozen years after the press in America and other Allied nations had been abusing the Germans as beastly Huns. Yet to tell an anti-war story from the German side was, in other ways, politically expedient. Such a story told from an American viewpoint might have been attacked as unpatriotic, as implying that the Allied cause had not been a just one and that the American soldiers who had laid down their lives in 1917-18 had done so to no good end. America, Britain and France had their own Kantoreks- Owen's poem was aimed at one of them, the jingoistic poetaster Jessie Pope- but such people are never mentioned in the film. Audiences might have inferred that God, king and country, or the war to end all wars were slogans as empty as Gott mit uns or Deutschland über Alles, but Milestone never spells this out directly. Following the bloodshed of World War I, pacifist sentiment was widespread in the twenties and early thirties, and the film takes the same strongly anti-war stance as Remarque's novel. This message was highly popular in 1930; the critic of Variety wrote that The League of Nations could make no better investment than to buy up the master-print, reproduce it in every language, to be shown in all the nations until the word war is taken out of the dictionaries. Yet we now know this was not to be. To quote another Latin tag, tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis. (Times change, and we change with them). Less than a decade after the film was made, the world was to be plunged into a second war, even bloodier than the first. Lewis Milestone's contribution to that war would be to make patriotic pro-Allied propaganda films such as North Star and The Purple Heart, demonising the Germans and Japanese as monsters in human form. It might be unfair to accuse Milestone of deliberate hypocrisy- he was far from being the only ex-pacifist to have his pacifism tested to destruction by the savage inhumanity of Nazism- but there is a certain irony in the fact that the cinema's great chronicler of the First World War should have become one of America's Kantoreks of the Second. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 January 2012","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" All Quiet on the Western Front was perhaps the first great war epic of the cinema- certainly the first great war epic of the talkie era.

I wonder if you wonder. Every time I hear Walter Neff say those words to Phyllis Dietrichson as their initial encounter concludes, I smile and settle in for another round of Double Indemnity (1944) ... one of my all-time favorites. Though I have seen it many times over the years, I recently saw it for the first time on the big screen ... and from a 35mm print! So much of the subtle filmmaking becomes apparent - the variance of lighting, the intensity of shadows, and the vividness of close-ups. This reinforces my belief that we should never miss an opportunity to view good films in a theatre setting ... just as the director intended.Since this film was released 67 years ago, it's difficult to discuss without noting a key plot point or character reaction. If you haven't seen it and plan to, you might stop reading here. If you would like a little insight, then let's keep going. Billy Wilder (left) directed the film and his place as a Hollywood legend is quite secure. He was nominated for 21 Oscars (Director, Writer, Producer) and had 3 wins. Some of his classics are The Lost Weekend, Sunset Blvd, Witness for the Prosecution, Some Like it Hot, The Apartment, The Front Page. Many think of Wilder as a comedic filmmaker and he certainly had success in that genre, but if you watch closely, even his comedies have a dark element to them.Double Indemnity is based on the novella by James M Cain, who also wrote Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Wilder was a fan of Cain's book, but knew the dialogue wouldn't work well on screen. So together with Raymond Chandler they wrote a screenplay filled with crackling lines and a constant feeling of dread and pending doom. As great as the script is, it is heightened by a wonderful cast that includes Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G Robinson, Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines and Byron Barr.For me, MacMurray's performance is what brings the words to life and jumps the film to the must see category. He is playing against two Hollywood heavyweights in Stanwyck and Robinson, but we are somehow sympathetic to this not-so-bright guy who gets played like a fiddle by the villainous, wily woman he lusts after. Even as he is recording his confession, a part of us understands how he got drawn into MURDER! Not just any murder, but one for money and love ... only there is no money, and there is no love.Ms. Stanwyck is perfectly cast as the femme fatale who weaves her web of deceit and destruction. She quickly spots the vulnerability of MacMurray's character and uses her assets just enough to hold the leash tight. It is a testament to her screen presence that she can pull off the sultry siren while sporting a less-than-desirable blonde wig. At the time, the wig was so controversial that the producers compared it to George Washington and wanted it trashed. However, filming was too far along and now it's impossible to imagine her looking any other way. Besides, MacMurray only seems to notice her anklet!Edward G Robinson made a name for himself as a tough-guy actor ... cop and mobster all rolled into one. Here he plays the insurance investigator with a sixth-sense for fraudulent claims. He is a hard-nosed, dedicated employee who takes his responsibility very seriously and has no sympathy for those who cheat his cherished system. He has a soft spot for co-worker MacMurray, even though he is one of the back-slapping salesmen he so loathes. Their relationship in the film is one of respect and about as close as two professional men could be, given the era. When Robinson goes off on his rant about suicide research, he is a joy to behold. This guy could flat chew scenery.In addition to the infamous wig, you might also notice that MacMurray is wearing a wedding band throughout the film, even though his character is clearly a single man. Wilder and MacMurray stated many times over the years that was simply a mistake and not caught until post-production. Expect a chuckle when MacMurray, as the narrator, enviously describes a Spanish style Los Angeles home as costing $30,000 ... probably less than the property taxes would be on that house today. The film originally was to end with MacMurray in the Gas Chamber and Robinson looking on (inset), but this was deemed inappropriate.

Another prime example of Film Noir would be The Big Sleep (1946), based on a Raymond Chandler novel, directed by Howard Hawks, and starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While Film Noir might not be an easily definable term, there are certain elements that must be present. Lighting is key. Shadows must be prevalent. Some type of detective story is usually at the center, and we typically get some poor schlub of a guy being yanked around by the femme fatale. The right mood is essential ... as a viewer we know things are headed down the wrong path, but we just can't save the characters from their own poor choices. But neither can we look away.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"5 January 2012","score":"","review":" American cinema in the 1970's revealed a more personal, gritty, and quite often profoundly moving. This was in part due to the changing of the guard at the studios that began happening in the 1960's. The Moguls that had created the studio system, and also the golden age of cinema, were leaving, and the studios were being sold off to corporations that had no connection to the cinema industry. This led to a multi-million dollar industry being run by companies such as Coca-Cola; therefore, the studios were being run by people who did not know what makes money. Fantastically for the new film makers, this led to a certain amount of freedom, and produced some of the most challenging and interesting films. It seems to me that this all occurred simultaneously with some interesting social and political challenges in the real world.In the media throughout the 1970's, there were many stories about political kidnappings (such as the well-known Patty Hearst kidnapping that had the world gripped through the bizarre change in the newspaper heiress and socialite who eventually became a member of the terrorist gang), and of course the biggest political story of the decade, the Watergate incident. This latter event highlighted the inconsistencies of political power, and (along with the JFK assassination in 1963) almost essentially created the conspiracy theory - and the modern political conspiracy was born, and is now a popular part of culture. So it seems incredible today that under this atmosphere of paranoia, and particularly with the corporate mergers of industries, that Network was made - a film that is mainly about a television network that is going through changes after a corporate merger\/takeover.I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore! This is the mantra of Howard Beale (Peter Finch who won a posthumous best actor Oscar for this role), anchorman of the UBS Evening News, who at the start of the film, is told that due to poor ratings, he was to be fired. On his next broadcast, Beale announces that he will kill himself in a live broadcast next Tuesday.

Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Michael Wincott, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra, Will Patton and James Cromwell-all serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this so-flawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost, he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character, no? And in the end he does the right thing, but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about that-how we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us.What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean, corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her, then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well, maybe not after all.

Series like Halloween and Friday the 13th had gravitated away from their horror routes and were now like comedies. The longevity of these series were now a running joke to the audience, and the genre needed some new life. So A Nightmare on Elm Street director Wes Craven decided to make Scream.Scream is a horror movie that is self aware. While most films in the genre are usually mocked for being so cliché, Scream celebrates it and cleverly follows the classic formula.The beginning of Scream opens up with Drew Barrymore. Many people thought that, due to the marketing campaign, she was going to be the lead role, since she was such a big name at the time. But, no, she's actually killed within 15 minutes. It's kind of a tribute to Psycho, where Janet Leigh was portrayed to be the main hero, but was abruptly killed early.So then, the film transitions over to Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell. Sidney's mother was raped and killed a year prior to the film, and as such, Sidney is in a depression. I find Capmbell's performance to be very solid for a horror film, and this is my favourite role she's been in. This is the film that launched her career. She may have a respectable resume these days, but in my heart, shes a scream queen.Sidney has a boyfriend named Billy, played by Skeet Ulrich. Neve Campbell had co-starred with him earlier that year in The Craft. In his very first scene, Billy sneaks into Sidney's room just to make-out with her. But the way he proposes it is funny as hell. Funny enough, this is probably the way I would propose it if I had a girlfriend.Then there's Sidney's best friend, Tatum, played by a young Rose McGowan. Funny to think that in 11 years, this chick would be blowing the hell out of zombies with a gun-leg in Planet Terror.Tatum's older brother, Dewey, is played by David Arquette, who is the real life older brother of Patricia Arquette. Patricia had starred in A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3 Dream Warriors. Dewey is an easily lovable character. He comes off as kinda wimpy and weak, but you just love him.Then there's Gale Weathers, played by Courtney Cox. Gale's a news reporter, but she also becomes Dewey's love interest. While the sequels expanded upon this, in the original, it seems like Gale is just using Dewey to get to Sidney for her next big story. Sidney gets so mad at Gale that she punches her square in the face. I laugh my head off every time I see this part.But the man who steals the whole film is Randy, played by Jamie Kennedy. Randy is a film buff, always overflowing with film references and great humour. Randy is probably my favourite film character of all time. Mostly cause I can relate to him. Being a film buff myself, I know the mindset, and thats my favourite part about Randy. He's always in movie-mode.The finale is a 40 minute long build up, sprinkled with a kill here and there, and it keeps you guessing at who the killer really is. Speaking of which, I haven't even talked about the killer yet.The killer's costume was an actual real life Halloween costume that was already popular before the movie. It's kinda like the original Halloween, where the filmmakers went out, just bought a random mask from the store, and used it for the movie. Reusing this technique was very smart in my opinion, cause it truly gives the feeling that the killer could be anyone.Overall, I love this movie. While it's in no way a masterpiece of horror cinema, the modern age owes a lot to Scream. It revitalized the slasher genre and brought a new audience's attention back to the classics. It's not a landmark, but it's a pretty solid horror film. Check it out.

Probably my favourite zombie movie of all time and one of my favourite horror movies altogether, Braindead is an absolute blast to watch.Braindead takes place in a small town in New Zealand. The film is about an old woman who gets bitten my a Sumatran Rat Monkey, composed of dreaded stop-motion effects. Soon after being bitten she dies but returns from the dead as a zombie. The woman runs around infecting (and sometimes eating) dogs, neighboors, and friends and family. It is only up to her socially awkward son Lionel to stop her. Along to help Lionel is his girlfriend he meets days before.Braindead contains some of the most hilarious scenes of all time. There is one scene of a zombie baby being tossed around in a park as residents look in horror at what Lionel is doing to this baby of his. Of course it isn't his baby though, it is the baby of two zombies. How did they end up having this baby? Take a guess. While everyone else is watching Lionel beat this baby off of poles and such, there is a drunken guy who is cheering him on.A lot of the characters who put the comedy into the film didn't have very big roles at all. As mentioned before, the homeless drunk in the park has little to know role in the film whatsoever and is mainly there for comedy. But sometimes it isn't the characters who aren't funny, it's the scenes themselves. Kind of like when a priest is fighting a bunch of zombies using martial arts. Or one of the most gruesome scenes of all time when the main character slices zombies up with a lawnmower.Unlike a lot of other zombie movies, this one didn't have a dark feel to it. It was actually a feel good movie. But it was hard to take seriously over the comedy. However there are some emotionally intense scenes in it. Point is, don't expect to take this very seriously because you aren't getting a serious movie.It's a classic and there is no doubt about it. Can you go wrong with zombie movies? Not really. The scenes were classic. They were incredibly hilarious and always make me laugh. The costume designs were terrible but great at the same time while the stop motion effects were just plain awesome.

When I mention this is one of Peter Jackson's first films they automatically assume it will be like his Lord of the Rings trilogy. No, this is unlike anything else Jackson has ever done. Probably my favourite zombie movie of all time and one of my favourite horror movies altogether, Braindead is an absolute blast to watch.Braindead takes place in a small town in New Zealand. The film is about an old woman who gets bitten my a Sumatran Rat Monkey, composed of dreaded stop-motion effects. Soon after being bitten she dies but returns from the dead as a zombie. The woman runs around infecting (and sometimes eating) dogs, neighboors, and friends and family. It is only up to her socially awkward son Lionel to stop her. Along to help Lionel is his girlfriend he meets days before.Braindead contains some of the most hilarious scenes of all time. There is one scene of a zombie baby being tossed around in a park as residents look in horror at what Lionel is doing to this baby of his. Of course it isn't his baby though, it is the baby of two zombies. How did they end up having this baby? Take a guess. While everyone else is watching Lionel beat this baby off of poles and such, there is a drunken guy who is cheering him on.A lot of the characters who put the comedy into the film didn't have very big roles at all. As mentioned before, the homeless drunk in the park has little to know role in the film whatsoever and is mainly there for comedy. But sometimes it isn't the characters who aren't funny, it's the scenes themselves. Kind of like when a priest is fighting a bunch of zombies using martial arts. Or one of the most gruesome scenes of all time when the main character slices zombies up with a lawnmower.Unlike a lot of other zombie movies, this one didn't have a dark feel to it. It was actually a feel good movie. But it was hard to take seriously over the comedy. However there are some emotionally intense scenes in it. Point is, don't expect to take this very seriously because you aren't getting a serious movie.It's a classic and there is no doubt about it. Can you go wrong with zombie movies? Not really. The scenes were classic. They were incredibly hilarious and always make me laugh. The costume designs were terrible but great at the same time while the stop motion effects were just plain awesome.

The plot goes like this;A detective who is haunted by his dramatic past involving heights is asked to shadow a old friend's wife who has gone insane. She makes regular pleasure jaunts on her own and appears to be trying to commit suicide. The more detective John Ferguson delves into the situation however, the more he falls desperately in love with the woman...James Stwert has done a lot of movies for Hitchcock; The man who knew too much remake, Rope, rear window-all classics. However, James Stewart really tops it all in this thrilling extravaganza.Lets start off with the acting. As you wold expect from a film of this class, the acting is nothing under A*. James Stewart plays his role perfectly, adding great lines and sometimes anger into his role. The supporting cast is fantastic too. The reason I don't delve to deep into what the actors say is because this film is surprisingly action based (No, not shooting). What I mean is sometimes, the film has no talking what-so-ever. Instead you see the characters expressions and movements to a great extent and you can almost read the character's minds. This is a technique lost in modern filmmaking.Spoilers coming up.The story is sometimes really hard to follow, especially halfway through the film. You eventually find out that the woman committing suicide is actually a conspiracy made by her husband to murder. James Stewart gets caught in the scene and when he finally finds it all out, it's too late. but then another woman who looks identical to the woman who was murdered appears in town and Stewert can't resist looking into it. I will not spoil any more for you, but I can guarantee, the ending will make you think good, long and hard about it. Not that that's a bad thing of coarse.Fantastic storyline that lacks in a lot of thrillers.Another thing I liked about the acting was the creepy wife. Throughout the movie, she looks completely blank; no expressions, no emotions, Nothing!! She rarely speaks in the whole film apart from about once a scene. In my opinion she is one of the most well crafted characters in thriller history.Lots of scenes in this movie are very intense. They will have you at the end of your scene and most of this is due to what I call musical timing. This is where films use the right types of music for the right scenes and they have to be at an exact moment, or the scene will fall flat on it's face. in this film, it is used to an extreme. Sometimes it will be really quite and then music will bare out when something intense happens. The musical score is pure brilliance.All in all, a fantastic thriller and probably Hitchcock's greatest hit, tied with Noth By Northwest which you should really check out if you love this film.To think this film was poorly received when it first came out! in fact, it was James' last movie working with Hitchcok because Hitchcock thought he was to blame for the failure. humph. I right! Anyway Brilliant film and one of the best heart stopping thrillers of all time.

It's beautifully drawn and animated, the characters are all cute and adorable and there are one or two classic moments throughout (one being an offscreen death and the other being a bit of larking around on some ice) but it's actually a bit *whisper it* dull.Okay, maybe dull isn't quite the right word I'm after - the gorgeous visuals certainly keep boredom at bay. Perhaps I should be saying that it's just too insubstantial. Oh, you might say, well, just remember that this is a Disney movie and I'd be quick to remind you that Disney movies have often had a lot more going on than just the surface story content.

But a lot of the other films have something more to offer, whether it's the absolutely amazing audio-visual extravaganza of Fantasia, the moral lessons in Pinocchio, the importance of embracing your individuality and just being yourself in Dumbo or the rewards that can come along when you face up to responsibility and step up to the mark (The Lion King).What's Bambi about?

Most of them have failed but there are a couple gems that stand out from the rest. As for this film, it comes off as an Indiana Jones movie but with the lead being female, with a British accent and is one of the most attractive actresses in Hollywood. Besides it being a financially successful PC game, this film was a financial success and even spawned a sequel in 2003. Starring as Lara Croft is Angelina Jolie. She really brings sexy back in this action film because of how she moves. The way she leaps, rolls, jumps are all very exhilarating to watch. Mostly these moves look so great because of her agility and flexibility as a woman. Also starring with her is British actor Daniel Craig. It's funny to see Jolie who's American, play a British character while Craig who's British, plays an American character. In my opinion, that's pretty impressive because if I were acting out that scene, I would get confused with who I was talking to and speak whatever accent felt more comfortable; but they do it like they were born in those countries. What makes this movie like Indiana Jones is not because of the title, Tomb Raider. No, it's the substance involved in this film. Right at the beginning of the film, Croft is already fighting off a menacing killer robot that's packing some serious arsenal. Same thing with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981); no robots but still trying to avoid all kinds of dangerous devices such as impaling walls and rolling boulders. Lara Croft is just more modernized since Indiana Jones lived in the 1930s. Either way both are trying to find sacred artifacts that could change the fate of mankind. And to do this, they must hunt for these objects by entering ancient architecture. All this does is add spectacle and wonder to the film and it works really well no matter if it's 1981 or 2001.Making things even spicier in this film is what Croft wears. Whatever she wears in a certain scene is appropriate and sexy at the same time. It's almost like she's setting a standard for a next generation of archaeologists. As for the musical score, I didn't really care for it. I couldn't really feel anything from it and felt that maybe a different composer could have been hired for the job. That and the fact that although this movie was good, I just never felt any love for it. It was entertaining but it wasn't like much of the characters were memorable besides Lara Croft.

The investigation looks like an easy game, only bumping into the ubiquitous SS manpower.So the two big flaws that make The Odessa File a mediocre movie are- a poor adaptation missing the point of suspense building up as the investigation gains momentum;- the shortcuts in the seminal flashback and in the ODESSA premise summed up as a gigantic SS conspiracy pulling the strings behind every German administration (in 1963).One good point though, the disturbing clumsiness of Peter Miller as his investigation gets more and more dangerous, in the book, has been properly dealt with. But as in the book Peter Miller is a rather bland character. His stubbornness doesn't help to make him interesting as he does his job.

As such, I'm made it a bit of a mission to take a look at as much of his back catalogue as I can whenever they are shown on TV. So this is how I came to watch this one. I have to say it's not the best film I've seen associated with his name, but it's passable. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary.We start in heaven (where else), where two angels, O'Reilly and Jackson, are given their last chance to, let's say, facilitate a couple falling in love. It's a tough case; two people from very different backgrounds. First there's Robert Lewis who's a cleaner (& a writer in his spare time) who has just lost his job and been dumped by his girlfriend. Then there's Celine Naville a rich socialite whose father wants her to go to work for him. They are thrown together when Robert goes to see Celine's father to demand his job back and things go slightly wrong. He ends up kidnapping Celine and taking her to a cabin in the wilderness. He really doesn't have a clue and Celine ends up taking the lead; deciding she may as well try to get some money out of her father. Meanwhile, O'Reilly and Jackson are hired by Celine's father to find them. As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated already and we're only part-way through! I'll leave it there though or the Spoiler Police (confusing plots division) will have me kidnapped in amusing circumstances (again).A well made film that has the beginnings many of the hallmarks of Boyle's latter works. Some interesting ideas thrown in, some that worked and some that didn't, but then I see it as a bit of a stepping stone for Boyle. Nice performances all round; Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Robert Lewis, although his haircut is pretty bizarre! Cameron Diaz did a great job as Celine; it's the kind of role she's pretty comfortable in. I thought both Holly Hunter as O'Reilly and Delroy Lindo as Jackson were excellent. Honourable mentions must also go to; Ian McNeice as Mayhew, Frank Kanig as Ted, Stanley Tucci as Elliot Zweikel, Tony Shalhoub as Al and Ian Holm as Naville (Celine's father).Although I'm a fan of Danny Boyle's work, I'm afraid this one failed to hit the mark (for me). I found the plot far too over-complicated, almost like they were trying to fit far too many ideas in all at once. To me it would have been much more interesting to see the story from the point of view of O'Reilly and Jackson, but then I guess I'm not a screenwriter (yet).

THEATRICAL RELEASE June 1, 1984. BUDGET ESTIMATE $17 million. USA BOX OFFICE $76 million. WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE $87 million. THE PLOT Kirk and Co. disobey Federation orders by stealing the Enterprise from space dock (!!) and heading for the forbidden Genesis Planet (created in the previous film) to retrieve Spock's body and clash with Commander Kruge, a Klingon bent on claiming the secrets of the Genesis Project for his own destructive purposes. COMMENT For a 1984 film I admit that the Genesis Planet sets aren't the greatest, but they get the job done. Besides, if you're used to watching the TV episodes they're fantastic. Star Trek was never about outstanding special effects anyway (with the exception of the unique and brilliant Star Trek The Motion Picture); no, Star Trek is about people, their joy of living and their grand spirit of adventure and exploration. GREAT LINE Witnessing the emblazed ship go down on the apocalyptic horizon of the Genesis Plane, Kirk asks My God, Bones, what have I done? McCoy responds What you HAD to do, Jim, what you ALWAYS do -- turn death into a fighting chance to live. QUESTION Just how far does the Saavik (Robin Curtis) go in helping the teenage Spock get through his first Vulcan pon farr on the Genesis Planet? The film itself doesn't concretely answer, it simply shows Saavik holding Spock's hand and comforting him. However, since early drafts of Star Trek IV featured Saavik remaining on Vulcan because she was pregnant with Spock's child, we can assume that Saavik went ALL THE WAY in helping young Spock (!). Okay, so now the question is Did she do this out of a sense of Vulcan duty or simply to get her jollies with a young Vulcan stud? Speaking of Robin Curtis, she plays Saavik much more Vulcan-like (i.e. better) than Kirstie Alley in The Wrath of Khan (I never bought Alley as a Vulcan). In truth, Curtis in nothing less than exceptional in this film. COMMENT Although early in the story Sarek describes Spock's 'katra' as his living spirit and later Kirk refers to it as his soul, it's clear in the the film that the katra does not refer to spirit or soul in the traditional sense, i.e. one's non-physical life-essence. We know this because, while McCoy possesses Spock's katra, the Vulan's actual consciousness or life-essence is simultaneously within his rapidly-aging regenerating body on the Genesis Planet. Hence, the katra could be accurately described as an incorporeal file of a Vulcan's knowledge and life, which is why Sarek described it as everything (Spock) knew, everything he was. FYI I never bought Merritt Butrick as Kirk's son, David, but he's serviceable. He died of AIDS in 1989 at the young age of 29. ANALYSIS The Search for Spock is a great Star Trek picture embellished by the welcome return of Trek's quirky brand of humor. The story expertly meshes comedic touches with dead-serious tragedy. It's also thoroughly enjoyable and compelling to see Kirk & crew in the wry and unexpected role of Starfleet rebels, risking everything to honor their fallen comrade. Another highlight is the return of Klingons as major villains, with upgraded make-up no less. The only problem with this Trek installment is revealed in the title -- there's no Spock, at least as we know him, but the film does a fabulous job of instilling a sense of the Vulcan's lingering presence. The story climaxes with the powerful image of Spock's mates warmly gathering together. This scene is worth the wait where a simple raised eyebrow fills the viewer with incredible warmth and joy (not to mention the shedding of a few tears). Also, I gotta hand it to the creators for coming up with an inspired and (seemingly) credible way of resurrecting Spock; the Genesis Project was, by happenstance, the perfect catalyst.

In fact, aside from Star Trek IV The Voyage Home, STTMP is still the most profitable of all the Star Trek feature films with the whole original cast (Making FOUR TIMES its expense worldwide); it therefore can't very well be the cinematic turd that many critics claim. Also, consider the fact that STTMP made more at the box office than the acclaimed films Alien and Apocalypse Now, both released the same year (1979).I should add that, although this film is an Grade A picture as far as epic, awe-inspiring pieces of cinematic art go, I understand why some would grade it lower. In such cases I suggest making the necessary psychological adjustments and watching it again as it is more along the lines of The Cage (#1) than The Doomsday Machine (#35). If this doesn't work, stick with more lightweight fare like Zathura or even Star Wars (giggle). Just joking.

V'ger hopes to touch its creator to find its answers.Another powerful sequence is a crewman's self-sacrificial fusion with V'ger so that it may evolve to the next level of awareness (seemingly self-sacrificial, that is).The fact that the film inspires such profound contemplation and emotion proves that it's not just a bad film that apologists try to make excuses for as critics claim, e.g. It's deep and awe-inspiring; you just don't understand it. I'm not making excuses; it's simply the truth. If you are unable to accept this perhaps it's because YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH. (lol).My conclusion on the film runs parallel to Roger Ebert's comments My inclination, as I slid down in my seat and the stereo sound surrounded me, was to relax and let the movie give me a good time. I did and it did. In other words, just accept the film as is, and you WILL be entertained -- but put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, HA, HA!), kick back and relish the movie magic.Let me add that The Motion Picture was one of the most expensive films of its time, but it did well at the box office and thus made a decent profit -- a testimony to how hungry the public was for Star Trek after ten long years (since the cancellation of the original TV series in '69). In fact, aside from Star Trek IV The Voyage Home, STTMP is still the most profitable of all the Star Trek feature films with the whole original cast (Making FOUR TIMES its expense worldwide); it therefore can't very well be the cinematic turd that many critics claim. Also, consider the fact that STTMP made more at the box office than the acclaimed films Alien and Apocalypse Now, both released the same year (1979).I should add that, although this film is an Grade A picture as far as epic, awe-inspiring pieces of cinematic art go, I understand why some would grade it lower. In such cases I suggest making the necessary psychological adjustments and watching it again as it is more along the lines of The Cage (#1) than The Doomsday Machine (#35). If this doesn't work, stick with more lightweight fare like Zathura or even Star Wars (giggle). Just joking. The viewer will note that The Motion Picture is truly the sole Star Trek film that aspires to and attains a level of cinematic awe along the lines of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Actually, The Motion Picture is LEAGUES better IMHO. 2001 lacks characters whom the viewer truly cares about; it's also cold and overly artsy, with way too many unnecessarily boring sequences (but, don't get me wrong, if 2001 trips your trigger, that's great). The Motion Picture, by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.Say what you will, but The Motion Picture towers alone, utterly unique in the feature film series -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH.

He plays an American in London who mistakenly believes he is the apple of a wealthy young lady's eye (Joan Fontaine). Many misunderstandings follow until, inevitably, Miss Fontaine realises he's right and she does, in fact, love young Fred.Most of the humour is provided by the banter between supporting stars George Burns and Gracie Allen, and their quick-fire one-liners are still pretty funny today. They're not the only ones to be given funny lines though. In one scene, the snobbish mother of Fontaine, matriarch of a British stately home, says sniffily after learning that it is the weekly open-house day, 'Well, open all the windows after they've gone.' Of course this is a fabricated world as far removed from real life as it is possible to get, and I suppose it was exactly the type of escapism people in the midst of a depression craved. I'm not quite sure why the studio chose to pair Astaire with the young Miss Fontaine, who clearly isn't a proficient dancer. Perhaps they were trying to build her up as a star. Anyway, it means that Astaire shares most of his dance numbers with Burns & Allen or goes it alone. The film's a little poorer because of it, but he's still pretty good, whether playing an unconventional drum solo while dancing to a Gershwin number, performing a comical fairground dance with his two sidekicks, or simply singing A Foggy Day in London Town in an atmospherically shot solo number.

Hitchcock loved to exploit the audience's fear of heights, for instance, and darned if people in this film aren't standing on ledges and looking over railings etc. The locale is, of course, a foreign one, Paris in this case.

The jokes all work, the thrills thrill, the fast paced segments really move, and Audrey and Cary have fabulous romantic and comedic chemistry together.

But what was it about Carpenter's influential masterpiece that initiated the so-called slasher craze? Carpenter effectively crafted Halloween to instill suspense and fear into its viewers and influence filmmakers for decades.Halloween follows good-girl Laurie Strode, and her friends, Annie and Lynda, on a typical Halloween night. Little do they know, escaped murderer Michael Myers has been following them, and their Halloween night will not turn out as they had expected. Halloween begins shocking its audience right from the opening sequence. The unique point-of-view, behind the mask, continuous shot of the vicious murder of Judith Myers puts the audience right in the antagonists shoes. It is soon revealed that the point of view is from six year old Michael Myers, who blankly at the camera, holding a bloody butcher knife.Carpenter shifts the focal point onto Laurie Strode and her friends, as well as Myers' doctor Sam Loomis, who is obsessively hunting him. Carpenter carefully paces this part of the film, creating ample suspense with shots of Myers standing in the background unnoticed, stalking our protagonist, until the final half hour of the film when Myers finally strikes and complete terror unfolds upon the audience.The main quality of this film that denotes it as one of the greatest horror films of all time is its use of suspense and the unknown to scare viewers. Myers' motives for what he is doing are completely unknown. The only explanation, given by Dr. Loomis, is that he is pure evil. This is characterized perfectly by the blank, white mask Myers wears throughout the film. Carpenter also uses film techniques to create suspense and instill fear into viewers. You have no clue where he is, and where he could strike next. One of the main things that sticks with audiences is the score of the film. From the eerie main theme, to the bone chilling zing that plays at the most surprising moments, the score perfectly reflects the events in the film and strengthens the emotions of the audience. Carpenter also selects the best shots to use, and is constantly reminding us the Michael Myers could be anywhere, stalking Laurie and her friends. With Halloween, Carpenter proved that you don't need a big budget and flashy effects to create a masterpiece. Produced independently with just $320,000, Halloween scared generations with its eerie score, dimly lit scenes, and precisely constructed shots. Halloween personifies fear and gives it a name Michael Myers. Fans of horror films will surely love it, and it is a must see for anyone who enjoys getting spooked.

The script is the anchor and Myers uses it brilliantly to sculpt out some fine characters and drives this film into comedy gold.OK, so it's not stuff of legend like Monty Python and Ghostbusters but I personally rate it just as highly. If I'm totally honest, if you don't laugh all of the way through this then there's something wrong with you. Watch it, and watch it again! Also, you'll never get The La's - There She Goes out of your head for months. Fair warning. ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"}]
