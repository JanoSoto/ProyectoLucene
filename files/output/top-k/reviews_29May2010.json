As onlooker Joseph Calleia points out, It's the most curious love-hate pattern I've ever had the privilege of witnessing.It's curious all right. Johnny (Ford), a scruffy grifter on the streets of Buenos Aires, is on the brink of being killed when he is saved (picked up?) by a well-dressed stranger named Ballin (George Macready). Ballin hires Johnny to oversee his illegal casino, and the two form a quick bond of trust and loyalty. This relationship's a puzzler too; when Ballin reverses his dictum that women and gambling don't mix, and announces there's a lady in the picture, Ford's expression reads less like a concerned business partner than a jilted suitor.Quicker than you can say so what's that about? we meet Gilda (Hayworth), and... it's no mystery why this remains Hayworth's most famous role. From that first dazzling shot of her tossing her hair back -- even her hair is erotic -- with shoulders bared, she simply glitters with sex. Was this really 1946? Onstage at the casino, she flirts with the audience I can never get a zipper to close. Maybe that stands for something, what do you think? Oh, I think it probably does.The plot is frankly odd, hinging on lust, murder, and for some reason tungsten. Rudolph Mate's photography is gorgeous. The dialogue is consistently entertaining. Ford, often saddled with bland roles, does fine here as a ne'er-do-well with a conscience, and Steven Geray is quite amusing as the owlishly cynical Uncle Pio.But it's Hayworth you'll remember, wriggling in her black dress or raising her stockinged leg like a banner of temptation. Hate is a very exciting emotion, she tells Johnny, pressing up close. I hate you so much I think I'm going to die from it. Hayworth's lips melt and transmute the word hate until it means want.

Well, I haven't read Berendt's book and must report that I rather enjoyed the film. It reminded me of the observation (and I have tracked that down to first being said by Mark Twain, but it might well have been someone else before him) that it's 'a good story well told'. And at the end of the day you can't really ask for more than that. Well, of course you can, but you run the risk of being rather greedy. With Midnight, Clint Eastwood has made a film which is intriguing and entertaining. Admittedly, to do so he has had to adapt Berendt's account of mysterious murder and a very colourful gang of people living in Savannah, Georgia, which has upset purist, but, as I said, I hadn't read the original book, and so I would never have known had I not read other reviews. I always feel filmmakers have an inalienable right to make a film 'based on' rather than 'of' a book because, in essence, they are creating a new piece of art (one hopes) rather than simply transferring a story from one medium to another. Clint Eastwood has made good use of that right and, pertinently, hasn't abused it. So, for example, criticism that he has boiled down the unprecedented four trial antique dealer Jim Williams faced on the charge of murdering a male hustler into one can be countered by observing that including four trials in his film would have meant making a very different film indeed and boiling it down to one (and altering crucial details to do so) makes admirable sense. Those of us who haven't read Berendt's book do not feel short-changed, and the film still stands steadily on its own two feet. The writer portrayed by John Cusack (intended to represent Berendt although he is called Kelso in the film) is the only fictional character, and the rest are all real, which must have presented Eastwood with something close to a legal nightmare in that none of the characters could be portrayed in a bad light or else they might sue for libel. The film also introduces a romance between Kelso and Mandy (who was real but who didn't fall in love with the Kelso character) which in retrospect has absolutely nothing to do with the core of the story. But it does provide a pleasant dimension to the film in as far as Kelso is rather likable and so is Mandy so why not pair them off. There was absolutely no reason to do so, except to add a little love interest to the film, but there again there was absolutely no reason not to it doesn't in the slightest detract from the film, so what the hell. Lady Chablis, the real-life drag queen of portrays himself - herself? - is something of a tour de force. Yet again there is a longish scene when she turns up at a middle-class black prom to which (for some reason not made clear) Kelso has been invited and proceeds to scandalise him which doesn't advance the story very much. It seems more intent on showcasing Lady Chablis' outrageousness, but as it's very entertaining, I feel Eastwood can be forgiven including it. To sum up Midnight is an entertaining account of a series of whackos in Savannah, Georgia, an intriguing murder story and has many good performances, not least from Kevin Spacey as the gay antiques dealer and Cusack as the writer. If you have read Berendt's highly praised book, you might well be disappointed. If, like me, you haven't you won't be. Give it a whirl and you'll find you won't regret having done so.

I always feel filmmakers have an inalienable right to make a film 'based on' rather than 'of' a book because, in essence, they are creating a new piece of art (one hopes) rather than simply transferring a story from one medium to another. Clint Eastwood has made good use of that right and, pertinently, hasn't abused it. So, for example, criticism that he has boiled down the unprecedented four trial antique dealer Jim Williams faced on the charge of murdering a male hustler into one can be countered by observing that including four trials in his film would have meant making a very different film indeed and boiling it down to one (and altering crucial details to do so) makes admirable sense. Those of us who haven't read Berendt's book do not feel short-changed, and the film still stands steadily on its own two feet. The writer portrayed by John Cusack (intended to represent Berendt although he is called Kelso in the film) is the only fictional character, and the rest are all real, which must have presented Eastwood with something close to a legal nightmare in that none of the characters could be portrayed in a bad light or else they might sue for libel. The film also introduces a romance between Kelso and Mandy (who was real but who didn't fall in love with the Kelso character) which in retrospect has absolutely nothing to do with the core of the story. But it does provide a pleasant dimension to the film in as far as Kelso is rather likable and so is Mandy so why not pair them off. There was absolutely no reason to do so, except to add a little love interest to the film, but there again there was absolutely no reason not to it doesn't in the slightest detract from the film, so what the hell. Lady Chablis, the real-life drag queen of portrays himself - herself? - is something of a tour de force. Yet again there is a longish scene when she turns up at a middle-class black prom to which (for some reason not made clear) Kelso has been invited and proceeds to scandalise him which doesn't advance the story very much. It seems more intent on showcasing Lady Chablis' outrageousness, but as it's very entertaining, I feel Eastwood can be forgiven including it. To sum up Midnight is an entertaining account of a series of whackos in Savannah, Georgia, an intriguing murder story and has many good performances, not least from Kevin Spacey as the gay antiques dealer and Cusack as the writer. If you have read Berendt's highly praised book, you might well be disappointed. If, like me, you haven't you won't be. Give it a whirl and you'll find you won't regret having done so.

They're nothing if not clever and self-assured, just a tad too clever and self-assured for my taste. The Catherine character veritably oozes nervy slyness. And they all spout dialogue that's too artificially adroit to sound natural.

The only way to find it is by luck, such as if you live overseas from the US or if one can find a bootleg (as I ultimately did). The indication from it being quasi-banned by its parent company Disney- who as previously as twenty-four years ago released it back in theaters- is that it is offensive and, perhaps, even racist, giving it a kind of stigma that actually Disney films from the 40's still have. Could it really be as in poor taste as people say or its reputation purports? As it turns out, watching the film, no, it's not offensive. It shows post-slaves with some of dem type of words, but it is really tame for today (ironically a much available and classic movie like Dumbo with more questionable black characters in the crows is rougher to see today). It's a silly movie about a cheery black character- let's call him the Magical Negro as is a common cliché in movies- who tells children the stories of Brier Rabbit and all that jazz in the deep south circa late 19th century.So why say it's not worth your time and money and effort to find the movie? Frankly, it's just not a very good effort. While the other Disney movies at the time, more concentrated with being strictly animation, had a better focus with its stories and mixing in some songs, there isn't much of a story or a conflict. There's little things that happen, little moments, things like a gag with a frog one boy hides under his hat, or the plant\/payoff with the bull behind the fence. The set-up is what it is, that the little boy is left with his mother while his father is off being a newspaper man, and intermittently Uncle Remus tells his stories about the Brier Rabbit and Fox and the Bear and how the Fox and Bear tried to catch the rascal-rabbit. These, by the way, are the only time the film is animated; the rest of the live action is shot in a sterile form by otherwise great DP Greg Toland.That it was Disney's first real shot at doing something like this, combining animation and live action, shouldn't be discounted at least for its ambition (though only twice really does the film go into this style of mixing the two forms, and at the end it's just ridiculous with characters we haven't seen before). But the results are at best uneven and at worst some of the most boring material in any Disney movie. Even the animated scenes don't have much to them except as small, weakly done stories, and with that they could just as well be the animated Disney shorts of the period by themselves (that the voices aren't convincing- and this is for a voice like a stupid deep-south bear- is one thing), with only a few moments in them that are striking or fun. The Zippedee-doo-da song should be a classic, but that too feels just a wee-bit much.But back to what could or should be offensive. One person might think immediately when hearing that the movie features a tar-baby that it will be awful and racist (it's a term that's been bandied about over the years at black people). It's handled much more innocently than you'd expect, albeit still with a silly-stupid payoff in the context of the Brier Rabbit saga. And the characters of Uncle Remus and the housekeeper played by Hattie MacDaniel are surely not subtle, but there's nothing to them that would cause an uproar, save perhaps that it wouldn't be quite right to screen at a NAACP meeting.

It shows post-slaves with some of dem type of words, but it is really tame for today (ironically a much available and classic movie like Dumbo with more questionable black characters in the crows is rougher to see today). It's a silly movie about a cheery black character- let's call him the Magical Negro as is a common cliché in movies- who tells children the stories of Brier Rabbit and all that jazz in the deep south circa late 19th century.So why say it's not worth your time and money and effort to find the movie? Frankly, it's just not a very good effort. While the other Disney movies at the time, more concentrated with being strictly animation, had a better focus with its stories and mixing in some songs, there isn't much of a story or a conflict. There's little things that happen, little moments, things like a gag with a frog one boy hides under his hat, or the plant\/payoff with the bull behind the fence. The set-up is what it is, that the little boy is left with his mother while his father is off being a newspaper man, and intermittently Uncle Remus tells his stories about the Brier Rabbit and Fox and the Bear and how the Fox and Bear tried to catch the rascal-rabbit. These, by the way, are the only time the film is animated; the rest of the live action is shot in a sterile form by otherwise great DP Greg Toland.That it was Disney's first real shot at doing something like this, combining animation and live action, shouldn't be discounted at least for its ambition (though only twice really does the film go into this style of mixing the two forms, and at the end it's just ridiculous with characters we haven't seen before). But the results are at best uneven and at worst some of the most boring material in any Disney movie. Even the animated scenes don't have much to them except as small, weakly done stories, and with that they could just as well be the animated Disney shorts of the period by themselves (that the voices aren't convincing- and this is for a voice like a stupid deep-south bear- is one thing), with only a few moments in them that are striking or fun. The Zippedee-doo-da song should be a classic, but that too feels just a wee-bit much.But back to what could or should be offensive. One person might think immediately when hearing that the movie features a tar-baby that it will be awful and racist (it's a term that's been bandied about over the years at black people). It's handled much more innocently than you'd expect, albeit still with a silly-stupid payoff in the context of the Brier Rabbit saga. And the characters of Uncle Remus and the housekeeper played by Hattie MacDaniel are surely not subtle, but there's nothing to them that would cause an uproar, save perhaps that it wouldn't be quite right to screen at a NAACP meeting.

The chemistry between De Niro and Gooding Jr. is the main reason this movie works so well, and while De Niro goes into dangerous territory of going over the top with the accent he's doing, he managed to do it with near perfection. My favorite scene is when De Niro smashes Gooding Jr's beloved Radio he got from his Dad.Performances. Cuba Gooding Jr. has the ability to be one of the best, as he's shown his Oscar was no fluke, he just needs the right scripts. Here he is a believable hero and one we can relate to perfectly. His courageous performance should inspire people. Robert De Niro is at his best here. For most of the movie he plays the perfect antagonist, but he does a great turn near the end that is very touching to the viewer. Charlize Theron plays her role well as De Niro's wife, but didn't have a whole lot to do. Aunjanue Ellis is solid as Gooding's love interest.

It's a terrific story which slam-dunks the bewildered heroine into the middle of a fight for survival against a backdrop of nuclear apocalypse. Like all the best suspense pictures, it follows a straight minimalist route; Reese sets the action with a brilliant speech, Listen, and understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead !. As this fearsome assassin, Big Arnie is simply perfect casting - his best role by a long chalk which suits his looks, his acting chops, everything. He cruises the city, a mean machine stalking his prey, and is a truly frightful fiend. Hamilton and Biehn are equally good; she is vulnerable and scared but not stupid and their resolve to outwit and survive near-impossible odds give the film a real dramatic core. The support cast are a lot of fun; Winfield and Henriksen do a nice Mutt and Jeff cop routine which is welcome light relief and there are funny bits by Miller as a gun shop clerk and Paxton as a street punk. The movie also has a terrific neo-noir atmosphere, thanks to Adam Greenberg's photography of L.A. at night, punctuated by hellish futuristic visions of irradiated rubble patrolled by nightmarish machines. Brad Fiedel's score, whilst occasionally a bit cheesy, has a great main theme and pumps everything along with pounding electronic percussion. The movie was written by Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, and fans cite it as a pioneering story of time travel and machine dystopia, although in practice it has many antecedents - sci-fi author Harlan Ellison sued the film for it similarities to his 1957 short story Soldier From Tomorrow, but there are also very similar Dr Who yarns, not to mention the last half-hour of Michael Crichton's Westworld. All of this doesn't matter however - what the film has going for it is good characterisation, fabulous direction, and a great Bad Man. Produced by Helmdale Films, who made some great flicks in the late eighties (Salvador, A Breed Apart, Miracle Mile), it was made on a pretty tight six-million budget but it looks ten times that and is sensational entertainment from start to finish.

For 16 long years, I finally found out it was the gorgeous Miss Gugino (after not knowing all this time) who not only was in that clip, but also featured in a Season 5 episode of The Wonder Years.

After the revelations of the past week I again was surprised to find a young Carla Gugino in the lead role next to Pauly Shore. This is your typical 90s looking movie, just about watchable but nothing spectacular. Pauly Shaw's character Crawl is pretty much the same as his character in Encino Man. But like most people who have commented on this movie, they can't help but mention the equally stunning Tiffani-Amber Thiessen from 90s sitcom Saved By The Bell. Someone mentioned in this thread she should have been in the lead role but the fact remains is Gugino over time has had a more prestigious acting career than Thiessen and her role in Son In Law shows this. In saying that, Thiessen is certainly memorable in this movie and easily sits in my Top 20 Hottest Females of All Time list. If anything, its great to see both of these girls in early roles and I don't agree with some people who have regarded this as one of the worst movies of all time.

And as I said with another historic movie, facts are the bricks for getting into the events. Conclusions, hypothesis, commentaries are maybe useful but they can't replace the facts. This method is rewarding concerning this dramatic event of our previous century because it shocked a world while just a handful was present on this famous Dealey Plaza, November 1963. Above all, a movie make you see things as they were, thus you just call for your best judgment. So, let's take a look at what happened1) The supposed lone gunman (HLO) fired at the most difficult time to aim when the presidential car moved away and not while it was right in front of him. Strange? 2) The place of the shooting is the best for a trap you see the famous grassy knoll and just behind a huge parking and nothing else except railroads. Coincidence? 3) The definitive visual proof the Zapruder movie if JFK fell left and behind with the head gunshot, thus that means that someone behind him and at his right, as HLO, could have been the killer. Nonsense!That's why I just loved this movie because it's like living this dreadful day right from where it happened. So when you heard a past (awful) president, involved in the Agency and making dollars with blood, saying it's a crap, well, you know that the movie kicked where it hurts!While watching it, I read the 1968 book The Plot which amazed me because I think it's the quickest book to reach the same conspiracy conclusion. Together, they make me understand the motive for the killing JFK was a pacifist and as he would have been surely reelected for a second and finale mandate, he would have then his hands free to do what he wanted. And peace wasn't what the military-industrial complex wanted, as warned by his predecessor Eisenhower, himself coming from this corporation.So, this movie is a powerful testimony for truth and in addition, a truly artistic masterpiece the editing, the cinematography with fictional shooting and real footage makes a nearly virtual experience. It's not only talks because for each opinion, you see immediately the actual and real proof. We must thank Stone for his great cast and his attention to profile it as the real people. I have never been a great fan of Costner but for a actor labeled action, he was just amazing portraying the attorney. He delivers a great incarnation of courage and dedication. If you add a great score from one of the best, John Williams, you got the ultimate movie of 1991 a story that you can't forget told by excellent artists!

This movie starts out as a dark comedy starring a bastard misfit boy of a gypsy community named Perhan. The teenage boy is first shown as quite innocent and naive, taking everyone for their word. Throughout this film the viewer watches helplessly as Perhan changes from the young innocent boy into a conniving untrusting thug.Perhan goes on a mission with the gypsy hustler Ahmed who promises he will take Pehan's handicapped sister to a doctor at his own expense. Of course Ahmed lies to Perhan and sends him through a series of transformations by forcing Perhan to join his group of gypsies that expose the young teen to acts of thievery, prostitution, and deceit. This character transformation is convincing and unfortunate, but was the only redeeming factor in this movie for me.I usually prefer movies that don't stick to a specific genre, but instead use whatever elements of each genre to make the best movie possible. Unfortunately I didn't like the genre mixes in this film. The first 1\/4 of the film is a dark romantic comedy. Perhan chases a girl and wins her heart, but when he cannot win her parents approval, he attempts to hang himself. I found this scene more disturbing than humorous which I think it was meant to be. The rest of the film is a tragedy with Perhan's spiraling downfall into a life of lies and crime. Random magical elements are introduced along the way such as Perhan's telekinesis that is only practically used once in the film.I felt like the mixture of so many elements did not turn out as well as the director imagined they would, and it became a messy storyline that I found difficult to take anything away from. Overall, the film is entertaining, but I felt as though it didn't have enough redeeming qualities for me to recommend it to anybody.
