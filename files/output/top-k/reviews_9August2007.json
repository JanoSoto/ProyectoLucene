Travolta makes a great alien in his Klingon like get up and plays it to the hilt with grade B gusto. In fact we thought his Klingon like costume was very acceptable. Consider how many Sci Fi movies mimic the Alien monster movies with Sigourney Weaver etc. Why should Travolta not take a good idea and make it his own. He is a terrific and scary alien in this movie. We were engaged through out the entire movie with his ruthless and heartless character which he did a fine job portraying. It was interesting to see mankind as a lesser species forced to be slaves to a alien race. The masterly and entirely arrogant alien Travolta plays is most believable and menacing. He struts around like a bull in a bull fight threatening any second to erupt and destroy anything, any idea and anyone in his way! You keep thinking where is his weakness?

This raises interesting questions such asWhy make films about the Marquis de Sade? Who (except professional social scientists ) would be interested? Should works similar to De Sade's be published? How far did his writings reflect his genetic make up?How far did they reflect his experiences? -and then more personally How much do I really know about De Sade and do I want to spend time learning more? Am I recoiling from worthwhile but unpleasant material, or ashamed to admit a prurient interest in it? If we met, would I admire him, detest him or pity him?As a child I learned of his connection with the word 'Sadism'; and since then short magazine articles or references to his life and writings have provided glimpses of a fascinating story, placing isolated patches on a vast empty canvas. But even to talk intelligently about what gave him his incredible drive one must read a biography of his life, or a number of his works - reading both would be better. The latter appeals more - he is recognised as a superb word-smith - but understanding the experiences behind his writings requires a biography. Reading takes precious time and Quills is a film biography, so I bought it. It is a well made and challenging film which received many awards - I strongly recommend it to other IMDb users who are interested. The story is strong meat, powerfully acted by a superb cast. Geoffrey Rush plays the Marquis as someone who is under a ferocious drive to express his philosophy in writings whatever the cost; Joacquim Phoenix provides the perfect character foil as the (relatively) kindly Abbe de Coulmier who befriends De Sade; Kate Winslet, although too old, plays Madeline LeClerc, the laundry girl who helped De Sade smuggle his writings out of the prison to the printer for continued distribution despite the increasing fury of Bonaparte's government - historically I believe Madeline was a thirteen year old, but Kate nonetheless plays this part admirably; and Michael Caine has the role of the Government appointed doctor who was, if possible, more sadistic than De Sade himself. These four great performances help create what is ultimately a memorable film, and supporting performances are all more than adequate.The early part of De Sade's life was relatively normal. He was born into the French aristocracy in 1740 during the reign of Louis XV, and served in the army during the Seven Year war. He married a woman chosen by his father in 1763 and they had three children. Reports of dissolute behaviour and abuse of prostitutes started to surface soon after this when De Sade was in the mid-twenties. In 1772 he was convicted and sentenced to death for administering Spanish Fly aphrodisiac to prostitutes and subsequently sodomising them, he escaped but was arrested and imprisoned through the intervention of his mother-in-law. Escaping again, he fled to Italy where he wrote his first book. Tricked into returning to Paris he was re-arrested and imprisoned in Vincennes where he succeeded in getting his death sentence revoked. In 1784 he was transferred to the Bastille, and then moved to Charenton Asylum for the insane 10 days before the Bastille was stormed at the start of the French revolution. Released by the revolutionary government in 1790 he threw himself into writing and political activities, but this did not save him during the Reign of Terror - he was imprisoned tried, condemned and nearly executed. After release he was almost destitute, had to sell the family castle, and spent his time writing very controversial works including 'Justine' and Juliette which were published anonymously. His authorship was traced after Napoleon ordered the arrest of Justine's author and he was imprisoned again in the harsh fortress of Bicetre. His family succeeded in having him declared insane and he was transferred to Charenton in 1803, remaining there until his death in 1814 after a total of 29 years imprisonment. De Sade lived an eventful and dangerous life, which should provide scope for creating a film that helps in understanding how his character developed, but Quills is not this film as only the final period when he was imprisoned in Charenton is featured. By then his behaviour pattern had become well established, so it can gives little help,.Assessing his works is not easy as many were destroyed, (including surviving manuscripts destroyed by his son after his death). Best known are probably 'The 120 days of Sodom', written whilst he was in the Bastille, and the dual novels 'Justine' and 'Juliette' which feature two sisters, Justine is a 'good' girl and everything bad happens to her, whilst Juliette is a 'bad' girl who does not mind what she does to avoid troubles and has a very comfortable life. Both De Sade's works and his life have fascinated film-makers from many countries, and watching their films should make it easy to learn more about him, but many are very hard to find. 'Dark Prince' (1996) and 'De Sade' (1969) are fairly full but somewhat bowdlerised biographies, not highly rated by IMDb users, whilst 'Justine de Sade' (1972) and Pasolini's 'Salo or the 120 days of Sodom' (1975) appear to be the most powerful films based on his works. There are many others - but it is easier to watch Quills than hunt for them. As with The People v Larry Flint, this film provides a trumpet call for freedom of expression, but could equally well defend censorship- its only role is to stimulate thought.

Tricked into returning to Paris he was re-arrested and imprisoned in Vincennes where he succeeded in getting his death sentence revoked. In 1784 he was transferred to the Bastille, and then moved to Charenton Asylum for the insane 10 days before the Bastille was stormed at the start of the French revolution. Released by the revolutionary government in 1790 he threw himself into writing and political activities, but this did not save him during the Reign of Terror - he was imprisoned tried, condemned and nearly executed. After release he was almost destitute, had to sell the family castle, and spent his time writing very controversial works including 'Justine' and Juliette which were published anonymously. His authorship was traced after Napoleon ordered the arrest of Justine's author and he was imprisoned again in the harsh fortress of Bicetre. His family succeeded in having him declared insane and he was transferred to Charenton in 1803, remaining there until his death in 1814 after a total of 29 years imprisonment. De Sade lived an eventful and dangerous life, which should provide scope for creating a film that helps in understanding how his character developed, but Quills is not this film as only the final period when he was imprisoned in Charenton is featured. By then his behaviour pattern had become well established, so it can gives little help,.Assessing his works is not easy as many were destroyed, (including surviving manuscripts destroyed by his son after his death). Best known are probably 'The 120 days of Sodom', written whilst he was in the Bastille, and the dual novels 'Justine' and 'Juliette' which feature two sisters, Justine is a 'good' girl and everything bad happens to her, whilst Juliette is a 'bad' girl who does not mind what she does to avoid troubles and has a very comfortable life. Both De Sade's works and his life have fascinated film-makers from many countries, and watching their films should make it easy to learn more about him, but many are very hard to find. 'Dark Prince' (1996) and 'De Sade' (1969) are fairly full but somewhat bowdlerised biographies, not highly rated by IMDb users, whilst 'Justine de Sade' (1972) and Pasolini's 'Salo or the 120 days of Sodom' (1975) appear to be the most powerful films based on his works. There are many others - but it is easier to watch Quills than hunt for them. As with The People v Larry Flint, this film provides a trumpet call for freedom of expression, but could equally well defend censorship- its only role is to stimulate thought.
