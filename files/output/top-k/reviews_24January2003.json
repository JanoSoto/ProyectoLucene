Here is my opinion why&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;..Visually 2001 has (for its time) the best special effects the film world has ever seen. It was (excuse the pun) an astronomical evolutionary jump forward, not only visually but also in way a film flows. It's totally unique; the use of music to propel the awe-inspiring plot and intellectual narrative is quite brilliant. Where as before music was mostly used to control the audience emotions.Some of the shots and camera work in this film are GENIUS. THE FAMOUS JUMP SHOT, the Leopard with the light reflecting off its retinas as it consumes a dead Zebra. The beautiful space scenes, coupled with just the right use of eerie\/spectacular music send shivers of wonder and awe down the spine.The plot is a great one, I especially love the beginning and indeed the whole back bone of the story which suggests that we as a race did not come to be through just evolution or just divine intervention, BUT BOTH!!! This is the over riding plot in the film which comes to a conclusion in the end. But more on the end later.....HAL is strangely in my opinion the best character in the film. In that he is the most complex and is the hardest to understand. Did HAL EVOLVE into something more than a computer??? And therefore doesn't it seem normal that he would indeed try to protect himself against being shut down my Dave and the others???? I feel the whole story is a superb intellectual battle, between HAL and the humans (which is also a physical battle), HAL and himself (against his programming)......and most importantly the humans fighting with their inner beliefs as they start to gain an insight into where their past and indeed their future originated and originates.And now the ending, well Kubrick did say in interviews that I have heard that he didn't intend to puzzle people so much with the ending, its just the way it came across. But he was really very pleased that that's what happened. He never let on what he thought the ending meant (One of his prime principles in his films was to let the audience make up their own mind.) In my opinion its really quite simple and beautiful, Dave is transported though hyper space (either through mind or body, its a matter of opinion) then once their in this strange place in space or his mind, keeps seeing the black monolith and every time he touches it he seems to get older, then he finally ceases to hold a human from and his body dies of old age.

The scenery is glorious, the sets are perfect, and true to the era, the script is enchantingly well written, and the cast is on the mark. Many people are in the school of thought which declares (verbally, or not) that Brad Pitt is good looking, and plays certain types of roles, and he is therefore a bad actor.  To those people I say...open your mind and watch his acting brilliance.  In this film he perfectly demonstrates, and with feeling, the long journey, through the ups and downs, of a soul in conflict with itself.  The beast within Tristan, and the beast within all of us, whether or not we care to admit it, is always fighting to get to the surface, often succeeding, sometimes not.  The constant struggle to balance the beast within each of us with our own outer persona is a difficult one. Some never show theirs, while others, like Tristan, are constantly revealing it, then burying it for a period of hibernation, only to repeat, ad infinitum.  Pitt conveyed this so well that I would have though anyone would respect the job he did. As for the story itself, I have read Harrison's novella, and two others by him that accompany my copy within one book, Revenge, and The Man Who Gave Up His Name, and all three are written with passion and insight into the human condition.  Legends of the Fall, however, rises above this and tells a hauntingly beautiful tale of a trio of brothers torn in a plethora of directions over the heart of one woman.  If anyone doubts the veracity of such a plot, look to the real world and you can see this every day.  The flow of Tristan's life through time, encompassing much of the first third of the 20th century gives the film both context and a sense of potentially being any one of our forefathers.  It works as a story, but it wins as a piece of history. The Cheyenne Indian, One-Stab, as narrator, fills in the gaps of the story, and moves it along with the natural skill of the oral tradition.  This is just one of the many twists and additions that this movie's scriptwriters have made that works perfectly. The biggest problem with a film based on a written work is that it invariably falls short, or too far exceeds its predecessor.  In this case, the perfect adaptation was achieved. I seldom see a movie that is worth watching more than once or twice, but this film tops my list, and I have seen it at least 100 times in its entirety, and countless fragments of it as well.

Unfortunately, I missed it at the theaters, so I had to catch it on video. And all I could say after I saw it was Wow.  I couldn't stop shaking, because after renting so many movies lately that were disappointing, this was a great refreshment.I had read the book in a French class years before, so for me to try to compare the two at that time was difficult (both because it was in French, and it was years ago), as far as I could recall, it was similar enough. Then I recently read the book, this time in English, and found that the two were dramatically different.  And both of them were excellent, in their own ways.For all of you purists out there, who think that this was a bastardization of the book, and that it was too Hollywood for you tastes, I only have 3 words to say to you Get over it.  Hello, every book changes when it goes into screenplay format.  Granted, some more than others.  But with this one, the changes they made were excellent.  And also, IT WAS A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE!!! Mid-size budget, experienced director, actors with a few movies already under their belts.Jim Caviezel I thought was amazing at portraying Edmond Dantes\/Count of Monte Cristo.  I have loved his acting since Frequency, and this movie did not disappoint me in regards to him.  Especially after watching the DVD with director's comments, and finding that he had to switch daily from being the sophisticated Count to the naive Dantes.  And for all of those who thought that his transformation was too simple, and that his enemies should have been able to tell who he was at once, you only have to remember one character to get into it Superman.  All Clark Kent needed was a pair of glasses and red lycra suit.  The Count had the pouffy hair, the goatee, the stylish clothes, and his voice is even different.  Not to mention, Guy Pearce can't remember anything for longer than 15 minutes (watch Memento and you'll get my joke there).Guy Pearce was amazing as Mondego.  You hate him almost immediately for being such a coniving, oh, I hate my rich life, pretty boy cad.  You hate him even more as the movie goes on.  James Frain is fantastic as Villefort, so power hungry that he would have his own father murdered to suit his needs.  And you can believe that the man who played Danglars is as big of a jerk as he is.Dagmara Dominczyk is wonderful as Mercedes, who even gets revenge of her own on Mondego for putting her through such a miserable marriage.  When she leaves him, and sends the dagger through him by saying Albert isn't his, the audience gets so much satisfaction.  First, Mondego deserves this. Second, she truly stands up for herself.  And third, you realize why exactly she did get married so soon after Edmond was sent off.In minor\/somewhat major roles, Abbe (Richard Harris), Jacopo (Luiz Guzman), and the warden (Michael Wincott), are perfectly cast.  Harris does the most amazing job as Abbe, giving Edmond both a friend and a father figure in the prison.  Guzman not only adds comic relief, but is the voice of reason to Edmond at times, even if he doesn't listen.  Many have complained about his accent, Brooklyn instead of European, but remember, he's a pirate.  He's been all over, and no one knows his origin.  And as for Wincott, he's wonderfully sadistic and cruel.Yes, the revenge isn't as intricate as it is in the book, but it is nevertheless perfect, and poetic justice.  Danglars is imprisoned for theft, but first made to hang right after learning the Count's true origin. Villefort is imprisoned for conspiracy, and the scene in the carriage is perfect.  Can there be anything more cruel than giving him an empty gun, and then saying Do you think I'd make it that easy?  And Mondego loses everything.  His fortune, his wife, his son, and finally, his life.  As he has committed the most crimes, he is the one most deserving of this.  And I love it when he opens the final case he stole from the Count to find the chess piece, the King, inside.In addition, the sword fights are amazing.  This is a classic film, so it doesn't need the fancy, Matrix-style sword play that's in most films. This happened to be one of my favorite things about this film.I can't say all that I want to say about this film, but I give it a 9.5 out of 10.  I loved the book, but I can't over how much I adored this movie. It was recommended to my friends before, and I will continue to do so. Congratulations to all who were involved, since they made it into my top 10 favorite movies of all time (and that's a pretty hard feat to accomplish).

Unfortunately, I missed it at the theaters, so I had to catch it on video. And all I could say after I saw it was Wow.  I couldn't stop shaking, because after renting so many movies lately that were disappointing, this was a great refreshment.I had read the book in a French class years before, so for me to try to compare the two at that time was difficult (both because it was in French, and it was years ago), as far as I could recall, it was similar enough. Then I recently read the book, this time in English, and found that the two were dramatically different.  And both of them were excellent, in their own ways.For all of you purists out there, who think that this was a bastardization of the book, and that it was too Hollywood for you tastes, I only have 3 words to say to you Get over it.  Hello, every book changes when it goes into screenplay format.  Granted, some more than others.  But with this one, the changes they made were excellent.  And also, IT WAS A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE!!! Mid-size budget, experienced director, actors with a few movies already under their belts.Jim Caviezel I thought was amazing at portraying Edmond Dantes\/Count of Monte Cristo.  I have loved his acting since Frequency, and this movie did not disappoint me in regards to him.  Especially after watching the DVD with director's comments, and finding that he had to switch daily from being the sophisticated Count to the naive Dantes.  And for all of those who thought that his transformation was too simple, and that his enemies should have been able to tell who he was at once, you only have to remember one character to get into it Superman.  All Clark Kent needed was a pair of glasses and red lycra suit.  The Count had the pouffy hair, the goatee, the stylish clothes, and his voice is even different.  Not to mention, Guy Pearce can't remember anything for longer than 15 minutes (watch Memento and you'll get my joke there).Guy Pearce was amazing as Mondego.  You hate him almost immediately for being such a coniving, oh, I hate my rich life, pretty boy cad.  You hate him even more as the movie goes on.  James Frain is fantastic as Villefort, so power hungry that he would have his own father murdered to suit his needs.  And you can believe that the man who played Danglars is as big of a jerk as he is.Dagmara Dominczyk is wonderful as Mercedes, who even gets revenge of her own on Mondego for putting her through such a miserable marriage.  When she leaves him, and sends the dagger through him by saying Albert isn't his, the audience gets so much satisfaction.  First, Mondego deserves this. Second, she truly stands up for herself.  And third, you realize why exactly she did get married so soon after Edmond was sent off.In minor\/somewhat major roles, Abbe (Richard Harris), Jacopo (Luiz Guzman), and the warden (Michael Wincott), are perfectly cast.  Harris does the most amazing job as Abbe, giving Edmond both a friend and a father figure in the prison.  Guzman not only adds comic relief, but is the voice of reason to Edmond at times, even if he doesn't listen.  Many have complained about his accent, Brooklyn instead of European, but remember, he's a pirate.  He's been all over, and no one knows his origin.  And as for Wincott, he's wonderfully sadistic and cruel.Yes, the revenge isn't as intricate as it is in the book, but it is nevertheless perfect, and poetic justice.  Danglars is imprisoned for theft, but first made to hang right after learning the Count's true origin. Villefort is imprisoned for conspiracy, and the scene in the carriage is perfect.  Can there be anything more cruel than giving him an empty gun, and then saying Do you think I'd make it that easy?  And Mondego loses everything.  His fortune, his wife, his son, and finally, his life.  As he has committed the most crimes, he is the one most deserving of this.  And I love it when he opens the final case he stole from the Count to find the chess piece, the King, inside.In addition, the sword fights are amazing.  This is a classic film, so it doesn't need the fancy, Matrix-style sword play that's in most films. This happened to be one of my favorite things about this film.I can't say all that I want to say about this film, but I give it a 9.5 out of 10.  I loved the book, but I can't over how much I adored this movie. It was recommended to my friends before, and I will continue to do so.

This movie is, without question, one of my favorite science fiction movies ever made.  The story is so well written and quite intriguing.  I absolutely love the idea of another species of intelligent life living on earth, but living in a place where we couldn't have previously seen them or noticed them...in the depths of the ocean.It's truly hard to believe that this film was made way back in 1989, because it looks so crisp and clear and looks better than a some movies released today.The cast in just superb across the board.  Ed Harris pulls off one of his best performances and probably my favorite.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also pulls of one of her better performances.  Michael Biehn plays his part very well in his third outing with director James Cameron, I guess there's a reason Jim keeps using him in his films.  The only other cast members that I recognize from other films are Kimberly Scott (in her first role ever and doing an extraordinary job), Chris Elliot (very odd to see him in a non-comedic role, but it was cool to see him nonetheless), and Ken Jenkins (of TV's Scubs).  Despite the cast being relatively unfamiliar faces, they all did a fantastic job and deserve a great deal of credit for their work.I have to talk about the special effects in the film.  They are nothing less than spectacular.  Some of the blue screen effects are a little off, but I certainly won't hold that against the makers, everything else is just PERFECT!I would definitely recommend this film to everyone.  There is so much good stuff in this film, and I think it appeals to a wide variety of people.  It's got sci-fi, action, suspense, romance, comedy, ...everything!  I hope that you will give this film a chance if you haven't seen it already, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.

But when the feds find him, he has gone into a coma. But technology that allows social workers to enter patients minds may be the key to finding out where his latest victim is before the cell drowns her. Enter a gifted psychologist (Jennifer Lopez, the film's lead) who mainly works with traumatized children.  Her initial job is to go in, discover where the victim is, and get out.  But when she discovers that the killer has a tortured inner child, she tries to get emotionally involved, an act which could destroy her mentally. This is, however, Tarsem's film.  If India has more directors like this, then it's a shame we don't see more films from that country.  There is some CGI, but this is mostly makeup and set work; computers are kept to a minimum.  Tarsem shows us a startling portrayal of a killer's mind, which seems very believable.  Mark Protosevich wrote a so-so script, which isn't a bad thing; it just means that when you see this movie, there's three things you should be paying attention to.  The first is Tarsem's visuals.  The second is how the characters interact with the environment. The third, one of my favorite's, is the performance by Vincent D'Onofrio. I swear, this man is a genius, even though he is overshadowed by Tarsem's work.  This is so different from his role on Law & Order Criminal Intent, it's just amazing how he can move from role to role.  On another note, did anyone notice the similarity between the two Vince's?  I mean, they're both tall, 300 pound gorillas with bad posture.  If you saw one of them from behind, you probably couldn't tell who it is. Overall, worth renting.

It is unpretentious, raw, and mythic. I didn't enjoy it when I saw it as a child. It is an adult's film. Conan the Destroyer was made for a younger crowd - children to college age. Despite the PG rating, it does have plenty of rolling heads and blood, though to satisfy the adult audience. The difference in this film is that there is an emphasis on humor and the characters are not as interesting. It IS a weaker film, but it still is a good film.Uncompared, as every film should be viewed, this is a nice little fantasy. The scenes with the evil wizard in the ice palace are wonderfully mythical and the sword-fighting is just barbaric and true to the Conan character. The musical score by the returning Basil Poledouris is excellent too. It really adds to the credibility of the film. Schwarzenegger is good here too. He seems to be having fun and he definitely is a perfect Conan. Just as good is the return of Mako as Akiro the Wizard. He is definitely Conan's best ally and he turns in a much better performance than the rest of his team. Chamberlain is good enough and it was smart that he doesn't have too much dialogue. He gets to look imposing. Sarah Douglas is terrific as the sexy evil queen and the only shame in her character is that we do not see more of her. She has a certain dignity and mystical quality that a beautiful evil villainess should have.What doesn't work as well in the film is the acting of the supporting cast, less the people just mentioned. Most of all, it is weakly directed, though. There just doesn't seem to be a driving force in this film. It feels as if wanders along. It would be more interesting to see what makes the princess choose the course that they take. The film lacks purpose.Overall, though, this film entertains and is still a worthy sequel to Barbarian. It rates about 3 points less though, almost solely based on the directing strength that John Milius gave the first film. He is what is sorely missed in this one. On its' own, however, this is a fun film and can be totally satisfying as such.

He seems to be having fun and he definitely is a perfect Conan. Just as good is the return of Mako as Akiro the Wizard. He is definitely Conan's best ally and he turns in a much better performance than the rest of his team. Chamberlain is good enough and it was smart that he doesn't have too much dialogue. He gets to look imposing. Sarah Douglas is terrific as the sexy evil queen and the only shame in her character is that we do not see more of her. She has a certain dignity and mystical quality that a beautiful evil villainess should have.What doesn't work as well in the film is the acting of the supporting cast, less the people just mentioned. Most of all, it is weakly directed, though. There just doesn't seem to be a driving force in this film. It feels as if wanders along. It would be more interesting to see what makes the princess choose the course that they take. The film lacks purpose.Overall, though, this film entertains and is still a worthy sequel to Barbarian. It rates about 3 points less though, almost solely based on the directing strength that John Milius gave the first film. He is what is sorely missed in this one. On its' own, however, this is a fun film and can be totally satisfying as such.

It is unpretentious, raw, and mythic. I didn't enjoy it when I saw it as a child. It is an adult's film. Conan the Destroyer was made for a younger crowd - children to college age. Despite the PG rating, it does have plenty of rolling heads and blood, though to satisfy the adult audience. The difference in this film is that there is an emphasis on humor and the characters are not as interesting. It IS a weaker film, but it still is a good film.Uncompared, as every film should be viewed, this is a nice little fantasy.

The two team up using West's shoot first approach and Gordon's gadgets to take on the high-tech weaponry of Loveless.Every year we have blockbusters that throw money at the screen in the hope of buying sufficient hype and effects to make people watch. Some times these films are actually quite good or at least OK but often they are shocking wastes of money that are just plain awful. That is the case here. Not having ever seen the TV show I can only imagine that I am missing out on the knowledge necessary to enjoy this film. The plot is just a spin on the mismatched partner movies we've all seen before, however here it goes into all sorts of cross-dressing and stupid gadget antics.The action scenes are reasonable but are spoilt by just how damn stupid the whole thing is. The gadgets are just daft and the use of disguises and silly events just make it seem even more silly and not worth while. The overblown effects shots are just daft and the supposed 'visual climax' of the ultimate weapon is laughable.The spark that existed in Men in Black is totally absent here. I had ZERO laughs all through this film. Only two in-jokes actually raised a smile (an amusing 'His Master's Voice' and a dig at Lawrence Kasdan). Smith tries hard but to see the Oscar nominee dressed up as a belly dancer is just plain embarrassing and he makes a fool of himself. Kline also is foolish and doesn't bond with Smith one bit. Hayek is wasted in a small role and the film's only interest in her is in her body, cutting to her ass as much as possible - she is a better actress than this and the film does her a huge disservice. To talk of how awful Brannagh is in this film is to understate the fact. This man, who I have seen recently in 'Shackleton', 'Rabbit Proof Fence' and 'Hamlet' being excellent is terrible here &#x96; he overacts to the point that it isn't even fun &#x96; it is just plain daft and annoying. Having him only have half a body just makes it all worse somehow.Overall this is a rare thing &#x96; a summer blockbuster that will stick in you memory, it's just a shame it sticks for all the wrong reasons. It is absurd yet incredibly unfunny, full of good actors but lacking a single good performance and very expensive but just looking ridiculous with every increasingly dumb special effect shot.

The gadgets are just daft and the use of disguises and silly events just make it seem even more silly and not worth while. The overblown effects shots are just daft and the supposed 'visual climax' of the ultimate weapon is laughable.The spark that existed in Men in Black is totally absent here. I had ZERO laughs all through this film. Only two in-jokes actually raised a smile (an amusing 'His Master's Voice' and a dig at Lawrence Kasdan). Smith tries hard but to see the Oscar nominee dressed up as a belly dancer is just plain embarrassing and he makes a fool of himself. Kline also is foolish and doesn't bond with Smith one bit. Hayek is wasted in a small role and the film's only interest in her is in her body, cutting to her ass as much as possible - she is a better actress than this and the film does her a huge disservice. To talk of how awful Brannagh is in this film is to understate the fact. This man, who I have seen recently in 'Shackleton', 'Rabbit Proof Fence' and 'Hamlet' being excellent is terrible here &#x96; he overacts to the point that it isn't even fun &#x96; it is just plain daft and annoying. Having him only have half a body just makes it all worse somehow.Overall this is a rare thing &#x96; a summer blockbuster that will stick in you memory, it's just a shame it sticks for all the wrong reasons. It is absurd yet incredibly unfunny, full of good actors but lacking a single good performance and very expensive but just looking ridiculous with every increasingly dumb special effect shot.

With major scientists going missing all over the world, the President puts the two men together to prevent crazed Southerner Loveless from carrying out his threat to take over the US. The two team up using West's shoot first approach and Gordon's gadgets to take on the high-tech weaponry of Loveless.Every year we have blockbusters that throw money at the screen in the hope of buying sufficient hype and effects to make people watch. Some times these films are actually quite good or at least OK but often they are shocking wastes of money that are just plain awful. That is the case here.

Dennis Hopper plays a schoolteacher with a gimpy leg who is quite unexceptional.  He's middle-aged but still only engaged (to Amy Irving who is fantastic in this!)and still lives with his aged mother (the wonderful Julie Harris).  Suddenly, a young, fresh, beautiful and vibrant teenager arrives at his school and he finds his heart - and other vital organs - stirred beyond endurance. She's technically not innocent (she's not a virgin) but she's no Lolita either. She's the epitome of the young women of Andrew Wyeth's paintings. In fact, the whole film looks and feels like a Wyeth painting organic and idyllic with an emptiness that's filed with loneliness. The script is intelligent and original, allowing each character to be fully developed, and Dennis Hopper gives the performance of his career.I've read a few reviews here and elsewhere that complain about Hopper's age and the frontal nudity.  I belong to the school of thought that nothing natural is ugly, and that art should not ALWAYS be pure and youthful and beatific (which BTW, was what Hitler's vision was. Art that wasn't beautiful was classified as degenerate and banned).  If there's room for artists like Michelangeo and Egon Schiele in this world, and there's surely room for Brad Pitt AND Dennis Hopper!  If the nude body is something that you just can't look at then a film like this may not be for you (there's only one very brief scene). But keep in mind that you can't broaden your vision of humanity if you don't have an open mind and are willing to look below the superficial surface that at least in Hollywood, poses as reality.
