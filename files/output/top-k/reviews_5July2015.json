It's not the most gut wrenching comedy you'll see, but it has a few heavy scenes that most comedies don't. I think they did a pretty good job on it because there are a lot of places where they could have slipped up and didn't. Two examples are 1) not trying to give an explanation for why the time lapse happens since that would have created another storyline with a lot of room for error, and 2) keeping it to a PG rating, because it probably have detracted from the overall effect if we had thirty more scenes of Phil doing everything he would never dare do normally. If you took this exact same concept and put it into a modern movie, it wouldn't be as good. We pretty much saw this exemplified by Click, which had a similar feel to Groundhog's Day even though it was kind of the inverse concept.Our protagonist is egotistical and slightly unlikeable weatherman Phil Conners. We get to see nearly every side of his personality as he reacts to his plight of being stuck in one of his least favorite days of the year. Regardless of how any give viewer feels about his personality, almost everyone will be able to sympathize with Phil to an extent at one point or another. Some people might not like it that Phil ends up a nicer guy at the end and does a 180, but I would argue that it's completely plausible. We can approximate that Phil was stuck in Groundhog's Day for at least a year, probably much more. And he had plenty of time to think along with plenty to think about. Besides that we see his progression from irresponsibility, to depression, to self improvement and generosity. So I think his maturing was completely plausible, though not inevitable. We get to know some of the other characters fairly well like Larry the cameraman, Phil's high school classmate Ned Ryerson, the lady who runs the hotel, and obviously Phil's new co-worker and love interest Rita. I read a review that said Rita was portrayed as too perfect, which might be true, but it might also just be that Phil is so insensitive to her that we don't notice her shortcomings. Besides, for all we know she just woke up on the right side of the bed that particular day and was a horrible person the rest of the time.The comedy is mostly comprised of the different ironic situations Phil gets into from repeating the same day and how he reacts to the differently each day. There are a few good one-liners, but there is relatively little verbal comedy for the most part.You might get annoyed with the repetition of the different events, as Phil does, but it's not very annoying considering that they have to repeat some events several times. This reflects pretty well on the screenwriter(s) with the way they gave the audience enough information, but didn't repeat it. The way they executed the progression of Phil trying to win over Rita was well done, along with him learning the piano and the general knowledge that he gains of the Punxatawny (probably spelled that wrong) residents. It doesn't come off as spectacular, but it's notable that there weren't any problems with those scenes.I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story or plot basis. The acting's fine, and you could argue that Bill Murray has an above par performance. It is properly labeled as a comedy, but there are enough serious dramatic elements that you shouldn't choose it if you're looking for strictly comedy. It's one of very few movies that can be enjoyed by all ages without being completely kid geared, so you can enjoy it equally with your family or on your own. If you don't like Rita's character or the general story after about forty minutes, it's probably not worth your time to finish it out. Overall Rating 8.2\/10.

From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her. If I told you that the murderer was a massive cyborg who was sent back through time to assassinate the eventual mother of humanity's last hero, you'd probably think I was describing something less than brilliant. You'd be wrong. The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.Sarah has a hero. Also sent from the future, Kyle Reese appears to thwart the Terminator's attempts and protect Sarah at all costs. Through a seemingly unending series of chases, Reese explains the truth to Sarah, and the two of them promptly set off to... avoid the homicidal robot at all costs. Throw in some unfortunate hooligans who unwisely mock the hulking beast, an oversexed roommate, a disco full of mid-'80s dancers and a barracks full of the most unlucky cops ever caught on film, and you have the ingredients for one dark and violent thrill ride.As the Terminator, Schwarzenegger (Commando) shines. With very few lines of dialogue to worry about, Schwarzenegger can concentrate on that cold dark stare and a truly menacing presence. Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast. Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on. As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right action-hero buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor... and the tender moments last about three minutes in total.With one of the more clever sci-fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard. While many feel that the sequel is the better film, I'd contend that Terminator 2 was merely more expensive. If you're building yourself a digital sci-fi collection, this movie should definitely be on your Top Ten list.

Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on.

From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her.

The film takes place in the campus at MIT, where Hunting works as a janitor. One day after his class is over, mathematics Professor Lambeau writes a problem on the board that took several MIT professors two years to figure out, and challenges his students to solve it. When Hunting sees the problem, he solves it by himself in a matter of minutes. The movie then unravels the genius in him, but also portrays his many weaknesses and his rough childhood. One of my favorite aspects of this film is Hunting's relationship with the psychologist Sean, played by Robin Williams. Sean is persuaded by Lambeau to council and give advice to a metaphorically speaking lost Hunting, after Hunting gets sent away from five other counselors. Sean asks Hunting some thought provoking questions that lead him to pursue the dreams of his heart. Their relationship is like one of doctor and patient, as Hunting describes toward the end of the film. Sean tolerates him even after horrible disagreements and arguments they had with each other, and he never loses hope in him. Sean is one of the few people that actually understands Hunting, and why he does what he does. Unlike Lambeau, who often sees Hunting as an object of great power to be handled with force and control, Sean puts himself in Hunting's shoes and relates to him. For that reason, Hunting reciprocates this friendship and learns to trust Sean's judgement. A major portion of Hunting's actions at the end happen because of the advice that Sean had given him. Another great aspect of this film is the dialogue. The dialogue between few characters in this movie flows very naturally and really moves the story along. Whether it's between Hunting and his three closest friends, between Professor Lambeau and Sean, or between Sean and Hunting, the dialogue is incredibly real. A major theme in this movie is finding oneself, and finding what one really wants to do with his\/her life. Talent and natural ability is one thing, but how will you use it? Will you just let it go to waste and stay comfortably in the status quo? Or will you go out and seek the adventures that your heart desires? Hunting has trouble identifying what his passions are, or what he wants to do with his life. When asked by Sean, Hunting cannot give a single straight answer. As far as I'm concerned, this film doesn't have any flaws, though some parts of the film may not be entertaining for everyone, and the beginning starts off quite slow. Other than that, I think people who enjoy watching classic films will love Good Will Hunting.After nearly twenty years since its release, Good Will Hunting remains one of the most powerful films ever made. This movie has a lot of heart, wit, and fun in it, though it revolves around a much more serious theme. This film is one of the few that can break your heart yet leave you smiling.

Even though I sometimes write spoilers I'm not going to spoil who the villain of the film is (I knew in the first 15 minutes of the film) but that doesn't really matter since it is so easy to figure out.I noticed that this film set a lot of precedents for action films made after this film. For example, if you have seen the first Spider-man film with Tobey Maguire then you probably remember the scene where Peter's single drop of blood signals Osbourne to become suspicious of his environment, and it is a very tense, simple scene. Well, in Mission Impossible, Tom Cruise is breaking into a room which will sound an alarm if the tiniest amount of weight is added to the room, even a drop of water, and Cruise starts sweating, and the scene becomes tense when a single drop of sweat is about to fall from the glasses he is wearing.This movie seems to think it is being overly smart which gets annoying when you realize the story is pretty simple. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on a mission at the start of the movie that goes haywire and results in the death of most of his team members. Somebody who is higher up than Hunt in this business calls him to a meeting immediately, where Hunt learns they think he is a traitor, so he has been set up. The plot then focuses on Hunt trying to contact the actual mole in the agency by referencing a specific bible verse from the book of Job (something was mentioned about a job in his initial meeting with the executive) and in my mind it is kind of confusing how he knows exactly what to say and who to e-mail to try to find the mole. It becomes like speaking in riddles and I do not think the movie needed to be this smart when its purpose was to be a fun action movie.Towards the end of the film, the CGI is just plain terrible in the climactic action sequence. Not to say that the action itself is not fun, but it just breaks the illusion of the film and you realize you're watching a movie (a movie should allow you to get lost in it). This is especially noticeable when Cruise's character flies towards the camera at one point, and you notice that the Cruise coming at you is computer generated for two thirds of the jump. The one effect I was astounded by, however, was the use of masks in the film - I'm not sure if the masks were real masks, but damn, they were elaborate masks that copied exactly how other characters in the movie looked, and I have to say bravo.I didn't enjoy this action movie since it wasn't as fun for me as other action movies, but perhaps this is your type of action movie; who am I to say?

But is a film for which reputation outstrips reality.Most everyone is familiar with the story of Sunset Boulevard, that of faded silent film star Norma Desmond. The faded star lives in an equally faded mansion, plotting a comeback which is far-fetched to say the least. Failing screenwriter Joe Gillis stumbles into Norma's bizarre world and, at the price of his dignity, feeds her delusions. A man's gotta make a living and Joe will make his by brushing up the godawful script Norma has written as her comeback vehicle. Joe will soon realize Norma wants him as more than a script doctor. He is to be her lover, a kept man living in her grotesque mansion, surrounded by the relics of Norma's past, reminders of a life which for her is gone forever. Of course in her deluded mind Norma is just as big a star as she ever was. It's the pictures that got small.Gloria Swanson turns in a performance for the ages. Her portrayal of Norma does match the hype, even if the film as a whole may not. The descent into madness is breathtaking to watch. Yes, Swanson is a little over-the-top at times but that is who Norma is. Especially as Norma begins to lose all touch with reality. William Holden, playing Joe, is not bad but certainly not up to the level of Swanson. Joe is a bit of a dry character, he could use some more personality. Holden doesn't make him into as much of a presence as he really needs to be for the film to truly grab you. Erich von Stroheim, playing Norma's ever-faithful butler Max, does have a presence, a quite ominous one. But as we learn more about the character Max becomes less ominous and more sad. It's a sad world Norma Desmond lives in and that sadness grabs everyone who falls under her sway. Joe knows he has to escape. He tries to find happiness with beautiful young Betty Schaefer, with whom he secretly works on a script. But nobody escapes Norma Desmond easily.All in all Sunset Boulevard tells a very sad tale, centered around the quite pitiable Norma Desmond. Norma longs for a world which is forever gone. She won't accept it and nobody will try to make her do so. Max, her only companion before Joe shows up, allows Norma to live in her fantasy world. She retreats so far into her fantasy there is no way back to reality. Norma cannot be saved. She has lost her mind. And despite the fact she does some truly loathsome things you can't help but feel sorry for her. For you saw those moments where the old Norma Desmond shined through, where you could see her for the great star she once was. But those moments are fleeting and ultimately those moments are gone. Only a sad, pathetic shell of Norma Desmond remains. It's a sad journey the character takes, a journey Swanson captures ever so well. You just wish the rest of the film was up to Swanson's standard. Holden can't quite match her. Nancy Olson brings a desperately needed breath of fresh air to the film in playing Betty but the romance between Betty and Joe never fully sparks to life. von Stroheim is memorable in his own way but his character is ultimately almost as sad as Norma. So much sadness in this film. Sunset Boulevard has a captivating story to tell but in the end maybe there is a little too much sadness. And madness. By the end it veers dangerously close to parody. There is much to appreciate about the film but to label it as one of the greatest films ever is to give it more praise than it deserves. It is a good film to be sure. But perhaps upon close examination Sunset Boulevard is not quite ready for its closeup.

Even though An Officer and a Gentleman came out in 1982, six years after I was born, I only just recently stumbled across it recently (sorry for my tardiness), just because my elders talked so much about it so I just wanted to know what the hype was about and to see if it will leave me with a lasting impression.For those who never seen the film it stars Richard Gere as a young man named Zack Mayo who has recently checked himself into the Navy OCS located in Washington. From the early scenes we discover that Mayo's life was not a very pleasant one. At a very young age, his mother killed herself and was forced to stay with his father (Robert Loggia) while stationed in the Philippines. His father's nurturing was absent since all he had on his mind was drinking and chasing prostitutes. Zach wasn't really prepared for the tough regiments that the OCS had to offer as he struggling in terms of handling commitment let alone following authoritative figures.Mayo is under the tutelage of gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley (Louis Gossett Jr.) and it comes to no surprise that their encountering is just on the horizon. Mayo seems to excel quite well on the physical initiatives that the Navy has to offer, but academically is quite the other story. This leads to Mayo forming a friendship with a fellow classmate named Sid Worley (David Keith) as he will do everything he can to get Mayo into the Aerodynamics class in exchange for immaculate belt- buckles and boots whenever there's a barracks inspection. The main setting for this movie is set in the OCS, there's also a vital subplot that involves Zach, Sid and a couple of girls Puget Debs who they meet when they're off campus during their weekend. The two ladies are Paula Pokrifki (Debra Winger) and Lynette Pomeroy (Lisa Blount) who a scrounging for military meat in hopes for a quick marriage proposal. These Puget Debs play riskier attempts to get their catch like faking their pregnancies or other things like that. Paula hooks up with Zach while Lynette is onto Sid.The rest of the way it's Zach trying to get through 13 weeks of OCS training and while getting adjusted to Paula. Since Zach is the titular character, fans seem to pretty much know the outcome of the story, but that doesn't deprive itself from being entertaining. After 33 years, I can safely say that An Officer and a Gentleman has aged quite gracefully. There are a lot of wonderful scenes with many authentic scenes that just can't be beat. Who could forget when Zach confesses to Sgt. Foley I got nowhere else to go, plus the final scene where Mayo is now an ensign finds Paula and walks out with her to the applause of his colleagues. The pacing was also very well structured. Even though the film was almost at the two hour mark, there was never a boring moment and that was because the romantic scenes never interfered with the OCS scenes and it flowed in a more natural way. We also deeply care about the characters and we hope that Zach and Paula stay a couple and hope they live a happy life after the credits roll. Overall this movie gets a 9\/10 that's highly recommended, even if you're a late bloomer like me, it's better late than never if you haven't seen this movie. It still holds up today since its release back in 1982.

","genre":"Drama, Family, Musical"},{"date":"5 July 2015","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Bond Review. Title Another title named after the main villain and it does have a sophisticated ring to it.Pre-Titles An action-packed opening sees Bond blow up a drug laboratory, trying to seduce a dancer and dispatching a henchman via electrocution in a bath. This is the perfect pre-title sequence filled with energy and bringing you straight into the action, ending with Bond brilliantly delivering the classic line, ''Shocking&#x85;.positively shocking.''Theme Song Shirley Bassey's 'Goldfinger' has become iconic and one of the most popular songs in the series. It has excellent instrumental work, a certain mysterious quality and Bassey sings it with a burning passion.Plot Bond begins to investigate gold magnate Auric Goldfinger who is accused of stockpiling gold bullion. He soon discovers Goldfinger's plan named Operation Grandslam, which involves contaminating Fort Knox's gold supply and disrupting the world economy. The story is the ideal mix of the far-fetched and espionage. The main plot sounds quite daft, but it is played out with a realistic tone and kept straightforward so that it never gets too extravagant. The pacing is superb once again, the story moves along at a great speed and it smartly only slows down during the most important scenes.James Bond Sean Connery is at his most content in the role and it is clear that he is enjoying himself throughout. He tones down the rough edges of Bond and really plays up the smooth charm of the character, which sounds like a retreat but it works perfectly for this film. Connery's charisma is at an all-time high and he makes an engaging screen presence.Bond Girls Honor Blackman, mostly known for her work on The Avengers, is top notch as the famously title Pussy Galore. She flawlessly plays Galore as no-nonsense and initially cynical, but she has believable chemistry with Connery and they share some really good scenes. Shirley Eaton is very good in her small role as the charming Jill Masterson, the image of her painted in gold is one of the films many memorable moments.Villains Gert Frobe is truly wonderful as Goldfinger. He has a commanding, almost larger than life presence and gets the message across with his facial expressions alone. Frobe makes Goldfinger someone we want to find out more about and he consistently delivers great line after great line. Harold Sakata set the bar for hulking henchmen as the silent Oddjob. He uses his movements and expressions to his best ability giving his mute character, he is a real physical presence and an intimidating figure.Support Cec Linder is one of the weaker points as Leiter given Jack Lord's great performance prior, he just looks too old to be convincing and comes off more like Bond's goofy uncle than a CIA spy. Tania Mallet is fairly decent as Tilly Masterson and is convincing as someone who wants revenge.Action The action scenes move seamlessly from small and gritty to big set-pieces. The Pre-titles and Bond's infiltration of Goldfinger's headquarters are really exciting sequences that are heavy on intensity. Bond's confrontation with Oddjob is excellent as well as suitably brutal and the demise of Goldfinger, though dated and daft, is good fun.Score John Barry delivers one of his best scores here. The music is memorable throughout and adds a striking quality to many already important scenes. He balances everything out beautifully once again, the creeping intense sounds for the low-key scenes and big bombastic numbers for the action.Production Values Production wise this is a change from Young's grounded approach into something much more slick and stylish that would remain in future instalments. Hamilton clearly has a good eye for shots and he knows how to approach scenes to make them memorable. We get so many iconic moments and pieces here, Masterson covered in gold paint, Goldfinger's laser ready to cut Bond in half, Oddjob's razor hat and the Aston Martin DB5. Not to mention great lines like ''No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.'' Goldfinger is a film that is packed full of unforgettable imagery and that helps it live long in the memory. The locations are all excellent as usual and setting most of it in the United States gives it a unique edge, whilst Ken Adam is back to design more stunning sets. We also get the first signs of Q branch and the addition of more crazy but cool gadgets, which are surprisingly well-thought out here. Conclusion For many Goldfinger is the quintessential Bond flick and it is very easy to see why. This is Bond at its most entertaining and it goes all out to thrill the audience in every single aspect. It abandons the low-key approach of the previous films, but it doesn't get too unbelievable and keeps you gripped at all times. The plot is enjoyable and keeps you interested, whilst the acting is very good from almost everyone involved. It also set up many aspects that would be poorly copied later on such as big villains, emphasising gadgets and a slightly more humorous tone, but all of these are at their best here. Memorable is the work that sums up Goldfinger the best and it is the best Bond film purely from an entertainment sense.

It took about six years for it to enter production, due to issues with the effects for the T-1000 to work, and the rights to the Terminator franchise. When it did, the work for the film lasted about 171 days, nearly half a year. They filmed at around 20 different locations for the film to be made. When the film was finally released, having spent about $94-$102 million dollars on the film, the film quickly made back it's budget about 5 times. Many people have given the film rave reviews, as the film has an 8.5 on IMDb and a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. So, let's see if the film holds up after twenty-four years, and if the film is any good.Terminator 2 Judgment Day follows John Connor as he comes into contact with a reprogrammed T-800 who has been sent into the past to protect John from the T-1000, a upgraded Terminator that can turn into any living being and has been tasked to kill John to prevent the future from ever occurring.This film is freaking amazing. Okay? Just saying. The acting in this film is outstanding. Returning actors Schwarzenegger and Hamilton both do fantastic jobs as their roles, and Hamilton does an even better job than before, portraying a slightly more hardened, more badass Sarah Connor. Edward Furlong, in his first film role, does a pretty good job as John Connor. I mean, there are a few cringe-worthy moments, but isn't that how most child actors are? Robert Patrick... I really think there's no really good way to describe his phenomenal acting in this film. He's menacing and always has that sort of look on his face of menacing, yet somewhat charming. Reminds me of Norman Bates, haha. And Joe Morton does a fairly good job as Miles Dyson, basically the man behind the future SkyNet.The score was done once again by Brad Fiedel and he manages to one-up himself from the previous film. Don't believe me? Then listen to the music played over the opening credits, because it's kickass! It really does set the tone for the rest of the film. The special effects this time around are one hell of a lot better than the first go through. I mean, sure, the stopmotion Terminator at the end of the first one wasn't that bad, but the special effects for certain scenes, especially ones involving the T-1000, are a thousand times better. It's amazing that special effects created in the early 1990s are sometimes better than the ones in films made a few years ago.The screenplay written by James Cameron was as good as it was last time. I watched the Special Edition\/Director's Cut, because I heard that was the best version, and while some of the humor in that version was a bit weird, it was still really good. I can't imagine the film without those scenes now. The cinematography in some scenes, especially scenes when they are driving and wide shots of the city all look amazing, and that's thanks to the cinematographer, Adam Greenberg. He really did a fantastic job with this film.The plot works for the most part. I mean, of course, there's going to be a few discrepancies, no matter how minor, because this is essentially a film where several people time travel and change the history that's been established. The fact that so much happens over the two and a half hour film and it all still manages to make sense is quite amazing, to be honest.Overall, Judgment Day is a very worthy sequel to the original Terminator, and dare I say it, it surpasses the original. The music, acting, screenplay, cinematography, plot and special effects, especially, all look and sound truly amazing. I do recognize the film has it's flaws, but you know what, I'm still going to give it one of my highest ratings because it is definitely becoming one of my favorite films.

(Matthew 1313)Sarah Connor a young woman, a to be mother of the future savior, John Connor. The names seem inspired from Sarah wife of Abraham, who miraculously by God's help bore Isaac in her old age, as Bible says Through your descendant all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me and name of Jesus Christ with initials JC, led to Sarah and John Connor (JC).It is shown that in the future an artificial intelligence called Skynet attempted to destroy all humanity by starting a nuclear war and extermination of humans in death camps.However humans led by John Connor managed to defeat it, so to prevent its destruction it built a time machine and sent a killer cyborg into the past, called the terminator, to kill the mother of the unborn John Connor, Sarah.Terminator acts like king Herod, who ordered killing of all children from Bethlehem to kill also the king of Israel and Messiah Jesus Christ, attempting to kill all women called Sarah Connor.The terminator seems to be influenced by earlier movie robot types such as evil clone of Maria from 1920s Metropolis, also with deep Christian influences.Having no shame, no guilt, no fear, no mercy, acting like a beast, not a human, he seems to be inspired by image of the beast from the book of Revelation And he (beast of earth) had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.. (Revelation 135-6)In this lies conviction of those who are human in appearance only, but are like beasts in their action, lacking love, care, goodness which come only from God, who makes us human.To protect Sarah Connor, her son John sends one of his soldiers Kyle Reese, as was mentioned in one internet article, acting as both angel Gabriel and Holy Spirit of God, telling Sarah about her future son and conceiving him in her.In this is the paradox enacted, the son acts like his own father, by sending his real father to save him and conceive him from his mother. It is close to the Christian faith notion of trinity, where God is altogether Father, Son and Holy Spirit, as humans made in his image are composed of mind, body and spirit, yet are one being.After a long round of chases, Sarah and Kyle manage to damage and burn the flesh of the cyborg, as was prophesied And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. (Revelation 1920)By the last remaining bomb, the terminator is badly damaged, crawling without feet, Kyle is killed and Sarah badly injured, unable to walk too. Finally she manages to crush it under a press, reminding me the Genesis prophecy from God about serpent aka Satan's fight against humans and being destroyed by a hit to the headAnd the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel. (Genesis 314-15)Thus i thank God and Lord Jesus Christ for giving me wisdom to uncover it as an apocalyptic tale of struggle between Satan and Jesus Christ who will win and will lead his people to the promised land, God's Kingdom of Heaven.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"5 July 2015","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" As a Christian I'll try by God's help to uncover the spiritual meaning and influences of this movie, including the causes of its popularity and enduring factor.I watched it more than 20 years ago, even before really believing in God and His Son and my Lord Jesus Christ.At first sight Terminator seems to be a typical late 70s-early 80s action\/horror movie, which were mostly based during the night, like early John Carpenter's movies Halloween, Attack on Precinct 13 and Escape from New York, which adds to the fear factor, as having a seemingly unstoppable and almost silent villain, who seems to represent pure evil, barely stopped by a final girl.The cause might be rooted in the global politic and economical crisis which was occurring then, lack of resources, large unemployment, rise of crime, as well as fear of nuclear war.The difference is that Terminator offers a solution to these fears, a savior figure who could deliver the humanity even from the case of the worst &#x96; a nuclear holocaust.The main source of inspiration for Terminator is actually Christian faith and the Bible, which already predicted a future Judgement day, great tribulation, as well the Savior in Son of God Jesus Christ.I think it is by God's help that this movie was made, even in Hollywood industry, a money-making business; but nobody likes pure materialism, hence it is the spiritual subtext acts as a parable, assuring its popularity, despite increasing apostasy from Christian faith and worldliness.As God and Lord Jesus Christ said Therefore speak I to them in parables because seeing they see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. (Matthew 1313)Sarah Connor a young woman, a to be mother of the future savior, John Connor. The names seem inspired from Sarah wife of Abraham, who miraculously by God's help bore Isaac in her old age, as Bible says Through your descendant all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me and name of Jesus Christ with initials JC, led to Sarah and John Connor (JC).It is shown that in the future an artificial intelligence called Skynet attempted to destroy all humanity by starting a nuclear war and extermination of humans in death camps.However humans led by John Connor managed to defeat it, so to prevent its destruction it built a time machine and sent a killer cyborg into the past, called the terminator, to kill the mother of the unborn John Connor, Sarah.Terminator acts like king Herod, who ordered killing of all children from Bethlehem to kill also the king of Israel and Messiah Jesus Christ, attempting to kill all women called Sarah Connor.The terminator seems to be influenced by earlier movie robot types such as evil clone of Maria from 1920s Metropolis, also with deep Christian influences.Having no shame, no guilt, no fear, no mercy, acting like a beast, not a human, he seems to be inspired by image of the beast from the book of Revelation And he (beast of earth) had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.. (Revelation 135-6)In this lies conviction of those who are human in appearance only, but are like beasts in their action, lacking love, care, goodness which come only from God, who makes us human.To protect Sarah Connor, her son John sends one of his soldiers Kyle Reese, as was mentioned in one internet article, acting as both angel Gabriel and Holy Spirit of God, telling Sarah about her future son and conceiving him in her.In this is the paradox enacted, the son acts like his own father, by sending his real father to save him and conceive him from his mother. It is close to the Christian faith notion of trinity, where God is altogether Father, Son and Holy Spirit, as humans made in his image are composed of mind, body and spirit, yet are one being.After a long round of chases, Sarah and Kyle manage to damage and burn the flesh of the cyborg, as was prophesied And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

How about songs that are so dorky and gooey that you feel the strong urge to vomit? Usually, one has to visit an insane asylum to find people this severely disturbed. I was raised in Catholic schools; nuns whale on you with rulers and generally rough you up. Has anyone on earth met nuns like these? The lyrics to the songs are natural emetics. When I say slimy goo, I mean the lyrics are frighteningly disturbed. Make up your own lyrics it is the only way to maintain your sanity. I like You are brain dead, I'm an idiot, how will we find our way?.., I suggest you try for your stomach's sake. The unrelenting sickly sweet goo that will be slimed all over you; musicals always have some idealization, this is a masterpiece of psychosis, not one scene in the movie is real. Robert Wise did the Motionless Picture which moves faster than this. He evidently suffered some kind of mental breakdown while making the film. Has he read a history book about the Nazis? See, they do not get out flashlights and spend three hours searching for the Von Craps. No, they line the nuns up and then start shooting them until either they run out of nuns or somebody points out where the Von Craps are hiding. I grew up in a family this large and it is a miracle I am still alive. Parents out there? Is this a realistic picture of raising six children? Are they all lovable, mischievous little angels like this? Please, OK? We are going to vomit. How about mother superior's eardrum shattering rendition of Climb Every Plot Hole? They should have used her on the Nazis. You know, hit high C again honey, just wait for us to get our headphones on first. The fillings in my teeth were rattling with her note. Please, that was not music; it was auditory assault. Did you enjoy seeing a grown man, dressed in lederhosen, crying like a baby over his favorite little white flower? Did you know that about 90% of Austrians were out there cheering Adolph when he took over their country without firing a shot? Please, stop with the revisionism. The whole audience would have grabbed strudel boy and beat the crap out of him. Read a history book, please. Young people, the movie is the length of your entire life up to this point. Your mind will be assaulted by a world that never has nor ever will exist except in the mind of a crazy or heavily sedated person. It is like being drowned in honey. One gooey, maudlin, lobotomized, insipid song after another. We have the historical insult of making an exception, Von Crap, depicted as typical of all Austrians. Gee, who were all those thousands of people throwing flowers at that crazy paper hanging mass murderer? If they had come into my neighborhood, on those sissy bikes, crooning Do Re I Got To Pee, they better have all their premiums paid up in full.
