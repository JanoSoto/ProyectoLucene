You would think SOMEONE involved in the production of this movie might have bothered to look something (anything!!)up!I can only conclude that the makers of this film had NO intention of portraying Elizabeth's personality, intelligence, forcefulness, and political acumen accurately, let alone the events of her life and reign.The portrayal of her as faltering and weak in the beginning is hard to swallow, as she was politically subtle and well versed in the arts of intrigue from the cradle.Although so many so-called historical films are not accurate, or portray history through a particular bias, this one must be called total fiction.

Any biography of Elizabeth is replete with references to the huge part he played in her life, both politically and personally.I needn't go on-- I can't go on!

There's a witchy schoolmarm, in one scene made up as the wicked witch from the Wizard of Oz of the same year. She will get burnt, we know.There is the disenfranchised grandson who married secretly and was wounded. We know he will reconcile with his crabby but kindhearted and rich grandfather.We have the stagestruck brother who we know will have a rewarding return to the stage. And of course the centerpiece is the bankrupt, mad, wounded Captain Crewe who we know will be restored to his riches and daughter.There's even a hint that some relationship with Queen Victoria will ensue.But all of this is implied, to occur after the ending placard.

She places Isaiah in a discarded box beside a dumpster then goes to get her fix. She just left him there all night. Luckily he was discovered by some garbageman 10 seconds away from being smashed. Baby Isaiah is rushed to the hospital where Dr. Margaret Lewin administers treatment. She discovers Isaiah is a crack baby, meaning his mother was high on crack when she was pregnant so some of it got into the baby's system; Khalia came to in the morning and went back for Isaiah, only to find him missing; Back at the hospital, Margaret took special care of Isaiah and even took it upon herself to adopt him and take him home to meet her family, husband Charlie and teenage daughter Hannah. The family was Caucasian and Isaiah was African American, but as long as there was love, it made no difference. Khalia meanwhile, still baked, knocked off a liquor store and was incarcerated and sent to a woman's correctional facility.Four years went by, Isaiah was a happy, high-spirited 4-year-old boy. He went to see Hannah's school play and, for no particular reason, threw a huge tantrum, really humiliating his sister; Khalia was released, she quit crack cold turkey, and working steady. She looked after two kids, Amir and Josie, whose mother is a trashy junkie too. Khalia was a good mentor to the children, but whenever she visited their trashy, run down apartment, she kept running into a man, Eddie Hughes, who seemed to have the hots for her. One day, Khalia finds out that Isaiah is alive and well after she was under the impression she had killed him. He is living with a foster family whose adoption had finally been confirmed. Khalia finds the family's address and stalks them, trying to find Isaiah. The next step litigation. She hires a lawyer, Kadar Lewis, because even though the Lewins' adoption of Isaiah was finalized, Khalia never sighed away her parental rights so she was entitled to a hearing. That's our great country's judicial system, even trashy junkies have rights. Charlie and Margaret also hire a lawyer, preferably an African American one; Lewis set up housing for Khalia in a run-down old dump on the west end of town. Not much, but it's home; the court date finally arrived. Judge Silbowitz presiding. When the Lewins took the stand, Lewis seemed to grill them playing the race card. Apparently he didn't feel the Lewins were a fit family for a young African American child.The hearing pressed on and on, both sides delivered good arguments. Margaret points out that all they've been focusing on is skin color and not on what is most important for Isaiah love. Well, soon came the day of judgment. Both sides held their collective breaths as Judge Silbowitz took the bench and announced her verdict...Isaiah would be returned to his birth mother. Well, Margaret and Charlie were devastated. But it was worse for the child, for they had to tear a kicking, screaming Isaiah from the only family he's ever known and give him back to his biological mother who he's never even met. Well, needless to say Isaiah was miserable in his new home. Khalia tried her best to be a good mother and run a suitable home, but Isaiah totally tuned her out. He threw a screaming fit in public on several occasions. Meanwhile Charlie and Margaret were at their wits' end with each other. It was a desperate time for everybody, until one afternoon when Khalia called Margaret for help. They work out an arrangement that would be beneficial for everybody Isaiah would be going to live with the Lewins for a while until he was old enough to understand this whole mess. So it was really a happy ending. For some.Well, Losing Isaiah, what can I say? It's a good movie. It's acted really well, but it's just a bad story, in terms of conscience. Making a movie about a crack-addict mother who abandons her baby then suddenly wants him back and thank to a biased judge, gets him back. I was on the Lewins' side the whole time. I'm not racist, but I do think that sometimes people just focus on skin color much too often. No wonder we still have fights about racial inequality. Anyway, Jessica Lange was good as Margaret Lewin, Halle Berry played a really good trashy crack addict, were we supposed to feel sorry for Khalia at any point in this movie? Because I sure didn't. Cuba Gooding Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, David Strathairn and Daisy Egan were also good in their roles. Marc John Jeffries was the cutest kid; Anyway, if you're in to deep, powerful dramas like this movie or you happen to like Halle Berry or Jessica Lange, then to you I recommend Losing Isaiah. It's not for everybody, however. If your stomach can handle it, see Losing Isaiah today!

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"15 September 2005","score":"5 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" Title They Live (1988) Director John Carpenter Cast Rody Piper, Keith David, Meg Foster Review John Carpenter is hailed as a horror master anywhere you go, and why not he has made such incredible contributions to the genre that heck, there's no way that he could NOT be considered amongst one of the greats. But among those great ones there's a few crappy ones and a few so-so ones. They Live is one of the so-so ones, in my opinion.The story is about a drifter named NADA (that means nothing in Spanish by the way) and the guy is looking for a job trying to make his way in life. So when he ends up in a shelter he discovers that there is actually a whole rebel force teaming up to go up against these aliens that are trying to take over our world. Here comes Roddy Piper and David Keith ready to take them on and kick their collective asses.This movie has a few things going for it and a few bad things going for it. Ill start by the good stuff. First off, the biggest attraction for me with this movie is the story. There's aliens that are trying to take over the world while disguising themselves as human beings is a great story. I love how they represent the rich and oppressive side of humanity. How the rich and powerful are trying to keep the poor poor and ignorant. Only in this movie they are aliens trying to manipulate us via the TV set and subliminal messages spread out all over the media. Great stuff. Immediately anyone who has felt the oppression and constant hammering of the media and the never ending bombardment of TV commercials will instantly identify with this story. So thats what grabbed me right away.What didn't grab me right away was the slow pacing of the film. Right from the get go when you hear the movies soundtrack which consists of a slow as hell bass line you know you are in for a slow flick. And it never really picks up, its just constantly slow. There was never an effort to liven things up, its all very ho hum. Even the action sequences had nothing special about em...and yeah, I'm talking about that fight sequence between Piper and Keith. I really didn't find it all that special.Another thing that didn't really do it for me were the stupid decisions that the characters kept on making over and over again. Walk around broad daylight with a shot gun in hand? Check. Walk into a bank with a shotgun in hand and start shooting at everybody? Check. Hows about letting the aliens know that you can see their true appearance? OK, lets do that! There's more things they do like that, but it just drove me nuts after a while. And ultimately made me hate the main characters....or feel sorry for their high level of stupidity.Then there's the aliens themselves. First off, the rebels say that the aliens are breeding us to use us as slaves? And they want to take over the world, but we never really see any of this happening, in fact the aliens seem pretty harmless to me, save for the fact that they are not from this planet, they really aren't a threat! For the longest time I kept asking myself, why are these aliens being portrayed as evil? What exactly are they doing thats so damn bad for humanity, and an answer to that question never really showed up. So suddenly I felt like the humans were really just being a bunch of racists. Shooting aliens just cause they ain't humans.The look of the aliens didn't really bother me because I think its kind of cool in a low budget sort of way. I mean lets face it, they obviously didn't have much moola if the aliens ended up looking like that. When they talk it looks so fake! You can tell its just a cheap ass mask over the actors face. Anyhows, not a big problem for me, but I'm sure a lot of people will hate it.And finally, I really gotta say that watching this flick I got the same feeling I got when I watched Jhon Carpenters Ghost of Mars and Prince of Darkness. I just really felt that Carpenter got really lazy while making this flick. You can tell certain story elements and script elements could have been developed further and better, you can tell certain scenes could have been directed better had they been planed more elaborately. I don't know the whole film just films like a rushed job, specially towards the ending.But don't get me wrong, I don't hate this movie, I like its themes and what its trying to say.

Those days seem to be gone forever.Rating 21\/2 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 September 2005","score":"5 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" Title They Live (1988) Director John Carpenter Cast Rody Piper, Keith David, Meg Foster Review John Carpenter is hailed as a horror master anywhere you go, and why not he has made such incredible contributions to the genre that heck, there's no way that he could NOT be considered amongst one of the greats. But among those great ones there's a few crappy ones and a few so-so ones. They Live is one of the so-so ones, in my opinion.The story is about a drifter named NADA (that means nothing in Spanish by the way) and the guy is looking for a job trying to make his way in life. So when he ends up in a shelter he discovers that there is actually a whole rebel force teaming up to go up against these aliens that are trying to take over our world. Here comes Roddy Piper and David Keith ready to take them on and kick their collective asses.This movie has a few things going for it and a few bad things going for it. Ill start by the good stuff. First off, the biggest attraction for me with this movie is the story. There's aliens that are trying to take over the world while disguising themselves as human beings is a great story. I love how they represent the rich and oppressive side of humanity. How the rich and powerful are trying to keep the poor poor and ignorant. Only in this movie they are aliens trying to manipulate us via the TV set and subliminal messages spread out all over the media. Great stuff. Immediately anyone who has felt the oppression and constant hammering of the media and the never ending bombardment of TV commercials will instantly identify with this story. So thats what grabbed me right away.What didn't grab me right away was the slow pacing of the film. Right from the get go when you hear the movies soundtrack which consists of a slow as hell bass line you know you are in for a slow flick. And it never really picks up, its just constantly slow. There was never an effort to liven things up, its all very ho hum. Even the action sequences had nothing special about em...and yeah, I'm talking about that fight sequence between Piper and Keith. I really didn't find it all that special.Another thing that didn't really do it for me were the stupid decisions that the characters kept on making over and over again. Walk around broad daylight with a shot gun in hand? Check. Walk into a bank with a shotgun in hand and start shooting at everybody? Check. Hows about letting the aliens know that you can see their true appearance? OK, lets do that! There's more things they do like that, but it just drove me nuts after a while. And ultimately made me hate the main characters....or feel sorry for their high level of stupidity.Then there's the aliens themselves. First off, the rebels say that the aliens are breeding us to use us as slaves? And they want to take over the world, but we never really see any of this happening, in fact the aliens seem pretty harmless to me, save for the fact that they are not from this planet, they really aren't a threat! For the longest time I kept asking myself, why are these aliens being portrayed as evil? What exactly are they doing thats so damn bad for humanity, and an answer to that question never really showed up. So suddenly I felt like the humans were really just being a bunch of racists. Shooting aliens just cause they ain't humans.The look of the aliens didn't really bother me because I think its kind of cool in a low budget sort of way. I mean lets face it, they obviously didn't have much moola if the aliens ended up looking like that. When they talk it looks so fake! You can tell its just a cheap ass mask over the actors face. Anyhows, not a big problem for me, but I'm sure a lot of people will hate it.And finally, I really gotta say that watching this flick I got the same feeling I got when I watched Jhon Carpenters Ghost of Mars and Prince of Darkness. I just really felt that Carpenter got really lazy while making this flick. You can tell certain story elements and script elements could have been developed further and better, you can tell certain scenes could have been directed better had they been planed more elaborately. I don't know the whole film just films like a rushed job, specially towards the ending.But don't get me wrong, I don't hate this movie, I like its themes and what its trying to say.

And so here I go, pulling you the reader of this review into a story of obsessive love and serious phobias.As the film opens, we see Detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart), in pursuit of a criminal with a fellow officer. As he tries to jump across a roof, he slips and falls, hanging on for dear life. The fellow officer, in an attempt to help him, falls to his death. It seems that he has acrophobia, which causes his vertigo and forces him to retire from the force, feeling guilt about the officer's death. Sometime later, while visiting with his former girlfriend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes), Scottie tells her about Galvin Elster (Tom Helmore), a former college friend that needs his help. It seems that Elster's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak)is acting a bit strange she goes into trances and disappears for hours without being able to account to her whereabouts. Scottie at first doesn't want anything to do with this. One look at Madeleine however changes his mind. From the moment he lays his eyes on her, he's hooked.While tailing her, he finds that she is obsessed with an ancestor of hers an ancestor that went mad and killed herself. Scottie manages to save her from such an attempt (She tries to drown herself in the San Francisco Bay). He starts to fall for her HARD.During an attempt to help her at the San Juan Batista Mission, Madeleine runs from Scottie and up the tower. Scottie, unable to continue up the tower because of his acrophobia, can only watch in horror as Madeleine falls to her death. The death of the woman that he had fallen in love with is more than he can bear and it drives him to a nervous breakdown.Sometime later, Scottie, still haunted by Madeleine (And visiting some of her haunts)sees Judy Barton (Novak again), who looks remarkably like Madeleine. Scottie soon becomes obsessed with turning Judy into Madeleine (Even having her sit by the fire the way Madeleine did). Scottie is so desperate to reclaim the love he had for Madeleine that he is oblivious to the deceptions that have been surrounding him He is truly falling in love with an illusion.All the parts of the film work wonderfully, from Saul Bass' opening titles to Bernard Herrmann's incredibly haunting music. But it is Stewart and Novak that bring the film it's life. When Scottie looks at Judy emerge out of the bathroom as his lost Madeleine, the green light makes her look as if she is truly a ghost, returning from the dead to once again love Scottie.If you have never seen this film, then you are missing one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films.

Even though it is not the worst film with aliens in it (that title belongs to AVP Alien Vs. Predator) it sure is close. The first thing I'm going to do is make a pros and cons list so people will get a general idea of how I perceive this filmPros The effects. Cons Everything else.First the pros. This film has the best effects of all the series but that really isn't very surprising. The first two films were beautiful in their own ways and I thought the the third film was very atmospheric as well but they were all before the era of computer graphics and as Alien Resurrection is from 1997 (ergo after Jurassic Park which was the first film to really use the potential of computer graphics) it must be fairly straightforward to assume that the effects will be better. They are. The effects are stunning and even today (2005) they are believable. The director, Jean Pierre Jeunet, has a very distinct visual style and it works beautifully. From the space shots to the design of the aliens themselves. It all works. We finally get to see the aliens walk around and seem a 100 percent believable. We also get to see them swim which is nice little addition to their range of abilities. The gore in the film is very graphic and this too works fine but aside from the effects the film is pretty awful.The acting doesn't exactly suck but its not very good either. Sigourney Weaver does her best but her new abilities and the fact that she is not the same character as in the previous films does that we don't really feel with her in the same way any longer. Her performance is passable though and I have nothing against her. I don't know what Winona Ryder is doing in this film and her talent does seem to be completely wasted. Ryder's emotional range as an actress is very high but we don't really get to see it in this movie (for obvious reasons) and that is a darn shame. She is degraded to being eye-candy. Dominique Pinon, Jeunet's favorite actor doesn't really do that much in the film and quite frankly isn't all that good even though I am impressed with his English. Most French actors have a very thick accent but Pinon doesn't. Ron Perlman who has since become quite a big star has nothing to work with in this film and thus his performance is not really worth noting. The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Some do decent jobs (for example Brad Dourif) and some do not.The story is what is really disappointing and (I feel) insultingly bad. The two first films had brilliant stories and even the third had a passable story (considering it never had an entirely finished script) but the story in the fourth one is just hauntingly bad. I won't go into the details as I might accidentally spoil the plot but needless to say it is really, really bad. Especially the ending is very anti-climactic. As for it being a horror film. Come on there isn't anything remotely scary about the film and the action is average at best.All in all a film that should be avoided almost at all costs. The only saving factor is the effects but effects don't make a movie.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 September 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I really cannot begin to express how much I hate this film.

It is fundamentally an action\/thriller about a lonely hit man who seems to be getting swindled by his boss over his money, and who unwittingly gets caught up in the troubles of his next door neighbours drug problems with the DEA, through a little girl Matilda (Natalie Portman, who he helps).As well as this, he eventually ends up with crazed DEA officer Gary Oldman on his back, as well as nearly the entire NYPD. On the surface, this film is an action shoot em up, but it is really much more. It seems to be a tale of a desperate young girl who has no where to go after her entire family are gunned down by Oldman, and who sparks up a kind of father daughter relationship with Leon. Gary Oldman is excellent in this, and plays the part with the usual intensity that he has. Natalie Portman is also great, and its probably this film that has led her onto her more recent successes in films. As for the lead Jean Reno, this was the first film I saw him in, and I can't say I've ever seen him beat this performance in any other.

I saw Carpenter's movie long before I saw Nyby's, so maybe that is why I'm biased towards the former, but let's face it, people, the original film is stagy, badly acted and horribly overrated. On the other hand, Carpenter's film is edgy, paranoid, brilliantly shot and perfectly performed. I'm not being paid to say this, my friends; like Mr Tarantino, I freakin' LOVE this movie.I suppose it helps that Carpenter actually chose to do an adaption of the source novella, Who Goes There?...Nyby's movie is really nothing like the book at all. William Campbell's often tripped-out 1938 story has been translated by Carpenter into an artifact of its' early 80s era. That is to say, plenty of gore, post-Watergate world-weary 'heroes' who react instinctively rather than earnestly, and a distinct lack of hope. One might almost call it the welcome antidote to the mawkish saccharine (another and wholly opposite facet of the early Reagan era) that was The Thing's box office opponent, ET.Carpenter in The Thing is light years from the rubbish he'd trot out after his last truly great movie, Prince Of Darkness (though In The Mouth Of Madness was a rare return to form amidst some truly lousy movies from Mr C). Here, he's the youthful, edgy, guerilla filmmaker with a touch of stoned poetry that made him the cult icon he is today. The direction is sparse but deft, showing great economy of movement and some of the best examples of 'directing lots of people in a tight space' work I have ever seen. Carpenter knows when to not direct and just let scenes play - he makes you think you are watching a tape of true events at times, just as our heroes do at one point in the story.And it's genuinely *scary*, too. Our scruffy band of Antarctic outpost scientist heroes are confronted by and trapped with a defrosted alien menace that can imitate any life form it encounters...and imitate it so perfectly that it seems that even the duplicates don't know they're duplicates. Our characters are forced into a nightmare where paranoia is actually a virtue, where you can literally trust no-one. There's one thing the creature wants, and that is to reach a populated area and begin an infection that could swamp the entire human race in just 27,000 hours....The oft-mentioned gore is pretty extreme, and there are numerous examples of sheer gross-out body horror. The most famous example has to be *that* bit with the defibrillator paddles- oh God, that bit made me jump out of my skin the first time I saw it. Leonard Maltin might claim that the 'non-stop parade of icky effects' are off-putting, but the grossness of the effects is the *whole point*, Lenny! This creature literally devours a victim, absorbs its' DNA and changes into the victim! To show this process as anything other than flat-out crunch-and-splatter would be..well, silly.Kurt Russell gives the performance of his career here as our hero, Macready; a shaggy-haired, alcoholic, sombrero-wearing chopper pilot who's the only one of our isolated protagonists who realises the truth -that survival is all that matters - in time to save himself. But that's not to say that the rest of the cast are slackers; each of the other 11-odd people in the all-male cast are top-notch. Wilford Brimley excels as the doomladen Blair, Keith David's his usual great self, and a nicely cast-against-type Donald Moffatt (remember him from Logan's Run The Series?) gets the film's best line when he's tied to a chair.And who can go past Ennio Morricone's music? It's one of his last scores, and one of his best...a moody, pulsating collection of mainly bass tones that serves the same function as Bernard Herrman's slashing strings in Psycho - to heighten the palpable sense of unavoidable doom.There is literally NOTHING wrong with this movie, folks. Not a single false step in the whole flick - even the so-called 'cop-out' ending is perfect. It is up there with Alien and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers '78 as one of the three best sci fi horror movies of all time. Forget the RKO original, because it really is not very good at all.

Young, innocent, and virginal Irena (Nastassja Kinski) can barely remember her parents or brother. She knows they were circus performers and that is about it. Having been raised in orphanages her whole life, she is finally contacted by her long lost brother Paul(Malcolm McDowell ), who is now a priest living out in New Orleans. So... she packs it up and hightails out there to go live with him. What she begins to learn is that her brother is quite an oddball, and she herself is beginning to have feelings and connections that she doesn't quite understand. Ya see, Irena and Paul are from actual feline ancestors, and they themselves turn into panthers upon heightened sexual arousal. Once they turn, they are kitty killing machines-who don't turn back to normal until after they have made a kill. AWESOME! Not only that, but they are incestuous-and they only way for them to function as humans, have a healthy sex life and pro create is to of only sleep with one another. HA HA! As Irena begins to establish a life and job for herself, her family demons began to take shape in many bizarre ways. As the truth unfolds, Irena is left with a series of perplexing dilemmas & questions1. Should she believe and join her brother? 2. Should she continue to develop a relationship with that nice man at the zoo she works at? 3. Should she give in to her daily animal instincts? 4.

Almost every single one has a Pygmalion-esquire plot line where the geeky girl (sometimes boy) is made over so they can fit in with the elite group of rich and popular kids. They've addressed all the clichés, and how unlike high school these movies really are. Think about it, to be popular means to be liked by a lot of people. And who likes the snotty brat who thinks she is prettier than everyone else? I attended several different high schools around the U.S., and these girls exist, but they don't get named prom queen.The completely nude foreign exchange student is the only part that is a little uncomfortable to stomach (oh, the old lady lesbian kiss *shudders*) But the idea behind the character is hilarious. I wish they kept the line in the movie where Janey Briggs asks why her accent kept changing.The guy who kept slow clapping at the wrong time, and Molly Ringwald saying F***ing teenagers made the entire movie.

There's very few suspense, even though Craven desperately tries to create some, and the special effects are truly weak.

James Whale's THE INVISIBLE MAN is possibly the best of the early Universal horror series of the 1930s. FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula (both English and Spanish versions) are great films too, but the threat of Jack Griffin's discovery of invisibility makes the other two seem quaint as threats.

But how does one fully protect oneself against someone who is physically strong, mentally smart, and totally determined to kill you if you cannot see him? It's not easy, especially if the goal of this monster is to rule over others. As he puts it, he wishes to have the world grovel at his feet.In the novel, Griffin's personality is shown to be so selfish from the start that one can tell that no matter what discovery he would have made he would have misused it for power. He has no redeeming features at all. However, his omnipotence is sort of curbed in one way that is not the case in the film.

But Claude Rains was made as of that moment, though it would be awhile before he actually ceased being a villain in all of his films. James Whale's THE INVISIBLE MAN is possibly the best of the early Universal horror series of the 1930s. FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula (both English and Spanish versions) are great films too, but the threat of Jack Griffin's discovery of invisibility makes the other two seem quaint as threats. One can run from Frankenstein, and one can stay indoors at night with a handy cross or garlic available. But how does one fully protect oneself against someone who is physically strong, mentally smart, and totally determined to kill you if you cannot see him? It's not easy, especially if the goal of this monster is to rule over others. As he puts it, he wishes to have the world grovel at his feet.In the novel, Griffin's personality is shown to be so selfish from the start that one can tell that no matter what discovery he would have made he would have misused it for power. He has no redeeming features at all. However, his omnipotence is sort of curbed in one way that is not the case in the film. A character is invented by Wells (who is not in the movie) that Griffin frightens into serving as a slave or servant. The character manages to run off with Griffin's chemistry lab and chemicals, as well as Griffin's notebooks. As a result he is trapped in his invisibility, and can't get out of this situation until the novel ends.The film does have some classic moments of humor (Whale liked to add black humor to his films). When a woman runs screaming down the lane at night followed by an empty pair of pants skipping along reciting here we go gathering nuts in May is one. So (more darkly) is during a massive search for Griffin, after he causes a train disaster. One of the volunteers, slightly apart from the others, is grabbed and thrown down and choked. Rains\/Griffin, in speaking, says, Here I am...AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU FOUND ME?!! It is a chilling moment.A wonderful blend of thrills and comedy, surrounding a science fiction tale of constant interest, this film never disappoints. I give it a 10 for entertainment value.

I read about the parties, the drugs, the fights, the splits and the deaths. The people were larger than life caricatures, in a time before 'celebrity' had reached the nadir it has plumbed today. The best soap opera set in Manchester... What I read were legends, the truth hidden behind the ink. Having watched it brought to life, I'm still not certain what really happened. As Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson quotes in the film 'if I have the choice between the truth and the legend, print the legend'. Here the legend has been filmed.And largely, they've played if for laughs. The real-life Tony Wilson is someone is often laughed at true, but when he speaks there's a hard edge, a confidence and edge, maybe even a whiff of intellectual brutishness, that Steve Coogan's portrayal doesn't have. The Tony Wilson in the film reminds me most of other Steve Coogan roles such as Alan Partridge. Unfortunate that the central role is lacking, as all the many other roles revolving round this centre of levity are wonderful. Most especially good are Andy Serkis as Martin Hannett and Sean Harris as Ian Curtis.This film's brilliance is in showing the life of a large, amorphous group of people brought together for the purpose of making music. There is an ill-defined boundary round the edge of Factory Record through which people slip quietly. From within, all is energy and life. Relationships fizzing off one another bringing tragedy and comedy, art and manure in equal measure. Lives lived brightly with a heart that still beats today, even though the body has been scattered to the major labels around the world. This thing really did exist, here is the testament.Help, I'm beginning to sound like Tony Wilson.There are other successes and failures. The Hacienda is resurrected to the smallest detail. The claim to show the real Manchester of the time rings hollow. This maybe their Manchester, but it isn't the real one. The in-flight narrative by Coogan as Wilson is simple, yet doesn't work. The cameos by many of the 'real' people is great if you know who they are. If you don't 'get' Factory, you'll probably not 'get' this film.As an attempt to bottle the Factory spirit, this is a roaring success and for that it gets high marks. This is not the real story, something that would make for a great documentary all of its own. One for re-living the legends rather than looking at them critically.
