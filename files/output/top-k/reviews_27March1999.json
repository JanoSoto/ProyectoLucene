Still, don't let  the  strong  violence   deter   you    from watching this movie, this film is a must-see.Instead of glamorizing on violence as usually stereotypically depicted in other movies, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN plunges the viewer into the real consequences of war.

I gave in about a third of the way through.  It's not that I can't accept implausible situations in movies; I would not have a very good time watching many of them if I couldn't.  This movie just didn't earn my willingness to do so.The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as a contract killer name Melvin Smiley, who is part of a secret society of such people run by no less than Avery Brooks of Spencer fame and more recently Deep Space Nine.  Melvin is a pathetic, gullible guy who is very, very good at killing people and very, very bad at standing up for himself.  He is being taken for a ride by two women who are constantly demanding money from him, and is engaged to one, played by Christina Applegate.  An obnoxious video store clerk is harassing him because he hasn't returned his copy of King Kong Lives for two weeks. Melvin is played with a certain strange detachment by Wahlberg, who never seems to know exactly who his character is or how he would react in the situations he is in.The opening sequence in the movie involves Melvin and his cohorts, including Lou Diamond Philips, infiltrating a high-rise apartment on a hit.  Melvin barges in, blasting away, with lots of cuts between him shooting at targets and his targets being shot.  His technique involves what appears to be breakdancing and bungie-jumping, while firing with uncanny accuracy at his foes.  As is always the case in such movies, he never misses, and his opponents never hit him.  Meanwhile his cohorts hang out in the hallway and casually drink coffee.In the meantime, we get a flat satire of suburban life, with cuts to Melvin's home (he's always pulling into the wrong driveway because all the houses look alike).  His Jewish fiance invites her parents over, apparently for the purpose of trying to portray as many Jewish stereotypes as possible in the shortest time.  Elliot Gould, an accomplished actor, appears here as the would-be father in law, a belching, moronic guy whose drinking habits leave much to be desired.  I am baffled as to why Gould took on this role; it would be difficult to come up with a more demeaning one.

Ron Howard's film is cliched from beginning to end. There is not one surprising element, and the characters are quite dull, with the exception of Ed's brother Ray (Woody Harrelson), who is at moments, quite funny. Mattew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson look like they could actually be brothers, but McConaughey's performance is just plain dull. And speak of dull; people call this a hilarious comedy. It had a couple of funny moments, but it definitely wasn't hilarious. As well, Dennis Hopper had a throw away performance as Ed's real father. Why bother getting a brilliant actor such as Hopper for a role like this?EdTv had a couple of minor elements that were somewhat good. First of all, Ron Howard captures quite well, the fascination that people have with seeing themselves on TV. Second, he repeatedly shows images on television, some in extreme close up, uncovering the individual pixels that make up an image, giving the viewer the feeling of the 'artificial'. TV is an artificial means to anyone's existence, whether you're on TV, or just watching it.The real problem with EdTv is its failure to take into account the fact that people act differently when they know they are being filmed.  The concept of EdTv is to get into the real life of an average every man by having a volunteer allow a camera crew film every aspect of their life on live TV for two months. But the truth is, people, no matter what setting they are in, respond differently to a camera than to other people. We are lead to believe that this is Ed's real life. Well, it isn't! Early on in the film, Ellen DeGeneres's character says that if you drive by an accident, you can't help, but look to see if there is that rolling head on the highway. At first I hated this line, because its so cliched in itself; I can remember having heard this line when I was eight or ten. It is however true, people do look and have that desire to look, but something such as an accident is a random and extreme event. These events are what people are interested in seeing. EdTv tries to develop a theme around people's desires to watch, but fails miserably. Psychoanalytic film theory has emphasized the importance of the 'look', or the gaze of the audience. This is reflected in its references to the audience as 'the spectator'. 'Looking' is part of an individual's self-definition and relationship to his or her environment. Freudian theory describes the position of the 'spectator' as that of a voyeur, who makes an object of those caught unwittingly in the power of his gaze. The voyeuristic look is one of the pleasures an audience finds in the cinema. One of the real pleasures of 'looking' is the power you feel in knowing that the person who is the subject of your gaze doesn't know that you are looking. EdTv doesn't even consider this as an option even though it hinted towards it at the beginning. Films such as Blue Velvet and even Sliver capture the idea that people want to see what others are doing without them knowing they are being watched.I think that EdTv would have been much more interesting if it had considered some of these possibilities. If what occurs in EdTv  were to actually ever happen, I don't think it would be much of a success. I personally couldn't care a less about some program with a guy knowingly putting on a show for us. Perhaps if you could get into his life and videotape him without his knowing it, it might be interesting. I know this is a scary idea, and most people would not want to admit this about themselves, but more people would watch if the person being filmed had no clue, because that gives us; the audience, the power.*1\/2 out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"27 March 1999","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  When I review a film, I like to try and elaborate on its good and bad points, however in the case of EdTv, there aren't many good points to speak of.

Freudian theory describes the position of the 'spectator' as that of a voyeur, who makes an object of those caught unwittingly in the power of his gaze. The voyeuristic look is one of the pleasures an audience finds in the cinema. One of the real pleasures of 'looking' is the power you feel in knowing that the person who is the subject of your gaze doesn't know that you are looking. EdTv doesn't even consider this as an option even though it hinted towards it at the beginning. Films such as Blue Velvet and even Sliver capture the idea that people want to see what others are doing without them knowing they are being watched.I think that EdTv would have been much more interesting if it had considered some of these possibilities. If what occurs in EdTv  were to actually ever happen, I don't think it would be much of a success. I personally couldn't care a less about some program with a guy knowingly putting on a show for us. Perhaps if you could get into his life and videotape him without his knowing it, it might be interesting.

Ron Howard's film is cliched from beginning to end. There is not one surprising element, and the characters are quite dull, with the exception of Ed's brother Ray (Woody Harrelson), who is at moments, quite funny. Mattew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson look like they could actually be brothers, but McConaughey's performance is just plain dull. And speak of dull; people call this a hilarious comedy. It had a couple of funny moments, but it definitely wasn't hilarious. As well, Dennis Hopper had a throw away performance as Ed's real father. Why bother getting a brilliant actor such as Hopper for a role like this?EdTv had a couple of minor elements that were somewhat good. First of all, Ron Howard captures quite well, the fascination that people have with seeing themselves on TV. Second, he repeatedly shows images on television, some in extreme close up, uncovering the individual pixels that make up an image, giving the viewer the feeling of the 'artificial'. TV is an artificial means to anyone's existence, whether you're on TV, or just watching it.The real problem with EdTv is its failure to take into account the fact that people act differently when they know they are being filmed.  The concept of EdTv is to get into the real life of an average every man by having a volunteer allow a camera crew film every aspect of their life on live TV for two months. But the truth is, people, no matter what setting they are in, respond differently to a camera than to other people. We are lead to believe that this is Ed's real life. Well, it isn't! Early on in the film, Ellen DeGeneres's character says that if you drive by an accident, you can't help, but look to see if there is that rolling head on the highway. At first I hated this line, because its so cliched in itself; I can remember having heard this line when I was eight or ten. It is however true, people do look and have that desire to look, but something such as an accident is a random and extreme event. These events are what people are interested in seeing.

To appreciate the brilliance of this picture you have to set aside your criticism for vulgar language and violence because it needs all of this to live up to what it really is. One of the greatest films of all time.Many people may dislike Quentin Tarantino because of his fascination with telling life as how it is, no matter how much we may not like hearing it. I give the man so much credit for not caring about what people may say about his style of directing. Anyway, Reservoir Dogs is the story about a loosely related group of criminals whose attempt at a diamond heist goes terribly wrong, when the cops are already at the scene of the crime before the crime even takes place, and it is most definite that one of the men in the group is the rat. Beautifully acted, the remaining men try to find out what went wrong without killing each other in the process. Tarantino knows exactly when to cut to a flashback and how to keep the viewer on the edge of his seat with costant quarrels between the crooks as they point guns in each other's faces. Mr. Blonde, the psychotic one who deforms a police officer by slicing off his ear while dancing to the 70's tune stuck in the middle with you, couldn't have been more sinister. You don't know if he's going to give his fellow accomplice a handshake, or blow his brains out.Something that I can say is bad about this film is the language. I think I heard the F word used some five hundred times (exaggeration). It is also very bloody but I think that that just makes the impact of film more powerful. I recall the scene when Mr. Blonde is torturing the rooky officer with the razor. It was probably the most horrifying seens in a movie I have ever seen. It puts you into the place of the cop and has you feel what he feels as his ear is sliced off, he is doused in gasoline, and the psychotic Mr.Blonde holds a lighter about to set you to blaze. I won't tell you what happens next but it is such a great twist in the plot.I recommend Reservoir Dogs as a must to any mafia or crime movie lover. Make sure you listen to everything that the characters say, the acting is superb and you think that you are actually in the hilarious conversations about the meaning behind the song like a virgin, and why someone shouldn't tip the waitress.

I was still in the mood for weird freaky films (I had just re-rented Videodrome and my bizarre-quota still hadn't been met). He said they just got a new film, Cube, and I might just be sufficiently freaked out.With apologies to the previous reviewer, who did a great job at displaying just how much this film causes a queasy and slick feeling in your stomach, I must give this film a very high mark. It's stylizied, it's claustrophobic, and it's downright CLAMMY.That's about the best word for it. Clammy. That kind of feeling you get when you've had a bad dream, it's 448am, you're awake and trying to regain your senses, and you notice you're soaked in a film of sweat.Plot? Simple. People wake up inside a machine. What's its purpose? Why are they here? They did nothing wrong! Grrrr. Moreover, how the heck do they get out? They don't belong here. There's no plausible reason for any of them to be here.Cop, doctor, college student, designer, idiot savant (sorry if that's not the correct definition, I saw Rain Man and 60 Minutes, that's my background), escape artist, and man at opening shot who is the perfect advertisement for Ronco's Slicer and Dicer.They all have no idea why they're in this 14 feet by 14 feet by 14 feet room, with four portals in all four compass directions, and a very uncomfortable shade of light. Each room is lit in a Clive Barker-esque unstable shade of potential pain, and each room has rails on all six sides...hand holds, if you will.Some rooms are trapped (and by trapped I mean devices that make Clive Barker's Pinhead look like Angela Lansbury in Bedknobs and Broomsticks.), some aren't. You don't know unless you are smart enough to find a way to check. Yet, even then, the room still might be trapped. Mathematics becomes a very important part of this film, as both the college student and the savant try to figure out a method to this madness.They're in a place more vast than their imagination can possibly fathom. Each room only leads to other rooms. Traps, pitfalls, etc., everywhere. One by one each character's mental focus breaks down as they realize they are trapped and cannot escape. They're doomed to a small room. And even the most distinguished leader of the group loses reality and becomes someone who makes Nicolson in The Shining look like Mr. Wizard. Nothing is as it seems...As they work their way around the maze, inspiration followed by sadistic disappointment follow. And here's where this small-budget film that none of us would even know exists works its magic. It's one of the most blunt exposes on the human soul I've ever seen. Who leads the pack to freedom, who gives up and dies, and who is in the middle....This is definitely a MUST-SEE film if you are even in the slightest way interested in Foucault, the prison system, and studies in human psychology. Yes, there are twists and turns left and right. Everytime they open a new hatch and slide through the walkway to the next room, there's tension beyond belief. But more importantly, if you step back and take another look at this Cube and the effects it creates on those inside, you get an abject view of confinement.It's queasy in some parts, and after a while you get a blase sense of apathy. Near the end I almost wanted to just give up on the slowly dwindling number of characters, and just throw my hands up in frustration.But if you look at this film as a comment on the prison system in general, you get just a glimpse into the paranoid, confined, sickening sense of claustrophobia. Every character is trapped in their own cell, left to their own devices. There might be a glittering exitway somewhere in the not to distant future, but finding the way is a trial of the Biblical Job. It's an exercise in frustration.I'll be honest, this film really upset me. It's not the fear of death that scared me, it's the fear of living in a place you still don't know how to get out of; you're just hinting at ways of escape, and you have to rely on people you don't know to help you escape.

It's intent was to show that we have to make our decisions ourself, no other human-being can. The main reason why it is misunderstood is because it excludes the 21st chapter that is in the book. This chapter tells of Alex's redemption, and his need to settle down. Alex wrong. Plain and simple, Anthony Burgess would never condone rape, for his wife was raped. But Alex realizes this at the end when he can think for himself and a treatment, as it were, was not thinking for him. In other words, if you had a disability would you want someone taking care of you constantly, always making a fuss.

It is a terrifying, artistic, brilliant experience that has never really been equalled by any other horror movie.  Definately one of the scariest, if not THE scariest, I've ever seen.  It is also the most stylish horror film I have ever seen. The perfectly symmetrical shots, are much like those of 2001, as is the very slow pacing in parts.  I've read many things about this movie where people speculated on the hidden meanings of it. Who knows what is the truth, since Kubrick is such a master it could mean anything, but it makes the film more interesting and mysterious.  I've noticed many things about this film.  For one, notice that Jack is shown very often talking while looking into a mirror - when Wendy brings him breakfast, at the bar, in the bathroom, when Danny comes into his room - and almost everyone else is shown talking with a very bright window behind them, so bright that it glares off the lens (usually considered a mistake).  The only times Jack has a window behind him are when he has the terrible nightmare, and when he is chasing Wendy with a bat, and they are especially bright.  Who knows if this means anything, but with Kubrick it is very possible, so watch for things like that in this film and his others.  Highly recommended!

The movie philosophizing about war and the effect on humanity, nature and civilization is not easy to sell. The Thin Red Line is certainly one of the most brilliant, haunting and moving movies I have seen since Roland Joffé's The Mission. It spoke for me intellectually, unlike others who have the zero tolerance for slow pace and elaborate rambling. But not without the obvious flaws -- convoluted narratives (intentionally or not), distracting cameos and disjointed editing in the final hour. I agree that some of the National Geographic Explorer shots are unnecessary, but Terry Malick makes the point that war is what decimates the stability of nature and mankind. It speaks for the essence of the metaphysics of the human mind.What angers me is the relentless comparision to Saving Private Ryan. The other manipulative and hypersentimental war movie have no place to compare to The Thin Red Line whose message have been convoluted because of people's assumption that they would see the reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The fact is, The Thin Red Line began principal photography a few months before Saving Private Ryan! The Thin Red Line does not delve to show the extremes of war such as extremely gory violence and carnage. Mr. Malick, despite the pressure, restrained from the excessive indulgence of violence unlike Steven Spielberg's hectic vision of relentless and unflinchingly inundate violence in SPR. The purpose of the movie is to show that the humans are lost souls desensitized by the atrocities of war and the perception that the soldiers on both sides are actually vulnerable humans instead of mere savage animals looking to kill (e.g., murder) more people to amuse and to advance. Stereotypically stoic characters are not in The Thin Red Line, unlike SPR. Instead some self-serving and conceited characters (such as Woody Harrelson's character) make the mistakes and regrets instead of succumbing to the final remark with a death rattle.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"27 March 1999","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This stylish, action-filled cop story is maze-like in plot and looks absolutely incredible. Not only is there an Oscar winning performance by Kim Basinger, but a discovery of 2 fine Australian actors, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce. They seem as American as apple pie on-screen, bringing to life the main protagonists of James Ellroy's novel. The hard-boiled script by director Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland brilliantly follows through with the evolution of these seemingly one dimensional characters, both on opposite sides of a police officer's moral code, who find they have a lot more in common than first glimpsed. Sure, its a recollection of film-noir, but it is without a doubt a 90's film. The 1950's are relived with great nostalgia and period set-ups, however, it is not the showcase of the film. Its plot and acting are what is so great.Kevin Spacey headlines the troupe, playing slick Detective Jack Vincennes, a consultant to Badge of Honor, a fictional TV show based on Dragnet I guess. There are many nuances to real-life people and events, not the least being Lana Turner in a hilarious scene, or Johnny Stompanato, her mob bodyguard boyfriend who was later shot to death by Turner's own daughter (not in the movie). Spacey is the cop who busted Mitchum which he takes great pride in. Crowe is such a presence as the brutish enforcer who has a soft spot for abused women for a very good reason. This is where Basinger, a Veronica Lake look-alike (and noir film fixture), is able to come across as a hooker with a mind and ambition beyond what she does. It's a good performance, maybe not Oscar-worthy, but noteworthy, nonetheless. Pearce plays the stodgy, son of a cop lieutenant, who along with Crowe, realizes there is more at stake here than a simple murder\/robbery.To get into any more plot aspects or characterizations would be ridiculous. Just view the film and see how unique and important it is. This is not your usual police squad period portrait. Most importantly is L.A. CONFIDENTIAL's ending, which consists of a shootout, something that would usually turn movie buffs away. 9 out of 10 cop dramas end this way uneffectively. Here, we see a revelation. A shootout that holds you in a trance and surprises with each blow. It is to climactic shootouts what FRENCH CONNECTION was to car chases. As far as comparison to CHINATOWN, there really is none. This is not to say they do not belong in the same league. They even have the same Musical composer, Jerry Goldsmith, who again utilizes the trumpet to resonate corruption and deception.

This correspondent remembers the film coming out in his native Limerick and all the hysterical hoo-ha in the papers. People were being carried out in fits, grown men were fainting, ladies were swooning. The implication was clear - see this film and you will become an evil, disturbed person and you'll probably go mad as well. Living in Limerick, the events portrayed in the film sounded rather common place to us, (a joke, don't write in) but be that as it may, I was too young and failed to see it. Seeing it now, one is blown away by the visual and aural invention. Large swathes of it look like an Art Film, the sound design is also smashing - a nervy collection of clicks and rustling cymbals. After a hilariously portentous narration, the title sequence consists of a series of arresting ruby images of the sun, followed by a shot of a dead aardvark, all very Wild Bunch. We then join the Scooby Doo like gang of youths in their Mystery Mobile on the way to oblivion. The acting is, of course, ropey, the quality of the stock ghastly and the dialogue often inaudible but this all adds to the creepy harshness of the atmosphere. One is, of course terribly familiar now with this scenario, but it is a relief to see an original version of the old machine, free of self-reference and irony.One's first sight of the chainsaw wielding Leatherface is a wonderfully icy moment, but also one rich with association.

What follows is still pretty damn scary, although not as grisly as we have been led to believe - it is the degradation of humanity that is really frightening. The comically absurd behaviour of the cannibal family could be straight out of the Theatre of Cruelty. In particular, the scene where they encourage their decrepit Grandfather to bash one of the victims over the head whilst they hold her over a bucket, would have done Antonin Artaud proud.Of course all this was done on a minuscule budget and it is every bit as impressive in logistic terms  as the contemporaneous work of Cassavetes, more so, because it was competing directly with other films in its genre made for ten times the amount. Of course like Romero before him, Hooper never really fitted in to Hollywood afterwards. He made one huge hit - Poltergeist - and then didn't really know what to do with himself. Since then, there's been the average Life Force and numerous misjudged failures. T.C.M. showed him in his natural milieu as a gorilla film maker.

Seven films, but only two of them--The Fortune Cookie and The Odd Couple--are genuinely funny efforts showcasing these actors' combined talents.  Grumpy Old Men was mildly amusing due less to the script than to the welcome return of Lemmon and Matthau who hadn't been on screen together in 12 years.  The unexpected box-office bonanza naturally inspired a sequel, but all this equally lucrative outing has in its favor is a brief monologue by Burgess Meredith who, as Lemmon's 95-year-old father, boasts of eating bacon and smoking Camels while the experts who warned against such vices are taking a dirt nap.  Not even Lemmon and Matthau can enliven the script by Mark Steven Johnson this time around.  The curmudgeonly Matthau admitted he didn't lke the script for the first film but did it to work with Lemmon, and that the only reason he did the sequel is because the first film was a hit.

It seems that after long years of darkness, the sight of the sun was worth the wait. Terrence Malick returns at last with nothing less than the finest contemporary war film full of power and poetic grandeur as it follows a company of American soldiers during the brutal invasion of Guadalcanal in World War II. The exhausting fight for a key-positioned airfield that allows control over a 1000-mile radius puts the men of the Army Rifle company C-for-Charlie through hell. The horrors of war forms the soldiers into a tight-knit group, their emotions develop into bonds of love and even family. The reasons for this war get further away as the world for the men gets smaller and smaller until their fighting is for mere survival and the life of the other men with them. Malick's screenplay revolves around the inner dialogue of the men of Charlie Company as they confront their own fears and try to make sense of their disparate pasts while struggling to survive amidst the carnage whirling around them in an otherwise idyllic tropical paradise. Aye, every man has his war...The film's title comes from a 19th century allusion to the British Empire's infantry (red uniforms) whose small numbers managed to 'protect' the British civilization from the countless hordes of savages which the Empire ruled. Indeed, a simple title that reflects the true meaning of war, revealing the racism that sparks all wars. Considering even that war is mere defense of a civilization from barbarians, is but a proof to the fundamental paradox of war. Truly, in defending civilization we are sending young buds to war, coloring their white souls with satanic horrors of battle. And turning them into the very savages that we are trying to prevent from destroying our civilization. The cure is now but further contamination that would infest all the body...I personally find it unbelievable to hear sort of comments degrading this masterpiece especially concerning the absence of a plot or even characters. This film does not develop characters because that is part of the message war embraces all men and crosses all socio-political boundaries - do I really have to know anything about a character to see the senselessness in his death?. All the characters just represent one human, the flames of an only fire. Indeed, they are all just parts of our human subconscious. As for the plot, it lies hidden underneath the shroud of war as it reflects the development of man amid the bushes of brutality. It's intended to show a small slice of one part of a campaign to take a hill on one island in the Pacific during a war which lasted 6 years. Depicting the war in this way is far more realistic than an action packed extravaganza of explosions and heroism ( like Saving Private Ryan ). For the average soldier the war would have been remembered in terms of vivid images of small battles, not as any particular timeline of larger events. For the price of a few too many of Bell's memories you have the sight of a lone soldier lost in a misty haze as the occasional bullet whizzes past. Or the image of Witt's return to the village to find his heaven corrupted by the cruelties of fighting. War is finally revealed as an outplay of doom rather than a conquest for hope. The disease is diagnosed, and its deadly and contagious effects are revealed. The best sequence is the companies attack on the Japanese encampment. Whilst only five minutes long it's a frenetic episode as the camera moves in all directions. Inside huts, over corpses, alongside running troops. Its pace means we never actually see anybody killed clearly so there is no sense of loss. Until it stops and the defeated Japanese are paraded in front of us. There is no feeling of victory or pride ; shame is the only survivor. Indeed, what does war hold but shame or the loss of pride. Conqueror or Conquered, both are defeated by the concept of war...Terrence Malick brilliantly interweaves tragic images of nature's inexorable brutality with almost spiritual views of the jungle sunshade, leaving the viewer simultaneously stunned by nature's beauty and aghast at its violence. By comparing war with natural beauty the film highlights the ridiculous extent man has gone to by ending life and destroying such beauty. This contrast reflects the fierce and brutal identity of war, destroying the Eden of yesterday. At the same time, the ebb and flow of the poetic narrative gives character to the universal themes and forces one to introspect and to contemplate the very nature of existence. The philosophical undercurrents of the film are made apparent through such vivid symbolism as the alligator, the bird, the snake, and the seed, all of which touch upon topics ranging from the inborn evil in nature to the nature of the soul, war, and God. The crocodile entering the green algae covered water symbolizes nature's savagery, the tree being choked by parasitic vines reflects Lt. Col. Tall own words 'nature is cruel', the bird being born as a soldier dies sheds light on the cycle of life for we come from the earth and return to it, the coconut sprouting a palm on the empty beach in the last scene is a proof that after death comes birth, and that amid the waters of despair man lives on a mere speck of hope, his own palm tree...Words fail to unmask the true beauty that surpasses the matter, reaching the ephemeral nirvana. I can but wonder what enchantment another twenty years wait holds? Maybe a supplementary bouquet of divine philosophy and an escape from the dungeons of the run-of-the-mill cliched Hollywood action-movies.

It seems that after long years of darkness, the sight of the sun was worth the wait. Terrence Malick returns at last with nothing less than the finest contemporary war film full of power and poetic grandeur as it follows a company of American soldiers during the brutal invasion of Guadalcanal in World War II. The exhausting fight for a key-positioned airfield that allows control over a 1000-mile radius puts the men of the Army Rifle company C-for-Charlie through hell. The horrors of war forms the soldiers into a tight-knit group, their emotions develop into bonds of love and even family. The reasons for this war get further away as the world for the men gets smaller and smaller until their fighting is for mere survival and the life of the other men with them. Malick's screenplay revolves around the inner dialogue of the men of Charlie Company as they confront their own fears and try to make sense of their disparate pasts while struggling to survive amidst the carnage whirling around them in an otherwise idyllic tropical paradise. Aye, every man has his war...The film's title comes from a 19th century allusion to the British Empire's infantry (red uniforms) whose small numbers managed to 'protect' the British civilization from the countless hordes of savages which the Empire ruled. Indeed, a simple title that reflects the true meaning of war, revealing the racism that sparks all wars. Considering even that war is mere defense of a civilization from barbarians, is but a proof to the fundamental paradox of war. Truly, in defending civilization we are sending young buds to war, coloring their white souls with satanic horrors of battle.
