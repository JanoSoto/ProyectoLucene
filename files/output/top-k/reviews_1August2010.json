First of all she was still alive and at an all time popular height and second of all, she in my opinion is not a that big star, when compared to all other people who get a biopic made about them. But I must say that after seeing this movie i have a whole lot more respect for her by now and I was definitely wrong about her career and life not being worthy or interesting enough for making a movie about it.The movie was a positive surprise. But nevertheless there still is plenty wrong with it as a biopic. It suffers from lots of the stuff other genre movies often suffer from. Thing with biopics often is that you try to capture a persons entire life and career into a 2 hour long movie. This means some stuff will often get rushed and shoved down your throat. You often just have to take things for granted, without them ever getting developed properly and convincing enough, like would be the case in a normal film drama about a normal average, every day person. And yes, this happens quite a lot in this movie. It often makes some very sudden jumps with its story and make jumps in time as well. We just never get to see how popular Tina Tuner is with the public and some things seem to happen very randomly in this movie, just because they happened in her real life as well. It at times feels like some stuff really got crow-bared into the film. They movie because of that also feels quite distant at times as a biopic, since you don't ever get the feeling you are really getting into the character.But having said all that, the movie still works out great. The story is always intriguing and keeps you interest throughout. It's also really fast-going, which makes this a bit of a distant one when it comes down to its emotions and characters but at the same time keeps this movie consistently good to watch, since you never get bored with things.It's also true that it are the actors performance that keep the movie going and make this a great watch. Angela Bassett really shines and she deserved her Oscar nomination. Same goes for Laurence Fishburne as the abusive Ike Turner, who is perhaps the foremost reason why this movie remains such a good and interesting watch. His character, no matter how awful he is, is still what gives the story as well as the Tina Turner some real depth. Because lets face it, would Tina Turner's life had been interesting enough for a biopic if she had never met Ike? I really don't think so.But of course the movie does not only focus on her personal life but also her career. It's quite fascination to see how she started out and at several points at her career had to start all over again but every time came back stronger, as a performer and person as well. It's why I now have so much more respect for her after seeing this movie. I now kind of wished I would had gone to her concert when she was in town here a decade ago. Besides, I really don't think you have to be a fan of her music in order to enjoy and appreciate her incredible stage presence and performance. Same sort of goes for this movie. You really don't have to be that much in Tina Turner in order to really like and appreciate this movie.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" There is plenty wrong with this movie as a biopic, however when you look at it as purely being a movie, it is a surprisingly great one.I never really considered Tina Turner to be such a good subject for a biopic, especially not in the '90's.

I saw the promotional image of a wooden Pinocchio looking at a real version of himself like a reflection in the water, and later saw a trailer for this adaptation of Carlo Collodi's story on TV. Even though I was very familiar with the classic 1940 Disney version, I never actually saw this movie when it was new, not that I was missing much. Well over a decade later, I finally saw it just last night. By this point, I knew it wasn't a very popular film, so my expectations weren't very high, and it's a good thing they weren't, since I found The Adventures of Pinocchio to be below average! Pinocchio is a wooden puppet carved by a woodcutter and puppet maker named Geppetto. Soon after he finishes making this puppet figure of a boy, it magically comes to life! Even though Pinocchio is still wooden, he can now move and talk, but doesn't know much about the world around him. He wants to be a real boy, but has a lot to learn before that can happen. While walking out with Geppetto, he meets some schoolchildren and wants to go to school himself. He also catches the attention of two criminals named Felinet and Volpe, and is soon wanted by the evil Lorenzini! At school, Pinocchio punches a classmate and lies to the teacher about it, causing his nose to grow longer with each lie, and after he finally confesses, he is kicked out of class. He then goes to a bakery, where he causes chaos, and for this, he and Geppetto are both taken to court! They will both be sent to prison unless Gepetto can pay for the damages, which he can't, so Lorenzini offers to pay, but only if Pinocchio is given to him. Eventually, Geppetto reluctantly gives in and Lorenzini gets the puppet, but it turns out Pinocchio is not safe with him! The living wooden puppet finds himself on an adventure full of danger, with a wise cricket named Pepe often appearing to give him advice! This film adaptation begins with a poor opening narration from David Doyle, which turns out to be the voice of Pepe the Cricket. This character is supposed to be funny, but he fails. The same goes for the rest of the film's humour in general, in scenes such as the havoc Pinocchio wreaks in the bakery. It's not funny when it tries to be. Also, it seems Felinet and Volpe are supposed to be funny, but they also fail miserably, unlike Honest John and Gideon in the 1940 version. Some of the characters in this 1996 version may get a little annoying at times, including the title one, and I think this is when they're trying to be funny. The poor humour isn't the only problem here. The Adventures of Pinocchio seems rushed, going too fast and seeming to just throw in characters without taking enough time to introduce them, making them seem very insignificant. Geppetto certainly doesn't seem very surprised when he sees Pinocchio alive for the first time. The lack of focus even makes the story seem almost meaningless, even though it does include the morals of the story, but in a very ineffective manner! The film fails both at trying to be funny AND trying to be touching, except maybe near the end. I also didn't care for the design of the wooden Pinocchio's face and his facial expressions.I have never read the 19th century book, The Adventures of Pinocchio, by Carlo Collodi, but have been familiar with the animated 1940 Disney flick from a very early age, so it's obviously hard for me not to compare these two films. I can't forget the times I saw the 1940 version as a kid, and I still thought that film was great when I watched it again a couple times in 2007, my first viewings of the classic piece of Disney animation since my childhood in the 90's. It has excitement, poignancy, and some good humour, and all this is more than I can say about the 1996 version. This movie does have some nice visuals, but that's the only positive thing I can think of to say about it, and that's certainly not enough to make it worthwhile. Some movies can improve with a second viewing, but I can't imagine how I could ever warm up to this mess of a live action adaptation of Collodi's story, so I don't intend to watch it again. If the screenplay had been better written, it could have made a really good family movie, but due to its poor quality and lack of focus, the film's results were disappointing.

The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love.The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them.What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it.

Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it.

The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer.The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person.The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme.

I really like how they try to make Edward a part of society at 1st, and try to make him feel like a human being, it was really heart-warming and fun to watch. After all these years, this remains one of Johnny Depp's best performances, and most certainly one of his mot definitive roles. Tim Burton's directing style suits him perfectly here. It's effectively dark and brooding, while having the neighborhood in the day-time smartly looking peaceful and classy. The characters are well-developed for the most part, but the main reasons this work so well is Johnny Depp and the unique romance surrounding it, I especially loved the old mansion Edward stayed at.Performances. Johnny Depp isn't even at his peak here talent wise, and he still musters up an incredible performance. He looks unique, acts unique and his character was unique. It was a tough role to play off, but Depp did it wonderfully and made Edward very sympathetic. Winona Ryder is pretty good for the most part. She's hypnotizing on the eyes, and her chemistry with Depp was excellent. Dianne Wiest is great in her role, as the caring yet ninny-nanny person. Anthony Michael Hall served his purpose well, and played a perfectly unsympathetic prick. Kathy Baker did great in her role, she stole quite a few scenes. Alan Arkin is a riot as the dry, yet hilarious Father. Vincent Price looks old and ill, but was pure class when on-screen.Bottom line.

At the time I was most impressed with the action sequences and with the futuristic setting of the story. Since then I have seen it a few times, but for the first time I watched it today with a different perspective. Here's a bit about the plot and then I'll tell you what I mean.The story follows on from the 1979 film Mad Max, also directed by George Miller. I won't go through the events that happened there, but I will tell you that former cop, Max, is now wandering the wastelands, a lawless desert. Here, after a run-in with some scavengers, he comes across The Gyro Captain, the pilot of a gyro-copter. He tells Max of a compound in the middle of the desert where the people there are pumping oil and refining it. With fuel being the most valuable commodity in the wastelands, Max is very interested in this place. They go there to find it under siege by the same scavengers that Max had a run-in with earlier. They are led by a character known as The Humungus. Max makes his way into the compound where he discovers they have a tanker but no truck to drive it. He has seen one out on the road and makes a deal for as much fuel he can carry, if he can retrieve it. I won't say any more, I think that's enough to whet your appetite.Although it does look a little dated, this is still a very well made film. It's not perfect by any means, but the stunt work, the acting and the humour all stand up today. It is not heavy on dialogue, but I could not fault any of the performances, so honourable mentions go to; Mel Gibson as Mad Max Rockatansky, Bruce Spence as The Gyro Captain, Michael Preston as Pappagallo, Max Phipps as The Toadie, Vernon Wells as Wez, Kjell Nilsson as The Humungus and Emil Minty as The Feral Kid.I talked about perspective at the beginning and I think I should explain what I mean. Since I have been putting my thoughts online, for just over a year now, I have found that I watch films with a more critical eye. What I mean is I pay more attention to how they make me feel, to how they are made and to whether I find them entertaining.So, I found Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior to have a lot more humour in it than I remember, although some of the stunts didn't quite work and you can see where the action has been sped up to cover for this. Having said that, the story is great and it is told in a very clever way with just the right balance of humour and drama in and amongst the action.

There is a scene where Derek organizes a raid on a foreign owned grocery store. He organizes people to go into this store and raid it, tearing up the inside in the process and confronting the owners. In the beginning of the film Derek kills, black gang members after they are caught breaking into his family's car. He shots at them, then makes a man put his teeth on the curb, and kicks the back of his head. Derek is then arrested. Daniel follows Derek's footsteps and joins the white supremacist. While Derek is in jail, Dr. Sweeny (Avery Brooks) visits him and Avery convinces him that racism is pointless. Derek realizes that the only reason he stayed alive in prison was a black person that he became close friends with. Time in prison was life changing for Derek and he was determined to change the family's lives when he got out. Derek and Daniel were committed to a better lifestyle without racism when Derek drops Daniel off a school Daniel goes into the bathroom and is confronted by a black boy from the previous day.

Both of these movies start out harsh in relevance to racism and by the end, all people are getting along. The lighting and color choice were very appropriate for this film. The film went from color to black and white, which was appropriate for the scenes they were showing. For example, the scene where Derek shots the gang members is black and white and I think it added feeling and dramatization to the scene. The color scenes were not overly bright which sets the mood for the film and how Derek's family is unhappy and racist. The lighting was not very bright and was dull throughout the movie. Both the lighting and color choice set the mood and tone of the entire movie. The motif in this film was the swastika as it was portrayed throughout the film. It was tattooed on Derek's chest, it was on posters in Derek and Daniel's room and it was seen many times throughout the movie. This shows or proves that the movie is about racism and white supremacists. This symbol was a fit for the theme of the movie and it was evident when they were taking there posters down that they were going to attempt a better life and a life without racism in it. This was an excellent movie and I enjoyed it however, I feel that it was very violent and should not be viewed by everyone. Not every individual can handle this film because of the graphic nature and the extent of the violence and the language. I think that everything was needed to get the theme across but once again; I would not recommend this movie to everyone especially if you are easily offended.

It's true; it didn't let you (or me) down. And #2 it started both the brand name of Jurassic Park in addition to the return of the big blockbuster. (Ironically, as it started off as a new brand name, it was marketed the same way the movie, itself, was preaching against. Much like Natural Born Killers taught us not to concentrate on violence. Good job!)There are just too many comparisons that can be made about Jurassic Park and Jaws, aside from the obvious both were directed by Steven Spielberg. Both are huge summer blockbusters that bring back the heart to connect with multiple audiences. Both are When Animal Attack stories. Both had the predictable outcome due to its family nature despite the gore. Both begin with a seemingly insignificant scene of death and foreshadowing. Both had source materials that were, in fact, deeper, more graphic, more adult and radically different endings. And both had one central leader who thought better of doing the right thing, valuing money over saving lives.Not that I'm knocking the movie. It was, as stated, one helluva roller coaster. I have yet to visit the actual ride at Universal Studios, but from what I've seen by someone who taped the whole experience on YouTube, I doubt even the real experience is half of what this movie drags you, joyfully, that is, through.John Hammond's rich and loves to make flea circuses small and large.

I've tone down a lot that happens, but really it's a paper-thin plot with more emphasis on the adventure over depth. Not that that's a bad thing here.

I was amazed back then, but damn, it holds up STILL (for the most part) 17 years later. Many have tried to reproduce, but haven't even come close to how real the dinos look and due to that, the suspense was heavier on whether or not our heroes will survive. If someone were to watch this for the first time today, they might even overlook the fantastic overlapping of the dinos and man, but think about it in 1993 like The Matrix, this changed cinema indefinitely.That all said, I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature, though it's close.

It was an excellent concept executed beautifully. The problem is that the idea behind it, when someone is desperate enough for a follow-up, can lead to... *this*. Yes, Krueger is terrorizing a new group of teens. By... scaring them. They go to sleep, he appears, and he doesn't kill them. No, that's what is apparently happening leading up to the beginning of this film. And he doesn't need to worry, because there are plenty of people who want to ensure that the kids, all placed in a hospital ward, sleep. Enter Nancy, who thankfully helps keep this from getting any more we don't know what we're dealing with(even though every member of the audience does) than it, well, does. Oh, and these guys have abilities in their dreams. No, you read that right. And if you ignore(as the makers of this did) that horror is best when the villain and the victims are *not* equal, the skills are stupid and exceedingly lame. How anyone thought this would be good is beyond me. Honestly, if it's straight fantasy\/adventure, maybe, but don't bring supernatural stuff into it controlled by the protagonists when we're meant to be terrified. Unlike the first one, this doesn't evoke the feeling of being in a nightmare. It tries, on occasion, and awkwardness ensues. Freddy(who is now vocal, taunting, using cool one-liners) doesn't chase as much, and when he does, it's less effective. Like the second, it's bizarre at times when it attempts to be creepy. It manages to be eerie at times, and the FX tend to be well-done(especially the clay-mation), if the creative gags are few and far between. Actually, this seems to strain itself trying to produce them, with there being absurdly specific stuff based on who the toasted antagonist is going after. The characters are mostly obnoxious or dull; I didn't really care about any of them, they weren't developed enough. Fishburn delivers a solid performance, but he's just about the only one. The acting is decent for the rest, if no one is necessarily shockingly poor. This was Arquette's movie debut, and it shows. It's directed by Chuck Russell, of The Mask, Eraser and The Scorpion King. That list ought to tell you that he can do well at effect-laden flicks... as well as, you know, *not* well. Yeah, this is another case of the latter. Well, in his defense, in the three cases, the script is to blame. This provides backstory, and that part is OK. The climax is unexciting, and this has the weakest ending of these three. There is a moderate amount of bloody, gory violence and disturbing content, as well as a little nudity and strong language in this.

Oh, and these guys have abilities in their dreams. No, you read that right.

Honestly, if it's straight fantasy\/adventure, maybe, but don't bring supernatural stuff into it controlled by the protagonists when we're meant to be terrified.

Freddy(who is now vocal, taunting, using cool one-liners) doesn't chase as much, and when he does, it's less effective. Like the second, it's bizarre at times when it attempts to be creepy.

We see a lot of comedic scenes like those found in Hollywood movies but Kusturica knows how to balance comedy,drama,magic realism, and all the other things that make this movie so great. The movie starts off a bit goofy but transitions into a very serious movie about the changes that occur to a young kid because of a manipulative and lying man.The movie in summary is about a kid named Perhan who is taken to Milan to get rich by Ahmed. This money is suppose to build a house and treat his sister's leg at a hospital she was left at by Ahmed. Perhan also saves up money so he may be allowed to marry Azra, his girlfriend before he left the village, by proving he has potential and wealth. He finds out that Azra is pregnant but is unaware who is the father. Perhan believes it's his uncles kid but Azra insists its Perhan's kid. These events add to Perhan disillusionment. He had been lied to by Ahmed and neither his house or sister's health were being funded by the money earned by Perhan. Perhan didn't believe the kid was his but proceeded to marry her.Azra has the kid in a magical scene but dies giving birth. He finds out his sister and son were taken by Ahmed so she can work for him. Perhan goes 4 years looking for her, he finally finds her and his kid as well. He puts them on a train back home, goes and kills Ahmed and his brothers but is unfortunately killed by Ahmed's new wife.Not only was the plot one of the most important factors that kept me entertain but Kusturica's ability to sneak in elements of magic realism and his implication of suspension of disbelief were pulled off amazingly. I went throughout the whole movie without questioning anything out of the ordinary. A turkey that was trained and behaved like Perhan's turkey seems completely normal to me. Seeing him move a can and spoon was surprisingly normal too. Transitions from real life to a dream were subtle that in some scenes it was difficult to differentiate real life from a dream. The scenes that dealt with magic realism weren't over the top. In a book magic realism can be written so a reader can visualize it and interpret the scene in their head differently from other readers so this causes the reader to make the scene believable to themselves only. In a movie it is different, the director visualizes the scene for us and its up to us to decide if its believable or not and Kusturica did a great job. The scenes looked like they can happen at any time of day.The movie will change mood,tone as it plays. As I mentioned earlier, the movie starts with some laughs but changes into a serious drama about the struggles of minorities in that area. The actions depicted by Ahmed occurs in that area and in many poor areas throughout the world even today. Kids are forced to pretend they have disabilities just to stand on a street asking for money. Girls are turned into prostitutes and kids are beaten if they refuse to work. It is a very serious issue that plagues many similar areas and Time of the Gypsies does a good job of displaying it seriously on film.Characters are also easy to like but can also be easily hated. Perhan started as lovable character who I could relate to but the more corrupt and powerful he got through his wealth, the more I disliked him. I hated him when he kept planning to sell his kid before he was born. As quickly as I started to dislike him and I started to like him more when he saw his wrongs and tried to make everything right. I was on the edge of my seat as he tried to jump into the train and was disappointed and saddened when he was killed. Other characters were also the same; the uncle,Azra,Perhan's kid and even Ahmed. They all did things in the movie that can change one's opinion of them.This movie is a now a personal favorite and I have been recommending it to multiple people. Unfortunately, according to my professor at SMC the movie is difficult to find but definitely worthy of being watched when found.
