When one of the cattle happens to be smarter then the rest of the herd and decides to quit playing dumb --Nolte's character-- then that animal is turned away from the herd and is no longer allowed to play anymore reindeer games (if I may mix metaphors).

It's not Love Story. It uses whatever tools it needs to elicit an emotional response. If stock characters, noble sacrifices, sentimentality and ludicrous plot twists are what it takes to get that response then so be it. I went in to this movie with low expectations. There were maybe twelve other people there, which tended to confirm my misgivings. As soon as it started I was swept up in it. I read a comment somewhere recently that said film is not a literary medium. I tend to agree. As literature Armegeddon fails miserably. A crappy paperback that you put down near the middle. I think movies somehow touch us more than that. Something about sharing the immediacy of the screen with other people makes it work on us on another, visceral level. Good lines too, better than I would have thought Go wake up 11,000 (1,100?) people. A reference to the contingency plan to save congress during the event of a nuclear war. The part where Steve Buscemi rides the bomb like Slim Pickens in Doctor Strangelove. This is also a good movie to watch Bruce Willis play Bruce Willis playing Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi doing Steve Buscemi, and the fat guy from the Frasier submarine movie playing fat guy from Bruce Willis asteroid movie.

Along the way she falls in love with a fellow student, Avigdor, who is engaged to be married. Due to a family secret he is prevented from doing so by the bride's father. In a desperate bid to keep him from leaving, Yentl, now known as Anshel, marries her instead.The story has been modified for the film in that the role of Yentl is somewhat older and her internal dialogue is fleshed out in the form of songs. A sort of musical narrative solely from her perspective.The opening song Where Is It Written, the soulful Papa, Can You Hear Me?, The Way He Makes Me Feel and the closing A Piece of Sky are some of the stand-out performances. This is Streisand's first directing effort and she was the first woman to win a Golden Globe for it. She pulls solid performances from everyone and tells her story with a fresh sense of style rarely seen in film today. There are moments when Streisand lingers a bit long to make sure you feel what she is trying to convey. Her subsequent directorial efforts, the 1991 The Prince of Tides and the 1996 The Mirror Has Two Faces are more fluid.  Avigdor's concern over his affection for Anshel is not adequately explored, but the girl marries girl theme is approached with great humor and tact.For music fans, check out the  Yentl Medley from the 1994 Barbra - The Concert and the soundtrack album, which contains studio versions of The Way He Makes Me Feel and 'No Matter What Happens.

It combines half-truths, educated guesses and made-up characters to create a universe where no one really knows who the bad guys are.  Having said that, this is one of my favorite movies.  The characters are rich (even if they are just characters), and the logic is laid out in a way that Sherlock Holmes couldn't have improved upon. True, Kevin Costner doesn't show the most emotion (or even talent) in this film, but that's appropriate, because we are supposed to concentrate on all the other wackos that make up for Costner's blandness.  Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, and the entire supporting cast are terrific. While it is true that Oliver Stone may not have it exactly right, he proves pretty convincingly that there was some kind of conspiracy.  And the underlying message is one of revolution; if our governmental leaders are corrupt, he says, then we -- America -- have to take the power out of their hands.  Also, he lobbies for the release of the JFK assassination files, which is probably a good idea. This is a great political thriller.

The only other film of its genre that has the same effect is Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boot.If the viewers draw moral conclusions strictly from the material Spielberg provides, many if not most will conclude that making war should NEVER be an option. Of course, Spielberg scrupulously avoids any explanation for the presence and actions of Captain Miller's men other than rescuing this one man. This is in contrast to Schindler's List, which is a continuous justification for using whatever force is necessary to liberate the innocent and punish the guilty. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Schindler's List liberates the innocent without any evidence of men like Captain Miller, his squad, or the millions of other GIs that made it possible.How could Spielberg, if he wanted to, have combined the two, giving the viewer a sense of the reaction of those occupied by the Nazis to the Allied landings, yet not completely switch the film out of context?Consider the film Playing for Time. This TV film, released approximately ten years ago, achieved extreme notoriety even before its release by virtue of its central casting of Vanessa Redgrave. Redgrave's extreme political left wing views are regrettably, considering her occupation, tainted with a devotion to the cause of Palestinian statehood. She played a Jewish woman in a Nazi labor camp. The film recounts the real world assembly of musically talented female inmates, who form a small orchestra and perform for the camp Nazis. As long as they played, they gained time. The continuous horror of life in a labor camp is interrupted very briefly when, just before the start of a concert, a male technician arranges something on stage in front of Ms. Redgrave, and opens his palm to her sight. On the skin is written Allies landing in France. He closes his palm and goes on with his work. Redgrave gives the slightest of all smiles, but one which the viewer understands is a shout of joy. It will be over. Survival is possible.This is not a scene Spielberg considered necessary in Schindler's List.Chester Wilmot's The Struggle For Europe describes an event he witnessed during the liberation of Brussels. He writes In one square the British tanks were halted by the Belgian civilian throng and the Brussels police attempted to move the crowd back, but they could not restrain one little old woman who wore on her drab black dress her husband's medals from another war. She made a quick dart across to the nearest jeep, took the hand of the driver, kissed it, and said, 'Je vous remercie, Tommie. Je vous remercie.' And into his hand she pressed what was obviously all that she had -- three cigarettes.This is not a scene Spielberg considered necessary in Saving Private Ryan.I am extremely fortunate to have a father who was a Normandy to Berlin GI, and a mother who was a Belgian native, lived under the Nazi occupation, and could very well have been in that Brussels crowd that day.
