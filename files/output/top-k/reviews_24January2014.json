She tracks him down to propose stealing a valuable mask.This has a very weak cat and mouse game between CZJ and Conner. It's more innuendo and sexual gamesmanship than actual compelling story. None of it is worthwhile. The two leads would work better as a grandfather granddaughter team, and has as much sexual chemistry as that. It's an excuse for CZJ to roll around in skin tight clothing and get caught naked. As for the capers and exotic locations, they are a bit of fun distraction. It's kind of sad to see Sean Connery in this.
