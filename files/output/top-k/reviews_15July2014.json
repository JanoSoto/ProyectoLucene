Vin Diesel has the luxury of this phenomena. Most of time, when actors become known for doing the same roles, they become forgotten and non-existent. So in order to break free of that, the actor takes on new and different roles to either round out their skills or grab their fans attention. Jim Carrey was like this early on in his career. Originally, he was the funnyman with hits like Dumb & Dumber (1994), Ace Venture Pet Detective (1994) and The Mask (1994). But then he went on to do The Truman Show (1998) which was a totally different step for him. Again, Vin Diesel hasn't had any problems sticking to what he's good at. This franchise and The Fast and the Furious (2001) series continue to cement him in Hollywood fame without having to take on completely different roles. He has tried but they never took off.Here, Vin Diesel plays his second best known character to that of Dominic Toretto - Richard B. Riddick, a convicted killer who's got nothing to lose. While being transported, the ship ends up crash landing on a foreign planet with flying Dracula hammerhead shark like creatures. The catch is that they only come out at night. And the crew that is stranded is just in luck because a full eclipse is on its way. Ahh,...gotta love how convenient these situations happen. But for writing, convenience is the only problem. The rest is a well-written script that develops its main cast to the point of where they must come to grips with certain events that possibly audiences may not see coming. I know I wasn't, the actions of certain individuals continued to keep me guessing. This is important because that means it can keep the attention of its audience with ease. Plus, with the element of the unknown and high tension continuously keeps viewers on their toes.Diesel as Riddick is convincing enough. He has snarky dialog and definitely has a presence that's hard to find boring. In charge of the rest of the crew is Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) and although at times she's not sure of herself, she does become strong over time. Then there's her second in command William Johns (Cole Hauser) who has a grudge to settle with Riddick. His interactions with Diesel are comical at times because of how much they resent each other. Adding to the story is Abu 'Imam' al-Walid played by Keith David who adds a bit of a religious agenda into the mix. For him at least, he too as a character is tested, not only by the creatures but also by his peers. It is these kinds of moments that are critical in defining characters and not making them feel all the same.The special effects for 2000 are good at points. The alien creatures don't look recycled but visually, they do look fake at times when it came to CGI. There are physical props but most of it is CGI, which makes it less frightening. The action and gore are commendable. Vin Diesel has the chops for such requirements. The cinematography by David Eggby looks great. For the planets terrain, it looked and felt very dry. I do question the color scheme at times. It would swap between yellow and blue. Both looked great but just one should've been picked. Graeme Revell's score to the film is interesting. It incorporates tribal drums to match Diesel's prologue of animal instincts but other than that, it feels light. No theme or tune was memorable. Come on Revell, you're better than this. Altogether still a very satisfying franchise entry.The writing contains highly developed characters that will keep its audience guessing until the very end, along with its unique creatures. The only parts that feel weak are some of the visuals and Graeme Revell's musical score.

I loved this film along with other thrillers of its time.The movie is about a woman who moves into a new apartment block. She starts to get a few people saying that she looks a lot like the woman who killed herself that used to live in her apartment. When she starts to make some new friends in the area, she discovers that there is more to this coincidence than she first thought.This is a typical Sharon Stone film of the 90s. It is full of sex and suspense. The story is quite good, and the mystery element to it is actually not that bad. There are times when I watched the film and thought I knew who the villain was, but as time goes on your mind changes about 5 times. When you watch the movie, you realise it could only be one of two people&#x85; but you really are not sure who it is until right at the end.I enjoyed the movie, but to be honest it was not as good as I remember it being. This happens a lot when you return to an old film that you have not seen in many years. It is a shame, but your opinion changes on movies, and with the rapid changes in the effects that Hollywood has made, it is not surprising that you all of a sudden think that the films are not as good. But I still enjoyed it. I thought it was entertaining and I had forgotten who the bad guy was anyway, so the film was still a surprise for me.The movie stars Sharon Stone, William Baldwin and Tom Berenger. Sharon does a great job. She had a very good career in the 90s but just seems to have dipped off of the radar. I believe she is making straight to TV movies now&#x85; it is a shame because she is a talented actress and she deserves to be on the big screen. In my opinion, the last great film I saw her in was Diabolique. William Baldwin did a good job at playing a creepy, slimy guy. He was just weird throughout the whole film. I know he was supposed to play the good looking but suspicions type, but he just came across as creepy. Tom Berenger should have had a bigger role really. He was good in the bits he was in, but to be honest he had a relatively small role.The drama and suspense in this film is the thing that carried it through. I wanted to know who did it&#x85; The ending was OK, but I thought they could have had a bigger ending. It just kind of felt it just ended. There was more that could have happened.I did like this movie, but it is not Sharons best.I will give this film 7 out of 10.You like to watch?

Pierce Brosnan is still as charming and as charismatic in his second appearance as he was in his debut but the film offers little that we haven't seen before.However, the concept of the villain being a media mogul is a strong one. Elliot Carver &#x96; played well by Jonathan Pryce though the performance isn't up to his usual standard &#x96; is essentially Robert Maxwell or Rupert Murdoch as a Bond villain. It's not terribly subtle, it has to be said, especially with the cover-up for Carver's death being that he drowned after falling off his yacht being the exact manner in which Maxwell was killed. He makes for an interesting villain in that seeks to control the world not through weapons or ideology but through newspapers, television, radio, etc. and the historical parallel with William Randolph Hearst occurred to me before Carver mentioned him. However, the character is perhaps a bit too over the top and the fact that he has giant posters of himself everywhere was a far too obvious sign of megalomania, though at least they proved relevant to the plot during the escape from his Saigon building. Michelle Yeoh's character Colonel Wai Lin is one of the few aspects of the film which I felt lived up to the new era of modernity introduced in GoldenEye. Wai Lin is a great character played wonderfully by a gifted and underrated actress. She is extremely capable and resourceful, providing an absolutely invaluable ally for Bond in his fight against Carver. Far from a shrinking violet, she is certainly well able to take care of herself in a fight, defeating her male opponents with relative ease and no small amount of style. Her scenes are more physical than those of any of her predecessors and she does most of her own stunts. Yeoh is also very good in the romantic scenes with Brosnan. It's a shame that the planned spin-off film series about Wai Lin never materialised. Teri Hatcher, who will always be Lois Lane to me, is very good as Carver's ill-treated and ill-fated wife Paris Carver, one of Bond's many old flames. Brosnan has been lucky with all of his Bond girls when it comes to chemistry and Hatcher is no exception. Although initially cold and distant due to the circumstances of their last meeting, Paris once again succumbs to Bond's charms and agrees to betray her husband at the cost of her life. Hatcher plays the role very well but the character is basically just Domino Derval, Andrea Anders and Lupe Lamora all over again. The most interesting thing about her scenes with Bond is the revelation that he left because they were growing too close, which hearkens back to the far more extensive exploration of Bond's psyche in GoldenEye.Afforded more screen time in her second appearance, Judi Dench is effortlessly brilliant as M who, in spite of the fact that she made her views on Bond's cavorting very clear in the previous film, sends him to reignite Paris' passions in Hamburg. Samantha Bond is once again extremely good as Miss Moneypenny, even if her liberated woman of the 1990s vibe from GoldenEye is less apparent. In his 16th and penultimate appearance as Q, Desmond Llewelyn plays the role with the same skill that he has displayed since From Russia with Love and I liked the fact that he appeared to be far more exasperated with Bond than in the previous film as it was more nostalgic. Cast against type, Dench's As Time Goes By co-star Geoffrey Palmer is excellent as the unsympathetic, pig-headed, short-sighted and not terribly bright Admiral Roebuck, whose thinly veiled contempt for M earns him the audience's ire and makes him appear more and more foolish as the film progresses. In his third and final Bond film, Joe Don Baker is once again extremely good as Jack Wade, who I would have liked to have seen more of. The towering Götz Otto is suitably intimidating as Stamper but far still less so than Jaws or Necros. Although he does occasionally act, magician Ricky Jay makes for a rather odd casting choice as Henry Gupta and fails to make much of an impression. I'd also have preferred it if the usually very entertaining Vincent Schiavelli hadn't played Dr. Kaufman with a cod German accent. Colin Salmon makes a good impression as Charles Robinson in his rather brief appearances in the film.The locations, sets, action sequences (the best being the motorbike scene), gadgets and music are all up to their usual standard but the nuclear war storyline is rather uninspired, seeming like a rehash of earlier and better Bond films with the only major difference being that the United States and the Soviet Union have been replaced by the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China. With the threat of nuclear war on the horizon, the main participants don't seem terribly important in the grand scene of things. Overall, this is a good, rather enjoyable and well made Bond film but a somewhat underwhelming one. I suspect that I'd have enjoyed it a great deal more if it was the first Bond film that I watched rather than the 18th and not that's even including the unofficial ones.

However, the character is perhaps a bit too over the top and the fact that he has giant posters of himself everywhere was a far too obvious sign of megalomania, though at least they proved relevant to the plot during the escape from his Saigon building. Michelle Yeoh's character Colonel Wai Lin is one of the few aspects of the film which I felt lived up to the new era of modernity introduced in GoldenEye. Wai Lin is a great character played wonderfully by a gifted and underrated actress. She is extremely capable and resourceful, providing an absolutely invaluable ally for Bond in his fight against Carver. Far from a shrinking violet, she is certainly well able to take care of herself in a fight, defeating her male opponents with relative ease and no small amount of style. Her scenes are more physical than those of any of her predecessors and she does most of her own stunts. Yeoh is also very good in the romantic scenes with Brosnan. It's a shame that the planned spin-off film series about Wai Lin never materialised. Teri Hatcher, who will always be Lois Lane to me, is very good as Carver's ill-treated and ill-fated wife Paris Carver, one of Bond's many old flames. Brosnan has been lucky with all of his Bond girls when it comes to chemistry and Hatcher is no exception. Although initially cold and distant due to the circumstances of their last meeting, Paris once again succumbs to Bond's charms and agrees to betray her husband at the cost of her life. Hatcher plays the role very well but the character is basically just Domino Derval, Andrea Anders and Lupe Lamora all over again. The most interesting thing about her scenes with Bond is the revelation that he left because they were growing too close, which hearkens back to the far more extensive exploration of Bond's psyche in GoldenEye.Afforded more screen time in her second appearance, Judi Dench is effortlessly brilliant as M who, in spite of the fact that she made her views on Bond's cavorting very clear in the previous film, sends him to reignite Paris' passions in Hamburg. Samantha Bond is once again extremely good as Miss Moneypenny, even if her liberated woman of the 1990s vibe from GoldenEye is less apparent. In his 16th and penultimate appearance as Q, Desmond Llewelyn plays the role with the same skill that he has displayed since From Russia with Love and I liked the fact that he appeared to be far more exasperated with Bond than in the previous film as it was more nostalgic. Cast against type, Dench's As Time Goes By co-star Geoffrey Palmer is excellent as the unsympathetic, pig-headed, short-sighted and not terribly bright Admiral Roebuck, whose thinly veiled contempt for M earns him the audience's ire and makes him appear more and more foolish as the film progresses. In his third and final Bond film, Joe Don Baker is once again extremely good as Jack Wade, who I would have liked to have seen more of. The towering Götz Otto is suitably intimidating as Stamper but far still less so than Jaws or Necros. Although he does occasionally act, magician Ricky Jay makes for a rather odd casting choice as Henry Gupta and fails to make much of an impression. I'd also have preferred it if the usually very entertaining Vincent Schiavelli hadn't played Dr. Kaufman with a cod German accent. Colin Salmon makes a good impression as Charles Robinson in his rather brief appearances in the film.The locations, sets, action sequences (the best being the motorbike scene), gadgets and music are all up to their usual standard but the nuclear war storyline is rather uninspired, seeming like a rehash of earlier and better Bond films with the only major difference being that the United States and the Soviet Union have been replaced by the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China. With the threat of nuclear war on the horizon, the main participants don't seem terribly important in the grand scene of things. Overall, this is a good, rather enjoyable and well made Bond film but a somewhat underwhelming one. I suspect that I'd have enjoyed it a great deal more if it was the first Bond film that I watched rather than the 18th and not that's even including the unofficial ones.

Well there's no way on earth that happened, you'd have to be a constant fool to say that THIS ONE, EPISODE II, is BETTER THAN EPISODE I. Clearly there are more idiotic moments, let-downs, miss-moments, bad directions, mistakes, and so on, in this one. It's 10 years after the trade federation (the events of Menace), and a young Anakin Skywalker then, is a grown-up Anakin Skywalker now. He's now an apprentice to kind-hearted Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Count Dooku, a then-Jedi- master turned Sith is the film's main antagonist. The film also features bounty hunter Jango Fett - father of Boba Fett, who's much younger in the film. Of course, it's typically revolving around the clone army. At one point, there is a massive battlefield battle in which the Jedi's of the Jedi Council take on Clones, and up above standing is the evil Dooku, Jango, Poggle the Lesser, and a few more, including Nute Gunray. Jango quickly tries to take out Jedi Master, Mace Windu, but fails and gets his head ultimately detached from his body as a result of where Master Windu slashed him. There are many, many great moments in the film, definitely, but there are also many terrible moments. Moments like Anakin lashing out his hate for everyone whom he killed; eg. Tusken Raiders - that was incredibly annoying and somewhat hard to believe, because Christensen's acting, in that scene, wasn't very believable, i mean it was good, but not good enough. I also disliked the battle between Dooku and Yoda, in which frankly nothing happened, apart from a few moments before that in which he strongly defeats both Obi-Wan and Anakin. The whole Kamino scene was, and to this day is, disappointing - more time on Kamino would've been better, and the whole Ob-Wan and Jango segment, or duel, was quite fast- paced and wasn't as good as it could have been. In all honesty, more of Jango would have been great, just like in Menace, more or Maul would have been great.The focus on Padme and Anakin in certain scenes was effectively irritating and was a bit stupid. One minute she doesn't even want to kiss him or be close to him or anything, and then not long after they're getting married. I mean, maybe if something more was to happen, without it being as annoying, then maybe I could be on-board and it'd be more believable.

Nikki's actions and words beg the questions, Just how hollow and vacuous can one person be? How pretentious? How much self-awareness and identity can one person lack? The screen writing is the most drab and lacking-in-quality that I have ever experienced. I managed to watch Crazy\/Beautiful until they drove up to Carlos' house and the mother came out. Then, I was done. 90 minutes of a reminder of what the worst night of your life was like, when you were smashed out of your mind on booze. Then again, you had a personality. No one in Crazy\/Beautiful does.Absolutely disgraceful, especially considering the potential of the base story.

Not because I don't like it, not because I can't recognise it as beautiful or brilliant, not out of some sort of inverted snobbery. It's simply that it takes much work for me, like a very alien language. I don't have the time or energy for another language in my life, so I leave well alone. As proof that this is the case, not dislike or ignorance or whatever else people have opined to me as the reason, I offer consistently one of my favourite films. Amadeus was released in 1984, the year of my eleventh birthday. I can't recall when I first saw the film - I suspect about 3 years later on its television premiere - but it made a huge impact on me. In the year of forty-first birthday that impact hasn't diminished. It's directed by Milos Forman (most famous for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and adapted by the great Peter Shaffer from his own stage play. It tells the story of Mozart's professional life through the lens of court composer Antonio Salieri, a man tormented by his own relative mediocrity. It opens with an elderly Salieri in some kind institution for the mentally ill, claiming he killed Mozart and unburdening himself to a priest. Through that relationship, with the priest claiming to offer God's forgiveness, Salieri confesses his awe, jealousy and manipulation of the young genius, ultimately playing a key role in driving him to an early, overworked death. It's majestic, moving and utterly beautiful. It's a study of guilt - who doesn't reach Salieri's age without secrets they need absolution from? It's a study in the corrosive powers of success - the film's Mozart is perhaps most akin to a modern day elite sportsman, feted with praise and money he doesn't have the maturity to handle. It's a study in marriage under pressure - Constanze, Mozart's wife, is brilliantly played by Elizabeth Berridge; devoted to her husband, but one partner always just out of reach of the other. Most of all, it's a study in creativity and what we who benefit from the creativity want the creators to be like. Mozart should be as sublimely beautiful, dignified and upright as his creations. Instead, as this film and Tom Hulce's performance renders him, he's an obnoxious brat with an annoying laugh, no discipline and no self-control. It's that laugh that divides viewers; it's that laugh that Salieri hears even before he first lays eyes on the man he discovers to be Mozart. How can this man create such beauty? Thereby hangs the crux of the film, and Salirei's existential torment. It drives deals he strikes with himself and with God; it defies belief and offends the ears as much the music entrances them. It reaches its height in a spellbinding, unforgettable scene where Salieiri helps a bed-ridden Mozart work on his Requiem (a piece commissioned by a shadowy figure Mozart doesn't realise to be Salieri himself). Mozart hears the music in his head and dictates it to Salieri, who even then can barely keep up. Even with his nemesis at death's door, he can't hope to match him.Based in truth as it is (though how true it actually is, I don't know), the film achieves a kind of truth much more true than mere facts, uncovering the deeper realities of limited humanity's quest for transcendence. That's why, for instance, the American accents the actors keep throughout the film don't bother me one jot. The film is so true that the accents are frankly irrelevant; I'm not distracted by them, which I most certainly would have been by bad European accent imitations. It's a film which teaches me about beauty, hope, work, creativity and the freedom to take all my prayers - not just the safe, nice ones - to God and leave theme there.

The enemies are all around us. They're smashing down our doors. They're coming through the bathroom window. They're all swarthy and have no taste in clothes. They wear black masks and have weird hair cuts like cartoons out of a 1945 Dick Tracy comic strip. We live on the Upper East Side of New York and they live in Newark. They hate us for our freedom. They're out to get us all right.The unlucky among us come equipped with our own panic rooms, surrounded in steel and concrete, where they can't get at us, but then, since the rooms are in our heads, they may hurt us more than they help us.Jody Foster and her young daughter, Kristin Stewart, have just moved into a jumbo brownstone in the right part of Manhattan. It has a panic room. On their first night in their new mansion, three ugly thugs break in, in pursuit of a $20 million fortune stashed away in a secret safe in that same panic room. When Foster and Stewart become aware of the intruders, they dash into the panic room, unaware that the thieves are determined to break in and grab that stash.I won't bother to describe the rest of the plot. The set-up does the job. You can practically figure out the rest without any help. This piece of dumbed-down paranoia was written by David Koepp, who really knows how to do these things -- Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Spider Man, Zathura A Space Adventure. This is hack work with a vengeance.No possible cliché is missing. You must have seen a thriller in which the helpless heroine, with the madman in hot pursuit, runs to the elevator, clicks and re-clicks the close button, and the door slides closed just as the villain runs up against and begins pounding on it from outside. Three times here -- one elevator and two sliding steel doors.And as you probably know, one of the captives of the thugs, or even the heroine herself, must have some sort of medical condition that needs medical treatment if she's not to go into shock and perhaps die. A blinking neon sign might as well appear on the screen URGENT. Often it's asthma, as in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. On crippled airplanes, the kid needs a kidney transplant, quickly. Here it's diabetes. The writer and director gave us a touch of claustrophobia in Jody Foster at the beginning but decided to go with Kristin Stewart's diabetes instead. It was a good decision. Claustrophobia can only take the disability so far then it wears itself out, whereas diabetes can change its character from threat to impact over a much longer period, drawing out what little suspense is left in this hoary device.Of the three thugs, Forest Whitaker can act -- and does. Jared Ledo, in cornrows cannot and doesn't. He sounds exactly like a Hollywood actor. Dwight Yoakum as the taciturn, cold-blooded type who kills a partner in a fit of pique, doesn't have much to say, which is just as well. Paul Schulze, as a savvy city cop, gets the best lines and looks right.I didn't like the three thugs, but then I didn't like Foster or Stewart much either. (I thought Stewart was an effeminate boy until the last few minutes.) They're rich and I'm not, and that's why I disliked them. I want to live in a three-story brownstone on the upper East Side too.

They're smashing down our doors. They're coming through the bathroom window. They're all swarthy and have no taste in clothes. They wear black masks and have weird hair cuts like cartoons out of a 1945 Dick Tracy comic strip. We live on the Upper East Side of New York and they live in Newark. They hate us for our freedom. They're out to get us all right.The unlucky among us come equipped with our own panic rooms, surrounded in steel and concrete, where they can't get at us, but then, since the rooms are in our heads, they may hurt us more than they help us.Jody Foster and her young daughter, Kristin Stewart, have just moved into a jumbo brownstone in the right part of Manhattan. It has a panic room. On their first night in their new mansion, three ugly thugs break in, in pursuit of a $20 million fortune stashed away in a secret safe in that same panic room. When Foster and Stewart become aware of the intruders, they dash into the panic room, unaware that the thieves are determined to break in and grab that stash.I won't bother to describe the rest of the plot. The set-up does the job. You can practically figure out the rest without any help. This piece of dumbed-down paranoia was written by David Koepp, who really knows how to do these things -- Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Spider Man, Zathura A Space Adventure. This is hack work with a vengeance.No possible cliché is missing. You must have seen a thriller in which the helpless heroine, with the madman in hot pursuit, runs to the elevator, clicks and re-clicks the close button, and the door slides closed just as the villain runs up against and begins pounding on it from outside. Three times here -- one elevator and two sliding steel doors.And as you probably know, one of the captives of the thugs, or even the heroine herself, must have some sort of medical condition that needs medical treatment if she's not to go into shock and perhaps die. A blinking neon sign might as well appear on the screen URGENT. Often it's asthma, as in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. On crippled airplanes, the kid needs a kidney transplant, quickly. Here it's diabetes. The writer and director gave us a touch of claustrophobia in Jody Foster at the beginning but decided to go with Kristin Stewart's diabetes instead. It was a good decision. Claustrophobia can only take the disability so far then it wears itself out, whereas diabetes can change its character from threat to impact over a much longer period, drawing out what little suspense is left in this hoary device.Of the three thugs, Forest Whitaker can act -- and does. Jared Ledo, in cornrows cannot and doesn't. He sounds exactly like a Hollywood actor. Dwight Yoakum as the taciturn, cold-blooded type who kills a partner in a fit of pique, doesn't have much to say, which is just as well. Paul Schulze, as a savvy city cop, gets the best lines and looks right.I didn't like the three thugs, but then I didn't like Foster or Stewart much either. (I thought Stewart was an effeminate boy until the last few minutes.) They're rich and I'm not, and that's why I disliked them. I want to live in a three-story brownstone on the upper East Side too.

When we see Geraldine Page, suffering, we know why things are as they are. The girls have tried to make their lives go and have run into the depth of despair. At times it seems so maudlin and I can muster no sympathy for their pathetic beings. Throw in the flamboyant Jean Stapleton who adds color to this dirge and by contrast everyone is lost. E. G. Marshall is to be complimented for getting out of this black hole. Still, there is some growth. This sort of set the stage for future serious movies, but it is drained of charm, as Allen would use these themes later in better movies. I personally believe had this not been made by Wood Allen, it would have been treated with much less respect by the critics as pretty ordinary and overly artsy.

Marshall is to be complimented for getting out of this black hole. Still, there is some growth. This sort of set the stage for future serious movies, but it is drained of charm, as Allen would use these themes later in better movies. I personally believe had this not been made by Wood Allen, it would have been treated with much less respect by the critics as pretty ordinary and overly artsy.
