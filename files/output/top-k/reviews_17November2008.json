[{"date":"17 November 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Often in our lives we are faced with decisions what to wear to work, how to ask that cute co-worker out, what to wear on the date, or what movie to go see. But some decisions carry more weight than others. Election deals with the morals and ethics we try struggle with in our everyday lives in a way that causes us to truly reflect on our own decisions present and past. Alexander Payne has created a film that through great character development and the unraveling of a universally adult message becomes something that is both humorous and smart. Ultimately, it makes us understand what it takes to reach (or crush) a dream. What's the difference between morals and ethics? We are first introduced to Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick) as the teacher of his US History class as he is asking them this question. He struggles with the answer himself all the way through the final scene in the movie where he throws a slurpee at Tracy Flick's limousine in rage and bitter disgust. When we see Tracy Flick's (Reese Witherspoon) hand shoot up in the air in the classroom and hold it high as if she knows that no one can answer this question better than she can, we know we are in for a clashing of titans that can only end in disaster. Tracy is running for president, and is the kind of girl that is so over zealous and over motivated that it tends to make those around her who aren't, either hate her, or feel bad about themselves. We see both. Mr. McAllister has a loving wife and a modest job, but through a series of flashbacks where we see him teaching the same thing every single year, we begin to think that he is lying when he tells us he loves his job. He drives a small hatchback that looks like it probably ran him about a thousand dollars and came off the line in the early 70s. Immediately, he enlists Paul Metzler, (Chris Klein) the injured star quarterback to run against Tracy. He can't bear to see her get what she believes is her 'destiny' just because no one is opposing her. This underhanded partnership will bring to foresight Mr. McAllister's shadowed misogyny and deep unhappiness he has for his life. He along with others in the film will be forced to a moral and ethical crossroads of which the implications for the decision will undoubtedly be big. Tracy's other nemesis to world domination is Tammy Metzler (Jessica Campbell), Paul's sister, who is just running because her previous bi-curious girlfriend is just dating Paul to get back at her. She takes a stance during their auditorium speech that fuels the fire of moral decisions to the brink of ruin. She tells the whole assemble that she doesn't even care about the election, and that nobody should vote. This brings to light the true importance of school-run extra-curricular activates, and in foresight, even our modern day government. Who really has control and who are we supposed to think has control? What kind of social order are our schools teaching our students, and then how does this play out as we become adults? We see Tracy with a Nebraska senator near the end of the film, which really ties this line from a dysfunctional fake school organization to real life. Something that we, as CNN-watching Americans become unaware of too quickly. Because of this hotbed of events, each character is set out to confront a moral dilemma. This is set up at the beginning, because we hear about Dave Novotny, (Mark Harelik) a teacher who flew too close to the sun on wings of an underage student (Tracy) and ultimately lost his job and family. Tammy must decide between allowing Tracy to win and ultimately causing her brother to lose, or creating her own happiness by taking credit for Tracy's sabotage of Paul and getting herself expelled. Paul, the overly nice, innocent jock must decide between voting for himself, which will win him the election but he believes it is 'wrong'; or voting for Tracy, which will lose him the election but he believes it is right. Tracy must choose between stepping on everyone around her to accomplish her dreams, or risk being number two. And Mr. McAllister must risk losing his job and family for something that 'feels' right to him, or do what he knows is right and continue with his mundane existence. All very difficult decisions for our not-so-simpleton Nebraska high school. Payne puts a magnifying glass and a jury to the decisions we make everyday and the people they effect. Election will make you laugh and cringe, because it is so dark and goes so deep into the insides of what our own lives may very well be like, and ultimately how that translates into how we live and what decisions we are constantly confronted with in life. You will see moments of yourself in one of the broad spectrum of characters, and ultimately contemplate your own drive and what lines you set or cross to get where you are going.

Solondz divides the film into two sections fiction and non-fiction. Selma Blair stars in the fiction section which turns storytelling on its ear when a creative writing student borrows from real life experience to tell a story, only to have her peers criticize her for its pretentiousness and unbelievability. The story opens with Blair being manipulated by her college lover who has has cerebral palsy. When his story is ripped by the class as well as the professor, He breaks up with Blair. Blair, whose own story was trashed off camera, is determined to succeed in the class, so she goes home with her instructor and subjects herself to a degrading sexual escapade in order to write something honest fiction. While doing so, she discovers the class intellectual has been involved in kinky sex with the instructor as well. The non-fiction portion of the film stars Paul Giamatti as a loser, would-be documentary filmmaker who attempts to portray a suburban family with a troubled high school senior, played by Mark Webber. The portrait turns into an exercise in self-indulgence for everyone involved, including the Giamatti character. Giamatti of course is acting as Solondz' alter ego. He vacillates between making a meaningful documentary and accepting changes along the way as it suits the would-be success of the film. Initially, the film attempts to get at what makes the teenager click, but we discover there isn't much to explain it. He's just another typical teen slacker. We also discover the ignorance and bankrupt values of average America. Some of the dinner table conversations are sure to remind some viewers the banality and stupidity of their own experiences with family and friends.As in the fiction section, Solondz seems to be saying that storytelling, whether fiction or non-fiction, is entirely subjective and the success of any story told often relies upon luck and\/or factors out of one's control. In fiction, the author's attempt to fictionalize a true story went awry, possibly due to the limited, politically correct mind-set of her peers. In non-fiction, the documentary's focus was modified as other events occurred throughout filming the teenager being an inappropriate focus, his family's lack of character, his brother's accident, etc. Mike Schank from American Movie fame has a cameo even, underlying the notion that luck plays a part in any storyteller's success, just as it did with the film American Movie. The audience must be willing to accept the storyteller's premise. In American Movie, the audience accepted the premise of a loser filmmaker with no talent thinking he could produce a film. In this film, audiences failed to accept the premises in the fiction and in the non-fiction sections.Both sections of the film indicate the role of the audience as one of the chief determinants of the storyteller's success. The creative writing class reacted negatively to Selma Blair's true story. The class intellectual was revealed to be a sell out herself for yielding to the instructor sexually. What price are storytellers willing to pay to succeed? The test audience trashes Giamatti's documentary and finds it unexpectedly funny, contributing to a series of cataclysmic events. The film is funny at times but less entertaining at other times. It is not as successful at illustrating the storyteller's dilemma in creating as it is at illustrating the mind-numbing ignorance of today's youth and the lack of character and direction in their lives. **1\/2 of 4 stars.

I saw episodes of the original Muppet Show when I was little, and later saw The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper (didn't see The Muppets Take Manhattan until last year), as well as some post-Jim Henson material; The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island, and the remake of The Muppet Show, Muppets Tonight. None of these disappointed me. By the time Muppets from Space came out, I was seeing the first signs of adolescence, and didn't end up seeing the movie that year, though I do recall seeing the trailer for it on TV. Nine years later, having finally seen this movie, I am not impressed! Lately, Gonzo has been feeling lonely in the world, being a whatever, not knowing where he came from, and has been having nightmares about it. One morning, however, he sees messages in his breakfast cereal, ones which appear to be from aliens from another planet! While Gonzo is on the rooftop, watching the sky (following one of the messages), he is struck by lightning! He then meets two cosmic fish, and learns from them that he is an extraterrestrial! The other Muppets think he has gone crazy when he tells them about this, but he still attempts to contact his relatives. Meanwhile, government agent K. Edgar Singer is searching for extraterrestrial life on Earth, and has detected the messages Gonzo has been seeing! After Gonzo appears on TV, Singer manages to lure him, along with Rizzo, into captivity, and the other Muppets must try and rescue them and see if Gonzo can finally meet his family! I knew Muppets from Space wasn't the most popular Muppet movie, and it didn't surprise me when I found that one problem with this movie is that while I did smile\/snicker sometimes, it's not usually that funny. In fact, it's sometimes quite lame, such as the female armed guard played by Kathy Griffin in love with Animal. However, that's not its only problem. Another major problem is that it's a tad too dark for the Muppets! It's often too cruel, especially when Gonzo and Rizzo are in captivity, with the conditions they face there. That building is a rather dreary place, not the kind one would probably want to see the Muppets in. Those scenes, as well as a number of others, including a hoof to the groin, make me wonder why this movie is rated G! Also, the story is a bit bland, and there are no memorable songs. Basically, the magic that made previous Muppet material so good seems so far away in this flick! I was disappointed by this movie, even with low expectations. There are those who think everything that has been done with the Muppets since Jim Henson's premature death in 1990 is lame, and I'm definitely going to have to disagree with them. However, I'm going to have to agree with those who think this particular movie defiles the Muppets, and I've never been able to describe anything else I've seen featuring the Muppets that way before! When I see the Muppets, I expect good, lighthearted family entertainment, with plenty for kids and adults alike. It seems that some people describe this movie that way, but I honestly don't get it, and sincerely doubt I ever will! That's certainly not what I got with Muppets from Space! What happened?! Yes, this movie is rated G, which one would probably expect from a Muppet movie, but unlike the previous ones, I really don't think it should be!

However, I'm going to have to agree with those who think this particular movie defiles the Muppets, and I've never been able to describe anything else I've seen featuring the Muppets that way before! When I see the Muppets, I expect good, lighthearted family entertainment, with plenty for kids and adults alike. It seems that some people describe this movie that way, but I honestly don't get it, and sincerely doubt I ever will! That's certainly not what I got with Muppets from Space! What happened?! Yes, this movie is rated G, which one would probably expect from a Muppet movie, but unlike the previous ones, I really don't think it should be! The point I'm trying to make with this review is that this is NOT the Muppets! ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"17 November 2008","score":"","review":" The '40's are known for their strong family-drama's, often based on a best selling novel. All that this movies have in common is that they are filled with melodrama, dozens of characters and are basically in their themes and essence more or less the same. Yet they always manage to make a powerful and effective impression, no matter how many times you have all seen it before.This is a real family-drama alright! It has as a nice change that the movie for once isn't set in an upper-class family but a hardworking and struggling family in a little mining place, set in Wales, around 1900. But yet all of the problems remain the same. There is love, hate, struggles between the classes and death. The universal themes are all handled well within this movie, making How Green Was My Valley just as powerful as any other genre example from around the same time period.The movie is filled with many characters (not in the least due to the fact that the family consists out of many children), each of course with their own problems and views on the world. It makes the movie really melodramatic and you can actually wonder if it all wasn't a bit too much to handle in a just over 2 hour long movie. Lots of drama is happening in this movie, often involving some of the different characters of the movie and at times it is hard to keep track of things.This unfortunately often is the case with movies based on a novel. There is no way that you can ever put everything that is in a novel into the movie. You have to make some cuts but often a danger with those cuts is that the story will loose its power, since some things will be left out that are perhaps relevant for a certain following situation or the development of a character. Because of this as much as possible elements from the novel are being kept in the movie, with as a result that the movie often feels overfull, overlong and way too melodramatic. This also goes for How Green Was My Valley, that is filled with characters, dragging in some parts and over-dramatic in others.Nevertheless How Green Was My Valley remains a great genre movie, thanks to its craftsmanship. Even though I probably prefer John Ford's less serious movies, I can also appreciate his heavy drama's. It's a well told movie, despite all of the earlier mentioned problems with these type of movies.But of course you also shouldn't forget the acting. It's a movie that is made foremost by it's characters and the actors that are portraying them. Even though the movie doesn't feature the biggest stars of its time, it's a cast that is filled with some real capable actors who suits their roles all very well. Yes Walter Pidgeon and Donald Crisp are some well known actors but they were mostly actors who were normally playing secondary characters. Same also goes for Maureen O'Hara, who perhaps also wasn't that well known during this movie, which was only the 8th she ever did, even though she had already played the role of Esmeralda in the 1939 version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.To show how popular this genre was at the time; it won 5 Oscar's in 1942, including the one for best picture and best director, which means that it beat Orson Welles and Citizen Kane at that time. It really doesn't mean that this movie is a better one than Citizen Kane but its merely a reflection of how people looked upon movies in the early '40's.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"17 November 2008","score":"","review":" The '40's are known for their strong family-drama's, often based on a best selling novel.
