[{"date":"20 December 2011","score":"","review":" Agent J needs help so he is sent to find Agent K and restore his memory.If you have read my review of the original, I did love it. It was a parody of parodies, with fast-moving humor and memorable scenes, cast, and characters. With a sequel, I admittedly had some sort of expectation. The sequel, for one, is directed by the same director of the first. By this, we can expect some of the same and of course how he wanted the sequel to be. Secondly, we have the same cast. Obviously, we can have the same formula with the humor and laughs just as the original. As I sat down to watch, I kept asking myself WHY did they chose to do this? WHY is this happening? And lastly, WHY did the director chose the battle the original? The only answer could be he lost it. The humor is kind of the same of the original mildly vulgar, mildly presented. The problem with the sequel is that it tries to hard to make us feel like the first did. Of course, we have the same flaws as the first, but seems like the director wanted to double the amount and make ourselves *ASK* ourselves why? The acting was a little dumbed down, and surprisingly Tommy Lee Jones did a horrible job. Will Smith presented a better performance than him but maybe it was a bad day. Everything else is sort of like a throwback to the original, but sadly it's projected way worse. We have a few funny cameos, but none of them redeem the bad things. We have a few funny jokes, but most of them are forced. We have some cool scenes, but mostly they are all dumbed down. So let me put it this way if you took the original, sort of took all the bad scenes, then sliced this one in half, and filled the sliced half with the bad scenes, you have Men in Black II. I didn't hate, but I didn't like it. I don't recommend, and the film deserves the 5 rating. Instead of watching this, take all the bad things out of the first, then re-watch that. It'll be a much better experience. 5\/10.

He was an original, and how fortunate he evolved beyond a supporting actor to a full-fledged movie star. Some actors ACT funny. Mattau WAS funny.And it is watching Matthau that makes this film enjoyable. It's a mildly clever spy plot, with Matthau playing the fed-up CIA agent that decides to write a tell-all book and then disappear. Along the way he reignites what was an apparently long-standing love affair with Glenda Jackson. Although Jackson definitely plays second-fiddle here to Matthau, I was reminded how much I once enjoyed that fine British actress. Sam Waterston, Ned Beatty, and Herbert Lom each do their part in supporting roles. And the film comes together nicely...not totally unpredictably...but it's pleasing.Perhaps not one for the DVD shelf, but one to savor...at least once.

He's hated by his boss, Beatty, who humiliates him and assigns him to a desk job, to be replaced by the younger Waterston, who admires Matthau. Well, actually, everyone except Beatty admires Matthau, even his opposite number, Herbert Lom, in the Soviet intelligence apparat.In retaliation, Matthau cheerfully erases his identity and sets about writing a book that exposes all of the most secret operations of the CIA and the Soviets. Beatty is scandalized, and he and Waterston and Lom pursue Matthau and Jackson, his girl friend, all over Europe and the Southern United States. Matthau, being an exceptionally knowledgeable operative, remains one step ahead of them.He tricks everyone into believing he's been killed. The book is published and becomes a best seller. And Matthau, in a ludicrous disguise, insists on patronizing book stores and hearing his work praised.It's treated lightly, with trippingly elegant Mozart pieces used as the score. Matthau's spy is a big fan of Mozart. The scheme begins in Salzburg. Coincidentally, Bizet's Carmen provided the score for Matthau's later film, The Bad News Bears. Twenty years earlier his character had hummed pieces of Carmen in One, Two, Three. Twenty-three years before, he skipped down a hallway whistling a tune from Mozart's 41st symphony in A Face In The Crowd. Should we be worried? He does well as the CIA agent, always his usual, slouching, unpretentious self. Glenda Jackson is strictly secondary, which is just as well. Her popularity always eluded me. She's so domineering and icy. Maybe if you're into bondage or something -- But Waterston is fine as the friend reluctantly drawn into the pursuit, which turns from comic to serious over time, with the threat of termination hanging in the air. In fact, as comedy, this is only moderately successful. There is some drollery in the script but little in the situations themselves. One of the reasons I saw it through to the end is that, with a few changes, this could easily have been a dramatic thriller with Matthau dying. The ridiculous turned into the tragic.Matthau gets to do a side-splitting imitation of Eleanor Roosevelt. Some nice location shooting, a few impressive aerial shots, and nice reactions from a balked and frustrated Ned Beatty tearing his hair out as his house is mistakenly shot to pieces.
