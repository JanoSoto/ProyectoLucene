Maybe a better one will be released sometime in the future, but so far, Jurassic Park is unparalleled. The story involves the re-creation of actual living dinosaurs from their own DNA which was recovered from dinosaur blood remaining inside a prehistoric mosquito which, millions of years ago, was unlucky enough to get caught in the soon solidified sap of a tree. Even all of the scientific elements of the story are explained in a way that even the youngest viewers could understand. Jurassic Park, However, is not just about making dinosaurs and then getting eaten by them, it is about what happens when humans play with life and try to re-make and contain it in ways that were never meant to be. Dinosaurs once ruled the earth, but the earth is now ruled by humans, and the two species, separated by millions of years of evolution, cannot coexist. Neither can contain the other, one is sure to overcome.The spectacular visuals and amazingly convincing special effects and make-up provide an absolutely incredible cinematic experience. Never have dinosaurs been so convincingly made on screen. The fact that the dinosaurs were so real allowed for the film to really keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Particularly memorable moments include a velociraptor jumping up and almost out of the screen as it tries to get Alexis (Adriana Murphy) as she climbs up into the ceiling to escape, and also a scene with a Tyranosaurus in the rear-view mirror of the fleeing humans' Jeep(imitated hilariously in the great Toy Story 2). However, even though the special effects have the rare combination of being both overpowering and amazingly convincing, Jurassic Park had a good number of important messages to deliver. There were a lot of things that could be learned from this film, and many of them were put right into the dialogue, mostly that of Dr. Ian Malcolm, played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum. Michael Crichton needs to be recognized for his brilliant creation of such a man as Ian Malcolm, talking understandably about chaos theory and scientific responsibility and the extremely important fact that life finds a way. Sam Neill also delivers one of the highlight performances of his career as the wonderfully convincing Dr. Alan Grant, alongside Laura Dern as Ellie Satler, and both of them, along with the rest of the cast, were perfectly faithful to the original novel. That, in my opinion, is an extremely important element of films that were adapted from books, and Jurassic Park is rivaled in its literary faith only by other great films like The Green Mile.Jurassic Park is not a film about a dinosaur amusement park. That is the premise, but the message of the film has a lot to say about the vulnerability of the human race, and it is a testament to the skills of Steven Spielberg and the other filmmakers involved that they were able to make a movie with such an important thing like that to say (among others), while at the same time making the whole experience so much fun.

Maybe a better one will be released sometime in the future, but so far, Jurassic Park is unparalleled. The story involves the re-creation of actual living dinosaurs from their own DNA which was recovered from dinosaur blood remaining inside a prehistoric mosquito which, millions of years ago, was unlucky enough to get caught in the soon solidified sap of a tree. Even all of the scientific elements of the story are explained in a way that even the youngest viewers could understand. Jurassic Park, However, is not just about making dinosaurs and then getting eaten by them, it is about what happens when humans play with life and try to re-make and contain it in ways that were never meant to be. Dinosaurs once ruled the earth, but the earth is now ruled by humans, and the two species, separated by millions of years of evolution, cannot coexist. Neither can contain the other, one is sure to overcome.The spectacular visuals and amazingly convincing special effects and make-up provide an absolutely incredible cinematic experience.

When he and that poor kid John Artis were pulled over and the officer said that they were looking for two negroes in a white car, no actor could have been better than Denzel when he said, Any two will do? What a perfect piece of casting, and Denzel Washington was startlingly convincing as the legendary Rubin Carter throughout the entire film. Every actor performed amazingly, even Liev Schrieber, who makes a smart turn after all of his obnoxious performances in the Scream trilogy. However, I have to say that I did get a little bit tired of watching Vicellous Reon Shannon mumble through his lines as the determined Lesra Martin, but besides his slightly botched dialogue he also contributed an important element of innocence and wonder to the film.The Hurricane is a nearly flawlessly photographed film. Every scene has such perfect cinematography that you forget that you're watching a movie, you're actually THERE. This was especially important in the many prison scenes, particularly when Carter was in the hole for refusing to wear prison clothes, where his fall into temporary insanity was creatively and amazingly portrayed. I've seen people go insane in a huge number of movies (Hilary and Jackie (1998), Shine (1996), Little Voice (1999), and even Little Man Tate (1991)), but I've never seen the editing used to make a character seem that he was actually having a conversation with himself. Excellent piece of filmmaking right there. The time periods were portrayed perfectly, the costumes were designed to fit not only the time period but also each specific actor, and the dialogue was absolutely engrossing in every scene.This was an absolutely incredible film. It moves the audience just as much as even the most emotionally intense films, and it is a great film to enjoy and learn from at the same time. Unfortunately, there were a few fairly important things that were left out that just should not have been. (spoilers) For example, we never find out what happened to Carter's wife. Sure, it's easy to assume that she divorced him, but after the scene when she visits him and he tells her that he's going to die in prison, we never see or hear from her or about her again. Also, nothing really came of the strong threats that Terry (John Hannah), Lisa (Deborah Unger), Sam (Liev Schrieber), and Lesra (Vicellous Shannon) received from Detective Vincent Pesca (Dan Hedaya) on the street corner that day except for one time when their brakes were evidently disabled. Sure, that's a pretty vicious thing to do, but when he approached the four of them he seemed pretty determined to stop their investigation at all costs. The last thing that I think should be noted (as well as the most important), is that at the end of the film, nothing ever came of the heinous crimes that were committed against Rubin Carter. None of the people who falsely imprisoned him (especially Det. Pesca, who had falsely imprisoned Carter for most of his life) were ever reprimanded for their negligence to uphold the law. At the same time, however, this can be seen as a very respectable element of the film, because it suggests that the movie is about the tremendous strength of the human spirit in the face of hopeless circumstances, and that it is NOT about revenge. This is the kind of thing that you get from films that are somehow able to avoid the poisonous influences of Hollywood, and they are often not easily accepted because people don't look at the actual meaning of things like this, they just want a perfectly happy ending. The Hurricane is an example of a film in which you have to look at what the ending MEANS, not just the basic way that it happened. This same is true for other great films like Boys Don't Cry (1999) and Life Is Beautiful (1997). The emphasis is not on happy endings, but instead on being as accurate as possible in the depiction of reality, which does not work at all like a movie does. This type of thing is especially important in true stories, such as The Hurricane.The Hurricane is among the most powerful films released in years. I think that it is just as emotionally intense as films like Schindler's List and American History X and, like both of the above mentioned films, it not only provides wonderful entertainment, but it also tackles one of the most important messages that can possibly be delivered to our society today - the destructive power of racism. From the opening scenes of the movie, you just love Rubin Carter, and the way that his life is demolished because of racism and prejudice is an extremely powerful thing to watch. Every scene is saturated with emotion and intelligence and cinematic skill, and the end result is magical.

What i wish to comment on is when Shue takes Brolin's hand and tells him to stay awake, hold on. I honestly excepted Celine Dion to break the scene with her shattering caterwaul and horrify us with a power balled. Now that would have been scary. That would have brought the audience to the edge of their seats ... to leave the theatre i assume. Anyhow ... go at your own risk dear movie goer.

The scenery and cinematogrpahy are spectacular, and it is just a beautifully photographed movie. However, when you look past the superficial beauty of the film, much like Armageddon, its numerous shortcomings become clear. First of all, Titanic suffered badly from the transition from the big screen to video. This took away a lot of the hugeness of the film, and this inadvertently places more attention on the story and the acting, both of which were the biggest problems with the film. I went to see this movie to see the sinking of the Titanic, not to see some elaborately fabricated love story. Titanic is a landmark film as a result of the sinking of the ship and the fact that it inexplicably turned out to be such a huge moneymaker. There is absolutely nothing great about the acting, the story is nothing that hasn't been seen dozens of times before, and the directing is awkward, probably due to the fact that James Cameron, who is an excellent director, is so used to directing the Frankenstein-like Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. This is not to say that the directing was bad, it wasn't at all, but there is nothing special to be said about the directing because James Cameron is not really a director of this type of film.Kate Winslet was beautiful in Titanic. She delivered a wonderful performance in the film and was very convincing, as was Kathy Bates (as always) and even Billy Zane. I normally don't like him, but he was playing a dislikeable character, which is probably why I enjoyed his performance so much.

Go rent it if you haven't seen it peopleThese comments were written in part while listening to Zeni Geva's `Autopsy Love,' Paper Lace's `The Night Chicago Died,'  Maria Muldaur's `Midnight at the Oasis,' `Soothing Sounds For Baby 1 to 6 months' by Raymond Scott, and, of course, `Broken Hearts are for A--holes' by Frank Zappa.'SPOILERS'  AHEADStephen Frears' `High Fidelity' is a multi-faceted analysis through narration (often directly into the camera) of John Cusack's character (Rob Gordon).  Cusack confides to the audience (and not anyone else in the film) certain soul-baring confessions of heartbreak and disappointments suffered with girlfriends over the years, and also how these events evolved in an odd symbiosis with his one all-consuming passion in life pop music.  Every event in his life is directly accessible to his memory through some pop song he happened to be listening to when it happened.Rob is not untypical of a certain male type in American society self-styled, middle-class rebels who create more problems than they solve by rejecting traditional 'straight' alternatives but who are compulsively driven to this behavior by the frustrated 'artist inside' struggling to get out.  These are guys who, ideally would like to be artists (Rob considers his dream job to be any kind of musician except for classical or rap), but barring that would still like to live as close to their ideal as possible--for instance, by owning a record store, writing a music column, or producing a band (as Rob tries to do with the two skateboard-punks who steal from his store).Rob's relationship with his latest girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) is coming to an end.  Rob is very much afraid of commitment and traditional marriage and rightly so.  The end of freedom to grow (which includes the freedom to associate with members of the opposite sex who could be a source of growth) is the end of creative impulse.  Rob's whole life is a struggle to keep this impulse alive.  This type of person can never be cured by something as anachronistic as traditional marriage or anything of that sort.  It's 'open marriage' or nothing; the freedom to cheat if it comes to that but not wanting to cheat because the main relationship is strong enough.  And where does it get this strength? Well, to a large degree from being 'open,' in the first place, as a matter of fact.The fact that Rob's cheated and 'gotten it out of his system' during the 'living together' phase will mean very little once the burden of traditional marriage and its prescribed roles falls like a yoke around his neck. Frears implies this throughout the film and, at the end, ONE of the conclusions possible is that for someone like Rob the traditional marriage he's about to get sucked into will have to be modified into an 'open' one; otherwise it will lead to at best a quick divorce and return to old ways, and  at worst a dull, long, monotonous life of petty bourgeois pleasures, dishonest and manipulative CHEATING, and, of course, creative mediocrity.  Other conclusions are also possible, of course, because Frears left things ambiguous on purpose.  However, the semi-tragic, end-of-Rob-as-we-know-him, marriage-trap, one-way ticket-to-sterile-yuppie-hell conclusion cannot be avoided just as much as the so-called 'happy ending.'`High Fidelity' is far from 'square.'  It does not advocate a return to long discredited 'traditional' values as a refuge from insecurity.  It shows the pressures that MAY lead even a relatively nonconformist 'rock 'n' roll' bonehead to become 'square' or consent to living the 'square' or 'straight' life. Frears PUT MORE THAN ONE OVER on the Hollywood geniuses  who financed his venture by giving them their superficial 'happy' ending but very subtly undermining it to create an ambiguous ending.  CASE IN POINT  The final Stevie Wonder song played during the end credits 'If I ever fall in love I want it to be forever.'  Its lyrics are just as nauseatingly symbolic of conformity as 'I just called to say I love you' which Jack Black so savagely and hilariously criticizes as the symbol of everything he hates.  This song choice is a subtle warning that Rob may be about to embark on a dangerous journey to the land of what he's always hated a traditionally restrictive marriage.  Frears in no way implies that Rob's marriage will be successful in the traditional sense; on the contrary, if success is implied at all, it is that Rob's marriage will succeed and 'be forever'  only if its terms are kept 'open' as experience has warranted and as Rob and Laura are currently practicing in their relationship.Neo-hippy, new-age types represent another pocket of conformity that establishment America's created in order to pass itself off as 'liberal,' and tolerant of 'fringe activity.'  But people know a suck-up when they see one, even and especially if he has long hair and an earring.  In 'High Fidelity,' through the character of Ian (Tim Robbins), these 'types' are made the object of as much hatred as 'the middle-aged square guy' wanting to buy the Stevie Wonder song for his daughter.  The fact that THIS is the man Laurie's left Rob for only adds insult to injury.  The scene where Rob imagines three different ways of violently reacting to Ian's 'let's work out our problems' mumbo-jumbo--two of which include 'aggravated' assault--with his buddies backing him up all the way to loud sounds of belligerent hip-hop in the background, always gets the biggest laughs.  It is direct evidence that many people have contemplated delivering 'beatdowns' to just these types of hypocritical, establishment-approved 'non-conformists.'Jack Black is the John Belushi type actor\/singer who plays Barry, one of Rob's two employees.   Barry is a plump, suburban, middle-class, pop-music elitist.  He has a vast knowledge of pop music down to the most trivial things such as the correct title of songs.   He and Rob are in constant competition as to whose taste in music is more non-obvious, original, and hip.  I've seen a number of Barry types over the years, enough to know they're quite prevalent.  They don't necessarily work in a record store. They just think that they're 'COOLER' than other people in their taste in whatever it may be-- cars, clothes, movies, records,  etc., and look down on these others as a way of boosting their own egos.  They have a condescending attitude towards anyone who purchases products of any kind that do not belong on their list of what is 'unassailably cool.'  Barry  is obnoxious and quite demented.  He wears overstated, loud clothing.  It is his way of flipping the bird to people who follow the rules of 'understated fashion.' At different times he is shown wearing a T-shirt with a huge painting of a tiger and a huge picture of Yanni, the new-age 'composer' whose atrocious music he cannot possibly like, except as something to laugh at. When Jack displays his superb singing voice towards the end of the flick, becoming an instant 'stud,' we are taken by surprise. Frears exposes the folly of being too quick to judge and label someone.Dick is weird and shy and speaks in a very odd, labored way that irritates Rob.  But because he is a nice guy, Rob cannot do much about it, except try to politely cut-short their conversations, before they become long, irritating monologues by Dick.  Dick is the kind of guy that most people think would find it hard to get sex.  That is why later in the movie when he finds a girlfriend, Barry is taken by surprise and makes fun of him. Barry says what the audience has been thinking for the whole movie.  How does this guy ever get banged being that weird and shy?  Well the answer is  he finds a weird girl who appreciates his weirdness.  When Barry tells him to `smoke that a--' it is hilarious precisely because it is hard to imagine Dick having normal sex, much less the suggestively passionate kind of 'smoking that a--.'All three white record-store guys (Rob, Barry, and Dick), take a liking to a beautiful black pop singer named Maria De Salle (Lisa Bonet) and lust after her.  There's very much a racial tension here of three white guys lusting after a black prize. Later in the movie when Rob sleeps with Maria De Salle very quickly and unexpectedly the tension is nicely and abruptly released. The tension is there because most Hollywood films do not feature any sort of interracial romance and people have been programmed not to expect it without 'complications.' Latino actors like Jennifer Lopez are still the absurd racial middle ground in Hollywood films ( Raquel Welch, another Latino, and not Faye Dunaway  had the first interracial scene with Jim Brown in '100 Rifles' some 32 years ago and things haven't changed much).   Both George Clooney and Wesley Snipes get to have Lopez , but Wesley Snipes and some lillywhite actress like Michelle Pfeiffer or Sharon Stone? Not likely in good old Tinseltown.I couldn't care less about any of this racial nonsense, held over as if we were still living in the '50s, but it's the pathetic truth about Hollywood practice; and they constantly impose this racial nonsense on society, preventing enlightenment, causing regression.  Art is after all, not just a reflection of society but also the precursor.  The drivel that comes out of Hollywood adds up and becomes a precursor of general societal attitudes. The ultimate taboo in racist Hollywood is still the black man sexing the white woman, and they can't claim to be honestly reflecting society since it is not uncommon in society; therefore they're just  imposing their biases and creating more tension than what would naturally exist and forcing people to look at interracial romance as 'problematic.'  In 'the Bone Collector,' for instance, there is a very poetic scene where Angelina Jolie is very much attracted to the paraplegic Denzel Washington and while he is asleep, feels up his hands and arms.  They cannot have sex, of course, because Washington is paraplegic.  At the end of the movie it is implied that they have become a couple but it's never made explicit. In 'He Got Game,' the woman played by Milla Jovovich was a hooker and Washington, a newly released prisoner! Always trust Spike Lee to know where his bread is buttered, but to  take precautions not to offend too much (knowing that black women have been programmed to be insecure about that sort of thing and that some could be expected to complain, there's no question in my mind that Spike was (c. or u.c.) going exactly for JUST THAT MUCH controversy and no more--what other reason would he have to make the hooker white?).    I don't even want to talk about what Spike was trying to stir up with the ridiculous `Jungle Fever.'  `Zebra Head' was a much more realistic version of 'Jungle Fever' and  'Angel Heart' had some weird chicken blood subtext about god knows what (Mickey O'Rourke and the same Lisa Bonet?!).Hollywood is still stuck in that racist 'Love Connection' mentality that gave airhead-central MTV the chance to gain prestige by completely debunking it.   Until Tom Cruise recently decided to break the taboo in 'Mission Impossible 2'  there wasn't a single Hollywood film I know of that treated interracial romance as an irrelevant, pseudo problem.  Frears isn't new to this game, he has featured interracial romance before (Sammie and Rose Get Laid).  Frears joins Cruise (the true power was in Cruise's, not Woo's hands) in showing up 'the race barrier' as the  psuedo problem that it is. He shows Rob and Maria meeting, finding many things in common, and having sex without giving a single thought as to WHO is going to think WHAT of them.  These are the liberated people much more common in society than Hollywood and Spike Lee would like you to believe.Cusack's subperb portrayal gives us an in-depth tour of the whole phenomenon of guys like Rob.  Most guys of his age group have at least a few things in common with him and some more than a lot.  Some may even feel the same way about life in general and choose to follow Rob's way.  I don't share Rob's views on many things, but I could definitely identify with his situation and understand him as a REAL person.  I certainly wouldn't react the way he does, but I do know where he's coming from.  The irony is that Rob, of all people, should've known that 'Broken hearts are for a--holes,' as Frank Zappa so aptly put it on `Sheik Yerbouti,' but apparently he still couldn't help being an a--hole and torturing himself!  Oh! the pleasures of masochism!One final note, and I just have to say this--Catherine Zeta-Jones--god damn! She plays a girl who's supposed to be shallow and 'who talks s--t all night,' but there never was a shallowness more intelligent, sexy and soulfully exotic than that which comes out of ZJ's gorgeous lips.  It's very easy to see why she is 'the answer to all the world's problems' for any heterosexual man  from here to Katmandu; and no matter how much Rob tries to rationalize it away, no male member of the audience is fooled for a second. Stupidity shows through much more than the words a person utters, through body language and tone of voice for instance, and ZJ's are too refined and exquisite to be mistaken for stupid.   It should be quite obvious that all this was fully intentional on Frears' part in order to mine for ambiguity and also turn the camera on the audience.  Frears' uses ZJ as a demonstration model to emphasize how similar us guys in the audience are to Rob when faced with having to interpret the mysteries of the 'femme fatale.' Our only way out of total bondage is a similarly inane rationalization of her 'superficiality.'When a little later,the music-critic character played by Natasha Gregson-Wagner is introduced, this rationalization doesn't work.  She is almost as good-looking as ZJ but in addition she's 'intelligent' (on the film's own terms anyway)  and a seemingly perfect match for Rob.  So Rob now being defenseless, has to run back to Laurie and ask for marriage.  He sees this as the only way to avoid endless temptations; whereas the real problem lies in the fact that his relationship with Laurie is only beginning to show signs of strength.  This strength has been created through the 'open' attitude they've been practicing of late and is much more likely to be destroyed (and create ever stronger temptations to stray) than safeguarded by a traditional 'closed' marriage.

Go rent it if you haven't seen it peopleThese comments were written in part while listening to Zeni Geva's `Autopsy Love,' Paper Lace's `The Night Chicago Died,'  Maria Muldaur's `Midnight at the Oasis,' `Soothing Sounds For Baby 1 to 6 months' by Raymond Scott, and, of course, `Broken Hearts are for A--holes' by Frank Zappa.'SPOILERS'  AHEADStephen Frears' `High Fidelity' is a multi-faceted analysis through narration (often directly into the camera) of John Cusack's character (Rob Gordon).  Cusack confides to the audience (and not anyone else in the film) certain soul-baring confessions of heartbreak and disappointments suffered with girlfriends over the years, and also how these events evolved in an odd symbiosis with his one all-consuming passion in life pop music.  Every event in his life is directly accessible to his memory through some pop song he happened to be listening to when it happened.Rob is not untypical of a certain male type in American society self-styled, middle-class rebels who create more problems than they solve by rejecting traditional 'straight' alternatives but who are compulsively driven to this behavior by the frustrated 'artist inside' struggling to get out.  These are guys who, ideally would like to be artists (Rob considers his dream job to be any kind of musician except for classical or rap), but barring that would still like to live as close to their ideal as possible--for instance, by owning a record store, writing a music column, or producing a band (as Rob tries to do with the two skateboard-punks who steal from his store).Rob's relationship with his latest girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) is coming to an end.  Rob is very much afraid of commitment and traditional marriage and rightly so.  The end of freedom to grow (which includes the freedom to associate with members of the opposite sex who could be a source of growth) is the end of creative impulse.  Rob's whole life is a struggle to keep this impulse alive.  This type of person can never be cured by something as anachronistic as traditional marriage or anything of that sort.  It's 'open marriage' or nothing; the freedom to cheat if it comes to that but not wanting to cheat because the main relationship is strong enough.  And where does it get this strength? Well, to a large degree from being 'open,' in the first place, as a matter of fact.The fact that Rob's cheated and 'gotten it out of his system' during the 'living together' phase will mean very little once the burden of traditional marriage and its prescribed roles falls like a yoke around his neck. Frears implies this throughout the film and, at the end, ONE of the conclusions possible is that for someone like Rob the traditional marriage he's about to get sucked into will have to be modified into an 'open' one; otherwise it will lead to at best a quick divorce and return to old ways, and  at worst a dull, long, monotonous life of petty bourgeois pleasures, dishonest and manipulative CHEATING, and, of course, creative mediocrity.  Other conclusions are also possible, of course, because Frears left things ambiguous on purpose.  However, the semi-tragic, end-of-Rob-as-we-know-him, marriage-trap, one-way ticket-to-sterile-yuppie-hell conclusion cannot be avoided just as much as the so-called 'happy ending.'`High Fidelity' is far from 'square.'  It does not advocate a return to long discredited 'traditional' values as a refuge from insecurity.  It shows the pressures that MAY lead even a relatively nonconformist 'rock 'n' roll' bonehead to become 'square' or consent to living the 'square' or 'straight' life. Frears PUT MORE THAN ONE OVER on the Hollywood geniuses  who financed his venture by giving them their superficial 'happy' ending but very subtly undermining it to create an ambiguous ending.  CASE IN POINT  The final Stevie Wonder song played during the end credits 'If I ever fall in love I want it to be forever.'  Its lyrics are just as nauseatingly symbolic of conformity as 'I just called to say I love you' which Jack Black so savagely and hilariously criticizes as the symbol of everything he hates.  This song choice is a subtle warning that Rob may be about to embark on a dangerous journey to the land of what he's always hated a traditionally restrictive marriage.  Frears in no way implies that Rob's marriage will be successful in the traditional sense; on the contrary, if success is implied at all, it is that Rob's marriage will succeed and 'be forever'  only if its terms are kept 'open' as experience has warranted and as Rob and Laura are currently practicing in their relationship.Neo-hippy, new-age types represent another pocket of conformity that establishment America's created in order to pass itself off as 'liberal,' and tolerant of 'fringe activity.'  But people know a suck-up when they see one, even and especially if he has long hair and an earring.  In 'High Fidelity,' through the character of Ian (Tim Robbins), these 'types' are made the object of as much hatred as 'the middle-aged square guy' wanting to buy the Stevie Wonder song for his daughter.  The fact that THIS is the man Laurie's left Rob for only adds insult to injury.  The scene where Rob imagines three different ways of violently reacting to Ian's 'let's work out our problems' mumbo-jumbo--two of which include 'aggravated' assault--with his buddies backing him up all the way to loud sounds of belligerent hip-hop in the background, always gets the biggest laughs.  It is direct evidence that many people have contemplated delivering 'beatdowns' to just these types of hypocritical, establishment-approved 'non-conformists.'Jack Black is the John Belushi type actor\/singer who plays Barry, one of Rob's two employees.   Barry is a plump, suburban, middle-class, pop-music elitist.  He has a vast knowledge of pop music down to the most trivial things such as the correct title of songs.   He and Rob are in constant competition as to whose taste in music is more non-obvious, original, and hip.  I've seen a number of Barry types over the years, enough to know they're quite prevalent.  They don't necessarily work in a record store. They just think that they're 'COOLER' than other people in their taste in whatever it may be-- cars, clothes, movies, records,  etc., and look down on these others as a way of boosting their own egos.  They have a condescending attitude towards anyone who purchases products of any kind that do not belong on their list of what is 'unassailably cool.'  Barry  is obnoxious and quite demented.  He wears overstated, loud clothing.  It is his way of flipping the bird to people who follow the rules of 'understated fashion.' At different times he is shown wearing a T-shirt with a huge painting of a tiger and a huge picture of Yanni, the new-age 'composer' whose atrocious music he cannot possibly like, except as something to laugh at. When Jack displays his superb singing voice towards the end of the flick, becoming an instant 'stud,' we are taken by surprise. Frears exposes the folly of being too quick to judge and label someone.Dick is weird and shy and speaks in a very odd, labored way that irritates Rob.  But because he is a nice guy, Rob cannot do much about it, except try to politely cut-short their conversations, before they become long, irritating monologues by Dick.  Dick is the kind of guy that most people think would find it hard to get sex.  That is why later in the movie when he finds a girlfriend, Barry is taken by surprise and makes fun of him. Barry says what the audience has been thinking for the whole movie.  How does this guy ever get banged being that weird and shy?  Well the answer is  he finds a weird girl who appreciates his weirdness.  When Barry tells him to `smoke that a--' it is hilarious precisely because it is hard to imagine Dick having normal sex, much less the suggestively passionate kind of 'smoking that a--.'All three white record-store guys (Rob, Barry, and Dick), take a liking to a beautiful black pop singer named Maria De Salle (Lisa Bonet) and lust after her.  There's very much a racial tension here of three white guys lusting after a black prize. Later in the movie when Rob sleeps with Maria De Salle very quickly and unexpectedly the tension is nicely and abruptly released. The tension is there because most Hollywood films do not feature any sort of interracial romance and people have been programmed not to expect it without 'complications.' Latino actors like Jennifer Lopez are still the absurd racial middle ground in Hollywood films ( Raquel Welch, another Latino, and not Faye Dunaway  had the first interracial scene with Jim Brown in '100 Rifles' some 32 years ago and things haven't changed much).   Both George Clooney and Wesley Snipes get to have Lopez , but Wesley Snipes and some lillywhite actress like Michelle Pfeiffer or Sharon Stone?

She is almost as good-looking as ZJ but in addition she's 'intelligent' (on the film's own terms anyway)  and a seemingly perfect match for Rob.  So Rob now being defenseless, has to run back to Laurie and ask for marriage.  He sees this as the only way to avoid endless temptations; whereas the real problem lies in the fact that his relationship with Laurie is only beginning to show signs of strength.  This strength has been created through the 'open' attitude they've been practicing of late and is much more likely to be destroyed (and create ever stronger temptations to stray) than safeguarded by a traditional 'closed' marriage.

The truth is that this film is deeply flawed and undeniably weak in many regards, but it had a quality I cannot describe. This is the only film I have ever seen that, despite many shortcomings, manages to come out of the storm relatively unscathed, and become an unforgettable, almost haunting, movie.The production values are immaculate. Peter Weir's direction is excellent, and is in top form here. He has crafted a thick shell that blocks the flaws from coming up to the surface, an indescribable feat that very few directors have accomplished. The musical score is good, not outstanding, but it's fitting, and surprisingly subtle. There is only about six minutes out of the entire film that has musical accompaniment, which makes for a very unique experience, and not necessarily a bad one. The tropical cinematography is dazzling, and the decision to shoot on location in Belize instead of on a studio back lot really paid off, contributing greatly to the film's success.As good as the mentioned characteristics are, nothing is as good as the acting, especially that from the two leads Harrison Ford and River Phoenix. Prior to this, Ford had made a name for himself with big budget action roles, with several failed attempts at drama (Hanover Street being the best example of that). It wasn't until 1985's 'Witness' (which Peter Weir also directed, that Ford was taken seriously as an all around actor. Personally I think Ford's performance here greatly overshadowed his work in 'Witness', and is a career best for him, even in the light of 'Regarding Henry' and 'Presumed Innocent', both made after his. He takes the character of Allie Fox, and moulds him into a selfish, driving maniac, blind to the wishes of others, only caring for himself. Phoenix, on the other hand, deserves even more acclaim, for several reasons. For one, this was only his third film, after 1985's 'Explorers', and 'Stand by Me', made right before this. Secondly, he was only 15 at the time of the shoot, and had little acting experience, yet he easily out acted most of his co-stars. Though his performance wasn't quite as refined as Ford's was, he still reached a level of near perfection and set the stage for a glorious, and ultimately tragic, career.The story is one of utter genius, one of the few original ones popping up in an industry full of sequels, remakes and rip offs. Based on the 1981 bestseller by Paul Theroux, and co-starring Helen Mirren, 'The Mosquito Coast' deserves a place among the best films of the 80's.But wait, I'm not done. Despite a great exterior, deep inside the movie is troubled. It's as if director Weir pushed all the movie's problems deep down under the surface, then piled layer after layer of... something, on top of it, hiding them from the clueless audience. My main problem with the movie is that it yearns to break away from it's literary roots, a problem that could've been easily avoided had the right script come along. Entire conversations are lifted from the text, and there isn't a single line that doesn't have an equal counterpart in the novel. For me this got extremely tedious as, hours before popping in the tape for a second viewing, I had finished the book, and the two are much too similar.Another problem I have with it is that the scenes are much too short, with none of them running over about a minute and a half. An obvious result of this is that many subplots remain unresolved, and several concepts are hinted at, but go without further explanation, making for a confusing story. If the screenwriter had put a little more effort into making the film different than the book, with new scenes, we would have seen a much better end product.A third, albeit a smaller one, is that the production team apparently spent too much time making sure that the movie would get a PG rating, though it would've been much better had it gotten an R, or even a PG-13 rating. That would've allowed Ford a little more breathing room to tweak his character, possibly allowing Allie to become less sympathetic, more of a madman.I can't think of much more worth saying to put in this review, so I'll end it with this note see the movie, even if you've read the book, but don't do the two back to back.

He's a piece of work. He wears a stoic expression, perhaps because he studied the Stoics while obtaining his Ph.D. in Philosophy from NYU.

Being an itinerant and lonely bouncer cleaning up run-down Midwestern dives isn't that glamorous, but the pay must be sweet. No wonder he gave up his professorship.Of course, his immersion in the highlights of human thought have given him the insight necessary to utter such lines as Pain don't hurt. There will be a test on this later. I think that line probably cracked me up more than any other in film history. The previous record holder, not surprisingly, had been in a comedy, only the singing Hitlers over here. Dancing Hitlers over there. (You film buffs know the movie). Anyway, my buds and I swaggered around for years, whenever we would see each other, and intoned pain don't hurt. Interesting question for the philosophers amongst you. If pain don't hurt, what does? And why do they call it pain? I'll leave the answers up to you, because these trees falling in an empty forest questions always hurt my head.   Although, interestingly enough, when my head hurts there can be no pain, because.... (Your answer here).I told you there would be a test.There is also an interesting fight scene. Swayze is battling a knife-wielding goon. He relieves the guy of his knife with some proven technique of ancient Zen philosophy. Confucius once wrote that while the pen is mightier that the sword, he would prefer to deliver an enemy not a witty epigram from his quill, but a swift kick in the privates from his pointed shoes.My translation from Mandarin may be a bit inexact.Anyway, somehow the knife mysteriously reappears in the guy's hand, and Swayze uses the exact same maneuver to taunt him and remove the knife a second time. An important lesson for us all. If you have to do a second take on a scene - why waste it?Oh, and the back-up cast. Make room for wrestler Terry Funk and Kevin Tighe. Tighe plays a guy named Tilghman, presumably so he won't have to learn any new consonants.Oh, and the dancing.

Hard to believe it was made in 1989, because it includes so many details which would have been considered cliches in 1939.Here's the idea. Before I start, I need to tell you that this takes place in the present, not in the Old West. That's important, because it's really just an old western, as you'll see when you read through the plot summary. Hint think ShaneA powerful landowner with a savage taste for hunting gets all his kicks from his domination of a small town and all its inhabitants. Ben Gazzara plays this part. Don't miss the scene where Gazzara sings Shboom, shboom!Ben comes complete with all the movie evil accoutrements, like llama heads in his paneled den. How hard could it be to kill a llama? They are big clumsy-looking pack animals and they don't live in places where they can hide or run away. In my den, I have the heads of dairy cows. Now that's good hunting. I also enjoy hunting for Koalas. They sometimes go for hours without muscle movement, so you don't have to waste any bullets.Only one man is prepared to challenge Big Ben. The owner of a local bar simply wants to fix up his old joint and live his life, but Gazzara's goons keep roughing up the joint and scaring off the paying customers and demanding the usual protection money. How to fight back? The owner of the bar just happens to know the world's greatest bouncer. Oh, and the bouncer brings along his mentor, and together they stand tall against Ben and his henchmen.The world's greatest bouncer is Patrick Swayze, then one of the hottest properties in filmdom after his success two years earlier in Dirty Dancing. He's a piece of work. He wears a stoic expression, perhaps because he studied the Stoics while obtaining his Ph.D. in Philosophy from NYU. He also wears expensive Armani clothing (black is his color) and drives a Mercedes. Being an itinerant and lonely bouncer cleaning up run-down Midwestern dives isn't that glamorous, but the pay must be sweet. No wonder he gave up his professorship.Of course, his immersion in the highlights of human thought have given him the insight necessary to utter such lines as Pain don't hurt. There will be a test on this later. I think that line probably cracked me up more than any other in film history. The previous record holder, not surprisingly, had been in a comedy, only the singing Hitlers over here. Dancing Hitlers over there. (You film buffs know the movie). Anyway, my buds and I swaggered around for years, whenever we would see each other, and intoned pain don't hurt. Interesting question for the philosophers amongst you. If pain don't hurt, what does? And why do they call it pain? I'll leave the answers up to you, because these trees falling in an empty forest questions always hurt my head.   Although, interestingly enough, when my head hurts there can be no pain, because.... (Your answer here).I told you there would be a test.There is also an interesting fight scene. Swayze is battling a knife-wielding goon. He relieves the guy of his knife with some proven technique of ancient Zen philosophy. Confucius once wrote that while the pen is mightier that the sword, he would prefer to deliver an enemy not a witty epigram from his quill, but a swift kick in the privates from his pointed shoes.My translation from Mandarin may be a bit inexact.Anyway, somehow the knife mysteriously reappears in the guy's hand, and Swayze uses the exact same maneuver to taunt him and remove the knife a second time. An important lesson for us all. If you have to do a second take on a scene - why waste it?Oh, and the back-up cast. Make room for wrestler Terry Funk and Kevin Tighe. Tighe plays a guy named Tilghman, presumably so he won't have to learn any new consonants.Oh, and the dancing. Remember this is a forgotten town about as run-down as the mining camp in Paint Your Wagon, but all the chicks in the bar can dance broadway schtick.Anyway, not many movies are so bad they are good. Most bad movies are bad because they are boring. But this one is not boring for a minute. In fact, Road House is one of the greatest comedies ever filmed, although I don't think the filmmakers were aware of it. It is worth watching, and has a great rock 'n roll score, but I strongly suggest that you do so under the influence of mood-altering substances and in the company of like-minded goofballs.Bottom line - ya gotta see it.

The Oscar winning SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and the cult classic DREAMSCAPE, and put the two films together and you've got THE CELL. And one thing about THE CELL is that is has some of the most spectacular production designs since SLEEPY HOLLOW. THE CELL has a serial killer, Carl Stargher (Vincent D' Onofrio) a man who kidnaps young women and places them in a cell of sorts where as the hours go on, the glass cell fills with water until his victims drown to death.  He then dumps their bodies and makes them up to look like porcelin dolls. Enter FBI agents Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) who are on the trail of Carl.  They do find Carl, however he is unconscious and it's a matter of time before Carl's latest victim downs in his cage.  So they are suggested a new scientific discovery, where a group of scientist are helping giving people therapy, they enter the troubled person's mind, through their dreams.  And the only way the agents can know about the victim's whereabouts is by entering into Carl's mind.  Catharine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a therapist who is the kindest and gentlest person who can communicate with people better than anyone else.  Catharine is a expert into traveling into other people's minds, so going into the mind of Carl will be a experience into hell that Catharine would never expect. There are some good points and bad points about THE CELL. The good points, THE SET DESIGNS!!!!!  WOW!!!  They are rather well done, a lot of imagination and creativity went into making this film.  I really enjoyed how things seem real or surreal, and how entering another person's nightmares can be scary for the guest just as much as it is for the resident.  I also liked how the movie was in a good pacing.  It can be very suspensful and tense in some scenes and it does take it's time to slow down to catch it's breath. Then the acting is also good.  I always enjoy Jennifer Lopez in SELENA and OUT OF SIGHT, and she did win me over with THE CELL.  Also giving a good performance is Vince Vaughn as the FBI agent who suffers his own nightmares, and Vincent D'Onofrio as the sadistic killer. Then there is the bad points.  The plot does seem muddled and thin at times.  There are scenes where you think that the movie is going to be leading to, then it turns out to be a weak sub-plot.  And with it's mixture of SE7EN and DREAMSCAPE it isn't that original, with the exception of the style of the dreams.  And there are some really disturbing scenes to watch, I mean so disturbing that you will probably be turning green like I did. One of the most horrific scenes is what the Vincent D'Onofrio's character has on his back, and what he likes to do after killing his victims. But I did count more plus points than negative points for this film, so I enjoyed it.  First time film director Tarsem Singh (who directed the symbolic R.E.M. video Losing My Religion) does show the same style of symbolism and images in this film as he did in his music videos.  And it does have some scenes that still can't leave my mind after watching it. It does have a dark and creepy mood to it, and then again, this is a terrifying thriller that works out pretty well.  **** (out of five) ","genre":null},{"date":"30 August 2000","score":"","review":"  This film reminded me of two thrillers put together into one film.
