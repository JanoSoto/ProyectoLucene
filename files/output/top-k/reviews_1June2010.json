It's a card that tells him to go to this place called CRS, Consumer Recreation Services. They give Nicholas a chance to be a participant in a game. Things get a little too out of hand when the game itself becomes life threatening and Nicholas can't seem to stop it.The Game is never really mentioned when talking about Fincher and his body of work, good or bad it gets left on the cutting room floor. I guess it's because the film is the middleman sort to speak. You have Se7en, and Fight Club, his two most popular and fan favourite films. Then you have Panic Room and Alien 3, considered lower calibre. Zodiac and Benjamin Button seem to be in a totally different class here, but The Game deserves to be mentioned because it is a well written, thought provoking thriller that manages to peel away at it's mysteries and never have the viewer bored. Even the film's ending, which many people seem to complain about, did not make me hate the film, or think the first 80 or so minutes were a waste. The film looks and feels just like Fincher's others. It's cold, dark and unforgiving. He manages to craft his most suspenseful film to date and having Michael Douglass run around trying to solve the mystery helps the case. I'm a sucker for films full of mystery, that slowly but surely peel away at those mysteries to reveal the truth. A lot of crime films are like this, but The Game is something different. A bit more psychological, another reason why I liked it so much. Much like Memento, we are lost like the lead character. We know it's a game, he knows it's a game. But we, nor him, know exactly what the game is or what is happening next. We are trying to solve the same mysteries and Fincher makes us care about these things. Complaints for the film are ones that would have me base the film is reality. To believe the stuff that happens in the film is for one to suspend a lot of belief. The film ends in a way that made me think whether I liked it or not. I would have preferred the first ending, as opposed to the second one, but the way they did it didn't ruin the film. I'm not sure how I will feel on repeated viewings, but as it stands, the thrills were still there and I still enjoyed them. I'm still left with some character motivation questions, some that I will not go into for the sake of spoiling things in the film. Douglass, whom I usually hate, does a great job here. He is a jerk that slowly begins to unwind his sanity. His Gordon Gekko demeanor works here and yet we still root for his character. Sean Penn has a small role, one too small for me to really comment on and the supporting cast usually only have a scene or two to do anything. Deborah Kara Unger plays a good role in which we have to decide whether or not we trust her. She usually plays wackos. The Game is something that might frustrate you with the ending, but that's what films are all about, getting some kind of emotional response. I'm not a fan of the last 3 or 4 minutes, to me it seemed to be tacked on by pressure of the studio and would not be something Fincher would normally do.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"1 June 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Hoosiers (1986) **** (out of 4)The sports genre has been around since films became entertainment and they really haven't changed much in over one-hundred years. They can be about fun, bonding or redemption. I think there's a reason the genre has remained one of the most popular out there and it's because everyone can root for the underdog. This film tells the true story of Coach Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) who takes his checkered past to a small town in Indiana where he takes a team no one had heard of and gets them to the state championship. I'm certainly not going to try and lie because I love this film. To me this is one of the purist American movies ever made. Everything here, story wise, is stuff we've seen before in countless other sports movies but every cliché comes off as fresh and original here and in the end you've got a rather remarkable tale of second chances and hope no matter how small you are. It's funny to think that this movie is one that no one really had high hopes for yet it has turned out to be one of the most loved classics in film history. I guess you can compare this to the actual team as I'm sure no one expected them to do anything yet they turned out to be one of the most remarkable teams in history for what they achieved. There's so much in this film that works but I think the real key is the heart that it shows. Not only do we have the story of the coach getting a second shot but we also have a drunk (Dennis Hopper) trying to overcome his own demons and get his life back on track with his son. The way the film takes a look at the coach and the drunk is something everyone can connect with and I really can't think of a film that gets so much out of making the viewer want to see someone succeed. A lot of credit has to go to both Hackman and Hopper as both actors turn in some of their best work here. Hackman's performance here has somewhat already became legendary as you can always find people able to quote him or at least remember everything that happens here. The amount of dignity Hackman brings to the role is rather remarkable to watch as he has the fire, energy and passion to make you think you're watching a real person and not just some sentimental role. Hopper is the real eye-catcher here as he had only been sober for a few years so I'm sure he knew this character very well as he had been given several second chances in his own life. The amount of passion Hopper brings to the role makes this easily one of his greatest performances. It could be early one during a scene where he simply smiles at what the coach is trying to do with the team or when his is suffering the shakes from the alcohol with drawls. Hopper nails every inch of this character and his broken down weakness is up there with the greatest alcoholic performances. The supporting cast, including Barbara Hershey, are great as well but there's no question that the film belongs to Hackman and Hopper. It's rather hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this film and it's easy to tell I'm one of its major fans.

They can be about fun, bonding or redemption. I think there's a reason the genre has remained one of the most popular out there and it's because everyone can root for the underdog. This film tells the true story of Coach Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) who takes his checkered past to a small town in Indiana where he takes a team no one had heard of and gets them to the state championship. I'm certainly not going to try and lie because I love this film. To me this is one of the purist American movies ever made. Everything here, story wise, is stuff we've seen before in countless other sports movies but every cliché comes off as fresh and original here and in the end you've got a rather remarkable tale of second chances and hope no matter how small you are. It's funny to think that this movie is one that no one really had high hopes for yet it has turned out to be one of the most loved classics in film history. I guess you can compare this to the actual team as I'm sure no one expected them to do anything yet they turned out to be one of the most remarkable teams in history for what they achieved. There's so much in this film that works but I think the real key is the heart that it shows. Not only do we have the story of the coach getting a second shot but we also have a drunk (Dennis Hopper) trying to overcome his own demons and get his life back on track with his son. The way the film takes a look at the coach and the drunk is something everyone can connect with and I really can't think of a film that gets so much out of making the viewer want to see someone succeed. A lot of credit has to go to both Hackman and Hopper as both actors turn in some of their best work here. Hackman's performance here has somewhat already became legendary as you can always find people able to quote him or at least remember everything that happens here. The amount of dignity Hackman brings to the role is rather remarkable to watch as he has the fire, energy and passion to make you think you're watching a real person and not just some sentimental role. Hopper is the real eye-catcher here as he had only been sober for a few years so I'm sure he knew this character very well as he had been given several second chances in his own life. The amount of passion Hopper brings to the role makes this easily one of his greatest performances. It could be early one during a scene where he simply smiles at what the coach is trying to do with the team or when his is suffering the shakes from the alcohol with drawls. Hopper nails every inch of this character and his broken down weakness is up there with the greatest alcoholic performances. The supporting cast, including Barbara Hershey, are great as well but there's no question that the film belongs to Hackman and Hopper. It's rather hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this film and it's easy to tell I'm one of its major fans. To me this is storytelling at its very best as the film manages to show why sports remain so powerful and how they can touch so many lives.

He ends up in the apartment of a singer (Isabella Rossellini) who has a child and husband being held captive by the psychopath Frank (Dennis Hopper). I've seen this movie countless times over the years and a lot more times that I normally would considering I really don't love this movie like many do. I don't love the movie yet at the same times there's just something so strange and surreal about the thing that I find myself getting caught up in its web of strangeness. I think Lynch does a great job at building up the atmosphere as every single scene in the film has something bizarre going on. Even the opening with the lovely title song being played has one strange image after another and this section here is the purist thing we're going to see. I love the way Lynch starts the film off by showing a typical American town before quickly changing it some sort of nightmare world that would really only exist in the director's mind. The film is full of weird characters, strange situations and numerous WTF moments with many of them coming from Hopper. The role of Frank is certainly one of the most memorable villains in the history of cinema with his constant screaming and huffing whatever drug he is taking to get high. There's no denying that Hopper made this role his own and I doubt anyone else could have done more with it. On one level we're suppose to be terrified of Frank but I've always found the role to be somewhat like able just because of how crazy he is. Perhaps Lynch wanted this but I've never really feared Frank while watching this movie but instead I just viewed him as entertainment. For such an evil man he certainly can make you smile and laugh at some of the things he does. MacLachlan is also very good as the hero here and Laura Dern isn't too bad as his helper. Rossellini certainly gives a very brave performance here as she's asked to do some pretty ugly stuff and she handles it all extremely well. There are several plot holes in the film and at times I wondered if the actual story really meant anything or if it was just overlooked for the next weird set piece. Lynch certainly creates a nightmare here with his vision and on that level it makes the film worth viewing. At the same time I can't help but think the film should have and could have been much, much better.

I also found a common theme among bad reviews, most of them comparing this movie to the novel it derived from saying it didn't transcend the emotion and detail that the novel had brought them. Comparing a movie to a novel to which it is based is completely irrelevant on so many levels, one because nothing is as pure and complex as the human imagination that brings a story to life off the pages, turning words into action as if it were a repressed memory we had long forgotten until someone reminded us and wrote it all out on paper. Also, the novel The Virgin Suicides received great reviews, some calling it an instant classic among American contemporary work, which was the foundation upon which inspired Coppola to write and direct this movie. That said, I want to let people know what I personally thought about this movie, not comparing it to the book (which I haven't read) which, like I said, is really apples and oranges, it's just not fair to compare the two. So, from a movie-goers perspective and regular film enthusiast, this is what I thought of the film. I first saw this movie late one night on cable television back in the early 2000's. I remembered thinking at the time that it looked like an 'indie' film by the way it was shot, the script and all, but with headline actors playing the major roles. I was younger then and didn't fully appreciate the certain aspects of what made this movie so captivating to me the first time I saw it, entranced by the beautiful shot work of the film that gave it such a mystical dreamlike feel. It seems like every scene took place at the summertime dusk, bringing to life these emotions in myself that were triggered visually, along with an amazing soundtrack that assisted my eyes, keeping me glued to my television. As a teenager at the time, I was truly entranced by this film as it opened my eyes to a world I had never seen before. (Off topic) I was recently doing research on what movies I wanted to add to my collection when I stumbled upon The Virgin Suicides, and upon seeing the cast and plot I immediately knew I had seen this movie before. Easily 8-10 years have gone by and I remembered this film and the impression it made on me. I picked up the movie at a local used DVD store a couple of days ago and watched it again, the second time, years later, now as an adult in true appreciation. I can't explain in words how well this movie flows, music hitting right in stride, relating with the characters and as I'm watching, remembering why I feel in love with this movie the first time. Giovanni Ribisi narrates throughout the film as the story unfolds, his voice so eerily familiar and smooth. James Woods gives an excellent performance as does Kirsten Dunst, who's more likely to be remembered playing the role of a bubbly cheerleader in the teen movie Bring It On, is so easily and rightfully forgotten as she brings to life a character that is nothing less than spellbinding. Josh Hartnett, in probably one of his first roles, embodies the essence of what it is to be cool and the staggering infatuation his character develops in the film. I would advise viewers to be wary when watching this film not to confuse what seems to be a lack of an established meaning with a lack-luster film, which is certainly not the case. I feel that other reviews have trashed and tarnished this movie in whole because they didn't understand or get any point to the movie, or, they just couldn't grasp any major theme. To me, that's exactly the point! In relation to the characters of this movie (specifically the attention of the young boys' lustful obsession), not being able to put together the pieces (what,when,why,where and how) sometimes gives an illusion of poor film making but, in reality, is exactly (in my opinion) what Sofia Coppola intended. Being able to immerse yourself in the emotional value and confusion of the characters in this movie is what makes it so good. I won't call this movie great, because it does have it's flaws in such ways that it changes pace about 2\/3 of the way through with such haste that it leaves me feeling unfulfilled and that it needed more substance where it probably could have made for a truly great film. This movie will pull you in the direction of romanticism and obsession, back to another of a heartfelt sickness that begs to be tended to that never seems to come to fruition. Probably not every movie-goers dream, but I feel like this movie was a significant accomplishment by small time director with a big time (last) name.

Although I know it is not always easy to get away from the drugs and violence we see daily, we must try to not give in. Despite the fact that I was not into the movie, I would recommend it to others. I would recommend it to kids who think selling drugs is the easy way out, so that they can see that by selling drugs and being a kid from the ghetto, you are automatically looked at as a suspect by society. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"1 June 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In the movie Slam directed by Marc Levin, we see another story about a young man named Ray Joshua who grows up in the ghetto. Ray makes his living through selling drugs in the neighborhood, as some kids often do when they live in urban areas. As Ray is receiving some marijuana from his friend, his friend is shot. When Ray hears the shots fired and the sirens of the cops he begins to run. He does not run for long because he is quickly caught by the cop, who searches him and sees the marijuana he has on him. He is sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. Although Ray is imprisoned, he does not want to make himself a part of the gangs in the prison. At one point in the movie, two rival gangs approach him and Ray begins to say various rhymes. He catches the attention of both gangs and of a female who is watching him from the gate. Ray wants to show that he was different from the other prisoners, and he does that through his poetry.The forces of living in the ghetto and being sent to prison try to define Ray. Although Ray is innocent of the crime he is being punished, the fact that he has grown up in an urban neighborhood full of drug dealers it makes him more of a suspect. When the rival gangs in the prison try to get Ray to be on their side he separates himself with his words. Right after Ray says, I am the sun, and we are public enemy number one&#x85; (Slam), all the prisoners look around as if they do not know what just hit them. He catches all the prisoners off guard because they expect him to be just like any other kid from the ghetto, reckless and hardheaded. Through his poetry Ray is able to show the other prisoners that he is not the ordinary kid from the ghetto and that he does not need them to survive in prison; he can do that just fine on his own.Even though many people enjoyed this movie I personally did not. I felt as if I was watching the story of another kid from the ghetto that is exposed to drugs and is quickly locked up. I see these things daily where I live, and I did not want to see it on screen. I cannot relate to Ray in the sense of being in prison or blamed from a crime I did not commit, but I can relate to him because of the surroundings he grew up in. I constantly see kids and friends go down these paths that lead them nowhere in life. Some people may argue that Ray did what he had to do by selling drugs, but I disagree. My parents work extremely hard to put food on the table, and that is what I consider doing what you have to do in order to survive. Ray could have separated himself from the drugs just as he separated himself from the other prisoners in the prison yard. Although I know it is not always easy to get away from the drugs and violence we see daily, we must try to not give in. Despite the fact that I was not into the movie, I would recommend it to others.

This impressive film has a couple bikers (Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda) heading across country for Mardi Gras where they see both the good and bad that the land has to offer. I've heard several people refer to this as a flawed masterpiece, which I think is fair. This is certainly far from a perfect film as there are plenty of things wrong with it yet, at the same time, there's something so special about this movie that you can't help but be drawn in by the images on the screen. I think a lot of credit has to go to Hopper as there were countless biker films released before this one yet this one here doesn't try to be exploitation but instead it tries to say something about the times. I think it would be fair to say that the film deals with various stereotypes but in the end the message is certainly here. Even though this was Hopper and Fonda's child, there's no question that the real star here is Jack Nicholson, playing lawyer George Hanson, which would be his break through role. Nicholson is so perfect here that I don't think anyone would argue that his twenty-minutes or so on screen were the high point of the film. His high speech about UFO's is classic and that accent is priceless. There's no a single frame where Nicholson isn't glowing and jumping off the screen like very few performances that come to mind. Watching the film now you still can't help but be impressed by what he accomplishes in these few scenes. Both Hopper and Fonda are perfect as well. Hopper shows even at this early stage he could play someone off centered and Fonda plays what I've always seen as a hippie version of something his father would have played. Fonda's character here is the calm, peaceful and thoughtful one, which is the type of character his father played countless times and the only difference is that Peter had the long hair. The entire journey that is taken here doesn't take up too much plot but it does offer an interesting look at the decade and the land back then. The images of the South and West are one of the highlights here as is the wonderful soundtrack, which includes music by Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Band, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and countless others. This film certainly has many flaws but at the same times there's no denying its importance as well as its place in time.

Out of all the scenes in the film, Arthur and Guinivere's wedding was my favourite, it was beautifully done. As I have said, the film looks lavish, with sumptuous costumes and sets and mystical cinematography, and the score and battle scenes are excellent.

If people are too stupid and ignorant to be able to follow a plot then they deserve the drivel that is put on the big screen but i suspect that the majority of people still want a good film, and apologies for digressing from the point but this film is it.Funny and serious all rolled into one from the offset and grittily realistic and truthful and insightful into how people really are.Some of the one liners alone are simply hilarious;Marvin look out! Well i've got 2 words for you, Shut the %$£& up 96 bottles of beer on the wall Would you ever have $£X with a chicken Jack? Watch your cigarette with this one Jack!

If people are too stupid and ignorant to be able to follow a plot then they deserve the drivel that is put on the big screen but i suspect that the majority of people still want a good film, and apologies for digressing from the point but this film is it.Funny and serious all rolled into one from the offset and grittily realistic and truthful and insightful into how people really are.Some of the one liners alone are simply hilarious;Marvin look out!

It's like Flightplan, only not really, really stupid. The fact that it's been recently redone helps prove that this is an interesting concept. This actually does work out; the plot and its twists make sense, and as far as mystery-thrillers go, this should leave you satisfied, if it being made in a completely different time(which it certainly shows) does not bother you excessively. That's kind of where I found myself, however. It goes beyond merely stuff that is specific to the time, and that you might need to pay close attention to understand(and that's essentially fine, this is 72 years old). At times funny(the humor is sit-com\/screwball in nature), this tries too hard, *a lot*. The Brits obsessed with cricket made me chuckle... the first couple of times. Several main characters are obnoxious, particularly the male lead. That has to do with the rampant sexism; I realize it was common when this was made, but it's fairly intolerable. The same goes for the terrible xenophobia and egocentricity. Can this please decide on whether the fictional and ridiculously negatively presented European village is German or Italian? I gotta admit, all of that made this difficult to sit through, and it would appear that the subtitle guy sides with me on that. The acting is quite good. This is genuinely creepy, and Hitchcock's undeniable, immense talent is visible some in this, and the editing can be excellent. The dialog has its moments. This consists so much of one sequence after another of the people who think something's up not being believed by anyone else. There is a little mild violence in this. The DVD is one of the only I've seen that doesn't even have scene selection. I recommend this to big fans of its director or of other films of the period. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 June 2010","score":"","review":" A young woman appears to be the only passenger travelling on a train who remembers an elderly lady that seems to have disappeared.
