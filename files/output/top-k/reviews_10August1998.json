It has  every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant  script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad  performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately  uplifting story.Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from  first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's  (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime.  This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever  captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in  the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red  (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to  develop.This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue  spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie  are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen  performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no  other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman  also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while  playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a  quiet dignity for his character. The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never  over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the  prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks,  who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con  who's sad journey the film details.There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit  first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is  a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!,  he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be  made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but  perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red  sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing  short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely  not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.***** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 1998","score":"8 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time.
