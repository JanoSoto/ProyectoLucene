This grand and imaginative film makes a profound moralistic statement about the consequences of tampering with nature. As to the source, this famous novel was inspired by a real life dream and created by Shelley at the surprisingly young age of 19.

This became the most famous role of his career. Legendary makeup genius Frank Pierce created an inspired monster with attention to detail, definitely an important detail in the film's success.One odd thing about the film, is that the village in the story appears to be Germany, though the original novel was written in England and director James Whale is English. The characters in the story are all recognizably English. Whale uses painted backgrounds along with imaginative sets to tell his version of Frankenstein.

The film continues the unfinished story of the first film, where Dr. Frankenstein is persuaded to create a mate for his monster. Director Whale decided to use the sequel to complete the telling of the original novel of 1818.One difference, compared to it's predecessor, is the film has a music soundtrack. Frank Waxman's music score is majestic, dark and convincing. Sound quality is impressive for it's time and was nominated for an Oscar. Legendary makeup artist Frank Pierce delivers the same excellent style and technique with the monster, now with some added details. The monster speaks for the first time in this film. The monster's mate, or bride, is classically inspired by the Egyptian queen Nefertiti. The bride of the monster, masterfully created by Frank Pierce, has become as iconic as the monster and Boris Karloff's performance is again compassionate and sensitive, a portrayal of a man misunderstood and feared. The prologue of the film is masterfully done. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, her husband and friend are together inside an elegant mansion at night while a thunderstorm rages outside. It's believed that Shelley, along with some literary friends, brainstormed the idea of Frankenstein during a thunderstorm one night. This circumstance and a dream resulted in the creation of one of the most famous and respected horror novels of all time.Of special note are three acting performances. 19 year old Valerie Hobson, replacing the original actress portraying Dr. Baron Frankenstein's finance' gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernest Thesinger and Uma O'Connor give impressive, memorable dark and comic performances, respectively.The creation sequence of the monster's mate recreates the same majesty and power of the original 1931 film, this time with the help of Waxman's excellent music score. Though on screen for only about five minutes, the appearance of the monster's mate, as the bride of Frankenstein, near the end of the film, is especially powerful and memorable, becoming iconic over the years since the film's release. Along with the creation sequence, it adds up to roughly ten minutes of great cinema.Besides the music score, what set's this film apart from it's predecessor is it's use of humor, effectively blended with horror. A difficult combination indeed, but Whale pulls it off masterfully here. Reluctant to direct a sequel, Whale approached making the film as a lark and created one of the best ever sequels in film history and in some ways, superior to it's excellent predecessor.Whale did not return to direct the third film in the Frankenstein series. By the late 30's, the magic of the early 30's horror films had faded.
