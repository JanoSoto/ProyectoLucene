When Lord Farquaad, the ruler of Duloc, exiles all the fairy-tale beings in the woods, Shrek looses his peaceful life and his home becomes a refugees camp.So, he sets to find Lord Farquaad and convince him to take the fairy-tale beings back where they belong, and leave him alone. Lord Farquaad accepts, under one condition. Shrek must first go and find the beautiful young princess Fiona, who will become Farquaad's bride. So, the big Ogre begins his quest, along with his newfound donkey friend.This is what a good movie should be. Well, this is certainly one of the few memorable animation masterpieces ever made! Yes, I said masterpieces! I loved this movie! Not only it's good with the heart and humor for everyone to see, it also has a great story, which many animation films does not.This film is a very funny movie. It has great action scenes, although it won't beat Pixar's animation. This film has its own originality. That's how much I loved this film! Of course I can't say anything about the cast, but Eddie Murphy does make this film hilarious!With anything you want in a great movie, Shrek is one of a few which should be remembered in the past. It's one of the best movies ever made and if you haven't seen it, watch it now!

This is because when in the past Beavis and Butthead were visible on TV screens, one had to wait for weeks for them to make their appearance. Now as Beavis' and Butthead's exploits have been made into a successful film and that this film Beavis and Butthead do America is available on DVD, fans and admirers of Beavis and Butthead have a reason to smile. I am throughly convinced of the fact that Beavis and Butthead do America is a true animation classic. It is so different from other animation films of the same genre like Shrek, Lion King, Cars etc as all these films were made keeping young children in mind. No one and I mean it,no one, before Mike Judge dared to make a film so unique like Beavis and Butthead do America. This film is so different from other animation films as it is the only honest depiction of what average American teenagers feel. Watch this film with your family in order to have a true laugh riot.
