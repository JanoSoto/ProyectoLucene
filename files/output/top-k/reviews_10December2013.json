When Harry Met Sally is the film that stand out against it's competitors and was able to stick with me with multiple viewings. I adore this film and the film was able to draw out certain emotions from me, which is rare in romantic comedies, that it blinds me from watching this film objectively. This is a prime example of a film that defines the genre it belongs to.Nora Ephron is regarded by some as the greatest writer for romantic-comedy\/drama films. I have not seen all of her films but so far I hold When Harry Met Sally as her magnum opus. Ephron has written a story that explores the concept of friendship between man and woman, the role of sex in relationships, and the basic construct of a man and a woman. The film examines the role of fate in love, showing that people self sabotages or be in situations that destroys relationships in order to be with the love of their life at the end of the story. The choice of having New York was a great choice as it allowed the theme of fated love to be much more effective. Dialogue in this film is a stand out because it's what drives the characters in this film, because neither characters have any strong intentions to be with the other for the bulk of the film. The dialogue, and also the strength of the actors, deliver the comedy of the film and it gets me every time because it felt natural and was also able to come off as sweet and endearing.Rob Reiner, from his first feature film This is Spinal Tap and to A Few Good Men, has made a string of very well made films and sometimes it's hard to choose which one is his best of the bunch. Reiner wanted the film to be very optimistic, which made it so accessible, and he has made something that is so natural and relatable. The film can appeal to people searching for love, allowing us to understand or think that there is a much larger work going on in finding it, or to people who have already found it. Reiner did not allow the film to really show the other people that Harry or Sally have dated and how these people are not for them, instead the director just has these characters talk to each other about it allowing the film to spend more time with these characters together. The film has the ability to have us be attached to these characters. I love that the film takes it's time with the characters', allowing them to grow and allow us to see the growth of the maturity of the relationship\/friendship and the personal maturity of these characters. I was very glad that Reiner didn't congest the film in humor and allowed it to feel organic instead, like it could come out of our own mouths too. I also adore that the film's humor is driven more by the characters and the conversations that takes place rather than the story or the use of physical humor, aside from the diner scene. The film, even in multiple viewings, doesn't lose it's genuine touch which is why it is one of my favorite films of all time.Barry Sonnenfeld as the director of photography for the film was a good choice by Reiner. Sonnenfeld was able to connect with Reiner's vision for the film capturing the relationship between these characters through a long period of time with such accessibility and optimism. Sonnenfeld wants shots to be a bit stretched out in order to get the most out of the scene and allowing the actors to feel more natural and not just act in service to the story. Because the film is focused more on it's characters rather than the environment they are in, preventing the film from feeling like flashy and pretty though at times there are a few beautiful wide shots of New York like on the winter and autumn seasons.The film is soundtrack driven rather than a score driven film and I thought this was a great decision because Reiner chose songs that keep in tone with one another and the tone of the film. The songs are usually big band type of songs which was able to project a sort of class that other films lack. This though has made a big impact on future films\/TV shows set in New York.Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal demonstrated amazing chemistry as they both look and play roles that clearly show in paper that they are meant to be together. Both actors deliver their lines so naturally that certain moments can allow us to really relate to conversations and events in our own lives. Crystal's humor may not appeal to everyone but in my opinion it really worked here, he wasn't too over the top and instead of being the center of attention on screen, he was able to share it with Ryan which supports in making the film amazing. It's nice to see Carrie Fisher do something great instead of the Star Wars franchise. Fisher has amazing comedic timing and she doesn't try to distract us from the lead characters. This also applies to Bruno Kirby who has moments that just has you laughing.When Harry Met Sally is one of the greatest of it's genre and it contains such likable leads and played by actors that are able to drive the film forward. Ephron has written an accessible and relatable script and Reiner has crafted a brilliant film that enhances the themes that drives Ephron's script. This is a film that I would recommend to everyone due to it's universal themes.

It was kinda insulting to the veterans and those who live around the tragedy event. Directed by Michael Bay, and written by Randall Wallace. It feature a story straight out of badly written soap opera romantic novel. In my opinion, it's seem like a badly written remake or reimagining of 1953's From Here to Eternity. I would love for the film to focus more on the realistic story of those soldiers who died trying to protect our country that day, than those make believe characters with an unrealistic over the top love story that has nothing to do with the real events. I know Michael Bay wanted to graphically portray the horrors of war and was not interested in primarily marketing of mixing tragedy with romance aimed for the young adult PG-13 audience, but with the success of 1997's Titanic. Michael Bay pretty much sold out, and went with the studio ideas. Still, there is a Rated R version DVD out there, if you want to see that. The story goes like this, two fighter pilots, Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) are both under the command of Major Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin). Rafe happens to have an Army Nurse girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) who he loved, but based on what we see on screen, seem to rather spent time away from her and mistreat her. Rafe go off to fight in RAF outfit for American pilots to fight during the Battle of Britain and presumed killed in action. Meanwhile, Danny, Evelyn and the rest of their fellow pilots and nurses are transferred to Pearl Harbor, as Danny and Evelyn move on. Both fall in love with each other, until Rafe return making it a love triangle. The love triangle is god awful trite and how they solved the rush love story wasn't the greatest ending at all. It had cop out end to the film. It wasn't until ¾ in the film, that 'Pearl Harbor' the movie really became about the Pearl Harbor attacks by the Japanese Empire. I do have to say, the Pearl Harbor attack scenes were very well done, action pack while giving the emotional trauma of that day. Still, there were some historic inaccuracy and major factual misrepresentation of the facts in such things like the Doolittle Raids and how Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr) should be portrayed. Like many historical dramas, Pearl Harbor provoked debate about the artistic license taken by its producers and director. The biggest is the use of fictional replacements for real people. One of the biggest faults is replacing the real pilots, George Welch and Kenneth M. Taylor with the two leads played by Affleck and Hartnett who took to the skies during the Japanese attack and, together, claimed six Japanese aircraft. The pilots could be more realistic in tone, if the film didn't take great liberties on making them look a silly caricature of what romantic movies think military pilots should look like. Not only do they endanger their airplanes, and themselves playing a game of chicken, but they are allow to take citizen on war planes to see sunsets over the harbor and afterwards have sex in the parachute hangar. Plus, they are dyslexic and one is squinty all the time. Excuse me, if I did that. I would be in jail and no way, a pilot! I do have to say, the portrayal of the Japanese were pretty well done. I see no faults in that. All the supporting actors were very good. Mako Iwamatsu and Dan Aykroyd were interesting. I have to say, Jon Voight as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the closest thing to FDR coming back alive. Another thing good about the movie was the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, and the song by Faith Hill, 'There You'll be. In my opinion, there is no way to have a throwback World War II movie like the pre-Saving Private Ryan old days. Yes, the movie is full of war movie clichés, some good, some stale. America patriotism was written all over the film, like we single-handed won the war by ourselves. I didn't mind it, yes it somewhat true. I don't have that much of a quarrel with the idea of framing a standard romance between fictional characters with true historical events like other WWII drama like 1996's English Patient or From Here to Eternity is a fine film set on Oahu during the months leading up to Dec. 7, 1941. Still, it's not a good idea. Overall It wasn't the worst war movie ever. There are better movies set during the Pearl Harbor attack that better serve the public. Go watch a few documentaries, if not watch 1970's Tora! Tora! Tora! As it turns out, this disaster flick is both bomb and was the da bomb in the box office.

A decade later, now going by the name Ardeth Bey, the mummy seeks the reincarnation of his lost love (Zita Johann). This is one of the great horror classics from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Mummy is very different from the cliché image people have of it today. The bandage-wrapped mummy slowly shuffling through the dark towards his victim would come largely from the later Universal series. There is one short but unforgettable scene at the beginning of this film that features the iconic mummy. The image of the mummy gradually opening his eyes is a classic. This scene is the highlight of the film for many, showcasing makeup artist Jack Pierce's genius. The makeup holds up even by today's standards and outshines anything we have been able to do with computer imagery.The script is heavily influenced by Dracula, which was released the previous year. The screenwriter, John L. Balderston, had written the stage play that Universal's Dracula film was based upon. It also has the cinematographer of Dracula, Karl Freund, as the director. It even features a couple of notable cast members from Dracula Edward Van Sloan and David Manners. I actually find it to be a superior film to Dracula in many ways. Freund's direction is better than Tod Browning's for starters. The stagey elements are gone. The story is very good. Unlike many future Mummy movies, both at Universal and later Hammer, the focus is not on a monster that kills people. Instead the focus is on slowly building a sinister mood. It's an atmospheric picture, as all the truly great horror films are. The Egyptian visuals and mythology add something extra to the ambiance of the film. It must have been especially intriguing to audiences in 1932.Boris Karloff, with his trademark voice and manner, gives a subtle, ominous performance as Imhotep\/Ardeth Bey. It's a legendary performance by one of the icons of horror. The scenes of Imhotep's evil eyes glowing in closeups or the eerie scene where he chants over a scroll by candlelight are the stuff of legend. Zita Johann does quite well, as do the aforementioned Van Sloan and Manners. Plus Arthur Byron and a memorable turn by Bramwell Fletcher as the man who actually revives the mummy (He went for a little walk!).I love this movie. I love Universal horror films in general but this is one of the jewels in the crown. The acting, directing, writing, and makeup are all excellent for the period. I would encourage everybody to try these classic films out. I realize not everyone can enjoy older films and I think that's a shame.

It's an underrated movie, which at times loses it's punch, but it becomes such an engrossing movie that gets with the times. It's set around a big computer organization, where everything's not black and white. We have a beautiful high priced girl\/mistress, who's been accidentally strangled, or was she murdered, while engaged in a session of rough sex that got out of control. All evidence, instantly points towards Eddie Sakamoto, the son of the original owner of the business, I think, as he was in a relationship with the dead lass, and they had argued at the start while singing Don't fence me in at karaoke, where she just stormed out, where he gives chase. The exterior trick shot, outside the bar where the sports car is made to look really small as it takes off, outside the park, was a cool shot on Kaufman's part (this is the dude that made The Wanderers). Enter Connery, a cop was a mysterious past and Snipes who's assigned with him. The teaming up of these two is interesting. Like the Seagal characters, Connery's here is kept pretty secretive, as if almost boxed up. He's flawlessly great, disposing of tight situations, with a hand to the throat, when muscle bound geezers, give him trouble. We learn too about Snipes's background some, but this film really opens our eyes, to the deception in computer graphics, and the falsity of misrepresenting images, where's Eddie's may of been planted, preferably by the killer and his goons, possible employees of the business. RS is a nice cool mixture with the just the right of amount of sex, (it's hot, especially, naked sushi scene, much alike to the one in the dreaded, Showdown in Little Tokyo). There's nice looking broads, and some action, but on the surface, it's a drama thriller, but it's a very good drama thriller, right to the end, that has you wondering, if the supposed killer that dies at the end, is really our guy. These thrillers, who's victim is killed right at the start (Saigon, Basic Instinct) where the rest of the movie you're left to guess the killer, I love. RS has it all, = one big surprise, plus some of those great actors from Reservoir Dogs, Buscemi, playing a pussy character in this too. We even have a car chase, where at Snipes request, these homeboys stall these not so happy Asians. The interrogation scenes with Snipes, the interrogated set in before or after scenario's, I liked too which really gave it an interesting and serious angle. These after scenarios could have you thinking they took place after the end of the story, which is rather cool. After all poor Snipes has got enough personal problems. Also we have same real racial hatred going, thanks to a conflict of opinions, and ill favour. Don't believe the bad hype on this. Rent it today.

It's an underrated movie, which at times loses it's punch, but it becomes such an engrossing movie that gets with the times. It's set around a big computer organization, where everything's not black and white. We have a beautiful high priced girl\/mistress, who's been accidentally strangled, or was she murdered, while engaged in a session of rough sex that got out of control. All evidence, instantly points towards Eddie Sakamoto, the son of the original owner of the business, I think, as he was in a relationship with the dead lass, and they had argued at the start while singing Don't fence me in at karaoke, where she just stormed out, where he gives chase. The exterior trick shot, outside the bar where the sports car is made to look really small as it takes off, outside the park, was a cool shot on Kaufman's part (this is the dude that made The Wanderers). Enter Connery, a cop was a mysterious past and Snipes who's assigned with him. The teaming up of these two is interesting. Like the Seagal characters, Connery's here is kept pretty secretive, as if almost boxed up. He's flawlessly great, disposing of tight situations, with a hand to the throat, when muscle bound geezers, give him trouble. We learn too about Snipes's background some, but this film really opens our eyes, to the deception in computer graphics, and the falsity of misrepresenting images, where's Eddie's may of been planted, preferably by the killer and his goons, possible employees of the business. RS is a nice cool mixture with the just the right of amount of sex, (it's hot, especially, naked sushi scene, much alike to the one in the dreaded, Showdown in Little Tokyo). There's nice looking broads, and some action, but on the surface, it's a drama thriller, but it's a very good drama thriller, right to the end, that has you wondering, if the supposed killer that dies at the end, is really our guy. These thrillers, who's victim is killed right at the start (Saigon, Basic Instinct) where the rest of the movie you're left to guess the killer, I love.

Michael was pretending all time that he was a man by being the best in killing deers, which may represents 'killing his repressed homosexuality'. This happened before the war.

Nicki also has a gay side, he is the other who takes 'killimg dears' very serious, and definitely liked Michael as a lover, but he don't how to deal with it. This 'homossexual' side in Michael always left him uncomfortable, we can see how closed and cautious he is in relation to other people. He don't understand why he has this 'homo' side, so this is why his behavior is likely shy when he is with other people.After the war, he understands that he can't kill the deers anymore. This represents a transformation on his life, he is not repressing his feelings anymore. He starts to accept what he is.This also explain why people are so embarrassed when they are talking to him in the ending of the film.

So where do I begin...Alien 3 is what we call a beautiful mess, its beautiful but its a mess.So let me attempt appeal to the jury of haters by shedding light on this movie's hellish production. The movie was abused at the birth of its concept to the adolescence of its choppy final edit. Fox studios went off on a node cycling and terminating through eight directors, pitching stupid concepts and premises from cow aliens to armies of queen aliens fighting armies of powerloaders. Huge sets were built and torn down when the script changed. Since Fox officials and producers couldn't settle their creative differences on a decent plot they ordered filming commence without a script even being composed, probably one the most insane filmmaking decisions in history. David Fincher (Se7en,Fight Club, Girl With the dragon tattoo remake, the social network) yea that talented guy, this was his film debut as a movie director and Fox had him writing the script while filming. The list of doomings goes on. The insanity of making the film and fighting with Giler at Pinewood must have been traumatic for Fincher because he refuses to talk about the experience and has since isolated himself from having anything to do with the project, one can only speculate what kind of antics Fox kept him from disclosing, in the end it was Fox who treated the film as an article of commerce prior its release. The movie was edited with a few deep abrasions after going millions over budget (the team behind the assembly cut had said how they had found whole entire rooms full of discarded alien 3 footage from script rewrites and filmmaking insanity.)The controversy of what's good and bad with the film is nauseating and for the most part the opinions are mixed, either you absolutely love this film or infinitely hate the seed that spawned its existence. The film has quite a few continuity errors starting right in the very beginning, pointing out the magic egg, a bad screen writer put it there, it honestly appears on the sulacco for no reason. The movie also makes a (debatably)brave move to arbitrarily kill Newt, and Hicks off screen and recycle Bishop, the reason why a lot of attached Aliens fans curse this movie. Alien 3 is dark, beautifully dark, from the twin sunned trashy refinery wasteland that is the prison complex to the golden brown tunnels, low camera angles, and Elliot Goldenthal's beautiful score is all part of Fincher's style that aesthetically and artistically is done so well, its a void of embellished depression. The scene where Ripley discovers the alien queen on the cat scan was a truly amazing scene Sigourney Weaver's acting was superb and so was Charles Dutton and the rest of the cast. Bald Ripley was interesting to see, a kind of a cancer\/aids metaphor. The killing of Newt and Hicks (though I'd like to imagine them in this movie alive) tones out the mood of the film and adds some hard hitting drama, I guess people must have forget that the entire chemistry of the first alien is dark as hell why complain about that here. It goes back to the essence of the first film. Aside from the guy in the suit the alien is composed of some rod puppetry optically composited into the film not cgi, a few scenes in particular just look awesome but I do admit one or two of alien effects didn't look so great in the Pete Postlewaite chase scene. I recall this got an Oscar nomination for best visuals, yet everyone ironically complains about them? For some Alien 3 just puts you in a place you really don't want to be in, having the disturbing opportunity to actually see an alien eat a guys chest out or being reminded that rusty prisons in deep space make cancer metaphors suck even more. But for others its cinematically awesome especially if you're an alien fan. For me this one is a love hate relationship, I absolutely love the movie and everything that it is, but I absolutely hate the fact that its production left it unfinished and Newt, Hicks and Bishop not being present but yet I love how their deaths tone out the film, but then I think of the atrocity it spawned after that was alien resurrection. Many people who watch the assembly cut end up liking it better but really the special edition just drags on and is notably spliced with old footage filled with unfinished affects, and a dead bull.If we failed to do one thing in this film, and we failed to do many things, it was to take people out of their everyday lives. It's not a scary scare movie but a queasy scare movie and I think people resent that. Actually, my dentist, as he was drilling my teeth, was giving me his thesis on the things wrong with this film and he said, 'When you go out of this movie you haven't gotten away from Aids, you haven't gotten away from race riots, you haven't gotten away from fear of other cultures.'

The back-story to the Blair Witch is uninteresting and stupid, and this only sets up the film to fail.The actors are so incredibly annoying, myself and my friends frequently sighed in exhaustion for one of them to die just so we wouldn't have to hear their voices anymore. Not one of the three main characters are like-able, in fact all of them are nothing more than three confrontational idiots who are just begging for death. Like seriously, Mike decides that while him and his friends (I quote friends because all they do is bitch and moan at each other) are lost the best solution is to throw away the map. His explanation? It wasn't doing them any good the previous day. Are you for real? That is the stupidest thing I have witnessed in a film in a long time. The camera-work is so shoddy even student filmmakers would laugh it off as a 48hour film challenge gone wrong. Large portions of the film are either so blurry and shaky what is going on is a mystery, or completely black. And no, this doesn't add to the suspense, it just adds to your irritation at the whole stupid affair. I get that it was supposed to look amateur, but really, a monkey could film better quality shots. The main sin of the film though? It is just not scary. Even the final scene in the house is so poorly filmed and uninspiring that I ended up laughing it off. The image of Mike standing in the corner at the end is no more scary than the evil piles of rocks that are used to intimidate the characters throughout the film.

Though i think it complicates way too much for the introduction of the story,with all that weird editing quickly intercalating the events on the life of Marko Ramius(interpreted by Sean Connery) with the life of Jack Ryan(interpreted by Alec Baldwin, in the supporting role). I found it kinda weird and unnecessary, and may confuse those who are not so focused in the film. The rest of the character development is also obscure, it don't explains why Marko Ramius was doing the desertion, in the first place, and i don't see any reasons of why he didn't. It would just add to the film, and when they were about five minutes to end the film that they are really the good guys, and then, just when becomes absolutely unnecessary, he explains why he did it and it was the worst explanation for treason ever.

Astonishingly it is a serious drama, with a lighter tone. The film showcases the dilemma of a family whose daughter arrives announced with a 'Colored' man and tells them that she plans to marry him. This starts a set of troubling questions to all involved, except the girl. The father worries about the inter-racial marriage and the consequent problems; the mother is worried about her husband disapproving of their daughter's choice and making their daughter unhappy; the man in question, beautifully played by Sidney Poitier, decides not to marry his love if her parents disapprove of this match; His father worries about his son getting into a whole lot of trouble marrying a 'White' girl. So they all debate, discuss, convince each other over a period of a day up until Dinner, when it all ends well.The strength of the movie is not to overdramatize the sensitive issue of the 'race difference'.

But much of the enjoyment of this film is in the character studies. It so nicely gives us a look at several people and their Welshness. I can't say how folks from Wales may like the depictions; but they are curious, warm, friendly, and very real people shown in this film. All the acting is first-rate. Colm Meany and Kenneth Griffith play wonderfully off each other as pub-owner Morgan the Goat and Reverend Jones, respectively. Hugh Grant is very good in one of his most laid back comedy roles &#x96; here as a naturally shy young veteran from WW I. Tara Fitzgerald is very good as Betty. The rest of the cast make up a wonderful variety of different, if not eccentric, characters. This is not a comedy of rip-roaring laughter. It isn't loaded with sight-gags, or witty one-liners. There are a few clever lines, but the comedy of this film is in the everyday lives of the people of this Welsh community, and in the cunning to rouse the community to deal with a mountain of a problem. It is a very clean film, suitable for all ages and audiences. As many others have noted, it's a comedy of warmth that makes one feel good at its end. This film isn't for modern movie-goers who must have a constant flow of adrenalin. Or maybe it is &#x96; to help slow them down so they can learn to smell the roses along the way. Regarding the town's problem, it's interesting that there don't seem to be any real set standards for designation of mountains versus hills. The sources I checked seem to agree that the difference is more in the degree of steepness, rather than actual height. Funny though, that the 1,000-foot mark of distinction seemed to come from the U.S., where the British favored more a 2,000-foot mark. The outside scenes of this movie were filmed at Gyrn Moelfre, a hill or mountain in northeast Wales near the border with England. It has an elevation of 1,716 feet above sea level. But it rises just 778 feet above the surrounding terrain. The movie shows people climbing the hill on a trail with switchbacks. Indeed, climbing any hill of good size gives one the feel of having scaled a small mountain.

But it rises just 778 feet above the surrounding terrain. The movie shows people climbing the hill on a trail with switchbacks. Indeed, climbing any hill of good size gives one the feel of having scaled a small mountain.

I just add my praise to that of a few other reviewers who saw much more than the gentle comedy in The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill &#x85; The movie was filmed in Wales, and gives us some nice scenic shots of the countryside, with the mountain\/hill. But much of the enjoyment of this film is in the character studies. It so nicely gives us a look at several people and their Welshness. I can't say how folks from Wales may like the depictions; but they are curious, warm, friendly, and very real people shown in this film. All the acting is first-rate. Colm Meany and Kenneth Griffith play wonderfully off each other as pub-owner Morgan the Goat and Reverend Jones, respectively. Hugh Grant is very good in one of his most laid back comedy roles &#x96; here as a naturally shy young veteran from WW I. Tara Fitzgerald is very good as Betty. The rest of the cast make up a wonderful variety of different, if not eccentric, characters. This is not a comedy of rip-roaring laughter. It isn't loaded with sight-gags, or witty one-liners. There are a few clever lines, but the comedy of this film is in the everyday lives of the people of this Welsh community, and in the cunning to rouse the community to deal with a mountain of a problem. It is a very clean film, suitable for all ages and audiences. As many others have noted, it's a comedy of warmth that makes one feel good at its end. This film isn't for modern movie-goers who must have a constant flow of adrenalin. Or maybe it is &#x96; to help slow them down so they can learn to smell the roses along the way. Regarding the town's problem, it's interesting that there don't seem to be any real set standards for designation of mountains versus hills. The sources I checked seem to agree that the difference is more in the degree of steepness, rather than actual height.
