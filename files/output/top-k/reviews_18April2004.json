It kept me interested, because I enjoy watching murder-mysteries, but there isn't really much about this movie that is all that unique.  Past reviewers have correctly noted that it's formulaic and uses plenty of clichés.  However, the movie is unique in the way that we know who the killers are from the get-go, and we see how the detectives try to solve the case.I particularly found the interrogation scene to be interesting, as it is something I learned in my Business & Society class in a case called the Prisoner's Dilemma.  In fact, maybe I should tell my professor to show that clip when he discusses that case.  Hmmmmm.Anyways, I'm getting off-topic.  Like I've said, this is just a so-so movie.  The acting is good, with Sandra Bullock playing a talented detective with a secretive past.  However, the actors that stole the show are Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling, who played the teens that plotted the murder.  They probably have bright futures ahead of them in the movie world.So overall, Murder by Numbers isn't necessarily bad, but it's definitely not a must-see movie.  If you happen to come across it and have some time to kill, by all means, watch it.  However, if you are looking for a great murder-mystery, I highly suggest checking out Seven.My IMDb Rating 7\/10.

A movie that has weird characters, an outlandish story, and just a weird overtone to it that you can't really help but like. Bulworth is one of those movies. Written by, directed by, and starring Warren Beatty, it's a genius invention of government and human nature. Although released six years ago, it could have become dated, but it still remains potent today.Senator Jay Billington Bulworth (Beatty) has decided he's fed up with the world and puts a contract on himself for someone to kill him. Because he has only a few days to live, he goes out like a bull in a china shop, not caring what he says, because soon he'll be dead. However, he feels good about going out on a streak of honesty, and decides he wants to live. He a) falls in love with a random woman named Nina (Halle Berry), b) has to find out who was going to kill him so he can stop it, c) continue his new, successful campaign of honesty, and d) rap everything he says.Before watching Bulworth, I was worried. From what I'd read previously, the plot sounded hilarious, but I feared that the movie would have a great plot and not go anywhere with it. I was wrong. Bulworth went in all directions, including some I wouldn't have been able to guess. One mistake, though, was being billed as a comedy. Unless it's like a Shakespearean comedy (where it's exactly like a tragedy except most people don't die at the end), it wasn't funny at all. The character of Bulworth was endearing, though, making him an interesting and entertaining character, one that makes the movie interesting.However, seeing Bulworth become more and more less like a normal politician, there's nothing more entertaining. This political satire is biting, and speaking the truth, too. It's movie like this that need to be seen. They may not appeal to everyone, but it's entertaining and has some of the best political satire ever put to film.My rating 8\/10Rated R for language.

It is a moving story about a boy on the verge of manhood. It's also about a woman trying to survive in a world surrounded by lustful males and and their jealous, gossiping wives and mothers. The first story is told lyrically and masterfully. The second story -- well, we see the woman's story only through the eyes of the boy. A boy who loves the woman from afar and gains revenge on the woman's critics by spitting in their drinks and peeing in their handbags. I suppose that the boy couldn't do more for his beloved because of his youth the film shows several times how he is ignored by the adults, and like Malena, oppressed by them as well. His writing the letter defending her does lead to her reunion with her husband and her acceptance by the townspeople at the end of the movie.The film is very much a cross between Summer of 42 and Portnoy's Complaint. The scenes showing the boy's budding sexuality emerging and his family's horrified reactions are hilarious and the strongest moments in the movie. But I wanted to see more of the woman's story.

I don't find the film offensive, but I have to say Malena would be a very different movie told from her point of view. For one thing, she is completely unaware of the boy who tells her story.

Using the chest as a serving surface for the food, Brandon gleefully drops morbid clues throughout the night and he is pleased as all the guests leave none the wiser.  With Phillip's nerves totally frayed, Brandon rests on his laurels - until the pairs' old school master Rupert returns to find a misplaced cigarette case.It has been many years since I first saw this film and I could barely remember what I thought about it and thus decided to watch it again last week.  From the start of the film things look good as it appears to be setting up an excellent cat and mouse game.  However after the party things fail to really ignite in the way that they needed to and the end result is a rather wordy story that fails to create genuine tension.  This is a real shame as the potential was definitely there from the party scene.  Part of the problem may have been that Hitchcock was more concerned about the technical aspect of the film than the script.  This is not to downplay the wonderful effect of the long shots he uses and the way that he moves the camera around the set with ease and fluidity but such attention should have been put on the other aspects as well.I understand what Hitchcock was trying to do with the technical aspects of the film but I don't understand why he didn't just accept that he would have to make do with 10 different shots instead of trying to hide the edit. Each time he does it by zooming in on a black jacket and then pulling out again after the edit.  I was still impressed by the flow that the long shots brought to the film.  Dall is not an easy to understand character but he gives a good performance as a man that is so arrogant that you keep watching to see his fall.  Granger is more subtle and his fraying nerves are well conveyed during the party.  Stewart is good but he really needed more material to work with in the final third of the film - the section where he really needed to bring things to boiling point.Overall this is a reasonable film but it can't manage to deliver in the final act.  The plot is a little difficult to swallow but that wouldn't have mattered if the tension had been better developed and delivered.  The cast try hard and do reasonably well but the final act of the film really just sputters out when it should ignite into flames.

However after the party things fail to really ignite in the way that they needed to and the end result is a rather wordy story that fails to create genuine tension.  This is a real shame as the potential was definitely there from the party scene.  Part of the problem may have been that Hitchcock was more concerned about the technical aspect of the film than the script.  This is not to downplay the wonderful effect of the long shots he uses and the way that he moves the camera around the set with ease and fluidity but such attention should have been put on the other aspects as well.I understand what Hitchcock was trying to do with the technical aspects of the film but I don't understand why he didn't just accept that he would have to make do with 10 different shots instead of trying to hide the edit. Each time he does it by zooming in on a black jacket and then pulling out again after the edit.  I was still impressed by the flow that the long shots brought to the film.  Dall is not an easy to understand character but he gives a good performance as a man that is so arrogant that you keep watching to see his fall.  Granger is more subtle and his fraying nerves are well conveyed during the party.  Stewart is good but he really needed more material to work with in the final third of the film - the section where he really needed to bring things to boiling point.Overall this is a reasonable film but it can't manage to deliver in the final act.  The plot is a little difficult to swallow but that wouldn't have mattered if the tension had been better developed and delivered.  The cast try hard and do reasonably well but the final act of the film really just sputters out when it should ignite into flames.  Hitchcock was experimenting with this film and I'm sure it helped his technical prowess but that doesn't make it an enjoyable film.

That's the beginning of the refrain Hear Me, Feel Me, Touch Me, Heal Me (until he no longer needs it.)At a Christmas party, already full of some of Russell's palette of horrible garish colours, Nora(Ann-Margret) scream-sings I believe in love, but how can men who've never seen light be enlightened. This is not entirely honest, of course, because Tommy had been able to see for a few years.As she accompanies his healing moment, Nora, a ravishing mother if ever there was one, sings to the opening-up of Tommy You're rich, but it's so absurd....to try to explain the things you've done.As his success grows (not merely from pinball anymore) Tommy (Roger Daltrey) sings Come to my house, be one of the comfortable people...We're drinkin' all night and never sleepin'...These kinds of lyrics are not that easy to find song-music for, so they are reserved for the recitatives.You get some real rhymes for the great songs like Pinball Wizard that is lavishly produced with Elton John singingSince I was a young boy, I played the silver ball, From Soho down to Brighton I must have played them all I've seen nothing like him in any amusement hall That deaf, dumb and blind kid SHO' PLAYS A MEAN PINBALL.Of course, everybody knows that...and it's pretty thrilling every time.Equal to it is Tina Turner's fabulous star turn as I'm a Gypsy Acid Queen, in which all the stops are pulled out. This is one of the great musical numbers in movies, with her face and body as expressive as her voice, working overtime to evoke a high-powered prostitute-junkie.There are Rex Beans (like pork and beans) coming through the television for Ann-Margret to have to deal with by wallowing in--and here is one of the prime examples of Russell's hilarious love for mud, vomit and feces colours that remind one of similar predilections in 'The Devils' and 'The Music Lovers.'It looks indeed quite nasty, but, as always, Ann-Margret is quite the trouper and never seems to let it go to her head what a great actress she is. And Nora does a lot of back-and-forth (during the period in which the fame is purely from Olfactory Pinball that has stunned the world) between a guilty conscience about how Tommy has provided her with all of this and just going ahead and indulging in all the champagne and pink feathers and posters of herself in her own room she can muster.The opera and movie drag one through them, as one hypnotic bombardment after another is introduced. The movie goes fast, you cannot easily stop watching it even after several viewings because of how smoothly one seemingly totally opposed scene is modulated into another.Jack Nicholson has a small role as a quack doctor Tommy has been taken to. He is the third man we see Nora dancing cheek-to-cheek with--a curious bit of serialization--and Ann-Margret always wears that quiet, pleased look at such times. I think that is Jack actually singing, because there is no need to use a dubbed voice like that.This film is wonderful, there's nothing like Russell's energy when it is somewhat under control--and The Who made the one truly great rock opera. Andrew Lloyd Webber's attempts came nowhere near, with putrescent songs like I Don't Know How to Love Him from 'Jesus Christ Superstar.'

In particular he is a covert agent for a unit that doesn't exist that officially has done nothing but in reality gathers information and caries out missions to help with the brokering of peace.  When a freight container of dead refugees is found in America and the Chinese ambassador is assassinated, Shaw is framed and he is forced onto the run.  As Shaw attempts to clear his name, his bosses are contacted with false exposure for diplomatic crimes unless they stop the new trade agreement between the US and China.Despite the fact that this film didn't do well enough to warrant a cinema release in the UK and that professional reviews were less than complimentary about it, I was in the mood for an action thriller and decided to give it a go.  The film marks out it's attachments with reality in the first 10 minutes as it opens with a scene of espionage that would fit as well in a James Bond movie.  Once you have realised that this film is aiming for that sort of slick action-movie reality, it is easier to sit back and enjoy it. Of course, as with the genre, the plot is not up to much even if it aims for a solid thriller storyline of double crosses and action.  Sadly it creates too many holes for itself and the exaggerated action takes away from the reality that it's plot is trying to exist within.Despite this, the action scenes make it worth watching.  Just like the slick opening mission, the rest of the film continues with plenty of consistently enjoyable scenes that will please you if you are in the mood for that type of thing.  Duguay directs the whole film with the slick and polished feel that he brought to the action scenes - even though they are not original or realistic they are still quite exciting considering the plot fails to really engage.  Moments of John Woo-style standoffs are good as well as lots of running and jumping!  I watched this film on a Friday night and can only suggest that that time of the week with some friends and some beers must be the best time to watch this.As well as the action and direction, another reason this film worked for me was the presence of Wesley Snipes.  Over the past decade he has successfully turned himself into a good action star and he shows his qualities here. As with Blade, he is best when he is able to shake off the shackles of `normal' characters and play things a bit more superhero\/Bond as is the case here. He has a good charisma here that kept me with him as well as showing a nice sense of humour at points as well.  Matiko is quite cute but her character is less clear in terms of how she fits in at each stage.  She doesn't give that good a performance but the film doesn't ask very much of her - the biggest problem I had with her was that her character's name (Miss Fang) made it sound like everyone was calling her `Miss Thang' in a Ricki Lake style!  Archer is not very good and isn't used by the film well at all despite the key role of her character.  Sutherland looks about as rough as he could do - couldn't he even have brushed his hair? He makes a very unlikely Secretary General!  Tagawa is a well known face and plays his character with his usual style, while Michael Biehn is quite good and enjoyable in his action scene.Overall, this film has some topical interest as we have just found out recently that the Secretary General was spied on by the US, but that doesn't stop the plot being full of jumps in plot logic and having elements that just don't really fit.  However despite this the action is slick, from the Bond school of excitement and is helped by stylish direction from Duguay. Add to this a good centre pin in Snipes' fun performance and you have a film that is enjoyable and rather exciting if you are in the mood for a fun thriller.

I've only ever seen it when it's on television, and they refer to it as The Very Thought of You, which I find as a very inappropriate title. The other title is an improvement, though I have to admit it's a bit wordy. Other than that, I really enjoy watching this movie. I love the idea, the cute British guys, the setting, and Monica in this role. She's like a blonde Julia Roberts. Don't get me wrong, I'm not usually this approving of most movies. In fact, anyone could argue that this movie is like any other romantic comedy. Though something's different in the formula that makes this stand apart from the rest. Just don't ask me what it is...

Think you can compare all movies made about Japanese society with LIT and come up with the same similarities?  Two that come to mind, Mr. Baseball and Black Rain don't even come close.  As strange as it may seem, LIT and BNBGTJ are more closely related than it would seem on the surface.

However, the writer and director seem to be afraid to trust the audience to just get it. As a result, too much of Nicholas Cage's acting is way over the top. His ducking and flinching and wiping his brow when watching what could be a snuff reel, is not only hugely overacted, but also patronizes the audience. Then, there's the dialog. As the irredeemable punk, complete with horn hiding hairdo, Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) says to Tom Welles When you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change. The devil changes you. Wow. Timeless words of wisdom couched in marble prose, indeed. Or as Tom Welles replies Is that one of your lyrics?.The only scene that has some real acting involved, is the one between Welles and the mother Janet Matthews (Amy Morton). Anyway, just for it's subject matter, it's worth seeing at least once.

The Puerto Rican. A small-time hustler (Leguizamo) is picked out to be hunted and craziness insues. The movie itself isn't really that great, and laughable jokes are few and far between, but a small handful of one liners, and silly setups make this film worth watching, so check it during a really boring time in your life, and get amused!  Leguizamo sings one of the craziest most obnoxious songs ever known to man, and then almost kisses his mom. He gets hit on by the Nazi's son Himel, and then gets thrown up on. The Pest as everyone calls him, trips over a tricycle.                  Enjoy!
