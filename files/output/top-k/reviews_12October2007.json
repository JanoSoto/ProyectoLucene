It has a big budget, which it spends on fancy cartoonish sets and other bizarre gimmicks, for what? To make it look like a cartoon! This results into a lot of things that we could prefer seeing in a Saturday morning cartoon. But as a movie, it's pretty hard to see why this was such a favorite cartoon during the early '60's. This is one of the most ineffective and unfunny movies I've seen in a while. And if your not convinced, lets move to to the casting. Lets see, Robert De Niro as Fearless Leader and Jason Alexander and Rene Russo as his bumbling minions. Okay, now your convinced.The film uses the technique of putting animated characters in real-live settings and real actors. This was done many times since films in the 80's like WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and, recently SPACE JAM. And like SPACE JAM, although not quite as bad, ROCKY AND BULWINKLE enjoys too much with the playfulness of its cartoon characters that they forget that they're making a feature film here. So, it has not much to tell and can't even afford to make jokes that really work.The film is basically a cartoon on a live action movie (which is made just as cartoonish as the animated world). Animated evil mastermind Fearless Leader (De Niro) and his henchmen have crossed the boundaries of an animated world and arrive in our 4-dimensional world and start a TV company called RBTV, meaning Really Bad Television (how prophetic), and turn people to mindless drones with their horrible cable shows. The FBI sends a rookie agent (Perabo) to protect still-animated Rocky and Bulwinkle from being zapped, allowing the megalomaniac from ruling the world.And as the story goes, the laughs and silliness get even worse. The film hardly made me laugh, and no head-hitting, car-crashing and any other mishap to change my mind about that. They should know they're making a motion picture here, not a an episode of Bugs and Daffy (which, at least, is better than this). Despite its budget, director Des McAnuff instead spends it on silly cartoonish gimmicks that, joined in with the corny laughs (if you'd call it laughs) and embarrassed leads, it can all be summed up in a 30 minute animated feature for TV, not an 88 minute film.Still, I did find one thing that was quite bearable in this walking disaster waiting to happen, and that is the entertaining cameos. How many movies can you see well-known (and then well-known) talents like Whoppi Goldberg, John Goodman, Kenan (Thompson) and Kel (Mitchell) and Billy Crystal just to name a few. Their cameos thankfully lightens up my high criticism for the film, but that doesn't stop me from giving it a big thumbs down.Still, I won't discourage you from letting the kids see it, for it's mainly made for them and they might be the only ones who'll enjoy it.Rating * out of 5.

I first saw it at age seven(!) and I've never been that scared in a movie since. I thought for a long time afterward that the scares came from not just the film, but my age at the time. However, even in my middle age, I watch it and the hairs on the back of my neck still stand up! Conclusion it still works.Amazing how all the imitators failed to heed the reasons WHY it works so well. EXORCIST is not filmed like a horror film; it's shot like a drama. The characters aren't pretty teens running from Jason. They're the upper middle-class people who live in the nice neighborhood uptown. Half of the actors (particularly those in the mental hospital scene) look like they wandered off of a documentary. Which makes the horrific scenes of possession and poltergeist phenomena that much more believable. The actors are all very natural. Ellen Burstyn as harrowed mother\/actress, Chris MacNeill is the agnostic, audience-surrogate non-believer who is forced into a spiritual showdown of good vs. evil when her 12 yr. old daughter seems to be possessed by a demon. The signs are so subtle at first (bed-shakes, etc.), it's easy for the audience to get lulled in. After MacNeill's daughter Regan seemingly pushes film director Burke Dennings from her window, with his head turned completely around as Detective Kinderman (played by the wonderful Lee J. Cobb) puts it, Chris soon turns to a priest for help (on the advise of her stumped doctors). Enter Jason Miller as Father Karras; a young priest haunted by the recent death of his mother (which weakens his already shaky faith). After interviewing the demon within Regan, Karras seeks approval to perform an exorcism. At this point, Max von Sydow as Father Merrin arrives (bookending the film; he is in the opening prologue sequence on an Iraqi archaeological dig). Together, Karras and Merrin do battle with the demon for the last 20 or so minutes of the film and (literally) all hell breaks loose. You've no doubt seen the parodies and the rip-offs, but the exorcism scene is still one of the most powerful sequences in all of horror. Mercedes MacCambridge (as the demon 'voice') gives a heart-stopping vocal performance. But that's only part of the what this film has to offer. The build-up, the crises of faith among the leads, the potent dialogue (I tell you that thing upstairs is not my daughter!). All of these pieces fit together; adhered by a near documentary look that makes this movie feel like it could happen to anyone, anywhere. That's the true horror. It's NOT an abandoned carnival, or a dark castle, or a cemetery at night; it's a nice upscale home in Georgetown! The heroes are not shotgun-toting, bare-chested guys but two Jesuit priests! Whichever version you see (the original or the re-issue extended cut) be warned. Watch it alone, at night with the lights down, and you WILL be scared.I've seen MANY horror films in my life. Many good, many not-so-good. But EXORCIST is still the gold standard. Because at it's heart, it's a solid, well-acted drama first. That element of true drama (often missing in most horror films lately) helps you invest more emotion with the characters when the film abruptly jumps into its horror scenes! After all these years, it's still the greatest horror film EVER made. And (until someone gets it right again someday) will probably remain so for a long time.

I'm not exactly an enormous fan of Columbus because there is something sickeningly twee that seems to infect just about everything he gets his hands on. Home Alone is one of his more successful endeavours, although I tend to think that's more to John Hughes' screenplay which is full of tiny amusements rather than anything on Columbus' part.After all, this is not the first time Hughes has tackled the nightmares of holiday travel. He previously directed the quite wonderful Thanksgiving comedy Planes, Trains & Automobiles. He got a tremendous amount of mileage from what could have been a thinly plotted scenario, and enlivened the film through rich, nuanced performances from Steve Martin and John Candy. A film of equal heart and humour. A true, comedy classic.Home Alone is not quite as successful. If it had been directed by the sure hand of John Hughes instead of the simplistically banal hand of Chris Columbus, it might have elevated the film's premise to classic status. Instead, its a film of amusing diversions and interesting ideas trying to get out. But when they do, Home Alone is a very good film indeed.We really don't need to go into specifics about the plot. Home Alone had such an impact on people the world over its entered the English language. Indeed its the intriguing concept at the heart of the film that drew so many people to it in the first place. An eight year old boy, Kevin McCallister is left at home by his neglectful parents during the Christmas holidays.While they're in Paris, Kevin has free reign of the McCallister house. That must be the dream of any child. The freedom to do whatever they want. Whenever they want. No parents to hold them back. Or discipline them when they step out of line. The whole film rests on little Macaulay Culkin's shoulders. And he does quite well too.I don't think Culkin is all that much of an actor. After all he peaked at a very young age, and his career went into steady decline after that. But his obnoxious precocity wasn't quite as pronounced here. There was still a little bit of innocence left in the boy, which is what gives the film its conviction. Without it, Home Alone wouldn't work.Which is exactly the reason why Home Alone 2 didn't work. By that time, Culkin was 12 years old and his child-like innocence had long since left him. His ego had thoroughly taken over, and the film seemed a much more calculated attempt on Columbus' part to replicate the things that made the first film work so well.Hughes' quite well written screenplay puts Kevin through his paces. I enjoyed watching the shifts in little Kevin's emotions. First off is Kevin's astonishment. He wished for his family to disappear, and so they did. Well they've only gone on holiday, but to a child's mind it could seem like wish fulfilment. This leads to unbridled joy at living life on his own terms.But gradually the reality of his situation begins to sink in. This leads to loneliness, fear, and eventually horror when the McCallister mansion is targeted by two dimwitted burglars, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern).The point where Kevin must defend his home by outfitting it with booby traps from top to bottom provides one of the best sustained 15 minutes of comedy you'll ever see. I did find it hard to swallow that Kevin could come up with so many different booby traps from blowtorches to tripwires and even Micro Machines. Especially with only an hour to work with. But Columbus directs these scenes with such breathless energy it will have you laughing harder than anything else in the film.There are some smaller pleasures to be found elsewhere. The film adds an external character of a snow shoveller Kevin believes to be a mass murderer. But in a nicely written scene, he turns out to be a lonely man estranged from his family. I like this scene because it very nicely sums up Kevin's predicament. What started out as an answer to his prayers is beginning to feel more and more like a punishment. Being alone can be fun for awhile. But eventually we want it to end. Its a very overlooked scene.I also liked the scenes with Kevin's mother, played by Catherine O'Hara. Her desperately trying to get home to Kevin is pleasantly reminiscent of Planes, Trains & Automobiles. All the more so because she even ends up travelling with John Candy along the way. He plays a character not all that far removed from Del Griffith, and the interplay between the two feels natural and warm. Like PTA, Candy proves to be O'Hara's ticket home.Home Alone has its flaws here and there. But it is a reasonably polished film, and it makes you laugh at all of the right moments. It's not quite the holiday classic Planes, Trains & Automobiles was, but you're bound to find something fun about it, and kids will most definitely love it.

Without a doubt, they then scored themselves another hit with The Lion King! I was nearly eight years old when this film came into theatres, and I went to see it, which I think was the earliest theatrical movie experience I can recall, and it was a memorable experience, leading me to watch it more than once shortly after it came out on video! Rediscovering Disney recently, as with most of the others, I am still impressed with this one! A lion named Simba is born in the Pride Lands in Africa. He is the son of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, so he is destined to become the next king of the land. However, his uncle, Scar, is jealous, and develops an evil plot to kill Mufasa and Simba, so he will become King! He manages to kill his brother, and convince his nephew that it's his fault, telling him to run away and never return! As Simba leaves, Scar sends the hyenas to kill him, but the young lion manages to get away. With Mufasa dead and Simba gone (with the others convinced he is dead), Scar is the new king, and the future of the Pride Lands is bleak! Meanwhile, Simba meets a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa, and grows up with them. Could he ever be persuaded to return and save the Pride Lands?!The movie begins with a song called Circle of Life, which makes for a great intro! Several other memorable songs (sung by the characters) follow, including I Just Can't Wait to be King, Hakuna Matata, and Can You Feel the Love Tonight (a song which you hear Elton John's version of during the closing credits). Like in many other Disney films, there is a lot of humour, with several characters to provide it. In this movie's case, there's Zazu (voiced by legendary comedian Rowan Atkinson), as well as Timon and Pumbaa. Scar and the hyenas may not be quite as funny, but they provide some laughs as well. Some of the characters might be annoying at times (such as young Simba), but this isn't usually a problem. As usual, we also have excellent animation, and the story is well-written and often touching (this is not an adaptation of a story that came before it, unlike most animated Disney flicks).

I generally trust the opinions of people who do so to the extent that if they told me the sky was blue, I would look out the window and see for myself. Because no matter how you look at it, The Lawnmower Man was a film with a terrible script, based on some terrible ideas, trying to trade off the name of an author who was at the peak of his commercial success. Said author, one tall American by the name of Stephen King, liked the idea of his short story being used to bolster the bleak commercial prospects of this film so much that he took the producers to court and demanded they stopped using his name. Having read Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man for myself, I completely understand why. Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man is a surreal terror story that twists suburban convention in a manner that only Stephen King can. Brett Leonard's The Lawnmower Man has not an original or well thought out idea anywhere in its little head.Part of the problem stems from the basic story of the film. The central story involves a scientist attempting to use virtual reality to train simpler minds such as those of monkeys to perform tasks that any normal human being would regard as complex. When our bold scientist meets a man who is, to put it bluntly, quite retarded, a light goes on in his head. What if the virtual reality simulator could be used to accelerate the functioning of this gardener's brain to the point where at least nominal calculations are no longer beyond him? And therein lies one of the problems most critics never pick up on. The human brain is demonstrably more complex than an electronic board or an engine, and accelerating it or repairing it is a much more complex process than this film gives credit for. When you add to that the fact that if Albert Einstein had been born around the same time as I was, he would have been diagnosed with High-Functioning Autism, this film's conception of the difference between simple and god-like becomes very shaky indeed.Not helping matters any is the apparent lack of research or planning that permeates the screenplay. In one memorable scene, we are told by the supposedly brilliant Doctor Lawrence that Jobe has mastered the Latin alphabet in a matter of hours, whereas it took him a year. This prompts the question of who is really retarded in this scenario, given that the Latin alphabet is something every child in the English-speaking world learns between their fifth and sixth birthday. At other times, the script seems to have been written by a twelve year old who has been listening to Black Sabbath songs like Iron Man a little too closely. Jobe's proclamation about how he will take over every computer system in the world being the best example. But the worst parts come when the script paints the characters into corners that they have no possibility of escaping, so the writers shoehorn in a convenient device. The writers here clearly had no idea of what a security backdoor is or how it works in the real computing world.Fortunately, Hollywood productions tend to have at least one strength they can fall back on when all else fails. Since the Hollywood system attracts some of the best actors money can buy, it stands to reason that The Lawnmower Man would have some commendable performances in spite of the terrible screenplay. Jeff Fahey's performance as Jobe easily rings the truest in this entire film. Pretending to be retarded is enough of a challenge for an actor. Pretending to be retarded, then suddenly gifted with mental faculties that would make Newton or Tesla envious, then given over the megalomania, is quite an acrobatic act. That Fahey pulls it off so well in spite of the script he is working from is a credit to him. Pierce Brosnan is no slouch, either, even though his performance as a scientist has little to discern itself from his performance as a secret agent. Somehow, this matter-of-fact, questioning portrayal really suits the scientist a lot better. Brosnan's performance as the man wondering where he went wrong is the only real anchor this film has.Much has been made of the virtual reality environments around which some of the plot is based. In 1992, simulating a self-contained environment within a computer was a frontier, and someone in the studio obviously thought this would be a good trend to cash in on. What they did not anticipate was that computing was becoming a very monolithic market, and a lot of the fantastic dreams we had about the future of computing were about to fall by the wayside. At the same time, the ability of computers to splice funky effects into films was growing at an exponential rate. A year prior, a little film called Terminator 2 had dazzled audiences with a combination of very simple computer-generated effects and practical effects that made the villain of the piece seem almost invincible. By comparison, the attempts to convince an audience that our characters had found their way inside a computer system were so half-hearted that it left audiences wondering if this were some kind of joke. Sadly, the end result has that Ed Wood touch of broadcasting a failure to think things through.As a result, this production of The Lawnmower Man ends up being a classical one out of ten film. Film school students can look at it for examples of when an ambitious effect or series of effects are not done well.

At the same time, the ability of computers to splice funky effects into films was growing at an exponential rate. A year prior, a little film called Terminator 2 had dazzled audiences with a combination of very simple computer-generated effects and practical effects that made the villain of the piece seem almost invincible. By comparison, the attempts to convince an audience that our characters had found their way inside a computer system were so half-hearted that it left audiences wondering if this were some kind of joke. Sadly, the end result has that Ed Wood touch of broadcasting a failure to think things through.As a result, this production of The Lawnmower Man ends up being a classical one out of ten film.

I generally trust the opinions of people who do so to the extent that if they told me the sky was blue, I would look out the window and see for myself. Because no matter how you look at it, The Lawnmower Man was a film with a terrible script, based on some terrible ideas, trying to trade off the name of an author who was at the peak of his commercial success. Said author, one tall American by the name of Stephen King, liked the idea of his short story being used to bolster the bleak commercial prospects of this film so much that he took the producers to court and demanded they stopped using his name. Having read Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man for myself, I completely understand why. Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man is a surreal terror story that twists suburban convention in a manner that only Stephen King can. Brett Leonard's The Lawnmower Man has not an original or well thought out idea anywhere in its little head.Part of the problem stems from the basic story of the film. The central story involves a scientist attempting to use virtual reality to train simpler minds such as those of monkeys to perform tasks that any normal human being would regard as complex. When our bold scientist meets a man who is, to put it bluntly, quite retarded, a light goes on in his head. What if the virtual reality simulator could be used to accelerate the functioning of this gardener's brain to the point where at least nominal calculations are no longer beyond him? And therein lies one of the problems most critics never pick up on. The human brain is demonstrably more complex than an electronic board or an engine, and accelerating it or repairing it is a much more complex process than this film gives credit for. When you add to that the fact that if Albert Einstein had been born around the same time as I was, he would have been diagnosed with High-Functioning Autism, this film's conception of the difference between simple and god-like becomes very shaky indeed.Not helping matters any is the apparent lack of research or planning that permeates the screenplay. In one memorable scene, we are told by the supposedly brilliant Doctor Lawrence that Jobe has mastered the Latin alphabet in a matter of hours, whereas it took him a year. This prompts the question of who is really retarded in this scenario, given that the Latin alphabet is something every child in the English-speaking world learns between their fifth and sixth birthday. At other times, the script seems to have been written by a twelve year old who has been listening to Black Sabbath songs like Iron Man a little too closely. Jobe's proclamation about how he will take over every computer system in the world being the best example.

Elvis Presley, playing Chad Gates, was a little wooden with his acting but I heard from a friend that the director just wanted Presley to play himself. Joan Blackman, playing Maile Duval, was just a lot of fun and a good actress. The scene where the motorcycle cop catches up to her on a highway in Hawaii and starts to bawl her out for speeding, like a number of times before, and then changes his mind when, his friend, Maile, tells him that her boyfriend is coming home from the Army, is charming. The motorcycle cop gives Maile an escort (including siren) to the airport to pick up Chad Gates. And when Chad Gates tries to make Maile jealous when Chad is getting off the plane, by kissing the stewardess, that was funny and charming. Another charming moment is when Chad and Maile are making out on the beach and a little Hawaiian boy comes up to them and asks them if he can play the game and when Chad tells the little boy he's too young, the little boy is persistent and asks Chad if he can play if he can get a little girl to play the game with him. My girlfriend especially likes the music box scene where Chad Gates, played by Elvis Presley, sings I Can't Help Falling in Love with You to Maile's grandmother. We own the DVD of Blue Hawaii and I use the scene selection to get to that scene and my girlfriend and I watch that chapter over and over again. Angela Landsbury, playing Chad Gate's mother is enjoyable and she's a good actress. Jennie Maxwell, playing Ellie Corbett was a thoroughly enjoyable over-sexed brat. My girlfriend always says, What a brat! when she sees Jennie Maxwell in this film. When Chad Gates gives Ellie Corbett a spanking on the beach at night, it's both funny and a little sexy, as far as I'm concerned. The spanking straightens Ellie out and she's more manageable the rest of the film.

I used to run them as a double feature at my seaside cinema in the 80s and they always were attended by a growing number of appreciative fans who often brought new admirers along....great word of mouth successes. in Australia most Woody Allen films of the 70s and 80s were quite popular (until the terrible SHADOWS AND FOG and the stupid MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY and don't get me started on the mind numbing drivel of his latest London effort with Scarlet Johanssen SCOOP............) and in the 80s at Orion Pictures he seemed to strike a new high in critical and popular successes. I am very surprised to research here and find that this film was 'obscure'... as it is not in Australia. This film and RADIO DAYS were big hits, so I am pleased to say I did my bit as a cinema owner then to help this happen. CAIRO really is a valentine to the moviegoer, and with Mia Farrow perfect as the downtrodden unhappy Cecelia, in a location and town so perfectly realised as well... a bittersweet reality bite with a hilarious RKO society adventure as the pivotal picture at the lovely little Jewel Theatre. If you see the 1932 RKO film MUMMY'S BOYS you will get the PURPLE ROSE for real, even if that film is a very silly comedy with Wheeler and Wolseley. In CAIRO the atmosphere and characters are quite well realised for my affectionate tastes but the real stars of the film to me are the production designers and Allen's hilarious and sad storyline. The idea of the film talking back itself and the movie actors noticing the audience... hilarious! and the chaos that ensues.... all of it is just ideal for my tastes. Along with RADIO DAYS and SWEET AND LOWDOWN and possibly MATCH POINT, CAIRO makes a perfect set of films. The scene with Cecelia looking wistful at the Astaire Rogers film is perhaps one of the great acting moments on film. Her face subtly changing from sad bewilderment to becoming absorbed in the new film is an emotional high only bettered by the fact that she puts her ukulele on the seat next to her; she realises she isn't going anywhere and this new film might just be all right anyway. I think I just sob every time I see that scene. Perfect.

Instead, they are generously taught to embrace the inward appearance of people, in this case the spirit of John Merrick, and to treat him with just as much respect as a normal person would be treated. In short, it is a film that hones in on the importance of observing internal rather than external beauty.Director David Lynch sets a specific standard by asking the viewer to consider an important idea Learn to analyze a human life in complete context of who they are before casting judgment. How could this be done? The subtext of the film asks the viewer to seek to understand what they do not understand by asking questions. This means that the viewer should not make poor assumptions of a person based upon their physical appearance, how they might talk, or even how they might dress. A person who superficially judges another based upon these factors conforms to a readerly context&#151;one who judges without analyzing. Contrariwise, Lynch is asking the viewer to be writerly&#151;in other words, choose to see the good in John Merrick, and humanity for that matter, by analyzing and asking questions to the things (i.e. people, films, ideologies) you don't understand.A general standard I've adopted while watching and critiquing films conforms to Lynch's overall message in this particular film. Just as Lynch suggests that the unexamined life is not worth living, I conclude that the unexamined film is not worth watching. The Elephant Man is a film about choosing not to be offended. My reasons are as follows.The characters in the film who are offended by Merrick's appearance (i.e. crowds at freak-show, Merrick's owner, nurses, doctor's in training, watch-guard) are the one's who take him out of context of who he really is&#151;and who is he really?

However, these aspects of his character are ignored by the offended because they refuse to take him in context&#151;in other words, they refuse to see beyond his physical appearance. They do not allow him to express himself. As a result of this rejection, Merrick is confined to a life of fear, misery, disparagement and loneliness.The viewer, on the other hand, is given the opportunity to see Merrick for everything he is in context. There are several ways the director accomplishes this First, the viewer is divorced from the animalistic qualities that are unfortunately attributed to Merrick and as a result learn to care deeply for him. How is this done? The director shows the viewer truthful and poignant moments of Merrick's humanity his love for theater and poetry shows his interests in the arts; his graciousness in accepting gifts from both the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) and the theater actress (Anne Bancroft) shows his cordiality; his ability to recite scripture illustrates his intelligence; and his ability to converse with other human beings demonstrates his cognitive understanding.

Unlike the American animators who either take cover for princesses\/talking animals, and whose major attempt at branching out to an older audience include (pre)teen action adventures or cartoon adaptations of comic books (perhaps the sole exception to these rules is Ralph Bakshi), Japanese animation has the potential to leap to adult, mature-minded audiences, exploring fantasies and futures that, no matter how many times Hollywood tries, they simply can not replicate. However, Japanese animation was fairly overlooked and undervalued for a very long time in North America.In 1988, Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira was released to instant classic status in Japan and still managed to find a small following in the Western world. However, its popularity was so infectious, that its appeal spread throughout the Western world and created a new generation, and legion, of anime fans. They soon wanted more, and the rest was history. It was a global cultural landmark. But I digress.Many others have said it before, and I'll say it again - Akira ranks amongst the greatest animated films. Amazing that a story about an out of control psychic can be transformed with such Gothic and macabre detail, yet visually it is still utterly mesmerizing; how everything falls into place, how it looks, how it sounds, how it feels. It has been said that Otomo animated the voice actors' lips and synchronized it by hand onto the characters. The film also reportedly used over 160,000 animation cells. When put together it forms a gripping effect, we see the characters are hand-drawn, yet the super-fluid motion and good voice acting says otherwise. Groundbreaking stuff. The US$ 10 million (yes it was that expensive) budget had been put to supremely excellent use. tell the creators put a lot of effort and determination to give the public what they want.In the year 2019, youth culture, delinquency, social unrest and future uncertainty are abundant. The city of Neo-Tokyo is weighed against the historical spectre of nuclear destruction and Japan's post-war economic revival. Otomo and his animators realizes this scenario with some jaw dropping sights, the encompassing metropolis of Neo-Tokyo fills up the screen, the streets filled with neon lights, chaos by oppressed citizens, and a shroud of gloom and despair throughout. You can tell that the look and feel of Neo-Tokyo has been inspired by, perhaps even modeled after many film noirs or neo-noirs more than science fiction. Blade Runner is probably the biggest influence on the film's look (the year 2019 should be the biggest clue).Despite the futuristic elements, the city surprisingly shows a lack of technological progress as oppressed citizens take to the streets to overthrow the corrupt government. Amongst all this, the main story involves teenage delinquents, which looks like a cross between Hells' Angels and the delinquents in The Warriors. One of them, Tetsuo, begins to harness supernatural powers after a freak accident, and he begins to lash out at anyone who opposes him - all while his best friend Kaneda tries to stop him\/save him. Kaneda is the typical male anime hero, cocky, hilariously arrogant\/ignorant at times, but desperately determined. Tetsuo, the villain, slowly descends into insanity and we watch as his design also changes along with his character. It's a solid tale of good and bad, the future, abusing power, friendship, and surprisingly, the introspective near the end of the movie, which is enough to make Kubrick proud.I love how the film is put together and arranged at the right moments. Crisp editing makes the fluid animation smoothly glide by. Otomo's masterful direction of not only the heavy material and spectacular visuals accompanies the slick, ambitious and thrilling action sequences, more than complementing the visual world that he has created. The violence in said action sequences are shockingly graphic, but not overly grotesque like many other animes before it - it's just the right amount. This is not a movie for young children to watch, unless you feel they are mature enough to handle graphic violence and some introspective scenes. Rounding up everything to come into fruition is the atypical anime, or film, music score. Composed by Shoji Yamashiro and performed by his musical troupe the Geinoh Yamashirogumi, haunting visuals of the city and the graphic action are accompanied by surreal sounds of traditional Japanese chimes, chants and drums, giving it a wholly cultural feel to the film and seemingly making it exist in a truly different world than the one we know.This film is excellent, simply excellent. An event of gargantuan proportions. Run out, buy this, see this yesterday, and preserve it for generations to come. Some films can be forgotten - this film will stay with you. It's a shame Otomo's next directorial feature was to become the disappointment that is Steamboy. He should have another go for ambition.

Amazing that a story about an out of control psychic can be transformed with such Gothic and macabre detail, yet visually it is still utterly mesmerizing; how everything falls into place, how it looks, how it sounds, how it feels. It has been said that Otomo animated the voice actors' lips and synchronized it by hand onto the characters. The film also reportedly used over 160,000 animation cells. When put together it forms a gripping effect, we see the characters are hand-drawn, yet the super-fluid motion and good voice acting says otherwise. Groundbreaking stuff. The US$ 10 million (yes it was that expensive) budget had been put to supremely excellent use. tell the creators put a lot of effort and determination to give the public what they want.In the year 2019, youth culture, delinquency, social unrest and future uncertainty are abundant. The city of Neo-Tokyo is weighed against the historical spectre of nuclear destruction and Japan's post-war economic revival. Otomo and his animators realizes this scenario with some jaw dropping sights, the encompassing metropolis of Neo-Tokyo fills up the screen, the streets filled with neon lights, chaos by oppressed citizens, and a shroud of gloom and despair throughout. You can tell that the look and feel of Neo-Tokyo has been inspired by, perhaps even modeled after many film noirs or neo-noirs more than science fiction. Blade Runner is probably the biggest influence on the film's look (the year 2019 should be the biggest clue).Despite the futuristic elements, the city surprisingly shows a lack of technological progress as oppressed citizens take to the streets to overthrow the corrupt government. Amongst all this, the main story involves teenage delinquents, which looks like a cross between Hells' Angels and the delinquents in The Warriors. One of them, Tetsuo, begins to harness supernatural powers after a freak accident, and he begins to lash out at anyone who opposes him - all while his best friend Kaneda tries to stop him\/save him. Kaneda is the typical male anime hero, cocky, hilariously arrogant\/ignorant at times, but desperately determined. Tetsuo, the villain, slowly descends into insanity and we watch as his design also changes along with his character. It's a solid tale of good and bad, the future, abusing power, friendship, and surprisingly, the introspective near the end of the movie, which is enough to make Kubrick proud.I love how the film is put together and arranged at the right moments. Crisp editing makes the fluid animation smoothly glide by. Otomo's masterful direction of not only the heavy material and spectacular visuals accompanies the slick, ambitious and thrilling action sequences, more than complementing the visual world that he has created. The violence in said action sequences are shockingly graphic, but not overly grotesque like many other animes before it - it's just the right amount. This is not a movie for young children to watch, unless you feel they are mature enough to handle graphic violence and some introspective scenes. Rounding up everything to come into fruition is the atypical anime, or film, music score. Composed by Shoji Yamashiro and performed by his musical troupe the Geinoh Yamashirogumi, haunting visuals of the city and the graphic action are accompanied by surreal sounds of traditional Japanese chimes, chants and drums, giving it a wholly cultural feel to the film and seemingly making it exist in a truly different world than the one we know.This film is excellent, simply excellent. An event of gargantuan proportions. Run out, buy this, see this yesterday, and preserve it for generations to come. Some films can be forgotten - this film will stay with you. It's a shame Otomo's next directorial feature was to become the disappointment that is Steamboy. He should have another go for ambition.

Unlike the American animators who either take cover for princesses\/talking animals, and whose major attempt at branching out to an older audience include (pre)teen action adventures or cartoon adaptations of comic books (perhaps the sole exception to these rules is Ralph Bakshi), Japanese animation has the potential to leap to adult, mature-minded audiences, exploring fantasies and futures that, no matter how many times Hollywood tries, they simply can not replicate. However, Japanese animation was fairly overlooked and undervalued for a very long time in North America.In 1988, Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira was released to instant classic status in Japan and still managed to find a small following in the Western world. However, its popularity was so infectious, that its appeal spread throughout the Western world and created a new generation, and legion, of anime fans.
