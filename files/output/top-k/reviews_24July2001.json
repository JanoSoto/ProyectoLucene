The storyline was more original and noble than I had antispaited but afterwards felt it was only an excuse to make another film. The only thing that saved this movie was Sam Neil. It was great to see his character devolop more and yet he was overshadowed by continully being the voice of reason but yet never listened too. William H. Macy was blatantly misused for this film. I mean it was a medicore performance by a superberb actor not his best work. As for Tea Leoni any no name and or actress with half a brain could have played Amanda. Waht saved this movie from being a total waste of money was the kid Eric. The fact that he was able to survive and stay alive for that amount of time is well to say the least hard to swallow but also you understand why he was made to be that resourceful.If you are looking for more bloodshed than you best see another movie. The movie was advertised as No Walk in The Park. As far as I could see if you were a character who had more than 4 lines you were going to live. I mean how many people died maybe 5 and of those we actually only got to see 3 of them get eaten and or torn apart.The fast action pace of the movie left well something more to be desired. The 90 minutes you sat at the movie theatre to watch this film could have been spent better else where. The introduction of a new dinosaur was a gamble and I would say not one that paid off. I mean come on a Spinasours or however you spell it. No one wants to see they're favorite T-Rex get beaten by some idiot with a spine on its back.(it really just looked like a T-Rex with a spine on its back). The action sequence between the 2 dinosaours was amazing but could have been longer. It was nice to see the new addtion from an old dinosaour in the Terdactyl, but also the parachute save was rather well one might say unrealistic. You can easily see why Speilberg refused to do this film. The plot and or storyline was used up and there was no new spin on it at all. It was an original attempt to get to the Island but after that it was run for your life theres a dinosaour chasing you. The fact that Raptors evolved and had intelligence is rather insulting yet cool at the same time. The fact that they were not hostile and only technically got one kill but left the others alone kind of defeats the purpose of having them in the film.This film would have made more sense by being the 2nd in the series rather than the 3rd. The special effects are just that and nothing more but are kinda old considering they are almost a given now in almost any film. Dispite an attempt to make a superb and memorable film this movie is nothing more than a good action film soon forgotton after it comes out on video. If you're looking for a good action movie than go see it. If you're looking for a new twist on an cool idea than see another film. All in all if you're bored go see it if not don't waste your time.

They get along now.The famous paleontologist, Grey, now appreciates the young, naïve Billy for who he is. Some people want to be astronomers, and some people want to be astronauts, preaches Grey. The astronomers get to study and love beautiful things from safety-- But they never get to touch them, says Eric, the lost son. Right, Sonnie. And astronomers get right up there to mess around with things, but they don't really appreciate them. Billy wasan astronaut. You know what the last thing I said to him was--Sorry, Grey, but I have to cut you short here. On to the second thing; it tried to have a plot. What? It did? you say. Yeah, the raptors. In the beginning, Grey gave a speech about raptor intelligence, saying they could communicate. Then Billy made a raptor larynx and blew on it to make raptor speech noises. Then they were in the old base on the island and a they trapped a raptor and heard it make a noise. Close up to Grey's face. He's calling for help. And finally Grey talks to the raptors himself to save his life. It's a strong plot because people didn't believe him when he lectured.However, this plot is lame, and it seems like a good plot when I say it, but in the movie it's not obvious at all. It's poorly dealt with, as is the character development. You would totally miss it if you just came for thrills and dynonici plunging their claws into people's backs. Of course, if you came for that, you'd have left happy and wouldn't have been complaining.So, I liked it because it WAS thrilling, and when they wanted you to be grossed out, you were grossed out, and when they wanted you to be scared, you were scared, and when they wanted you to be happy, you were happy. It had funny moments, like Grey's dream of turning and seeing Billy as a raptor who says Alan.... That was outrageous. I thought it was hilarious when Eric was being pecked and prodded by the baby pteredactyls. That was HILARIOUS.But the main reason it was absurd was because the whole reason Jurassic Park I and even II were worthy of any attention was because of the neat-o, brand spanking new, collosal, amazing animatronic life-size dinosaurs that were built and operated. Now it's just a computer. You know, computers, like in Tomb Raider, The Mummy I & II, Final Fantasy, Cats and Dogs, Paulie, Toy Story, Atlantis, 75% of kid's television, 100% of all D*sney movies in the last five years, &c &c &c. Wow. Computers. Maybe it was a big deal in Money For Nothing, but computer dinosaurs have been done, are old, and, besides still being adorable, do not do it like animatronic dinosaurs.Of course, animatronic dinosaurs probably could not have done it either. You need something new. So instead of writing a script we could do without just to spend years animating dinosaurs biting people's heads off, come up with new, interesting dinosaurs to grab our attention.Despite how negative this all may have seemed, I think you should go see the movie. If you don't, you will have to be tortured by guilt. See it. I mean it. It's a laugh, it's a thrill, but it's no Money For Nothing.

In the beginning, Grey gave a speech about raptor intelligence, saying they could communicate. Then Billy made a raptor larynx and blew on it to make raptor speech noises. Then they were in the old base on the island and a they trapped a raptor and heard it make a noise. Close up to Grey's face. He's calling for help. And finally Grey talks to the raptors himself to save his life. It's a strong plot because people didn't believe him when he lectured.However, this plot is lame, and it seems like a good plot when I say it, but in the movie it's not obvious at all. It's poorly dealt with, as is the character development. You would totally miss it if you just came for thrills and dynonici plunging their claws into people's backs. Of course, if you came for that, you'd have left happy and wouldn't have been complaining.So, I liked it because it WAS thrilling, and when they wanted you to be grossed out, you were grossed out, and when they wanted you to be scared, you were scared, and when they wanted you to be happy, you were happy. It had funny moments, like Grey's dream of turning and seeing Billy as a raptor who says Alan.... That was outrageous. I thought it was hilarious when Eric was being pecked and prodded by the baby pteredactyls. That was HILARIOUS.But the main reason it was absurd was because the whole reason Jurassic Park I and even II were worthy of any attention was because of the neat-o, brand spanking new, collosal, amazing animatronic life-size dinosaurs that were built and operated. Now it's just a computer. You know, computers, like in Tomb Raider, The Mummy I & II, Final Fantasy, Cats and Dogs, Paulie, Toy Story, Atlantis, 75% of kid's television, 100% of all D*sney movies in the last five years, &c &c &c. Wow. Computers. Maybe it was a big deal in Money For Nothing, but computer dinosaurs have been done, are old, and, besides still being adorable, do not do it like animatronic dinosaurs.Of course, animatronic dinosaurs probably could not have done it either. You need something new. So instead of writing a script we could do without just to spend years animating dinosaurs biting people's heads off, come up with new, interesting dinosaurs to grab our attention.Despite how negative this all may have seemed, I think you should go see the movie. If you don't, you will have to be tortured by guilt. See it. I mean it. It's a laugh, it's a thrill, but it's no Money For Nothing. I spent five dollars for it, but I also spent five dollars on an Arlo Guthrie record. It was well worth the five bucks I spent on it, though Alice's Restaurant was much more worth it.

The comparisons between these two movies are huge, and, although they don't show on the final product, they are quite visible on the way this movie has been made the thing they really wanted to do was to recreate the bombing of Pearl Harbor in all its 2.35 widescreen Dolby Digital DTS splendor, and Michael Bay, being the bubblegum popcorn director he always has been was the right choice to do this. But, as they noticed, a film doesn't live on only a bombing sequence, so they decided that they had to create a pretext, luring also the sensitive side of the audience, labeled as women. This is what really gives me the more disgust this movie was made by the numbers, no art involved, the script filled to the brim with clichés. The film is at all predictable, cold, a product of an industry and not much else. This is what really made me sick throughout.First part The way to start every epic movie the clichéd prologue of the two protagonists when they are still children, having experiences that will influence their lives (see Backdraft and Braveheart, for example). Then we get a love story that takes nearly 5 minutes to start, the essential time (the audience really only wants to see the action). The film rushes slowly to the action sequence, with the always-seen newsreels of war. The sun is always orange, and the cameras are almost always in slow motion. Ben Affleck and a guy I have seen in Trainspotting do also the (very weak) comic relief. But we blink and the movie is already in Hawaii, because we have to get there so that the characters meet their fate, which everyone is predicting. The result of this first part is a handful of clichés which bores everyone who doesn't go to the movies to eat popcorn.Second Part The thing everyone has been waiting to see. After all, this is why probably 90% of the audience bought their ticket. The explosions are, of course, massive and huge. Many people die, also in the most gruesome ways. Fire, planes, bullets, water, the 150 million dollars are all there on the screen, in those specially dramatic shots of the bombs falling and the torpedos swimming towards the ships. Many things blow up, but, maybe it's just me, there is such a lack of artistic sense of good taste and suspense that the cinematic event of the summer, which is probably those 45 minutes of bombing leaves the viewer cold. It actually tastes like a fraud. There isn't one single shot I can say that touched me more than the others. Not even that bomb falling, which I see as a different way to show the same thing. The bullets, the explosions, even The Rock touched me more than all that collection of stunts. The flying bits are good, but at the same time they fall flat why do we guess from the very beginning that the both of the protagonists will survive? I don't even ask how did they manage to be shot at during all that time and not being killed in the process. I don't even ask how two planes can lift off and escape. Why do the bad guys never kill the main characters? From the beginning, the bombing of Pearl Harbor doesn't strike us because there is no real sense of risk all the people that die are not the people we met in the first part, and we know that at least the three main characters will make it to the end.Third part America always wins. That's maybe the message they show here. The bombing of pearl harbor was a disaster to the american fleet in the pacific, but america always wins, no matter what. And yes, they will strike back. Hey, even the Japanese admit it's a sleeping giant (which makes us think on the reasons they attacked it). In the final part, which we see as another episode and not as a conclusion (really, the movie could continue on and on, the bombing still looks like it was glued in the middle of the absurd love story, just check out that first dialogue between Rafe and Evelyn). The final sequence is one more statement that America always wins, no matter what, and even if they lost a great deal of troops and boats and planes, they will manage to win. Like they say at one given time they lost the battle but they will win the war.It's things like these that kill the innocence and the sensibility of a movie.

Brando has a fair part considering how little has been seen of him lately.    He is not comical here and his swimming pool scene discussing the heist is interesting.  You can be sure that was real whiskey in his glass  It makes you hope he tries another film or two but he will probably disappear again and remain mysterious.  Angela Bassett is fine.  This film is not a forum about race or age or something you might have to listen to in some college classes.  Its just a tight smooth class act.  Cheers.

As for me, I love it.  I've seen around 20 Godzilla (G) movies and I've enjoyed them all (yes even the really silly ones).  To me, G movies are kind of like the rides at Disney World the characters aren't real and some of the effects are old, but, with a little bit of imagination, it's just as much fun.Of all the G movies I've seen, G2000 is my favorite.  I think the director really understood what Godzilla is.  Godzilla isn't a sympathetic friend to mankind, he's more like a F5 Tornado that destroys everything in its path - very dangerous yet very interesting.  And this is how he's portrayed in the movie - like a force of nature (with an attitude).  I liked the storm chaser (ala Twister) feel of the beginning of the movie.  One review of G2000 perfectly described the terrific scenes where there is action in the foreground and you see G tearing up everything far in the background like a bad storm cell looming in the distance.  The overall dark, brooding tone of the movie has just the right feel.Many have complained about the special effects in G2000, but I thought they were great.  Yes, I know some of the CG effects were a bit off, but as an amateur scale model builder, I can appreciate what went into making this movie.  To put together a project of this magnitude with suits, models, etc. and produce a movie like G2000 is truly amazing!  If the critics think it's so easy, they should try it themselves.  Try this get a camcorder, some legos, and toy G figure and see what you can do.  Yes, my son and I have done it and it ain't as easy as it looks.  So, I guess the quality of the special effects really depends on your perspective.  As many have pointed out, high quality special effects (like those in the Big Ol' Iguana, er, '98 Godzilla version) do not always equal a good movie.  Godzilla movies (the real `guy in a rubber suit' versions that is) are literally handmade and I hope they never change.In addition to the technical aspects of the movie, G2000 has some interesting subtle touches that I haven't seen in past G movies.  For instance, when G becomes truly angry, his dorsal fins (they look like flames to me) not only glow, but they crackle as they heat up.  Then you see fire welling up in G's mouth before he rares back and `throws' his fire breath like an erupting volcano - a nice touch.So finally, here are some recommendations for enjoying G2000.  First, watch one of the old ones (King Kong v. Godzilla for example) prior to watching G2000 and you'll appreciate how far Toho has come over the years.  Second, take time to check out the details like all those model buildings, bridges, etc. (it's amazing that with all of the horrific destruction in the final scenes that most of the city still has power, but never mind).  Finally, relax, enjoy and don't take it too seriously.  It's just for fun!  And it lasts longer than a ride at Disney World!

Any and all plot driven movies (movies that rely on plot instead of character to tell the story) must stay within that plot.  Jurassic Park must always involve dinosaurs.  Bringing Out the Dead must involve ambulance drivers.  Die-Hard must involve terrorists.  This is not a bad thing.  All of those movies I mentioned above are great movies, but they are plot driven.  It is nice, however, from time to time to see a character driven movie.  A movie with no gimmick, no real plot, only characters that tie it together.  These movies usually have more than one main character, lots of dialog, and most importantly, they can go anywhere.  The characters can jump in a plane and fly to Antarctica if the want to.  It is this feeling of open-ness that makes such movies feel so good.  As Good as it Gets is one of these movies.  Because the movie is character driven, we feel anything can happen.As Good as it Gets has some of the best characters I have ever seen.  There is no real plot.  If I had to say what the plot was I would say it's about a crazy jerk who tries to change himself.  But that doesn't even come close to describing this movie.  One reason why I love this movie is that I can really identify with the main character, Melvin Udall, played with shear brilliance by Jack Nicholson.  You see, I am a little obsessive-compulsive.  Not enough to warrant medication, just enough to know I have it.  As I have said before in other reviews, I love movies about crazy people.  And Melvin is about as crazy as they come.  I can really understand why he locks and unlocks his door ten times overtime he comes home.  I can understand why he wants to have the same waitress serve him breakfast every day.  Obsessive-compulsive people love routine and if anything gets in the way of their routine, they feel violated.  They not only want everyday to be like the last, they need it that way.The acting in this movie is the best I have ever seen in one movie.  The cast was perfect.  No one plays a better lunatic than Jack Nicholson.  The man is so good mer words can not express it.  Helen Hunt is great as the cruel, stressful yet sensitive waitress.  She deserves the Oscar for this and she has become one of my favorite actresses.  Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small part, but he works it beautifully.  Greg Kinnear is great as the sensitive and confused gay painter.  Even Yeardly Smith (who some of you may know as Lisa from The Simpsons) is good.  That just shows how good James L. Brooks is.  He assembles on of the greatest casts ever and he directs them with grace and beauty.Speaking of James L. Brooks, he and Mark Andus have made on of the funniest scripts of all time.  This movie has some of the best one-liners I have ever heard (most of which come from Melvin).  The dialog is great.  This is some of the funniest writing I have ever heard.Example Melvin- Never, never, interrupt me, okay? Not if there's a fire, not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home and one week later there's a smell coming from there that can only be a decaying human body and you have to hold a hanky to your face because the stench is so thick that you think you're going to faint. Even then, don't come knocking. Or, if it's election night, and you're excited and you wanna celebrate because some fudgepacker that you date has been elected the first queer president of the United States and he's going to have you down to Camp David, and you want someone to share the moment with. Even then, don't knock. Not on this door. Not for ANY reason. Do you get me, sweetheart?The movie even reminds me of The Simpsons.  James L. Brooks is a producer for that show (which in my opinion is the greatest show of all time) and As Good as it Gets is filled with the same sudden, jab to the head type humor of The Simpsons.  No, there is no other similarity, it's just that both seem to have the same comic timing.In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movies and is definitely a classic.  I normally hate softy romantic movies.  The only thing is As Good as it Gets is anything but a softy romantic movie.  Sure the movie has romance.  It is, mostly, a love story.  But it is NOT soft.  It is very hilarious.  Melvin is a cranky, brutally honest, meticulous, eccentric man and it is hilarious to watch him.  I recommend this to anyone.  It's a sweet, intelligent, deep, fresh, funny, and original movie that will continue to entertain me for years to come. Normally, I believe that every one has an opinion.  If I like a movie and you don't, so be it.  But, if you don't like this movie, well, I can say with APSOLUTE accuracy that you have no taste.

If I like a movie and you don't, so be it.  But, if you don't like this movie, well, I can say with APSOLUTE accuracy that you have no taste.

What could possibly be bad about this movie?  My, my, so many CHOICES!  Alright, when I went to see this movie I knew what to expect.  Just knowing that Spielberg wasn't directing and Koepp wasn't writing was enough to tell me that this movie was going to suck royally.  But, hey, there's always a possibility that Johnston just might direct something good and then we could all forget about Jumanji.  Guess what?  It ain't gonna happen.This film (if you even have the nerve to call it that) was more predictable than a day-time soap.  In fact, this movie is so predictable that I was actually able to tell exactly how the movie was going to start off.  The words 'Jurassic Park' on black.  And then three claw-marks are scratched through it.  That's what I told my friends, and guess what?  That's what happened.There were a lot of things wrong with this movie.  First of all, the Spinosaurus somehow finds its way onto Isla Sorna, even though in the Lost World (although not as good as the first is a hell of a lot better than this piece of crap) it's nowhere to be found.  One thing I liked about the movie, though, were the raptors.  Well, just their appearance.  I thought it was pretty cool to see colorful raptors, even though the whole thing conflicted with the first two films.In the previews when Tea Leoni says So this is where you make dinosaurs and then Grant answers in his quiet all-knowing sort of way No, this is where you play God you figure the naughty InGen scientists must've screwed with the dino DNA or something to make 'em super-smart.  Instead it turns out that they're like that naturally, even though they are nothing like the ones in the first two films!  In fact, these dinosaurs are so smart that they are capable of setting a trap.  But the thing is, these animals don't even ACT like animals.  They act like human beings would, plotting and acting really smart and stuff.  In one scene, a raptor casually bends down and breaks a guy's neck (he must think he's Steven Seagal, or something)... and then leaves his body!  They don't even EAT him!  No animal would EVER act like that.  And I cannot stress that enough.And then everything happens really fast.  The T-Rex (practically the star of the first two films) makes his appearance abruptly, and within a minute and a half exits in a very demeaning manner.  Who knew a fish-eating reptile could snap a Tyrannosaur's neck?  Well, until I saw this movie, I didn't! I also felt that you really didn't get to know the characters all that well. Who the hell cares if they're killed?  I sure didn't.  And the inaccuracies and plot holes (My GOD, the PLOT HOLES!) go on, and on, and ON.  Then, by the time the movie is over, I turn to my best friend and ask him what time it is.  He says  317.  I couldn't BELIEVE IT!  The movie had started at 140 and the first ten minutes or so was all previews (in fact, the previews were the best part of the whole mess.  It's cool to see a teaser for 'Spiderman', and 'The Musketeer' looks pretty groovy)!My God, the movie was only ninety-one minutes long!  The first two films (and they were brilliant films, I tell you) were both over two hours each. With this movie you could have used that extra fourty minutes or so to throw a little plot in there!  Hell, even some CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT couldn't hurt!  Also, the music was not in any way suspenseful. The only time I came even close to jumping was when poor Doctor Grant nearly fell to his death after placing his foot on a faulty step.  Please, just give us John Williams!Bottom Line  This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen.  At first I tried making up reasons why it wasn't so bad.  Well, the special effects were okay or That scene with the pterosaurs was pretty cool and Hey, Grant is in this movie! but in the end I really must admit it.  And the worst thing about it is the crude attempt at humor.  My God, if you're desperate enough to have Grant dream that a raptor is talking to him then throw Malcolm in there!  Malcolm could have made EVERYTHING better!  But then again, even Jeff Goldblum knows a bad script when he reads one.  Who were the three or four geniuses who thought this trash up, anyway?  On the plus side, I really DID think the scene with the pteranodons kicked ass. Rating  ** out of A Helluva Lotta Stars.

However, that doesn't make it horrible overall, considering that the first two were phenomenal and this script unfortunately wasn't written by Kevin Williamson.  The violence was toned down WAY too much, and on top of that, the death scenes were very uncreative.  Almost everyone died the same way a knife in the lower back.  I was particularly disappointed with the opening death scene.  First of all, the choice of characters to kill was very poor, since we already knew one of them.  The actor that played him isn't even that well-known either, and that's what one of the best things about the first two films' opening scenes was.  Seeing Drew Barrymore, Omar Epps, and Jada Pinkett die in the first scene was completely shocking. This opener just didn't have that same effect.  Also, many of the characters were very one-dimensional.Alright, enough on the negatives - now I'll focus on the good things about this movie (surprisingly, there were many).  Although this movie was not very scary, Ehren Kruger, who took Williamson's place on this one, was able to make it very action-packed and came out with a decent thriller, only because Wes Craven returned as director.  This was also by far the funniest of the Scream movies.  I enjoyed the clever dialogue between Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox - who by the way looked TERRIBLE in this!  My God, her hair! I don't get it!  She looked so hot in the second one!) and Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey - the funniest character in the film) who is playing Gale in Stab 3.  David Arquette is funny once again as Dewey, and Neve Campbell rocks reprising her role as Sidney.  I also loved the part where Randy (Jamie Kennedy) explained the rules of a trilogy on a video.  Everyone else - Jenny McCarthy, Scott Foley, Patrick Dempsey, etc. - were all great as well.Another fantastic part of this movie was the fact that the mystery was not just simply who is the killer?.  It was more complex than that - it involved how is the killer related to the 'back story'?.  The killer would leave a photo of Sid's mom after each murder, and that built up to the very clever identity of the killer at the end.  This is what makes me believe that it's a really great finale to the trilogy because it concludes the story so well.Although it has its flaws and it's not quite as enjoyable as the first two, it's not as bad as it may seem.  I found it to be fairly disappointing, despite the fact that it was fun to see at the movies, because i waited over two years to see it, and i couldn't help but expect something spectacular after hearing countless rumors about how well they kept the script and everything under raps.

This is what makes me believe that it's a really great finale to the trilogy because it concludes the story so well.Although it has its flaws and it's not quite as enjoyable as the first two, it's not as bad as it may seem.  I found it to be fairly disappointing, despite the fact that it was fun to see at the movies, because i waited over two years to see it, and i couldn't help but expect something spectacular after hearing countless rumors about how well they kept the script and everything under raps.  But I saw it again on video and realized how well it concludes the story.  It's very entertaining - not as much as the first two - but still a can't-miss for fans of the series nontheless. 8\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"24 July 2001","score":"","review":"  I've seen this movie three times now, and every time I've seen it I've come to like it *more*than the previous time - which is fairly incredible. I definitely liked it well enough the first time, but upon the third viewing I became convinced this isn't just a good, solid movie - it's one of the greatest of all time.Why? Well, for me, I'd say that Donnie Brasco is the movie that Goodfellas wasn't.  I don't actually get what the big fuss is over Goodfellas (which I realize, for many people, disqualifies my opinion right there, but here goes) - it's objective to the point of not taking any kind of stance at all on its characters or its situations. And even at that, in comparison with Donnie it actually *does* glamorize mobsters' lives they are all the masters of their little world, and are entitled to the best of everything, even in prison.  By contrast, Donnie shows the cheap and petty underside of mob life a bunch of frustrated grunts, hanging out in the local grease joint, hatching schemes to make any kind of buck in order to pay off their bosses. It's sad and pathetic - and the attempts of Pacino's character to puff himself up (as well as the life he leads) into some kind of mythic significance is just unutterably sad. It's the Death of a Salesman of mob movies. And that in itself would be quite enough. But in fact, it's also something else, something equally gripping and profound. It's maybe the best undercover cop movie I've ever seen, as well.  That is, not only does it gives us a good inside view of the actual mechanics and legwork involved (wearing a wire, reporting to superiors, etc.) but also the effect that staying perpetually in character can have on the undercover cop's personal sense of self. Johnny Depp's character here is torn between his two separate identities that of Joe Pistone, upstanding cop and family man, and the slimy and amoral Donnie Brasco that he is forced to live out every day as. His loyalty also becomes torn between his superiors, who stand loftily and sanctimoniously above him, and the everyday mob characters that he spends his time with and comes to feel a closeness for - particularly Lefty (Pacino). The relationship the movie builds between these two men is one of the strongest and most tender (while still understated) that I've ever seen in any film. And the conflict that it brings about in Donnie is made very real and poignant to the audience.Also helping to make Donnie's dilemma effective are the scenes between he and his wife, played (perfectly) by Anne Heche. I bring this up because there might be a tendency to view these scenes as filler, since they take us away from the main action, and are pretty touchy-feely to boot (the quality of writing in them, I'll admit, is not as consistently high as the other scenes in the movie - though never less than competent). However,  I find them just as necessary and vital to the film as all the mafia stuff those scenes add incalculably to the composite picture of Johnny Depp's character, and how it is being pulled this way and that by the call of duty and the pull of his heart and conscience.A FINAL NOTE Concerning Al Pacino's performance here; it's been lauded as one of his best, but I'm not so sure. The CHARACTER of Lefty is definitely one of the greatest he has ever been handed, but there's not much subtlety to his portrayal, i.e. it's of the hambone, Hoo-Ha variety that has become his stock in trade (Sea of Love being the last time he created a fully three dimensional person on screen). However, what's affecting and poignant is how the film *uses* that portrayal we're so used to seeing Pacino as the big boss, the head honcho - where his bluster is justified by his position - that to flip the formula on its head, and show him as the lowliest of the bottom feeders, yet still maintaining the same bluster, is tremendously jarring, in a sad kind of way. It's as if we're seeing the character of Lefty say to himself I'm a nobody, but maybe if I puff up enough and carry myself more like Al Pacino does in the movies, I can become a somebody. In this situation, is it the actor who's creating the magic, or the filmmakers' canny *use* of the actor, with all of his associations? I'm inclined to think the latter, but ultimately it doesn't matter the bottom line is, Lefty Ruggiero is one of the greatest characters in all of film, and his story will break your heart.A great, great movie. I'm sure I'll revisit it many more times through the years.
