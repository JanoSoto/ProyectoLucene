The results too often were stilted films, too self conscious about how they looked to get mud on their pants.The Talented Mr. Ripley has a good cast, beautiful locations and a nasty little plot, but it goes nowhere. Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow don't show enough personality to bring the film to life. It falls to Jude Law and Cate Blanchett to bring bursts of energy to the film whenever they appear on screen; unfortunately for the movie, those appearances are far too infrequent.You know who should have directed this? Woody Allen. The Talented Mr. Ripley should have had the same tone and white-knuckle suspense that Allen's Match Point did.Grade C ","genre":null},{"date":"29 June 2010","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Anthony Minghella turns what could have been a taut, Hitchcockian thriller into a giant snoozer by giving it the serious movie treatment.Minghella (RIP) seriously needed to relax as a filmmaker -- every time he got behind the camera, he worked overtime to make a masterpiece.
