A reworking in plot from their earlier outing of The Gay Divorcée (1934), TOP HAT, in fact, the most admired of the two, could easily pass as a partial remake, rehash or possibly a sequel, mainly due to the sameness in the casting of Edward Everett Horton, Erik Rhodes and Eric Blore from The Gay Divorcée also directed by Mark Sandrich. Stepping in for Alice Brady is Helen Broderick, whose deadpan humor and dry-wit personality proved more amusing than Brady's dim-witted character. Also similar to The Gay Divorcée is Ginger Rogers singing one song near its conclusion while Astaire provides most of the vocalization.The story opens in London. Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) is an American dancer (what else!) who is to perform in one of Horace Hardwick's (Edward Everett Horton) upcoming musical shows. They share a hotel suite together where Jerry has an urge to sing and dance. His tap dancing disturbs a sleeping patron in the room below. Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers), the upset hotel guest in question, comes up to the room above to register her complaint. After Jerry meets his complainer, he immediately falls in love with her, and decides to soft-shoe her to sleep by dancing on sand after she returns to her room. During his stay in London, he pursues Dale whenever he can, and sweeps her off her feet by dancing with her in the gazebo in the park during a rain storm. Because she doesn't know his name, she affectionately calls him Adam. Dale, who is to later meet with her best friend, Madge Hardwick (Helen Broderick) in Venice, Italy, discovers she's playing matchmaker, hoping to pair her with her husband's friend, Jerry, while, in turn, Dale believes Jerry to be Horace. Things get really complex as Dale mistakingly believes Made to be pushing her husband over to her while poor Horace, the innocent bystander, is being being threatened by Dale's dressmaker, Alberto Bedini (Erik Rhodes) and given a black eye by Madge for no apparent reason. Also adding to the confusion is Bates (Eric Blore), Horace's faithful servant, assigned by him to follow Dale Tremont and find out more about this gold digger out to trap Jerry, and ....Aside from TOP HAT being long on laughs and complications becoming more confusing and the story moves on, the film takes time for five classic dance numbers composed by the legendary Irving Berlin No Strings, I'm Fancy Free (sung and danced by Fred Astaire); Isn't It a Lovely Day to be Caught in the Rain (sung by Astaire\/ danced by Astaire and Ginger Rogers); Top Hat (sung by Astaire); Cheek to Cheek (sung by Astaire\/ danced by Astaire and Rogers); and The Piccolino (sung by Ginger Rogers and chorus\/ danced by Astaire and Rogers); and The Piccolino (reprise, finale). Of those numbers, Cheek to Cheek remains a true highlight, a scene clipped in many documentaries pertaining to movie musicals or Astaire and Rogers themselves. Cheek to Cheek was nominated for best song of 1935. Although it didn't win, it remains as memorable as the Astaire and Rogers dance itself.Any similarities between THE GAY Divorcée and TOP HAT are purely coincidental, but in many ways an improvement. Both films are not only the most famous and televised of the Astaire and Rogers musicals, but each presents itself like a stage play. The only twist here is that TOP HAT, which borrows from The Gay Divorcée is actually an original screenplay (by Dwight Taylor), written especially for the leading pair. Other than the horse and buggy ride on the London streets, the focal point remains mostly in the hotel suites, lobbies, dining areas and a brief ride on the gondola. TOP HAT gives the impression to be the most lavishly scaled musical ever released by RKO. It does. Even Ginger Rogers' dresses are glittering and rich in appearance, right down to her sleeping attire. A musical fantasy by way of costumes (how many women sleep with nightgowns flashier than a dinner dress?), TOP HAT has Astaire singing and dancing during portions of the plot, a common practice musical stage shows, though the title tune, Top Hat, White Tie and Tails is the only one given the production number treatment played to a theater audience on screen.TOP HAT, available on video cassette and\/or DVD, and formerly shown on American Movie Classics, most commonly found on Turner Classic Movies, is fortunate to have certain cut scenes restored. During the years of commercial television back in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, the sequence involving Bates (Eric Blore) insulting an Italian police official whom he believes doesn't speak a word of English, leading to his arrest, was among the missing. Whether seeing TOP HAT at 100 minutes, or in shorter reissue 93 minute prints, the movie itself is entertaining from start to finish. And if the blonde flower clerk in the London sequence early in the story looks familiar, look again. That's Lucille Ball, the future queen of television.

There is a return to Dr.Evil\/ Mini-Me and Scotty Evil & Fat Bastard not to mention the new female enterage FOXTY BROWN. Oh and did i mention AUSTIN POWERS IS BACK BABY - He must save his kidnapped father.If you walked in to the cinema 10 minutes late, you would have missed out on one of the most classic film introductions in history. So get in EARLY to the movie, you dont want to miss the intro. The casting in this movie was the best of all 3, you have so MANY famous faces. From Britney Spears, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Spielberg, Gwyneth Paltrow, Dany Devito, Beyonce Knowles, Tom Cruise, Michael Kane, Seth Green, Fred Savage and not to mention MIKE MYERS.The acting was fine. Cinematography was good but no great. The script though was A BIT iffy.First reason is Goldmember had the most amount of rude and crude humour in all 3. Sure some were funny, yet others fell flat and were quiet offensive. Also there was a lack of plot, i had to put the cards on the table, sure it was funny but the approach wasn't. Still This film is recommended if you want some good laughs. You WILL laugh through-out the movie, yet you will especially love the Intro, Shadow Scenes, Rap Cameo, Mini-Me scenes are always good.ACTING The acting was very good. Mike Myers is one my favourite comedic actors. He does a good job portraying all charactors. Beyonce Knowles did an acceptable role, yet she didn't have to do much, just laugh at Austin Powers Joke, walk around in sexy clothing and say SHAZAAM And Sugar way too much. Michael Caine fitted his character well. Everyone did well. EVEN BRITNEY SPEARS!!!ACTORS The best selection of actors in a film since TRUE ROMANCE(1993). So many famous faces, so many cameos. You almost feel like your watching a few movies, how could all these great actors come into a film in short notice? I was very pleased.SCRIPT Not as well written as part 1 or 2. I disliked some characters. Goldmember wasn't so good. Foxy Brown was just entirely pointless.Scotty Evil was annoying as ever. The plot was thin. It could hve been written a lot better. Yet still many scenes left you laughing so hard. It's probably forgivable.CINEMA Cinematography was fine, yet the atmosphere didn't fit in to its prequels. And travelling back in forth in time, they didn't set the scene so well for the 70's. Boogie Nights did a MUCH Better job. Yet still the costumes and clothing was funny and matching to its times. Acceptable cinematography, nice shots of Tokyo.COMEDY Very Good. It is GUARANTEED to make you laugh, so thats a start isn't it? Some Jokes are really funny and original. Others are repeatative and wear a bit thin (signs of lack of ideas). There werent many corny names, i used to love the Corny names, here theres a couple like Fook Mi and Fook Yu. It's funny, but not as funny as its prequels.MUSIC\/SOUND Beyonce barely sang in this. Music was okay, the 70's tunes were well written and sung by beyonce. Not many sound effects, except farting, burping silly little things.OVERALL Goldmemeber in overall was my least favourite of all Austin Power Films, but dont fret.

So many compromises have been made to get this richly textured novel onto the screen that where the book interwove the stories in a fascinating counterpoint, convincing in voice and detail, the film is simply a bog-standard romance between good-looking actors with some pretty victorian stuff tacked on.You have wonder about the wisdom of even attempting to convert a book which is powerful tribute to the power of words and language and turning into a would-be powerful tribute to Gwyneth Paltrow.  To paraphrase the famous quote, making a movie about words and language is something like a dancing about architecture.The second largest flaw is that Aaron Eckhart is woefully miscast, leaving a character floundering in a story where he no longer makes any sense.  I'm not sure if he normally delivers his lines in such a clunkingly flat way, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  I'm not against adding American elements to a story to make it work commercial - it worked very well in High Fidelity, for example, but Roland's transatlantic transposition leaves all the other characters constantly having to react to his incongruous American-ness - he simply doesn't fit into the character in the novel.In addition, several *important* characters have been removed, leaving gaps in the narrative - obvious ones - Roland's previous girlfriend for example. Roland explains his singledom as he is simply off relationships, but never gives any kind of convincing back story to the motivation for this.

As an eight year old Indiana Jones fan with a penchant for numbers, I could not understand why this new Superhero movie was faring better at the box office than the fabulously entertaining Last Crusade. While the third installment of the Indiana Jones trilogy is still one of my favorites, it didn't compare to the experience I would enjoy later that summer. Somehow I had missed all the hype that was built up for Batman, and I didn't have any inclination to see it at all. One evening my Dad and I went to the movies to see what I thought would be Ghostbusters II. I can still remember him telling me that he was reversing that decision as we pulled into the parking lot. I heard that Batman is a much better movie he said to a very unimpressed kid pouting in the passenger seat. From my point of view I had never read a single Superhero comic, let alone a Batman comic (and never have since), but I knew I did like Bill Murray, Slimer and the rest of the 'Busters and wanted my way.Well score one for my Dad, because by the five minute mark I was hooked. From Keaton's first screen appearance as the Dark Knight I knew I liked this dude in the black suit.Don't kill me man!I'm not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favour. I want you to tell all your friends about me.Wh-What are you?I'm Batman.I was mesmerized throughout the whole film. From that introduction right until the final showdown in the belfry. The movie is dark and desolate yet has some great funny lines mixed in and is entertaining through and through. The set design and the cinematography are top notch and unique. The acting is very good, (except for Kim Basinger, but I think she sucks so I'm probably being biased). The score is great, as it perfectly matches the tone and mood of the film. The songs by Prince seem a little dated now, but aren't terrible. Tim Burton's unique perspective and direction is also on display here and is a resounding success. This is what I'm talking about when I refer to Batman as the standard bearer for comic book movies. People debate about which is the best Superhero movie of all time. Is it X-men? or is Superman better?  Batman is always mentioned near the top of the list, but there is far from a consensus decision. But, since it was released in 1989, every single comic book adaptation I have seen since has been noticeably influenced from its style and mood. None of the other contenders can claim to have had such an impact on the genre. Overall I give Batman a 9\/10 and it still stands up today as one of my favorite movies ever. I've always thought to properly enjoy Batman you would have to be somewhat like him; a little dark, a little introspective with a yearning to be a hero buried somewhere deep inside. Flashback again to 1989 and my Dad and I are leaving the theater with a big grin stuck on my face. Dad, this is the kind of movie that you want to see again right away.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"28 September 2002","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  INHERIT THE WIND, as has been amply pointed out by all the preceding reviews, is inspired by and based on the Scopes monkey trial in 1925. Spencer Tracy plays Henry Drummond (aka Clarence Darrow), the liberal defense attorney for schoolteacher Bert Cates (Dick York) who has been placed on trial by his entire town for daring to teach Darwinism (i.e. evolution theory) in his classroom. Fredric March essays the role of Matthew Harrison Brady (aka William Jennings Bryan), fundamentalist Christian leader brought to the fictional town of Hillsboro (based on the real Dayton, Tennessee) to prosecute the case. What ensues is pure drama--a clash of wills and beliefs unprecedented onscreen, with Drummond as the undeniable hero for whom the audience is expected to have great sympathy, as he struggles in the face of the bigotry of the court and the people the judge (Harry Morgan) refuses to allow Drummond to bring in scientific evidence, which damns his case from the outset; the people of Hillsboro hold night marches through the streets, burning effigies of Cates and Drummond... a more frightening lynch mob can hardly be imagined. Although Brady does ultimately come off as the villain of the film, this judgement does not come unqualified. What the film strives very hard to prove, a moral that gets a little lost in the fierce arguments about religion and the apparently clashing theories of creation and evolution, is that everyone has a right to be different. What matters is the sanctity of the individual mind, which includes the right to reason, the right to think, the right to believe, the right to be different but also, most importantly the right to be wrong. The film is *not* preaching about the rights and wrongs of Darwinism. In fact, very tellingly, the audience is not informed about the specifics of the theory, just as the jury and the townsfolk in the film aren't. It doesn't matter. The villain here is bigotry, the refusal to allow people the rights earlier enumerated. Therefore it is most important that Brady should come off as a human being, one with just as many flaws as the next person. This the writers try very hard to do in creating, for example, the rocking chair scene between Drummond and Brady--it becomes evident that their friendship goes back several decades, that they have the greatest respect for each other as people, even if not for each other's beliefs and causes. It is Brady's refusal to examine his own beliefs that leads him into bigotry, but he is not the only person guilty of this--the townsfolk, of course, are the same way, with Reverend Jeremiah Brown (Claude Akins) being the best example. Even his daughter Rachel (Donna Anderson), who is engaged to Bert, must struggle with Bert's need to be different; the cynical E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly) spends most of the film making rude asides about Brady, and is himself revealed to be closed to the possibility that Brady is a good man, despite his beliefs. The moral of the story preached here is one of tolerance, a keystone of the American constitution--*this* is what is on trial, not the rightness of wrongness of either Darwin or the Holy Scriptures. To this effect, the film brings together the considerable acting talents of Spencer Tracy, Fredric March and Gene Kelly. The supporting cast is excellent, but in the end, it all comes down to those two giants of the silver screen, Tracy and March, and Kelly's right and ability to stand right next to the best of them and not be stereotyped as merely a musical star. March brings to life the larger-than-life Matt Brady, with his overbearing attitude and loud confidence captured in a portrayal that still somehow wrings sympathy from the heart. His final desperation in the courtroom, as he struggles to deliver his prepared summation, is harrowing--the look etched on Spencer Tracy's face, one of immeasurable sorrow and horror, perhaps best encapsulates one's reaction to Brady's final moments. March truly turns in an amazing performance in a role that isn't written too sympathetically. Perhaps that's part of the point--however domineering a person might appear, however wrongheaded and obstinate and misguidedly confident (if at all), he is still a person, with goals, beliefs, and a right to hold those ideas sacred. One cannot judge by appearances.Gene Kelly, as well, does a great job with his role as the cynical reporter from the Baltimore Herald. In the end one does realise that Hornbeck's posturing and strutting are almost all show; he did bring Drummond in to fight a cause he believed in, and not just to watch the circus melee that he knew would ensue. Hornbeck's final speech to Drummond--You're wrong, Henry. You'll be there. You're the type. Who else would defend my right to be lonely?--is wonderfully delivered, even after Drummond dresses him down. One actually believes Kelly when he says, I may be rancid butter, but at least I'm on your side of the bread. This film is a hint at what Kelly could have done in dramatic roles if he hadn't been so stereotyped as just a hoofer. Much as Kelly and March do their best to steal the show, however, the show ultimately belongs to Spencer Tracy. One possibly does not understand the meaning of screen presence until one has seen Tracy in a film displaying his formidable acting skill. Even when he isn't talking, it is almost impossible to take one's eyes off Tracy when he's included in the frame. He *is* his character, and perhaps only Tracy could really pull off the role and make it believable. Drummond is too obviously written as the hero of the film; Tracy manages to make him likeable and not a crusader. Drummond is crusty and a needler when played by Tracy, not smarmy and over-confident. Just as special effects and CGI were never needed to create movie magic in the Golden Age, all one needs is that final shot of Tracy--walking down the courtroom aisle--to see him as a soldier for his cause, a hero not because he has fought the winning battle, but because his message is one you feel he will fight for always, no matter how painful or lonely it gets.This film is worth watching for the performances alone, both driven and certainly some of the best ever committed to film. Its underlying message of tolerance is admirable as well. But, in the end, whether you agree with its characters, what matters the most is that this is a film that makes you think. It engages you on an intellectual level, using dialogue and arguments that--even if flawed--make you pay attention. (To be honest, Drummond's case *is* weak--he has no evidence and all he can do is prove that one should have the right and ability to think through what one believes. Similarly, one has the right *not* to do so... and this defence probably isn't the strongest that could be put forward.) The most valuable thing about INHERIT THE WIND, then, is one's inability to be complacent while watching it. This is film-making at its finest, and this is certainly a fine (though imperfect) film.

Hornbeck (Gene Kelly) spends most of the film making rude asides about Brady, and is himself revealed to be closed to the possibility that Brady is a good man, despite his beliefs. The moral of the story preached here is one of tolerance, a keystone of the American constitution--*this* is what is on trial, not the rightness of wrongness of either Darwin or the Holy Scriptures. To this effect, the film brings together the considerable acting talents of Spencer Tracy, Fredric March and Gene Kelly. The supporting cast is excellent, but in the end, it all comes down to those two giants of the silver screen, Tracy and March, and Kelly's right and ability to stand right next to the best of them and not be stereotyped as merely a musical star. March brings to life the larger-than-life Matt Brady, with his overbearing attitude and loud confidence captured in a portrayal that still somehow wrings sympathy from the heart. His final desperation in the courtroom, as he struggles to deliver his prepared summation, is harrowing--the look etched on Spencer Tracy's face, one of immeasurable sorrow and horror, perhaps best encapsulates one's reaction to Brady's final moments. March truly turns in an amazing performance in a role that isn't written too sympathetically. Perhaps that's part of the point--however domineering a person might appear, however wrongheaded and obstinate and misguidedly confident (if at all), he is still a person, with goals, beliefs, and a right to hold those ideas sacred. One cannot judge by appearances.Gene Kelly, as well, does a great job with his role as the cynical reporter from the Baltimore Herald. In the end one does realise that Hornbeck's posturing and strutting are almost all show; he did bring Drummond in to fight a cause he believed in, and not just to watch the circus melee that he knew would ensue. Hornbeck's final speech to Drummond--You're wrong, Henry. You'll be there. You're the type. Who else would defend my right to be lonely?--is wonderfully delivered, even after Drummond dresses him down. One actually believes Kelly when he says, I may be rancid butter, but at least I'm on your side of the bread. This film is a hint at what Kelly could have done in dramatic roles if he hadn't been so stereotyped as just a hoofer. Much as Kelly and March do their best to steal the show, however, the show ultimately belongs to Spencer Tracy. One possibly does not understand the meaning of screen presence until one has seen Tracy in a film displaying his formidable acting skill. Even when he isn't talking, it is almost impossible to take one's eyes off Tracy when he's included in the frame. He *is* his character, and perhaps only Tracy could really pull off the role and make it believable. Drummond is too obviously written as the hero of the film; Tracy manages to make him likeable and not a crusader. Drummond is crusty and a needler when played by Tracy, not smarmy and over-confident. Just as special effects and CGI were never needed to create movie magic in the Golden Age, all one needs is that final shot of Tracy--walking down the courtroom aisle--to see him as a soldier for his cause, a hero not because he has fought the winning battle, but because his message is one you feel he will fight for always, no matter how painful or lonely it gets.This film is worth watching for the performances alone, both driven and certainly some of the best ever committed to film. Its underlying message of tolerance is admirable as well. But, in the end, whether you agree with its characters, what matters the most is that this is a film that makes you think. It engages you on an intellectual level, using dialogue and arguments that--even if flawed--make you pay attention. (To be honest, Drummond's case *is* weak--he has no evidence and all he can do is prove that one should have the right and ability to think through what one believes. Similarly, one has the right *not* to do so... and this defence probably isn't the strongest that could be put forward.) The most valuable thing about INHERIT THE WIND, then, is one's inability to be complacent while watching it. This is film-making at its finest, and this is certainly a fine (though imperfect) film.  ","genre":"Drama, History"},{"date":"28 September 2002","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  INHERIT THE WIND, as has been amply pointed out by all the preceding reviews, is inspired by and based on the Scopes monkey trial in 1925. Spencer Tracy plays Henry Drummond (aka Clarence Darrow), the liberal defense attorney for schoolteacher Bert Cates (Dick York) who has been placed on trial by his entire town for daring to teach Darwinism (i.e. evolution theory) in his classroom. Fredric March essays the role of Matthew Harrison Brady (aka William Jennings Bryan), fundamentalist Christian leader brought to the fictional town of Hillsboro (based on the real Dayton, Tennessee) to prosecute the case. What ensues is pure drama--a clash of wills and beliefs unprecedented onscreen, with Drummond as the undeniable hero for whom the audience is expected to have great sympathy, as he struggles in the face of the bigotry of the court and the people the judge (Harry Morgan) refuses to allow Drummond to bring in scientific evidence, which damns his case from the outset; the people of Hillsboro hold night marches through the streets, burning effigies of Cates and Drummond... a more frightening lynch mob can hardly be imagined. Although Brady does ultimately come off as the villain of the film, this judgement does not come unqualified. What the film strives very hard to prove, a moral that gets a little lost in the fierce arguments about religion and the apparently clashing theories of creation and evolution, is that everyone has a right to be different. What matters is the sanctity of the individual mind, which includes the right to reason, the right to think, the right to believe, the right to be different but also, most importantly the right to be wrong. The film is *not* preaching about the rights and wrongs of Darwinism. In fact, very tellingly, the audience is not informed about the specifics of the theory, just as the jury and the townsfolk in the film aren't. It doesn't matter. The villain here is bigotry, the refusal to allow people the rights earlier enumerated. Therefore it is most important that Brady should come off as a human being, one with just as many flaws as the next person. This the writers try very hard to do in creating, for example, the rocking chair scene between Drummond and Brady--it becomes evident that their friendship goes back several decades, that they have the greatest respect for each other as people, even if not for each other's beliefs and causes. It is Brady's refusal to examine his own beliefs that leads him into bigotry, but he is not the only person guilty of this--the townsfolk, of course, are the same way, with Reverend Jeremiah Brown (Claude Akins) being the best example. Even his daughter Rachel (Donna Anderson), who is engaged to Bert, must struggle with Bert's need to be different; the cynical E.K.
