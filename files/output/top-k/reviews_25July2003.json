Yes, I did get the point of the movie. And yes, I do appreciate the talents of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. But no, I did not like this movie. Fight Club is the manifesto for all those frustrated middle class white males out there; a permission slip for them to be mad at the world.

The issue is complicated, however, by excellent execution and a good first act.(Spoilers follow)Edward Norton plays your average joe who has everything--apartment, job, furniture. Everything, that is, but a life. This all changes for him when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and is told I want you to hit me as hard as you can. They start up a little fight club, a great little counter-culture type of thing where everyone like them can get their aggression at society out.

The movie is complicated by Project Mayhem, an offshoot of the fight club where members are asked to be part of some sort of cult. But wait a minute.

And does it make any sense to fight against society's propaganda by creating your own propaganda and creating an alternative society?Not really. But this movie doesn't care, and it doesn't expect us to ask these types of questions. It expects us to sit back, eat up the movie's philosophy and listen to Tyler Durden's endless preaching (only about half of which makes any sense or fit into any cohesive whole).

Often, similarly themed gangster movies can be slow in pace and boring in parts, but `Pulp Fiction' is delivered in such a slick, stylised manner that you won't notice the two and a half-hour running time pass by. The Oscar winning script is top-notch and brilliantly conceived. It's the jumping forward and back in time that makes the film work. Only at the end of the film do you realise in what order the events took place. And the interweaving and overlapping comes in the form of three vignettes. They used the term `series' of vignettes so that it would sound like more than three. It would have been smarter had it one or two more episodes, but as it is, all works quite well. The first is arguably the best. What makes this one work is the close attention to detail and memorable scenes that occur. The second story, `The Gold Watch' is also quite good. This is shuffled in second when it's actually how the film closes.And the third vignette, `The Bonnie Situation' is probably the funniest of the three. Also thrown in there is the café robbery involving `Pumpkin' and `Honeybunny'. The actors are given tremendous material to work with, but the huge ensemble cast is perfectly chosen and is probably the best since `Magnolia'. The lead star, John Travolta (Oscar nominated for his part), is always perfectly believable and brilliantly styled as hit man Vincent. But the performance isn't developed enough to consider above support. Samuel L. Jackson excellently portrays his counterpart, bible-bashing hit man Jules. Also lurking in there is Uma Thurman's exceptional delivery as the enigmatic, sassy femme fatale. Surprising is the fact that Bruce Willis got the most screen time yet received the coveted `and' credit.Along with this, there is plenty of star-power from a supporting cast that would make Robert Altman weep. Harvey Keitel, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Christopher Walken, Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth round up the cast and all give ideal, noteworthy performances. Quentin Tarantino also does a near flawless job in the director's chair, bring just the correct amount of style, grit and humour. With quotable dialogue, memorable scenes and unforgettable characters `Pulp Fiction' is a near masterpiece. Working better in the more satirical moments, it probably isn't for the squeamish and definitely not for the easily offended.

Liv Tyler plays a 19-year old girl named Lucy who travels to Italy to learn the identity of her father - but by the end of the movie I was too bored to tears to care - and lose her virginity, and no doubt she has all the guys more than willing to help her get rid of it.

I am a 29 year old male with a real job and life.  In fact, when I first saw this movie, I barely knew who Mandy Moore was.  I consider myself fairly well educated in the arts, having studied primarily theatre design, but film and music as well, in college.Regardless of the technical merits of the directing or the script, this is the first movie to actually get to me emotionally in years.  I simply fell in love with Jamie. To portray a such a character in a manner as to make her real and believable took real talent on the part of Mandy and real guidance from director Adam Shankman.  Her goodness could have easily been taken over the top.  Also to her credit, Mandy was sixteen when she took on this role.  While this may have made it somewhat easier for her to relate to Jamie, often actors twice her age do not portray characters with this much depth.  I believe she shows tremendous potential as an actor.Landon, as played by Shane West, while showing tremendous growth within the film, appeared at times lack complex motivation.  However, I feel that the character is still strong and that Shane is a fine actor.  While the remainder of the supporting characters sometimes felt oversimplified and one-dimensional, I still feel that the actors overall did a fine job.The real triumph of this film is the chemistry that exists between all of the characters, especially Jamie and Landon.  This is evidence of a director who knows what he is doing and a well-written screenplay.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"25 July 2003","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  An interesting, ambitious, and somewhat entertaining satire of television, but one that pretty much fails for a number of reasons. It's difficult to believe almost everything that happens in it. Not one of the characters rings true. William Holden is as boring in 1976 as he was in 1955, and his cliché relationship with Faye Dunnaway is not at all believable, and not even that interesting. Their scenes together go on forever, and Holden's character carries the trite and obvious metaphor of Dunnaway as television personified, and their relationship as soap opera far further than necessary. Dunnaway herself puts an amazing amount of energy into her performance, and she didn't not deserve the Oscar she won, if you'll excuse my double negative. But her character really is only the metaphor that Holden attributes her, so what ground can she win with that? Beatrice Straight gives a performance that's most famous for being the shortest that ever won an Oscar, only three minutes. I didn't know who Beatrice Straight was, but it's obvious when she starts giving her big speech, so showy that she induced me to roll my eyes as many times as inches tall her Oscar is; that must be a record, too. Robert Duvall fares the best among the major cast members, although he hasn't much of a character either.Peter Finch's performance is interesting, but his ranting gets old quick. While Howard Beale's first couple of ravings would undoubtedly raise people's interest (the `I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore' scene is as great as it is famous), but I doubt the television show that is developed for him, which apparently airs five days a week and runs for many months before the film ends, would ever attract an audience of any kind, except maybe a small bit who have a taste for public access television, which is what it seems like. I think people, especially the kind of disenfranchised, cynical people to whom Beale's show is supposed to appeal, would be much more critical and suspicious of a man who does his show opposite a psychic and in front of stained glass window.People always refer to Network as `prophetic,' and then claim their proof is stuff like Jerry Springer, Hard Copy and reality television. As much as some of us may hate those kinds of television shows, only the deranged or stupid would ever believe that When Animals Attack is harmful to anybody other than those who are being attacked by animals. Does anybody really believe that anyone would ever air programs like The Ecumenical Liberation League or whatever that was? Some of the scenes focusing on this new show which the network is developing seem to want to be comedy, although the film is too heavy-seeming to ever succeed in being comic. Anyhow, in the world of reality, in which Holden's character keeps trying to convince Dunnaway and the film's audience that the story is really happening, the network's lawyers would have stopped them immediately. I will say that the film is prescient in only one way Ned Beatty, who appears for one scene, has the most intriguing part, where he says, among other thingsIt is the international system of currency which determines the vitality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things today! And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature! And you will atone! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. It comes out of right field in the film - well, kind of. The almighty dollar is the driving force of the film, and, the film realizes correctly, the world. But what Network does not understand is how television works to propagate this system, or perhaps how it would. It's too busy finding its subject, television, overtly evil when it misses the ways it can be more subtly evil. Not that I think all TV is evil or anything. Personally, I watch a lot of television and enjoy it immensely. I don't think it is particularly wicked, and I actually think that there's a lot of great art to be found on television (yes I do!). However, most of the evil I do see comes from the news. I wasn't around in 1976, so I can't say whether or not the news was as suspicious and creepy back then, but, if Network really had been prophetic, it would have at least got some of the satire right. 7\/10.
