When he emerged from his coma days later, he was changed somehow, and never again the same person he had been, according to an elder female relative.This is the type of detail that another writer than Thornton Wilder, or another director than Alfred Hitchcock, might have glossed over. But both of them had an uncanny sense of how things work in reality, and I believe it is this which lends an air of verisimilitude even to their most outlandish story premise. History tells of people who were injured in the frontal area of the brain, and how their character changed afterward they felt no more empathy, love or remorse; only greed, fear, suspicion and anger, with joy only visiting their lives when they won some contest or struggle against another person. Modern science finds that the Conscience seems to reside in that part of the brain, and to leak out when the area is injured, leaving the recovering patient a functional sociopath.Unlike some of those who have commented, I found Charles Oakley a very believable character. Unfortunately, I knew a sociopath personally (not a serial killer, as far as I know! just manipulative and extremely selfish), and he was charming and likable - until he was crossed. His family knew all about him, yet even so could be lulled by his wheedling and flattery into believing his lies just this once. Normal people WANT to believe there's good in everyone, and the sociopath takes advantage of that to manipulate them. Once the sociopath knows you're on to him (or her), however, and won't be fooled by him anymore, the mask drops and he shows his true nature. That's when things start to get nasty.That is what we see happening in Shadow of A Doubt. Charles is quickly able to convince the whole town of what a great guy he is, and even with his little slips and gaffes - like his outrageously cynical banter with his brother-in-law at the bank - people overlook such aberrations and make excuses for him, because they want to believe in him. The children in the story, however, are less set in their ways. Like children in reality, they take people as they find them, and are quick to wise up about Good Old Uncle Charlie, even though the younger two never seem to be aware of the full extent of his evil. It's very clear to them that there is something wrong with him, but everyone else is in nearly complete denial, and in a kind of role reversal, the children want to protect the adults' peace of mind. Young Charlie and her younger siblings want to protect their mother from finding out what a monster her beloved younger brother has become (or perhaps they are only stoic about the unlikelihood of her believing anything they might say against him). Unfortunately, his death is the only thing that allows her to maintain her cherished illusions about her brother.

You can say that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the movie that set the standards for animated movies and was a sign of things to come. It's also the reason why the movie won a special Academy Award for 'pioneering a great new entertainment field'. It was not awarded on simple Academy Award but also 7 smaller ones along with it. A nice and fitting tribute.Even though it's the very first full length animated Disney feature it's also actually one of the most daring ones. Some moments are truly scary done and the movie features some real horror like moments and even a skeleton in a shocking scene. No way Disney movies would allow these sort of imagery these days. It shows they were still looking for the right style and approach for their movies at the Disney studios.But it's funny to note how little the animation style had actually changed for the Disney movies over the years. Right till the '90's Disney movies used the same animation style and were just as good and smooth looking as this movie. It makes it all the movie obvious what a great accomplishment for 1937 this movie was. Not only the characters and their movies are looking fine but also the backgrounds and all of the other little details in it.So it's not a movie that is outdated with its style but it of course is with its story. As a matter of fact Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs story is shockingly simply and there hardly is any story development. It also is disgustingly happy and friendly with all of the cuddly animals in it and the sweet character of Snow White herself. But yet this at the same time is definitely part of the charm of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.While the comedy is not as good or much present as would be the case in a Disney short, featuring Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse for example, it still is a very fun movie to watch, which is due to the overall atmosphere of the movie and the likability of the characters.The characters from this movie are still among the best and most memorable ones out of all Disney movies. Not just Snow White herself but also obviously the seven dwarfs, who also make the movie mostly entertaining to watch.

Such is the case with 'Blue Juice,' a 1995 Brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem (to a dumb American, anyway) an even more unlikely place to find surfers Cornwall, England. You might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing, quirky little comedy. If only. The film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable. The easiest way to describe it is as a sort of '90's British version of 'Grease' without the dancing, but even that makes it sound better than it is. No, the best way to take it is as a little slice-of-life set in a small town. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Chloe, a young woman living with a surfing instructor, JC (Sean Pertwee; you remember him). Pertwee is actually the film's star, and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees, the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this. In this case, it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist, a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer, and a fat nerdy guy who, in a needlessly extended scene, gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him. I can't honestly say everything that goes on in 'Blue Juice' is predictable, since it's set in a place and reflects customs and manners I'm not very familiar with, but there's certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters. The comedy, though, IS very predictable and tired. One can sense the set-ups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue (in American form, of course) before the actors do.

He's afraid of losing face with his gang; she thinks he prefers them to her. You get the idea.

I had also always owned it, and had watched it on numerous occasions. Time went by without a watch for many, many years, as I lost interest in it for a awhile, and then later on, when I became more indulged in the film life, I saw it in my collection and decided it was time to freshen up on it. I popped it in and was ready to be overwhelmed with the memories of how great this film truly manages to hold up being over time.I thought this movie was overall just a really great and enjoyable little film that even though it was just meant for entertainment, ended up being so lovable and cherished, much more than I thought I would love and cherish it. What was really that bad about it, folks? I have heard a lot of negativity directed at this film for being a weak Dreamworks animation with practically no depth or originality. Depth? Originality? You were honestly looking for those qualities with Small Soldiers? Maybe if you would lighten up on it, you'd enjoy it for the truly fun and enticing film it is. Some I bet were already even doubting it from the start, which that's no way to enter with a film as lighthearted and good-willed as Small Soldiers.Most of the comedic antics were quite laughable, and that's laughable in the tasteful kind of way, especially the renovated Barbies and cowardliness of the Gorgonites. It completely entertains you, and it certainly keeps you interested through the whole movie with the fun characters and non-stop deliverance of toy warfare and excellent voice-overs. The fighting scenes were cool and amusing, and the script was pretty different and new, even though many think Dreamworks tries to silently and sneakily follow in the footsteps of previous Disney\/Pixar films that are big hits, in this case, Toy Story.I don't see why this movie has the rating it does, for I thought a lot more people would've liked it better than this, but I guess not everybody can spot a great film when they see one. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I completely recommend it, because it is a nice little movie that I am honored to own. It is getting too much harsh treatment.

As many have pointed out, an excellent satire.I want to respond to criticisms point by point.Shallow, mindless crappy formulaic Hollywood action-flick? ... actually I'm not even going to bother responding to this one.Weak Science Fiction? Verhoeven uses science-fiction as a method for projecting current social trends into extremes. It's a form of reductio ad absurdum. See what happens if this ideology takes over. Those who believe that real science fiction is only hard science fiction (i.e. effectively fiction about science) are completely disregarding much of the potential of the genre. Furthermore - I firmly believe that the scientific mistakes are entirely intentional. The film is full of absurdities (e.g. the bugs are considered to have intentionally launched an asteroid from the other side of the galaxy to hit Earth. The mathematical genius required to calculate such a launch, not to mention the faster than light travel, clearly imply very high intelligence, yet the bugs are still considered unintelligent). There are many such examples - resolving these problems, whilst not always impossible (in this case, e.g., maybe the rulers knew the bugs were intelligent and actually meant for the initial invasion to be a disaster for propaganda reasons - maintaining social cohesion of the federation must be a difficult task - having a truly feared and despised enemy is an effective force for controlling one's people, etc.), is missing the point I think. This is a truly post-modern film, and consciously so. The vehicle is the standard American action movie. I think considering it a mere parody of the genre is too limited. Verhoeven is using the genre not just to mock it but because this kind of film derives and culminates directly from the kind of ideological premises he is criticising.Fails to copy the book? Yes - yes it does. Is that a problem? I mean, if you like the book, fine - but did you really go to see the film because you were too lazy to read the book again? Verhoeven's adaptation of the book is a cover, if you like - and like any self-respecting artist, he is bringing to the work being covered his own perspective. Consider the Sex Pistols' 'God save the queen', or 'I did it my way'. Those are valid covers (ok 'God save the queen' perhaps doesn't exactly qualify as a cover, but it also refers to what it is criticising by sharing its title with its target). The Cohen brothers' adaptation of 'No country for old men' is also a valid cover - you don't have to be critical of the original for your version to be valid - but you do have to make the song your own. The Heinlein is chosen for the same reasons as Verhoeven chose the standard Hollywood action movie they exemplify the ideology that he despises, that he is warning us against. It's not surprising, of course, that the people who watched the film because they loved the book found the film unappealing the ideology of the book is satirised and condemned, much of the content is ignored (because irrelevant to the point being made), etc. Imagine the reaction of a British royalist who bought God Save the Queen having looked no further than the title.The acting sucks? Well of course it does - frankly, if Verhoeven had hired the best actors\/actresses in the world to perform these roles, he would have had to brief them to act just as VanDien and Richards do, and I doubt they would have done it as convincingly as the real thing. In a sense, Verhoeven is like Ken Loach &#150; he has people play themselves. The roles are of and by cliché wooden pretty soap actors and actresses. No depth of character may be allowed to slip out. The whole film is staged to perfection to be a standard Hollywood action\/teen highschool movie.Those who complain that the characters aren't likable and that therefore they didn't like the movie may have a point, in a twisted sort of way. I think it was Verhoeven's intention to make the characters likable at the surface level at the level of the action-flick, we root for them. If having characters to root for is a primary concern when watching a film, then you're probably not looking for much in the way of depth of artistry - so if you didn't like the characters it would imply that Verhoeven failed. Personally I disagree I think that at the immersion level we do root for the heroes - particularly VanDien. Richards' character is superficially ambiguous and at the immersion level we are meant to mistrust her. The simplistic techniques used to bring about these shallow characterisations are deliberately so. The utopian culmination of the ideology Verhoeven rejects would be a world in which these stereotypical ideal cut-out characters were real. Inversely, if this formulaic hollywoodian image of the world were real, we would drift inexorably towards the dominance of such ideology.It's a bad satire? I'd really need you to give some examples of good satire - and I'd still not be satisfied. There are numerous ways to satirise - but the classic approach (exemplified by Swift in his 'Modest Proposal' I think)is to produce a work which mirrors the style of the people you are criticising whilst exaggerating their content sufficiently subtly that a naive reader\/viewer could mistake it for the real thing. This is exactly the case for Starship Troopers. He is satirising bad movies, right-wing ideology and propaganda and has been accused of making a bad movie that is propaganda for right-wing ideology.

Thank God the film is on DVD so I can jump around to the good parts and avoid all the horrible filler material.First of all, I loved the scenery that formed the film background. Who would not enjoy this splendid area, some of the most beautiful in the whole world? The Ludlow home was very rustic and inviting. The perfect backdrop for the film.Then there was the idea of an Army officer becoming so disgusted with the abuse of native peoples that he turned his back on his military career. He attempted to redress the injustices by his incorporation of the old Cree warrior One-Stab into his household. Three sons are born to him before his wife flees back to the comforts of civilization. All this came out as promising material for a great film.Then a young Tristan Ludlow seeks out a sleeping grizzly bear and picks a fight. Amazingly, he survives with only superficial slash marks on his arm. For an animal that can easily split a large log with one swipe of his claws, that is a pathetic response to the provocation endured. The film goes downhill from there.The patriarch, Colonel Ludlow, is apparently content to live without the comfort of a wife in an isolated ranch in Montana. His cultured wife is too refined to stay with him in self-imposed exile. That would seem grounds for divorce even in the conservative America in the early 1900s. What kind of mother would abandon her young sons to allow her to enjoy a more comfortable life? Perhaps that explains why Tristan turned out so badly.The youngest of three sons, Samuel, returns home from college in Massachusetts with a stunning fiancé, Susannah Fincannon, who apparently has no close living relatives. How this woman managed to support herself and move in fairly privileged social circles is left a mystery. A woman in that era would find it difficult to survive outside the support of a family. Samuel is such a nonentity that one is forced to conclude that his fiancé latched on to him in desperation for a husband to support her continued social position.The actor Henry Thomas, who played Samuel, is six years younger than Julia Ormond who played Susannah. The age difference is so glaring as to be ludicrous. This pairing is obviously doomed from the start. I instantly knew that the plot would swiftly remove Samuel to make room for Tristan, Brad Pitt, to move in on the tempting Susannah.Susannah is actually an admirable person, for the most part. She tries to fit in to the frontier lifestyle and to bond with the people who work for the Ludlows on the ranch. She does her best to become a useful member of the family, able to help out with ranch work when needed. What sticks for me is the protracted engagement to Samuel. She is moved in to the home of her fiancée, the family welcomes her presence. Why is she not going through with the wedding? The answer is two words, Tristan Ludlow.Susannah has fallen for older brother Tristan, even from a distance. Samuel senses her growing infatuation and attempts to justify his claim to manhood by an absurd decision to join the British Army and fight in World War I. The two older brothers join him with lesser degrees of conviction. All the noble reasons for this decision are really covers for Samuel's feelings of inadequacy. The three brothers set out for nearby Canada, where they can join the British Army.The war kills Samuel, wounds elder brother Alfred, and drives Tristan nuts. The two surviving brothers are released from their service for reasons left unclear. I am sure many soldiers at the front would have liked to simply walk away from the carnage.

Thank God the film is on DVD so I can jump around to the good parts and avoid all the horrible filler material.First of all, I loved the scenery that formed the film background. Who would not enjoy this splendid area, some of the most beautiful in the whole world? The Ludlow home was very rustic and inviting. The perfect backdrop for the film.Then there was the idea of an Army officer becoming so disgusted with the abuse of native peoples that he turned his back on his military career. He attempted to redress the injustices by his incorporation of the old Cree warrior One-Stab into his household. Three sons are born to him before his wife flees back to the comforts of civilization. All this came out as promising material for a great film.Then a young Tristan Ludlow seeks out a sleeping grizzly bear and picks a fight. Amazingly, he survives with only superficial slash marks on his arm. For an animal that can easily split a large log with one swipe of his claws, that is a pathetic response to the provocation endured. The film goes downhill from there.The patriarch, Colonel Ludlow, is apparently content to live without the comfort of a wife in an isolated ranch in Montana. His cultured wife is too refined to stay with him in self-imposed exile. That would seem grounds for divorce even in the conservative America in the early 1900s. What kind of mother would abandon her young sons to allow her to enjoy a more comfortable life? Perhaps that explains why Tristan turned out so badly.The youngest of three sons, Samuel, returns home from college in Massachusetts with a stunning fiancé, Susannah Fincannon, who apparently has no close living relatives. How this woman managed to support herself and move in fairly privileged social circles is left a mystery. A woman in that era would find it difficult to survive outside the support of a family. Samuel is such a nonentity that one is forced to conclude that his fiancé latched on to him in desperation for a husband to support her continued social position.The actor Henry Thomas, who played Samuel, is six years younger than Julia Ormond who played Susannah. The age difference is so glaring as to be ludicrous. This pairing is obviously doomed from the start. I instantly knew that the plot would swiftly remove Samuel to make room for Tristan, Brad Pitt, to move in on the tempting Susannah.Susannah is actually an admirable person, for the most part. She tries to fit in to the frontier lifestyle and to bond with the people who work for the Ludlows on the ranch. She does her best to become a useful member of the family, able to help out with ranch work when needed. What sticks for me is the protracted engagement to Samuel. She is moved in to the home of her fiancée, the family welcomes her presence. Why is she not going through with the wedding? The answer is two words, Tristan Ludlow.Susannah has fallen for older brother Tristan, even from a distance. Samuel senses her growing infatuation and attempts to justify his claim to manhood by an absurd decision to join the British Army and fight in World War I. The two older brothers join him with lesser degrees of conviction. All the noble reasons for this decision are really covers for Samuel's feelings of inadequacy. The three brothers set out for nearby Canada, where they can join the British Army.The war kills Samuel, wounds elder brother Alfred, and drives Tristan nuts. The two surviving brothers are released from their service for reasons left unclear. I am sure many soldiers at the front would have liked to simply walk away from the carnage. Alfred comes home and tries to woo Susannah, with her firm rejection. She waits a few months for Tristan to eventually come home.Tristan wastes no time.

So right now I'm glad I saw this one after so many years; Back to the Future is the quintessential movie entertainment with two memorable characters, one memorable car and, of course, a magnificent time travel story full of fun and romance but not in a near or far future but in 1955.

Fox) is in high school, loves to play guitar with his band, is ready to spend more time with his girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) and the scientist and inventor Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is his friend. Here we also meet Marty's parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson), and also the abusive boss of George, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson). But is the Doc the one who is going to change everything for Marty with his latest invention that could be his own masterpiece a De Lorean that works as a time machine.I really like how in this picture the time travel stuff was used in a simple but great way. You can travel to any time but not to any place and of course, once in the past, anything you do will have consequences. The picture plays again in a simple way to focus just in the story of Marty's parents in 1955, in high school. Since everybody that Marty knows seems to be just as they are in 1985 (except his mother) his problem with the time machine is in good hands with a young Doc that looks exactly as in 1985 (funny). So the issue is just to get together George and Lorraine but that is going to be a -funny- problem since Marty has already replace his father and now he is the object of love of his own mother!Many funny details with Marty Calvin Klein Darth Vader McFly and even what could be just a pretext to use one of the greatest songs in rock and roll history (if that was the case is still good since the song is Johnny B. Goode) turns to be just a great, memorable and hilarious scene with the cousin of Chuck. And in the end everything was just right on time for Marty and Doc, even way better, and leaves everything for more pictures.Cast Both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are terrific; in the case of J. Fox this is the role for what I know him and eventually the one for what I always recognize him. Almost the same for Lloyd but he was also in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Robert Zemeckis, 1988) and in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Milos Forman, 1975). Crispin Glover is also terrific as a really weird but eventually lucky character.Conclusion Back to the Future is just a classic family entertainment with a magnificent story.

The plot deals with whether the boys (all on the basketball team) will throw the final game of the season or not to save their coach who owes Porky a lot of money.
