Time is a cold and objective master that can either play as your ally or your enemy, and its treacherousness is that you can never tell until you determine all the consequences, until the GAME is finally OVER. Run Lola Run illustrates the video game-related aspect of life, with only one game to play. In a self-reflexive aesthetics, it features a heroine that looks like a manga version of Lara Croft, but with a vulnerability that makes her profoundly human. Lola's mission is to find 100 000 marks for Manni, her boyfriend who might get killed by his 'employer', it's a matter of life an death. And what makes the couple so appealing is the love both have to each other, and the mission works like a test of this love. And Manni is not a passive character as he also tries to find a solution. Lola must think, and fast, she knows which door to knock at, then she runs, and runs and runs. She's not an athlete, she's not the kind of character with a healthy condition, and her reaction is almost of pure panic as she embarks us in this exhilarating quest for money.

Not to make Run Lola Run a metaphysical introspection into the true meaning of life with so many divine interventions, call them the work of providence or again, purely hazards, but the movie shows with a cold detachment combined with a clever cynicism how life is made of unexpected little details that condition our futures. One day, you buy a lottery ticket, or you take the wrong turn in the road, or you have an accident and fall in love with the nurse, etc etc. And your powerlessness, in this succession of events is that you never know what will come at you and where this will lead you. The movie is inter-cut with brief flashbacks showing the love between Lola and Manni and how both are aware of the random aspect of a love that'll never stop being a hostage of the future. But life is also about the awareness of that passive condition and the heroic struggle to overcome it. This is why Lola is one of the greatest cinematic heroines, she embodies the inspiring strength of someone who refuses to give up, even with twenty minutes left to her. She must succeed, she's flawed, she's not confident, but God knows that she'll try, even when struck by that panic that make her scream her lungs out with that disturbingly shrill sound, as the cry of despair to get off this &#x96;vulnerable yet so universal- condition.PHASE 3  CINEMA, CINEMA, CINEMA &#x85; Run, Lola Run is a cinematic little gem that reminds us of that sacred period where the video-games were a biggest trend than the Internet, where the Marks weren't replaced yet by the Euros, the late 90's with their crazy exuberance and delightful creativity that brought up so many masterpieces of editing like Pi, Fight Club and Run, Lola Run a movie that gets better after each viewing, thanks to Franka Potente's unique appeal, and her believable chemistry with Morriz Bleibtreu as Manny, but also Tom Tykwer's stylish and flamboyant direction, served by a top notch editing, with a repetitiveness that makes the choice of Techno music absolutely relevant, like the musical allegory of that adrenalin-loaded action structuring the whole narrative, with each viewing revealing a new detail.

Back then I didn't know yet that many of the recent movies I saw were in reality remakes. In other words, I didn't know there were original versions.At the time, I had good expectations about Vanilla Sky, partially because of its delicious title and partially because it appeared to be good. I was frankly disappointed with it.This one, the original and true version, is superior, easily eclipsing the remake. Even what seemed good in Vanilla Sky before seems mediocre next to the original. If you want 'Vanilla Sky' done right, don't look any further - this is it.Admittedly, it's still not an easy movie, but it's marginally easier to understand than the flawed American version. But even the original requires extra attention, otherwise it will be even more confusing. It's also more intriguing, more suspenseful, more tragic, more touching, more original, more artistic, deeper and more intense, not to mention it has a very nice soundtrack.Overall, a movie of higher quality. And ahead of its time. In 1997, movies this brave and complex were something from another world or even another planet. Nowadays we easily find movies like this, but in 1997 that was another music.On paper, Abre los ojos is the predictable story of a young man (César) who has everything in life he is rich, good-looking, popular among his friends and lucky with women. That's the easy part. Behind this simple idea lies an extraordinary and exceptionally complex story. Unexpectedly, César meets the charming Sofia and instantly falls in love with her. She corresponds but soon César's life changes completely, when his insanely jealous lover Nuria tricks him into a trap by offering him a ride, covering her true intentions. She intentionally commits suicide by crashing the car. César survives, but his face gets seriously deformed.César is willing to pay anything for a cosmetic surgery, so that he can have his normal face again, return to his life and reconquer Sofia. Much for César's sorrow, nobody can (or doesn't want to) operate his face. After that traumatizing experience, César becomes emotionally unstable, aggressive, confused, deeply depressed and his mental health changes dangerously he suffers from flashbacks, disturbing visions, is unable to distinguish dreams from reality and even confounds Sofia with Nuria - and by seeing Nuria instead of Sofia, he reacts with violence to that and the innocent Sofia is the one who pays. To tell the truth, the film comes to a point which is almost impossible to tell what's real and what's not - but all this complicated mess only makes it more interesting and remarkable. An amazing yet strong movie with also a surprising ending...But the movie isn't all about tragedy. There is also a romance between César and Sofia, and there is some sexuality. The lovely Penélope Cruz is seen naked. Penélope is beautiful with clothes, but naked she is simply divine. And she's got very lovely boobs.Eduardo Noriega is superb, so much better than Tom Cruise. The actress who plays Nuria, despite her minor role, is clearly superior to Cameron Diaz. Penélope Cruz is in both versions and plays the same role in both but she is better in this one. Maybe it was the pressure and boredom of doing the same thing twice, which affects the performance? Maybe because in the original she speaks her native language? Must be that. Not that I blame her. I love Chete Lera's fantastic acting as Antonio and Gérard Barray's terrific acting as Serge Duvernois (and he speaks Spanish so well that you don't even notice any french accent on him).

I guess the comedic aspect of the script &#x96;rightfully Oscar nominated- might have disoriented those who expected a solid courtroom drama. Yet the laughs worked for me, and if I wouldn't dare to label this a comedy, I must say that laughs never worked as well as when you expected serious stuff, especially when the film is served by one hell of a spectacular performance from Al Pacino, earning him his fifth Oscar nomination of the 70's.The comedy works because it conveys the subtle notion that some things would be too tragic if they were not so absurd, and the absurdity denounced in the film relies on the pervert effect of bureaucracy on the American judicial system. Norman Jewison's film is an extremely well-written satire of the judicial system, offering many perspectives on the way, justice can be handled with many vivid examples on the most dysfunctional elements, at a point that you almost get the feeling of an episodic film that sometimes loses its track, but this is trivial when you consider the pedagogic value of &#x85; And Justice For All.You have all the pros and cons of the Judicial system presented, beyond all the ideals and the noble words, there is a stinking atmosphere of corruption, if not in the procedures, in the human, which is saying a lot when the human factor is so preponderant. The hero of this tragicomedy is Arthur Kirkland while his colleagues reminded of a line from one of my Business School teachers, who told us that you can be absolutely professional AND a complete bastard, you can be a bastard and respect the rules, and on a bigger scale, the Law. This idea is totally unacceptable on an ethical level for Kirkland, who tries not to be just a lawyer, but a man of principles and ideals, like those expressed by children's voices in the beginning of the film, concluding with &#x85; And Justice For All said in unison.Four simple words that summarize a noble ideal, and an ellipsis to sustain the idea that this is what it's all about at the end, this is the Alpha and the Omega. And Arthur Kirkland's struggle is to revive a certain noble idea of Justice. As the movie goes on, we learn about the many judicial oddities that cruelly underline the flaws of the system, one man arrested for a taillight and kept in jail because he was suspected for murder, the burden was refused because of a delay of three days in the procedures, another man sentenced to jail because his lawyer couldn't even check his file correctly, while another one, played by a scene-stealer Jeffrey Tambor, was so talented, he allowed the acquittal of a killer, based on a technicality, allowing two new murders to be committed, he did his job but at what price?Progressively, the humor fades out while the decisive aspect of the human factor, for worse, is proved. And we can only hope, that Arthur Kirkland would use his humanity for the best and not let himself corrupted by the bureaucratic system, and become a professional instead of an ethical lawyer. This is the inspirational core of the film the moral conflict lying beneath the soul of Arthur Kirkland and incarnated by the case he must defend, his personal enemy, Judge Fleming, John Forsythe in a powerful and nuanced antagonistic role, is accused of rape. Fleming is the one who kept Arthur's client for jail because of the delay, Kirkland threw him a punch him in the face, getting directly to jail, and last but not least, Kirkland already betrayed another client who was really guilty. To avoid being disbarred, Arthur must defend his client, who reveals himself to be guilty.Arthur Kirkland is put in the wall besides his own moral conflict, and this is what the whole movie is about, making us root for a character who, in an existential impulse, must question the very meaning of his vocation. In a poignant discussion with his grandfather, portrayed by Lee Strasberg, (Michael Corleone's archenemy from The Godfather Part II), Arthur is reminded that honesty is the most important value. And this idea is proved as he realizes the emotional downfall of his colleague who let the killer getting free. What's the purpose of a system that doesn't guarantee justice for those who really need it, where justice depends on a talent more than an ethic? Is justice a system or an ideal? Is it reliable or ... totally out of order? Well, let's say that whatever slowness have bothered you in the beginning, the climax makes it all worth it. In the same vein of The Verdict or Kramer vs. Kramer, &#x85; And Justice For All allows a reflexion on the practicality of Justice and the way it should make the lawyers feel invested by a noble mission.And apart from that, the movie strikes by the originality of its tone where we get to discover a lawyer in a jail, where a judge with suicidal impulses fires a gun to have silence, Jack Warden is absolutely priceless &#x85; and where you'll have one of the most communicative laugh scenes ever, the movie is entertaining and enjoyable at many levels, and if I mentioned Lee Strasberg, it's also a pleasure to rediscover his Sicilian sidekick, Johnny Ola as his first client. And above all these elements, there's Al Pacino's intense performances made of laughs, shouts, cries, powerful silences, and desperate outbursts of anger. Al Pacino is the soul of the moral dilemma structuring the film, and having seen all the Oscar nominated performances from 1979, the fact that he didn't win an Oscar can be called &#x85; Injustice For Al ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2011","score":"","review":" Whenever I have the pleasure to watch &#x85; And Justice for All, I try to understand why this movie isn't as discussed and revered as it should be.

Norman Jewison's film is an extremely well-written satire of the judicial system, offering many perspectives on the way, justice can be handled with many vivid examples on the most dysfunctional elements, at a point that you almost get the feeling of an episodic film that sometimes loses its track, but this is trivial when you consider the pedagogic value of &#x85; And Justice For All.You have all the pros and cons of the Judicial system presented, beyond all the ideals and the noble words, there is a stinking atmosphere of corruption, if not in the procedures, in the human, which is saying a lot when the human factor is so preponderant.

And Arthur Kirkland's struggle is to revive a certain noble idea of Justice. As the movie goes on, we learn about the many judicial oddities that cruelly underline the flaws of the system, one man arrested for a taillight and kept in jail because he was suspected for murder, the burden was refused because of a delay of three days in the procedures, another man sentenced to jail because his lawyer couldn't even check his file correctly, while another one, played by a scene-stealer Jeffrey Tambor, was so talented, he allowed the acquittal of a killer, based on a technicality, allowing two new murders to be committed, he did his job but at what price?Progressively, the humor fades out while the decisive aspect of the human factor, for worse, is proved. And we can only hope, that Arthur Kirkland would use his humanity for the best and not let himself corrupted by the bureaucratic system, and become a professional instead of an ethical lawyer. This is the inspirational core of the film the moral conflict lying beneath the soul of Arthur Kirkland and incarnated by the case he must defend, his personal enemy, Judge Fleming, John Forsythe in a powerful and nuanced antagonistic role, is accused of rape. Fleming is the one who kept Arthur's client for jail because of the delay, Kirkland threw him a punch him in the face, getting directly to jail, and last but not least, Kirkland already betrayed another client who was really guilty. To avoid being disbarred, Arthur must defend his client, who reveals himself to be guilty.Arthur Kirkland is put in the wall besides his own moral conflict, and this is what the whole movie is about, making us root for a character who, in an existential impulse, must question the very meaning of his vocation. In a poignant discussion with his grandfather, portrayed by Lee Strasberg, (Michael Corleone's archenemy from The Godfather Part II), Arthur is reminded that honesty is the most important value. And this idea is proved as he realizes the emotional downfall of his colleague who let the killer getting free. What's the purpose of a system that doesn't guarantee justice for those who really need it, where justice depends on a talent more than an ethic? Is justice a system or an ideal?

In fact, it was our point-of-view in the world of these films that was made to be alien. The human being was invaded by or, as here, melded with the monster.The Thing was relatively clean-cut, like most of Carpenter's stuff. But Cronenberg goes further; he knows what propels the grisly transformations that we experience on the visible level, and is more interested in exploring the act of the transformation itself.I am not talking about SFX here, which is pretty good to this day. Both these films I personally feel are vastly hampered by this desire to make overly visible, to please the curious eye. We are no longer teased out with shadows and outlines, but get to see every ungodly detail. It's a painful process we undergo, the birth of new life. But gooey and prosthetic nonetheless, and distracting from the actual transformation that is happening inside.But with Cronenberg the warts really work in his favor; the gooey and prosthetic help vividly describe a prosthetic worldview. It's a very specific, original cinematic world, fertile with ecstasies of the flesh. The fashions, the technology, especially the technology so crucial in his films, always make me feel like they describe an 80's future that waits just around the corner.So, sex as what makes the flesh crazy - and being crazy, curious, excited about the flesh as an essential prerequisite of being human. Love as what transports between worlds, the movement itself a transformation. But love tainted by even the tiniest flying speck of doubt, even unbeknownst to the conscious mind, produces a monster of a human being on the other end.Cronenberg would return to this in Videodrome, there more eloquently on one hand the burning desire to transcend the body, the old flesh that keeps the spirit caged, on the other hand the impossibility of that transcendence as long as the mind remains impure. So this is why the attempted transformation is always ugly in Cronenberg, revolting, and why it's always left incomplete; the tainted mind - with ignorance, desire, ego, fear - transforms in its image.

The ending is painful, emotional, perhaps too earnest. The hubris is paid back, but we feel sorry because we know Prometheus meant well.Emotionally heavy, this is the part I don't care much for, but otherwise intellectually light Cronenberg.

Action pictures became bloodier, dramas became swearier, and romances became openly sexual. One of the earliest movies to show this change was The Graduate, a movie that pushed at the boundaries of taste not with smut but simply by showing who might be getting into bed with whom, and why.It's an interesting story we have here. On the one hand it follows a very traditional romantic story arc that can be traced all the way back to Jane Austen. Our hero is at first attracted to one member of the opposite sex, only to find the relationship unfulfilling, and find that the right choice was under his nose all along. The difference of course is that The Graduate is very frank about how bizarrely messy real world relationships can be. There is perhaps a bit of a 1950s-style dig at assertive women (the plot is basically An American in Paris if Nina Foch was Leslie Caron's mother). Ben Braddock makes a distinctly creepy lead man as well, conceivably only a couple of nudges away from Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, to the point where it's unbelievable that Elaine should fall for him. But the whole thing has such a sly, anarchic slant to it that it's enjoyable despite these dubious factors.The director here is a young Mike Nichols. Nichols is really good at playing with the images so that we only focus on the main characters. Often a minor character will appear with their back to the camera, contravening regular film grammar. Even when a character is more prominent, for example Mr Robinson or Carl, they are cleverly shot and lit so that while we remember what they do and say, we don't really get a clear look at them and they don't linger in the mind. Nichols is somewhat heavy-handed at times in trying to absorb us in the mood of a scene (the lengthy moving close-up of Dustin Hoffman at the party is a rather too artificial), but it certainly does the trick, even if it's headache-inducing at times. The precision involved can be exquisite too. The first time we see Anne Bancroft at the party, she might as well be just another extra, but she has a bit of clear space around her, and looks up just as the camera pauses, and thus we notice her, without actually realising yet that she's important.The Graduate also gives us some fine examples of acting. Ms Bancroft is the best, only marginally convincing age-wise, but certainly possessing of all the bitterness and frustration necessary for the role. Dustin Hoffman is deceptively quiet here, never really seeming to show much personality, but when for example he announces his intentions to marry Elaine he has the necessary conviction despite his quietness. Katharine Ross gives a decent turn too, having the most overstated role but keeping it within the bounds of naturalism. No-one else really stands out, but of course that is the whole point of Nichols's directorial scheme.When motion pictures became more explicit about sex, there was inevitably a great hue and cry from many in Hollywood's old guard. A lot of this was simple prudery, but others had more practical objections. Raoul Walsh for example, in his highly entertaining autobiography, says how in the old days all the tension was in when the romantic leads would finally get together, but in the modern era they will probably be shown having sex a third of the way through the movie, and that tension is gone. He has a point, but I think The Graduate puts forward a case for the sexualising of romantic cinema as something which makes the depiction of relationships more interesting, more compelling. It is, if nothing else, more true to life.

Nichols is really good at playing with the images so that we only focus on the main characters. Often a minor character will appear with their back to the camera, contravening regular film grammar. Even when a character is more prominent, for example Mr Robinson or Carl, they are cleverly shot and lit so that while we remember what they do and say, we don't really get a clear look at them and they don't linger in the mind. Nichols is somewhat heavy-handed at times in trying to absorb us in the mood of a scene (the lengthy moving close-up of Dustin Hoffman at the party is a rather too artificial), but it certainly does the trick, even if it's headache-inducing at times. The precision involved can be exquisite too. The first time we see Anne Bancroft at the party, she might as well be just another extra, but she has a bit of clear space around her, and looks up just as the camera pauses, and thus we notice her, without actually realising yet that she's important.The Graduate also gives us some fine examples of acting. Ms Bancroft is the best, only marginally convincing age-wise, but certainly possessing of all the bitterness and frustration necessary for the role. Dustin Hoffman is deceptively quiet here, never really seeming to show much personality, but when for example he announces his intentions to marry Elaine he has the necessary conviction despite his quietness. Katharine Ross gives a decent turn too, having the most overstated role but keeping it within the bounds of naturalism. No-one else really stands out, but of course that is the whole point of Nichols's directorial scheme.When motion pictures became more explicit about sex, there was inevitably a great hue and cry from many in Hollywood's old guard. A lot of this was simple prudery, but others had more practical objections. Raoul Walsh for example, in his highly entertaining autobiography, says how in the old days all the tension was in when the romantic leads would finally get together, but in the modern era they will probably be shown having sex a third of the way through the movie, and that tension is gone. He has a point, but I think The Graduate puts forward a case for the sexualising of romantic cinema as something which makes the depiction of relationships more interesting, more compelling. It is, if nothing else, more true to life.

Action pictures became bloodier, dramas became swearier, and romances became openly sexual. One of the earliest movies to show this change was The Graduate, a movie that pushed at the boundaries of taste not with smut but simply by showing who might be getting into bed with whom, and why.It's an interesting story we have here. On the one hand it follows a very traditional romantic story arc that can be traced all the way back to Jane Austen. Our hero is at first attracted to one member of the opposite sex, only to find the relationship unfulfilling, and find that the right choice was under his nose all along. The difference of course is that The Graduate is very frank about how bizarrely messy real world relationships can be. There is perhaps a bit of a 1950s-style dig at assertive women (the plot is basically An American in Paris if Nina Foch was Leslie Caron's mother). Ben Braddock makes a distinctly creepy lead man as well, conceivably only a couple of nudges away from Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, to the point where it's unbelievable that Elaine should fall for him.

So, after being inspired by the History Channel's recent airing of various Civil War battles, I purchased Gettysburg online and couldn't wait to watch it when it arrived.Honestly, I cannot understand why the majority of the reviews in here are praising this film. Although there are several bright spots and some very good actors involved, this film is unnecessarily long and clouded by ridiculous over dramatized scenes. From the very opening scene the acting was unbelievable. Even Tom Beringer's first appearance made me cringe as the dialogue between him and the scout (Harrison, I believe) was anything but believable. I only hoped it would get better as the film progressed. Unfortunately, Stephen Lang, as General Pickett, was the only bright spot, in my opinion.Not even the best actors, however, could have come away delivering Academy Award deserving performances with the horrible scripts they were given unrealistic dialogue, contrived interaction between the characters, unprovoked emotions...the list is simply too long.The battles, given praise by most of the reviewers in here, came across to me like Civil war reenactment performances (and they probably were). Not to mention, there were so many scenes that were repeated over and over again to lengthen the effect. A great example is on day three at the onset of the final battle as the cannon fire begins. Watch and notice how many times the same sequence is repeated. I even caught several scenes where the actors stopped performing, as if the cameras were supposed to cease filming - and somehow were overlooked in the editing room. One scene in particular, during Chamberlain's charge downhill, you'll catch several soldiers lifting their guns to pummel the onrush of enemy, and then halt in mid swing, as if waiting to hear the word cut! from the Director. Horrible. Embarrassing.The over-saturated dramatic speeches by one General after another made me glad I had a forward button on my remote. The emotions spoke for themselves due to the loss of so many lives and the tragedy of a Country torn apart by ignorance and differences of values and opinions. We didn't need their speeches to rub it in and create an unnecessarily long, drawn out movie.The soundtrack was the worst part. I own over 200 soundtracks and believe that music can make or break a movie. Knowing when to elevate climaxes, stop to breath, draw forth emotions, and support the dialogue are no different than a cook knowing what spices to use and how much. Randy Edelman drowned this movie in the major chords of over-embellished patriotic nonsense that lost its luster when he repeated the same theme over and over again. If you want to enjoy all 4 and 1\/2 hours of this movie's music, just repeat each track ten times and you're there.Now I understand that a film about our History that requires thousands of extras, stand ins, and the need to have as many physical bodies as possible is going to result in some poor acting or those in the background who have no experience in acting, but if you really want to see a great Civil War movie, which doesn't fall into these obvious traps and flaws, pick up Glory. I am pretty sure, anyone who has seen that movie will find Gettysburg nothing short of laughable.I'll refrain from continuing this review in fear that the producers of this film might see my somewhat long, over dramatized, and possibly unnecessary rambling, and ask me to participate in their next film, seeming that I meet all of their qualifications.P.S.

It simply cannot compete with the original movie, which, while similar to many films, still had that air of originality that this film simply lacks. Ghostbusters did launch a franchise of its own (with T-shirts, toys, a computer game, an animated series, as well as two sequels) but there does come a time when a concept falls flat, and there are movies that simply do not need a sequel.As can be expected, after saving the city the Ghostbusters have been forgotten and relegated to appearing at children's parties and dodgy TV shows. Dana has moved on, had a baby, and been married and divorced, and basically the city now considers them a bunch of frauds. It is amazing how quickly people forget, especially since ghosts were running about the city, but I guess that as time passes, people relegate these things to delusions and dreams.However, such is a city like New York, that there are always going to be more dangers, and when some force attempts to steal Dana's baby, the Ghostbusters are called back to investigate. However, during their investigations (which involves digging a hole in the middle of a New York Street) they are arrested and brought to court (and a court that refuses to believe in the supernatural) to face trial. It is then when the ghosts reappear, and suddenly those whom people had rejected are brought back to the forefront.In one sense, this film continues the theme of science trumping faith, however it also shows the nature of the fickle society, and the Ghostbusters are fools to accept it (or maybe they are simply good hearted people). After being stuffed around by all those who suffered losses after the last event, they are more than ready to come back and help their city in need (and one wonders if they will reject them again once the bad guy is defeated). There is a further concept of the positive and negative vibes of the city.

In the bible it is the name of a final battle where the world rises up against God and God fights back and wins. It is described as being a blood bath where blood is ankle deep. The reason it is called Armegeddon is because it is fought on the plain of Megiddo which, as one of my friends says, is a pretty good place for a battle. The movie, on the other hand, is a little like Deep Impact. I say a little because it seriously romps all over the former movie. Deep Impact came out first but after seeing Armegeddon you wonder why anybody would actually want to see Deep Impact. This is a much more well thought out movie with a singular plot and a lot of excitement. Deep Impact opens with a car crash and a government cover up and the period of excitement is watching a huge wave wipe out the east coast. Armegeddon opens with the destruction of the world and then goes straight into a meteorite shower striking New York city. They first think it is nukes but realise that they have a whopping great big asteroid coming towards them and they have only 18 days to prepare for it. Thus they find Stamper (Bruce Willis), the world's best oil-rig driller, and ask him to help them with the machinery to drill into the asteroid. He ends up taking his crew into space to drill into the asteroid. The movie is very entertaining with much more laughs than Deep Impact. The characters are a little light hearted and we can appreciate the jovial manner. Then there is the asteroid itself it is a very fearsome thing that has a very Gothic feel  to it. It is mostly shrouded in darkness and it seems to be alive as his attempts to stop the miners from destroying it. We know that it is not alive, but the problems that are continually mounting upon it create a situation of utter urgency. There is no end to the excitement in the movie, and the fact that a huge shower of meteorites is heading for the earth gives way for much more destruction than Deep Impact. Armegeddon is about the end of the Earth, but we all know that the world will be saved, we know from the beginning that they are going to destroy the asteroid. That is inevitable. What we watch the movie for is to see how we get to that spot. The psychology of the movie is what is interesting. There are fears that an asteroid will come our way and there is no way we can stop it, not with out technology. There is a fear in the populace that something like that will happen so what we have are movies that reassure us that no matter what happens, we can overcome such difficulties. A scientist theorised that such a thing could happen so everybody panics. We are sheeps and will believe anything that we are told, and we are being told that we have the power to stop the end of the world. The truth is we cannot. When Christ returns only those of us who follow him will be saved, all other will have to face his wrath. Thus Armegeddon is a good movie but puts false hopes in us.

I finally managed to get around to seeing it after a couple of months with my brother, and my brother loved the movie; I thought that it was pretty good as well. It seems to be a computer animated and the animation is quite good. Antz is based in an ant nest and focuses on a worker ant named Zee (Woody Allen). Zee is a bit upset with his life because it seems to be meaningless, but all of this changes when the princess pays him a visit in the pub and dances with him. The princess isn't really all that interested, she just wants a bit of fun before she gets married to a creep who is the general (Gene Hackman). After this Zee is a changed ant and he wants to see the princess again, and the only way he can do this is by switching places with Weezer (Sylvester Stallone) who is a warrior ant. Unfortunately for Zee the ants are off to a war which they are not supposed to win, but Zee comes back alive and is made a hero only to fall foul of the General's plots. This is a very clever movie and has a go at a number of aspects of society including hyper-individualism and hyper-conformity. I guess the main message is that forced conformity does not work because it undermines the moral of those forced to conform, but neither does hyper-individualism because one person is never really capable of doing anything. Napolean did not conquer all of Europe by himself but with the support of the French nation. Neil Armstrong did not reach the moon by himself, but with the support of many other technicians. Though this film is very anti-conformity most of the way through, the realisation at the end is that we cannot save ourselves, we must ultimately rely upon somebody else. The other theme is that the weakest elements of society are not expendable. As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12, each person with each gift plays a part to support the whole. Everybody has their role to play in society and we cannot simply eliminate them because we think them to be useless. In Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy an entire civilisation was wiped out because of dirty telephones namely because they got rid of all of their telephone sanitisers, thinking them to be useless. Same goes in this movie, the worker ants may seem useless in war, but without them there would be no colony. Antz is a very clever movie and it also makes me think that Dreamworks is directly challenging Disney with movies. They released Deep Impact in rival to Touchstone's (Disney) Armegeddon, and same with Antz competing with A Bug's Life, and now they are also going down the Animation road with films like Prince of Egypt, and Disney attempts to compete with them by releasing animations as well.

A bunch of people go into the Amazon jungle to make a documentary about a remote Indian tribe but soon get other things to think of. Movies like this always contain typical stereotype propaganda and this one may take the price in that department anyway. First it is Jon Voight who plays an ex-priest(!) turned snake-hunter and then the bimbo lady that is a must and her naive boyfriend. Then the European (in this case British) who is the typical dork who only seem to care about playing golf and listen to opera... One can figure out who is going to survive already from the start basically, the coolest people of course... The acting isn't a complete disaster according to me but nothing to write home about either. The plot in itself isn't that credible either, i doubt that a bunch like this would undertake to go on an adventure like the one they had in mind. The sceneries and the environment look rather good, although in one scene when they are done battling the snake the waterfall seem to run uphill....An unfortunate miss i'm sure. In conclusion, the characters are so stereotypical and surreal in some way that it just doesn't do it as a good movie even in this genre. If you have nothing else to do it could work as reasonable entertainment, and then just shake it off you, kind of. I think the movie makers figured that more people would watch it if it starred Jennifer Lopez and perhaps they thought right if so.

I let that scare me away from watching it for a long time. Tonight, I finally got around to watching it on Netflix. It was available on instant stream, so I figured I'd go ahead and give it a shot.I feel a little ambivalent about the movie...I think it was better than a lot of people give it credit for, but still not as good as I might've hoped. I really liked the beginning, I felt almost as if I were watching a novel come to life. It had a very slow pace that I kind of enjoyed, but then it felt like the movie was in a big hurry to end itself toward the latter half of the film.How did I come to that conclusion? Well, the same night that Peter\/Luke (Jim Carrey) figures out who he really is, is also the same night his father Harry (Martin Landau) has a fatal heart attack. Then, at Harry's funeral, Carrey's character confesses to his love interest, Adele (Laurie Holden), that he is not the man she thinks he is. Right after that happens, the government baddies show up to take him away. It's just a little too bing, bang, boom to me. The movie takes such a long time to build itself up, only to let itself end far too rapidly.I thought the performances were very good, and Carrey does surprisingly well, too...Although, I saw him slip into his shtick a few times, for the most part, he stays pretty true to his character.Overall, I wouldn't say The Majestic was a bad movie, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it was great, either. I think I'd feel comfortable in saying it was pretty good. I don't know if I'd necessarily feel comfortable in recommending the movie to everyone, but I think that as long as you don't mind seeing a predictable happy ending, you won't mind watching this movie. For me, I felt a little conflicted about the ending. I didn't want to see what would've been more likely to happen, which likely would've been too dark and depressing, but I also felt like I was feeding into the whole audiences love a happy ending thing, which is fine, except for when a happy ending isn't always what a movie calls for. I'm not saying The Majestic fits in this category, but perhaps an ending that wasn't too dark and depressing nor the best case scenario also known as the Happily Ever After ending could've been envisioned and perhaps utilized more effectively here. Although, in all fairness to the movie, I'd rather see the happy ending they chose than the bleak one they could've gone with, so I do think they made the right choice.

I liked the symbol of the movie and was so fascinated by it that I wanted a t-shirt and everything. While at one stage I considered this to be a pretty boring movie, when I look back at it it still is a classic with some quite memorable scenes.The reviewers commented that this movie was the first to mix good special effects and comedy successfully, but I really don't think it makes that much. I personally don't think that special effects make a movie, and looking beyond the special effects of this movie I really find that there is very little there. To our standards the special effects were not that crash hot, but then this movie is early 80's meaning that we can't expect too much. However, for a movie starring some relatively big names (Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd etc) the acting does have a lot to be desired. Personally, I thought that the best actor in this film was Rick Moranis, who plays an accountant (though not necessarily socially inept, more very eccentric in his own, special, unique way).This movie is about three scientists who are kicked out of university and thus start up a business, Ghostbusters, to exterminate any ghosts in the city. Coincidentally there are lots of ghosts appearing because some Babylonian God is returning to Earth. What I noticed about this film though was the concept of science vs faith. We have the spiritual word of the ancient times trying to break back into our world, and the only thing that is able to stop it is science. Long have ghosts been in the realm of the supernatural, meaning that they have been beyond our power to deal with, but now, as with many of the things in our world, science has come along to solve the problem, and that is what is essentially happening in this film, science is taking its place as our new god.We see this a lot in the movie, especially at the end as the ghostbusters arrive to cheering crowds. There is nothing special about them beyond their power packs and their knowledge of the supernatural, though they make it known that their knowledge gives them power of the ghosts, something that the normal citizens do not have. However it appears that from the beginning they are stumbling around blindly as well, using untested equipment, and bluffing their way through pretending they know something of which others are ignorant.My opinion swings regarding this movie, at first I thought it was great, later I thought it was boring, and now I would have to put it in the realm of a classic 80's movie. However, the one thing that brings to mind is the computer game that was released around the time of the film. While the film would not stand up to the likes of some truly classic films, the computer game literally took the world by storm. Many games these days come and go within 6 months, however the Ghostbusters simply seemed to have staying power. It was a relatively easy game, straight forward, and challenging enough to always bring to back to it when you were board. These days, while I may remember the film, it is the computer game that always sticks in my mind.

Personally, I thought that the best actor in this film was Rick Moranis, who plays an accountant (though not necessarily socially inept, more very eccentric in his own, special, unique way).This movie is about three scientists who are kicked out of university and thus start up a business, Ghostbusters, to exterminate any ghosts in the city. Coincidentally there are lots of ghosts appearing because some Babylonian God is returning to Earth. What I noticed about this film though was the concept of science vs faith. We have the spiritual word of the ancient times trying to break back into our world, and the only thing that is able to stop it is science. Long have ghosts been in the realm of the supernatural, meaning that they have been beyond our power to deal with, but now, as with many of the things in our world, science has come along to solve the problem, and that is what is essentially happening in this film, science is taking its place as our new god.We see this a lot in the movie, especially at the end as the ghostbusters arrive to cheering crowds. There is nothing special about them beyond their power packs and their knowledge of the supernatural, though they make it known that their knowledge gives them power of the ghosts, something that the normal citizens do not have. However it appears that from the beginning they are stumbling around blindly as well, using untested equipment, and bluffing their way through pretending they know something of which others are ignorant.My opinion swings regarding this movie, at first I thought it was great, later I thought it was boring, and now I would have to put it in the realm of a classic 80's movie. However, the one thing that brings to mind is the computer game that was released around the time of the film. While the film would not stand up to the likes of some truly classic films, the computer game literally took the world by storm. Many games these days come and go within 6 months, however the Ghostbusters simply seemed to have staying power. It was a relatively easy game, straight forward, and challenging enough to always bring to back to it when you were board. These days, while I may remember the film, it is the computer game that always sticks in my mind.

I liked the symbol of the movie and was so fascinated by it that I wanted a t-shirt and everything. While at one stage I considered this to be a pretty boring movie, when I look back at it it still is a classic with some quite memorable scenes.The reviewers commented that this movie was the first to mix good special effects and comedy successfully, but I really don't think it makes that much. I personally don't think that special effects make a movie, and looking beyond the special effects of this movie I really find that there is very little there.

The charisma and wonderful wit he adds to fictional characters is something to behold, but the power and the integrity he adds to his portrayals of real life individuals is nothing short of outstanding. Here in Norman Jewison's The Hurricane, he brings Rubin Hurricane carter to life with such raw emotion and intensity that this performance at least equals the high standards set by his portrayal of controversial civil rights leader Malcolm X. That film is superior in my opinion , but this is still an excellent film enriched by Washington's performance. This, a performance really showing The Hurricane as a man that throughout a heinous and unjustified stint in prison was as Dylan said a son of bitch that was brave and getting braver.Norman Jewison's directing is very accomplished, displaying cut scenes of racial violence showing the gross malpractices of police in sixties America in many parts towards African Americans. He also cuts to scenes of real life protests for Rubin Carter's release from imprisonment aptly surrounded by the sound of Dylan's The Hurricane. I like these scenes as once they finished and returned to Rubin in prison, a nearly broken man, you really felt his helplessness. Despite the protests, they mattered little to him, isolated in a small cramped cell, trapped, as he had being in different circumstances for far too long of his natural life. I also felt Harris Yulin and David Paymer as his legal representatives as well as also Dan Hedaya as a corrupt cop were all very impressive in their relatively small roles. You really believe Hedaya as a desperately bitter individual with little moral fiber.Vicellous Reon Shannon as Lesra Martin grew in his particular role, I felt as the film progressed.However in some early scenes, he seemed a bit too simple such as the mad jumping at the arrival of one of Rubins letters, proclaiming he wrote back repeatedly like some hyper kid who had drank too much Coca Cola from the fridge. Overall though he was reasonably good. However his Canadian friends made up of actors Deborah Kara Unger, liev Schreiber and John Hannah were at times just awful. There was some dialogue between them that might as well have being performed by robots for all that convincing it was , which is strange cause all three actors have being excellent in other roles, particularly Hannah, who was brilliant in his role in Four Weddings And A Funeral(1994). Their not key though as Washington dominates the screen, so it's a small gripe, I guess. But still It was annoying.One scene where Unger's character answers a very distressing and emotional call from carter is kind of laughable due to her response to the other Canadians and Lesra. In the scene, It would have being just as effective for me if she turned and said that was Rubin, he's a bit sad... oh well, do you want to go to a field and rake some leaves?. That's how inadequate I felt that particular scene was, which is clumsily cut away from, but the acting made it feel extra like a clumsy cut.Incidentally, there is some strange joke about Canadians past times being limited to raking leaves, which doesn't really work, I think.Back to the triumphs of this film. Most the cast is terrific, whether it be in flashbacks of Rubin's earlier life, his prison life(notably Clancy Brown, playing sort of a similar, but yet opposite role to his character in the Shawshank Redemption) or also, the latter time setting of his final drive for freedom, after meeting Lesra (Mostly). I would also like to praise the late Badja Djola, who is fantastic in his minor role as a sort of wise man in the hurricanes prison. Jewison also gets a terrific shot of him near the end I thought, coming out of a cell. Jewison's directing is as you would expect well thought out and carried out with great aplomb showcasing him as a true master of the trait of cinema. The pacing of the story may drag slightly but it is also very well done all the same, script wise,in fairness to Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, who adapted it.The key part of this films success though lies with the wonderful Washington, who shows Carters loneliness, despair, anger, hurt and determination with incredible passion and intensity displayed prominently in one scene where the hurricane proclaims to his lawyers in jail in a sad whimper I am fifty years old...fifty years old!. He goes on to declare his desire to be free. He showcases all those mentioned characteristics at once. The scene is a triumph and the acting of Washington is quite simply superb. It captures Rubin Carter entirely as he was and how he came to be The Hurricane as a fighter as well as a free man. The film may drag a tad at times, telling it's tale, but for a biopic on this man, that tale is what the audience wants to see and boy does Washington carry the day.
