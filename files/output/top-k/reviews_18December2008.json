So when I saw the first Ghoulies, I expected a movie about imp creatures causing trouble. Instead I got a movie about stupid wizards with the Ghoulies in there as a subplot.So, I never bothered with this one. However, lately I've been on this Imp flick kick, and just watched Ghoulies 2.I must say, I was happily surprised. Let me say, this isn't a good movie in the sense of good story, acting, sfx, etc. However, it does justice to the little creature style, this one focuses on the monsters.Basically, these little guys hitch a ride on a traveling carnival, and they hang out in the haunted house trailer. That's really all you need to know, it has some great quotes for sampling, Dude....you tunes! plus it has the rat Ghoulie squirting green snot at people, and this couple making out get...stuck together...yes, this movie is not for everybody.*********SPOILERS************ My only complaint is the ending, when the large Demon is summoned, it looks like the monster suit the guy is wearing is so heavy, it moves too slowly, and it would have been nice to have grosser deaths with the Ghoulies themselves. I mean the big demon swallows them whole, but it doesn't really show it. It would have been nice if they would have exploded in it's mouth, or maybe they do get swallowed whole, then spit out with nothing left but a slimy skeleton.Plus, the toilet death was cool, but it would've been nice if the guy had gotten partially pulled in and it showed it.I guess my other complaint is the same with Gremlins and Critters, it would've worked better as an R rated film - tits, ass, graphic violence, more F-words, staples of the 80's!

If a film has the ability to impact an audience beyond its time there is no doubt that something must be good about his film to be able to relate to so many various generations. In an era where teen and college rebellions were at their peak this film takes that concept and builds its plot around this concept. While at its peak in the 1970s teen rebellion will happen in every generation, which helps allow future generations to identify themselves with Alex.Once thing to take into consideration when looking at A Clockwork Orange is that this film was based off a book. Because of this there is the inevitable question of which is better. However, in this case it does not matter if you read the book because the film is spectacular enough on its own.It is amazing how this film can take songs as Beethoven's 5th symphony and Sing in the Rain and turning them into the most disturbing things you will ever hear. By placing these innocent songs with a controversial visual makes the songs and scenes that much more disturbing. Malcolm McDowell's performance as Alex is captivating by taking a character with villain attributes and turning him into someone that the audience can relate to and sympathize with. Not only is McDowell's performance captivating, but also so is the make-up and costumes. Each gang has their signature outfit that would seem out of place even in the film. Showing that these gangs are even more outside of the society's norms.A Clockwork Orange remains a must see film even past the time it came out. Allowing current audiences to enjoy the social exploration that this movie conveys. While some scenes can be a shock this film's ability to take the crude and ruthless and turn them into the protagonists makes A Clockwork Orange worth seeing.

In this movie, these two amazing actors grip you, they pull you in, and they put you in the movie. Jodie Foster's confident yet fragile character Clarice is easily believable and very convincing, to the point were you feel as if she is a real person living through this torment, and she certainly deserves the Oscar she gets in return. And Anthony Hopkins once again stuns and amazes audiences in his role, and deserves every little part of his Oscar as well.Now I've always been a great fan of Anthony Hopkins, from his performance in The Elephant Man to his performance in red Dragon which uplifted an otherwise fairly weak movie. And this is surely his finest hour, every single word and action in this movie is sinister, frightening and chilling, everything a perfect villain should be. His famous pronunciation of Clarice will go down in media history, and his first appearance in the jail cell will be engraved into the mind of every person who see's it for ever. His stance, his glare and his delightfully charming manner all add to this character, and Anthony's performance. He is so convincing in this role that by the end of the movie you actually question his existence yourself, and this is also helped by the brilliantly wrote and presented storyline, which relates this psychotic character to a real life background and real life events. Even though Hannibal isn't the main character in this film, or even the main villain, he certainly steals the show, and the Oscar he earnt was for the shortest ever award-winning performance in film history, spending only about 20 minutes on screen in total, but even this is enough for Anthony Hopkins to portray every aspect of his character.And as previously mentioned, Jodie Foster's Clarice is also a fascinating performance. Getting such a small actress to take on such a big confident role, and to do it convincingly , was a big risk, but it pays off. Jodie Foster's performance is truly amazing, throughout she promotes a feeling on un-ease and difficulty, however she also gets you rooting behind her, as she ventures ever deeper into the mystery. As i previously said, there are spoilers in the review, and this is one of them, in one of the final scenes were Clarice is chasing down the Maniac and has entered his house and is now trapped in the dark is one of the most 'Edge-of-my-seat' scenes I've ever scene. The brilliant first person views and wonderful change in mood make this scene memorable and one of the movie's real strongest moments, almost creating the traumatized and lost women theme which would go on to back up other movies. And this movie just kept going, which was a good thing, because i generally tend to rate a movie not only on film aspects, but also on how interested it kept me, and this one kept me going till the end.But as i mentioned, especially in the final scene, the direction of the movie is classic. The shots are often basic yet stimulating, yet occasionally the director uses his creativity and goes all out like a blockbuster should, the camera angles are near perfect and well taken care of throughout, promoting a sense of being in the film, yet not actually experiencing the danger's the characters are facing, such as many of Spielberg's movies.I have to cut this review short due to the word limit, but i can finally say, go see this movie, it's not Entirely perfect, and that's why it misses out on a 10, it would earn 5 Stars but it can take a while to get going and can often confuse even the most intelligent viewer, which is what stops it from achieving a perfect score, but other that those, it's just too difficult to criticize this film.

The movie world was quite different back then, allowing a movie with a concept like this the chance to actually be released into theaters. And sure enough, the movie was a decent hit in the summer of 1995.The movie begins with what appears like a young girl being gassed while a bald man looks on sadly. But rather than die, the girl breaks out of the compound and escapes on a train a few dozen miles away. The bald man, Xavier, quickly gathers a team to track this young girl. The team includes an assassin, anthropologist, molecular biologist and an empath. As the young girl switches trains, Xavier explains to the team that the girl is the product of an alien signal explaining how to bind a sequence of DNA with human DNA. The girl soon goes into a cocoon and emerges later as a stunning adult that can metamorphosis in a monster. The team track her to LA and race to find her as she begins her search for a man to reproduce with, leaving a trail of bodies in her wake. Eventually, she discovers the team and fakes her own death in front of them, with the intent of mating with the assassin. But she instead ends up copulating with and killing the anthropologist before being discovered and chased by the team. They track her underground and after she kills Xavier, she births a fast growing baby. Shortly after, the baby is set ablaze and the team manages to blow the monster's head off and leave her to burn with her baby.The cast is the strongest part and their enthusiasm makes the movie work. Ben Kingsley does alright as Xavier and Michael Madsen plays his usual badass self as the assassin Press Lennox. Forrest Whitaker, for all his talents, is given some of the worst dialogue ever as the empath or psychic. Natasha Henstridge does alright as the oft naked space beauty. She doesn't really do much but that fits her part. And both Alfred Molina and Marg Helgenberger both do a good job in the roles they are given.The story isn't exactly anything new and borrows from a number of sources but as a whole, it works quite well. The monster effects, as designed by HR Giger, are magnificently executed, save for a few brief minutes of bad cgi at the end of the film. All in all, the movie is a decent sci-fi skin movie that does a number of things pretty good and a few things really well. It's the perfect example of how a b-movie concept can be successful if given the right cast with the right attitude.

The movie world was quite different back then, allowing a movie with a concept like this the chance to actually be released into theaters. And sure enough, the movie was a decent hit in the summer of 1995.The movie begins with what appears like a young girl being gassed while a bald man looks on sadly. But rather than die, the girl breaks out of the compound and escapes on a train a few dozen miles away. The bald man, Xavier, quickly gathers a team to track this young girl. The team includes an assassin, anthropologist, molecular biologist and an empath. As the young girl switches trains, Xavier explains to the team that the girl is the product of an alien signal explaining how to bind a sequence of DNA with human DNA.

Perhaps it's to do with my age as the film seems to have affected teenagers most (yet I still love 'Catcher in the Rye', 'Heathers', 'Back To The Future' etc). To me, 'Dead Poet's Society' is by no means a terrible film and I appreciate the effort director Peter Weir put into it. Even though I found it to be dull (due to the slow pace), by the time I am slipping away into boredom, a great scene appears right at that moment to bring me 'back to life' and so it continues until the end. What I liked most about this movie are the performances. Norman Lloyd is convincing as the hateful principal. Robin Williams is brilliant but it is the then newcomers, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Hansen who own the movie and hold more than their own opposite the more experienced actors. I enjoyed the scenes of camaraderie and loyalty that existed among the friends. The background score is another plus. I particularly liked how Mike Oldfield's track was utilised. Moreover, there are some very nice visuals, the most powerful one being the scene covered field where Ethan Hawke runs into whiteness, mourning his friend's death. Overall, even though I may not include this among my favourite movies, it's still very watchable.

But this was a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused. Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought,images that linger in the mild's eye long after the movie itself is over and it is a film that you could mediate on. At a running time of 151 minutes with about 2 and half hour of film with 45 minutes of dialogue. There are still two schools of thought until this very day. First one will agree that it is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made,a technical achievement unheard of when it was released in 1968. Second,one may agree that it is also one of the most horrifically boring and confusing movies ever made. The story(based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same title,who wrote the screenplay)while,seemingly simple,is profound. Sequentially,several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these questions results in profound solutions. Its not left entirely up to interpretation,but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling,no matter what your personal solution. 2001 A Space Odyssey was not a regular motion picture with a complex plot,extensive dialogue,numerous characters,but rather,a story told in a series of carefully crafted pictures,which serve the purpose of not only amazing us through the breathtaking visual effects,but also of provoking our thought and imagination.Rather than telling us about it or explaining it to us Kubrick has decided to allow the audience to experience for itself thus unforgettable epic journey. The music of 2001 is as essential as any of the other elements in creating the atmosphere of the film,from the hallmark opening theme to Strauss' Blue Danube. Although the first 2 hours of the film are,undoubtedly,visually stunning and rich in its metaphors. It is the last 20 minutes of 2001 that truly amaze and boggles the mind. From the cold,creepy shots showing Jupiter and its satellites(accompanied by the spine-chilling music),to the flabbergasting journey through the infinite,and finally,to the famous ambigous ending,Kubrick is provoking us to see the big picturethe fact that we have not even begun to understand the vastness of the universe and,even more than that,the infinite nature of our existence. Kubrick was a genius when he made this masterpiece,since this movie is to be experienced more than understood,and it is one of the few films that has stood the test of time,some 40 years after its release.What makes it work so well? The sheer scope and mastery of it all. This is film in its purest form and one of the most multi-layered motion picture ever made. It is one of the few films that can be incredibly artistic and succeed in being so without coming across as pretentious or inaccessible,unlike many other classics. Most of all,it is a film of unparallel visual beauty. Its obvious Kubrick spend three years in the making and production on the look of this film,and he pulled off everything he set out to do. Its a feast for the eyes that only improves with each viewing. However,if you have a true appreciation for the fine art of cinema and its potential to illuminate and inspire,then you will certainly find that 2001 is one of the most important and profound works on film ever produced. Experience this with a food of thought. Have an open mind when you see this masterpiece of science fiction brilliance. 2001 stirs the emotions and penetrates the subconscious of the viewer and its astounding from beginning to end.

Douglas has invariably played firebrands of one stamp or another and here he fits the sandals of Spartacus as well as any. His full and extensive remit of acting skills are put on show. Tony Curtis as Antoninus, his close friend, is rather less convincing; he doesn't do 'serious' quite so well as comedy.Ustinov bumbles along as Batiatus, owner of the gladiator school. Olivier brings a stately gravitas to Crassus, Jean Simmons is a scrawny but adequate Varinia. However, I believe the best part is played by chubby Charles Laughton, who is absolutely believable as the crafty, but basically decent political manipulator, Gracchus. In a script that is unusually intelligent for the genre, he definitely gets the best lines, and delivers them with convincing panache. He steals every one of his scenes, even those including Olivier.Indeed, you'd be hard-pressed to find a bum role here, with reliable Woody Strode playing a doomed gladiator stricken by misguided loyalties, and a cameo from excellent Herbert Lom as the fixer Levantus.The political squabbling is actually more entertaining than the fighting. Let's face it; we've seen hoards of men in a sword-wielding scrum so often it's almost a period cliché.But the set-piece deployment of the Roman army is wonderfully realised. I don't know how many extras were engaged in this all-too-briefly observed spectacle, but I've never seen an army look so believable or so bloody intimidating. We watch from the slave perspective at each separate legion marching steadfastly forward with lock-step precision over the rolling meadows, just as they must have done during the centuries of Roman rule, indomitable, irresistible, suppressing everything in their wake. And then a second army is seen in the distance, following on from the first. It required extraordinary visceral courage to stand in the face of this expert machine.When Laughton isn't amply demonstrating the decadence that is the other face of Rome, Olivier adds additional icing with an attempt to seduce Antoninus. In a sly metaphor, choices in food are compared to tastes in sexual appetite that could be an object lesson for sophisticated homosexuals the world over, and must have been astonishingly daring for 1960. Once again, the extremely clever script shines through.There are many other excellent set-pieces and situations. Camera work is as expansive as widescreen production demands, but there is plenty of subtle intimacy too, with well-judged lighting throughout. In general, I like the music; though the martial bombast of Roman anthems tend to batter your eardrums into submission. There's a nice 'romantic' theme for the scenes depicting Spartacus and Varinia.The more recent 'Gladiator' added absolutely nothing to the 'conflict of loyalties' story, or the sword 'n' sandals genre, except - as one might expect - in the CGI department. Quite the contrary; I thought it inferior in every other way. Certainly the latter's script couldn't hold a candle to this one. And come to that; neither could the lead roles.If you haven't already; give 'em a whizz and see what you think.

Certain songs always seem to set the tone for various kinds of love and romance in film, whether the light-hearted or the dramatic. What High Fidelity does is make a film that not only uses the power of that emotional mixture, but focuses on it and attempts to understand it. High Fidelity is the story of Rob (Cusack), a vinyl store owner and his understanding of his most recent break up with Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) through analyzing his Top 5 worst break-ups. Rob's affinity for music and being a self-proclaimed professional appreciator of music clearly influences his understanding of love and his quest for some kind of greater fulfillment.Written by a team of writers including Cusack himself and based on a novel by Nick Hornby, Fidelity takes on a first-person narrative structure, with most of the story being Rob talking directly into the camera. Normally narration is voiced over or kept distant from the action of a film, but this choice for Fidelity creates an intimate relationship between Rob and the audience. Part of this success is how natural Cusack takes to the part. You believe he's treated you as a close friend the entire time--there's no lack of sincerity whatsoever. In general, it's a technique that works phenomenally for this movie because it's all about trying to make sense of love and seeing how music influences that. There are many people out there who strongly identify their emotions with music and those people will absolutely love this film. It is candid, witty, mature and it's dead on when it comes to identifying with music appreciators. Not a lot of films really connect to audiences on this level. There's no glorifying of romance when all is said and done--it's not overdone Hollywood style--it's just honest and doesn't claim to know any more about love than any of its viewers. An admirable and heart-warming depiction of how music and love simultaneously weave through our lives.

We have a tendency as Americans to appreciate good food and good wine, but I don't think we really appreciate good film, especially erotic film.This isn't porn or something we watch on cable, but an erotic film that has a psychological element, a visual element, and a real story.Writer\/director Catherine Breillat has given us a picture of eroticism from a feminist viewpoint. Now, that may be difficult for male viewers to appreciate, but it certainly serves to increase our appreciation for the female of our species.Marie (Caroline Ducey) has a narcissistic boyfriend (Sagamore Stévenin), who has sex for a couple of weeks or, in her case, a month, and then abstains for several months. he doesn't even like being touched. As strange as I might find this with Caroline Ducey in my bed, it certainly presents a quandary for Marie, as she has unfulfilled needs. Can there be love without sex? Can we fulfill our sexual needs and still remain faithful? These are questions that the viewer is left to ponder as Marie explores her desires and needs.There is a lot of talk about Paulo (Italian porn star Rocco Siffredi) and his place in the film, but mixing a porn star with traditional actors is a bold move, in my opinion. It is in Marie's adventure with Paulo that we see her dilemma about love and sex. They even manage a philosophical discussion about a used condom - those wacky French! It is the bondage scenes with Robert (François Berléand) that really interest me. I cannot fathom what the attraction is, but Robert really enjoys his work, and is attentive to the needs of Marie. She is attracted to him and returns for more because in the act of bondage he is paying close attention to her - something her boyfriend fails to do.There are some funny scenes in the movie - when the line of interns examine her after she becomes pregnant; and some that i could have done without - the birth of her son. I admit I am slightly confused about the ending, but the film with it's colors, and textures, and its symbolism that pays homage to other filmmakers, is certainly well worth the time and a great introduction to erotic film and the work of Catherine Breillat.

With Ellen Ripley gone, there was an opportunity to do something totally new and original. Instead, the studio insisted that Ripley return and thanks to the cloning of the deceased character (cardinal sin #1 when making a movie), she did, with the alien queen in tow. But that was forgivable because of the idea that came with Ripley (ie the failed clones). Then the director decided to crap all over it and make another bad horror\/sci-fi movie with bad cgi.The story is fairly basic. Ripley is somehow cloned 200 years after her death, with the alien queen somehow still in her. The doctors cut it out of her and keep her alive for some reason. Some space pirate types bring the scientists some hyper-sleeping miners and shortly thereafter, we have a bunch of aliens in cages. But these aliens (and Ripley) had some genetic crossover due to the cloning and are much smarter, leading to a fast escape. The rest of the movie is spent with Ripley and the pirates trying to escape the ship, all leading up to a shocking revelation after Ripley is taken into the alien nest the alien queen now has a humanlike reproductive system from the genetic crossover. She then gives birth to a nasty looking hybrid, which quickly kills her and sees Ripley as it's mother. Ripley eventually escapes to the pirate's ship and kills the hybrid by letting it get vacuumed out a broken window.A lot of the concepts in the movie could have worked very well. The scene with Ripley finding her failed clones is the best scene in the film. The rest is... well, questionable. Most of the cast (save for the pirates) is just poor, reading their lines more like a dark comedy (although that is mainly the fault of the writer). Save for the clone scene, Sigourney Weaver is borderline terrible and the fact that she got paid more for this movie than the entire budget of the original Alien is horrendous. The aliens themselves look like crap, both in color and how they are portrayed. The little bit of cgi used for the aliens is appalling, even by late 90s standards. And the hybrid alien is a f***ing travesty. It's not scary or interesting, just plain ugly. And the fact that it was designed with genitals (which were removed post-production) pretty much says it all.This movie could have been the start of a new, unique trilogy. Instead, it effectively killed the original Alien franchise and led to us having to endure those horrible alien\/predator crossovers. For that reason alone, this movie loses a few points. All in all, this whole story should have never been adapted into a movie.
