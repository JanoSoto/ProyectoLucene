I'm an actress who doesn't enjoy many musicals, but I have about five that I am simply crazy about, and Little Shop of Horrors is one of those. On the stage, I have seen many actors tackle that leading role, but none of them could ever hold a candle to Mr. Moranis' portrayal. I've seen other actors play the character almost one-dimensionally, but Rick Moranis truly showed viewers what a complex character Seymour Krelborne is. Rick Moranis is an amazingly talented man, and as I plan to write thesis on Little Shop of Horrors, I hope that I'll one day get to meet him.\tBut enough praising of that glorious actor, let me get on to talking about the movie.\tSo few plays make a respectable and admirable transition from the stage to the screen, but this one did, and I'm inclined to agree with a previous critic here that this may in fact be the last great movie musical. A fair amount of the play was altered for the screen, like a couple of songs that were replaced by new songs or more dialogue, but that seemed to make the movie better (I was very happy to find that It's Just the Gas was omitted from the film). The movie also adds the masochistic dental patient who was in the original 1960 Roger Corman film, but who wasn't added to the play. Played by the wonderful Bill Murray, the character has a delightful meeting with the sadistic dentist, played by the brilliant Steve Martin. Bill Murray doesn't give off the same amusing gay undertones as the great Jack Nicholson did in the original (and if you don't believe me about the original gay undertones, go watch that scene where he tells Seymour, who is posing as the dentist, to DON'T STOP NOW!!!). However, Bill Murray does seem to very subtly show that his character finds the dental torture to be sexually gratifying, which of course results in hilarity that is reminiscent of the original film.\tAs for the ending of this film, it's hard for me to form an opinion about it being better or worse than the ending performed on stage. I agree with another previous critic, that the play is a Greek tragedy (and I thought I was the only one who took interest in deeply analyzing that play!), and that it is important for Seymour to pay the price he's given. When watching Little Shop of Horrors on stage, I find the tragic ending to be quite fitting, but in this movie I honestly don't think I could see that happening. I'm not the kind of viewer that has to have a happy ending in whatever she sees, no not by a long shot, but something about this movie made me want to see them live happily ever after. I think I can chalk that feeling down to the fact that, like Leonard Maltin wrote, Rick Moranis played the character to perfection, and the fact that Moranis and the lovely and talented Ms. Greene had such dynamic chemistry together. Like I wrote above, Rick Moranis played the character with so many dimensions, that I felt drawn more to his portrayal than anyone elses' I had ever seen. I felt more compassion, hope, and love for his Seymour than I had for anyone elses' (Rick even gave the character more sex appeal, in my opinion). Rick Moranis knew how to make his character have that desired and appropriate effect on the audience. So, because of how he truly got down to the heart of the character, I don't think I would have enjoyed seeing his end come.\tHowever, I would love to see that ending. Ellen Greene is a magnificent, versatile actress and for her sake, it was a shame that scene was cut; the audience should have gotten to view that. And I'm sure Rick, who hasn't had the chance to do many dramatic scenes in his career so far, was amazing as well. So, what it comes down to is that I would love to see Rick and Ellen in that last scene, for I too feel deprived of parts of two great performances, but I'm still a fan of the happy ending.\tDoes anyone know where I can find the movie on DVD with the original ending? I believe I read that it was released with the original ending, but that was taken out of stores after some time. I would really like to see that, so if anyone can tell me of *anywhere* where I might find a copy (never before seen, used, or re-recorded) of the DVD, I would pay any price asked and be greatly appreciative.

Simply because it manages to keep the perfect pitch throughout it's length. The film is very funny throughout, without repeating jokes, or even going down the road to sick toilet humor. It is hard to say why I and thousands other people like this movie so much, I think its because the more familiar you are with it, the more you like it. Some movies, even great movies get old the more you watch them, but with Annie Hall, you get excited every time you know a great line or great scene is coming up.The movie is filled with great moments, not surprising considering that the plot not only centers around Woody Allen's character's relationship with Diane Keaton's character (Annie Hall), but with themes of obsession, religious differences, loneliness, and if there's a price to pay for love. Every romantic comedy made since this movie owes it something (especially When Harry Met Sally), and if you are familiar with a lot of modern sitcoms, especially the TV show Friends, you'll notice how much was derived from here. (For six million dollars a week, you'd think they could afford orignal scripts) There are thousands of scenes and lines in the movie worth calling attention to here, but if you haven't seen the movie yet, you deserve to see them without expecting them, so I won't mention them here.Annie Hall won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Woody Allen), Best screenplay written for the screen (Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman) and for Diane Keaton's performance as Annie Hall. Her performance is without a doubt one of the greatest performances ever done by an actress, actually, but anyone, take notice of the scene where Annie tells Alvy Singer(played by Woody Allen) that she misses him. She starts crying, then hits her bed with her fist. She loves him, but is ashamed of being weak. That is such an honest, subtle, and perfect motion that I really start to care for Annie at that point-and so does Alvy, because we start to overlook her flaws (her carelessness, immaturity, and her naivety and so forth), and really start to care about her. Woody Allen also gives a good performance, but unline Ms. Keaton, he knows he's performing (when he breaks the forth wall by talking to the camera), but still gives one of the best monologues I've ever seen. (notice how his hands never stand still, yet never make the same movement twice- every physical comedian should take note of this, from Jim Carrey to Groucho Marx)I first saw this movie when I was in 7th grade, and laughed uproariously at the animated segment, and all the one-liners and jokes (its amazing how with this amount of jokes, every single one of them works, none miss their mark) when it was over, I rewound it, and started over again. Now that I'm older, and hopefully more mature, the movie is even better, and the last scene never fails to inspire me, and the jokes that used to make me laugh, still do, with the added bonus of my also getting the more subtle ones as well.Woody Allen is one of the all-time great film-makers, and this is his masterpiece in my opinion, there are no flaws in the script, even though it has flash-forward, flash-backs etc, etc. He makes one movie a year on average, and he writes, directs, and usually stars in them too. If there's one person who I'd want to continue working, it'd be him. If you want to start watching Woody Allen movies but are unsure where to start, Annie Hall is a great place to start, its modern, yet a classic.If I haven't made the movie sound as good as it is to me, that is my fault, and not the movie's. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you go out and watch it now, making sure you don't read its IMDB quote page. Best to watch this movie, and be wonderfully surprised. I would be surprised if you don't love this movie. You've have to have a heart of stone to resist it. It is very funny, quite moving at sometimes, inspiring, perfectly acted and written. It deserves it's awards, and it's place on AFI's 100 best movies of all time (I think #32). Movies like this are the reason cinema was invented.NOTE If you like ANNIE HALL, here are some other great Woody Allen movie you might enjoy Manhattan, Love & Death, Stardust Memories, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Crimes and Misdemeanors.

Every romantic comedy made since this movie owes it something (especially When Harry Met Sally), and if you are familiar with a lot of modern sitcoms, especially the TV show Friends, you'll notice how much was derived from here. (For six million dollars a week, you'd think they could afford orignal scripts) There are thousands of scenes and lines in the movie worth calling attention to here, but if you haven't seen the movie yet, you deserve to see them without expecting them, so I won't mention them here.Annie Hall won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Woody Allen), Best screenplay written for the screen (Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman) and for Diane Keaton's performance as Annie Hall. Her performance is without a doubt one of the greatest performances ever done by an actress, actually, but anyone, take notice of the scene where Annie tells Alvy Singer(played by Woody Allen) that she misses him. She starts crying, then hits her bed with her fist. She loves him, but is ashamed of being weak. That is such an honest, subtle, and perfect motion that I really start to care for Annie at that point-and so does Alvy, because we start to overlook her flaws (her carelessness, immaturity, and her naivety and so forth), and really start to care about her. Woody Allen also gives a good performance, but unline Ms. Keaton, he knows he's performing (when he breaks the forth wall by talking to the camera), but still gives one of the best monologues I've ever seen. (notice how his hands never stand still, yet never make the same movement twice- every physical comedian should take note of this, from Jim Carrey to Groucho Marx)I first saw this movie when I was in 7th grade, and laughed uproariously at the animated segment, and all the one-liners and jokes (its amazing how with this amount of jokes, every single one of them works, none miss their mark) when it was over, I rewound it, and started over again. Now that I'm older, and hopefully more mature, the movie is even better, and the last scene never fails to inspire me, and the jokes that used to make me laugh, still do, with the added bonus of my also getting the more subtle ones as well.Woody Allen is one of the all-time great film-makers, and this is his masterpiece in my opinion, there are no flaws in the script, even though it has flash-forward, flash-backs etc, etc. He makes one movie a year on average, and he writes, directs, and usually stars in them too. If there's one person who I'd want to continue working, it'd be him. If you want to start watching Woody Allen movies but are unsure where to start, Annie Hall is a great place to start, its modern, yet a classic.If I haven't made the movie sound as good as it is to me, that is my fault, and not the movie's. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you go out and watch it now, making sure you don't read its IMDB quote page. Best to watch this movie, and be wonderfully surprised.

The initial response I had was to treat it as a mildly amusing comedy revolving around an eclectic set of characters that didn't really seem to have much of a point in the end. But there's more going on here than meets the eye at first. The whole movie revolves around the concept of freedom, and how freedom is defined. Produced at the height of the Cold War, I took from this movie a statement that freedom is about much more than a political system.The first part of the movie deals with Vladimir Ivanoff's (Robin Williams) life in the Soviet Union. Protesters are arrested, Ivanoff is threatened by the KGB for no reason other than that he has an eccentric grandfather and people line up for blocks to buy toilet paper or shoes that don't fit. From what I've read, that's probably an accurate description of life in the USSR. But it isn't as bleak as it seems. Ivanoff has a family he loves, a girlfriend who loves him and wants to get married, and he can pursue his passion of saxophone playing with the Circus. Most important - this guy doesn't want to defect, and he tries to convince his best friend Anatoly (Elya Baskin) not to defect either, when the Circus visits New York City.The second part of the movie is set in New York. On the spur of the moment, Vladimir defects - at Bloomingdale's. He hadn't planned to. It just happened. Asked by an FBI agent why he was defecting, he answered simply freedom. And now we begin to learn about freedom. Vladimir tries to make connections. His best friend becomes a black store security guard named Lionel (Cleavant Derricks). Lionel's family parallels Vladimir's (right down to the eccentric grandfather), but it isn't Vladimir's family. Lucia (Maria Conchita Alonso) becomes Vladimir's love interest, but she doesn't want to commit. He can't even play the sax. He waits tables, drives a taxi, becomes a street hawker - all ultimately unsatisfying. For me the most poignant part of the film comes in a coffee shop, in a discussion among the various immigrants. They misquote the Declaration of Independence, and say that the inalienable rights of human beings are life, liberty and happiness. But Thomas Jefferson didn't say that. He said the pursuit of happiness. Here is where I really began to see the film as a sort of satire about freedom. To be politically free without having one's basic human needs met is ultimately not freedom.It's an interesting statement. Unfortunately, the movie itself is not that interesting. That's the basic problem. It has the potential to be powerful, but just doesn't rise to that potential. Why? Too much emphasis was put on the immigrant nature of New York City, for one thing. That became - to me - something of a running joke, and I started wondering what the next accent would be rather than following the story. For a movie that tries to make a powerful statement (and a gutsy one, given the political climate of the time) it just came across as too light - the sort of movie that you feel you could miss twenty minutes of and step right back into without trouble. The nude scene with Maria Conchita Alonso in the bathtub with Robin Williams (Williams hands roving all over her body) also struck me as in bad taste and exploitative - totally unnecessary to the story.Anyway, not bad.

Two films have been based on this novel. Both Jeremy Irons and James Mason are acceptable Humberts, though while reading the book, I pictured either Rex Harrison or Noel Coward. Shelley Winters was perfectly obnoxious as Charlotte, while Melanie Griffith was terribly miscast. Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film is a dark farce while Lyne's adaptation is truer to the source. Kubrick's film deals with Mason's obsession for young Sue Lyon who, after the infatuation wears off, is a younger version of obnoxious Winters. Here lies the darkest humor of the piece. It is the same idea used by Blake Edwards in his 10, where Dudley Moore discovers that his beautiful dream girl, Bo Derek, is really a common dud. Kubrick also features a fair share of slapstick, which is surprisingly not handled by Peter Sellers. The famous cot scene is straight out of Laurel and Hardy. Winter's seduction of Mason is also hysterical. Lyne's film takes itself seriously and the only humor is really provided by Dominique Swain as Lolita. As for the characters of Clare Quilty, Frank Langella's character is pure evil, while Peter Sellers plays an insane impressionist. They are as different as night and day.Now for my comparison of the Lolitas. It is hard to believe that Sue Lyon was actually younger than Dominique Swain was when she appeared as Lolita. Lyon's Lolita is a beautiful, young adult. There is nothing childish about her. The taboo of a grown man falling in love with her is completely undermined. She is an adult who turns him into an irrational child. Her worst qualities are the personality traits she inherited from her mother. Seventeen year old Dominique is much more of a child. In Lyne's film, Lolita is supposed to be 14; it is never mentioned in the Kubrick film. Dominique does not act like a high school student. Her Lolita is a middle school child. Though physically, Dominique Swain is about as close to perfection as any girl could ever be, her Lolita is clunky, all arms and legs fidgeting all over the place. And it is she, beautiful Dominique, who provides the little humor this film has. Her playing with her retainer and her constant off pitch singing with the radio are quite funny. Her Lolita is ironic; she is physically immature for her age, but she is sexually very aware. Dominique is less convincing as Mrs. Richard Schiller. She looks like a pretty young girl dressing up as a frumpy old woman for Halloween. Her physical movement has matured, but her voice is still child-like.Kubrick's film is a masterpiece of International comic cinema. It is linked with Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick's other comic masterpiece, since both contain the best performances ever given by Peter Sellers. Lyne's film is beautiful to look at, but it will probably be forgotten because it does not go far enough. However, it is a fine adaptation of the novel. It is too bad the Dominique Swain has not had another role to propel her into stardom. She is magnificently beautiful and has a wonderful comedic sense.

Why are soldiers willing to risk death to protect and ultimately retrieve the corpse of a comrade? Well, I now have a slightly better, if still slippery, grasp on the answer. Why? Because. Yeah. That's it... Okay, there's a little more to it than that, but I think it's a personal answer, better discovered on your own, and BLACK HAWK DOWN may be the film to let you do just that.The first thirty minutes or so of the film sets up a few of the characters. No, there is no deep character development, the brush strokes are light, impressionistic, but it works here. We know that most of them are painfully young, full of bravado and BS, most are in their first tour of duty, and most haven't fired a gun off the practice range. More importantly, we know they've got family and loved ones, they've made friendships within their groups, and they play Scrabble and laugh at stupid jokes. They're very, very human and they are our brothers, sons, husbands and fathers; do we really need to know what personally motivates each and everyone of them? Their actions speak louder than any words they might offer, and that's where Scott gets it right. As with most films in this genre, the dialogue is often too heavy and shop-worn, but the strength of BLACK HAWK DOWN is in the actions and reactions of young men as they are caught up in a situation that goes from... Well, bad to worse doesn't begin to describe it. A General tells us that we've just lost the initiative and in short order we've arrived at the seventh level of Hell. We don't need to be handed some trite definition of bravery and courage when we can see it and feel it for ourselves on the screen. Thankfully, with the exception of one groaner at the end for the slower audience members, Scott keeps his film sermon free.The most important thing to remember during the course of this film is that we are watching events that, for the most part, happened. When two Deltas insist on being allowed secure and protect a crash site with no known survivors, alone, with no promise of back-up, against an advancing, armed, local mob, remember that they don't do this because some screenwriter thought it sounded good, or some director or producer thought it would amp the scene, we see it because **that's what they did.** Their actions alone are why this film should have been made. That these sweet faced, all too human and all too young men are not only somehow capable, but *willing* to face whatever is thrown at them is what BLACK HAWK DOWN is about, and no matter my personal feelings on war and warriors, I left the theatre with nothing but awe, sorrow and gratitude for them all, wherever they may be tonight.For those of you who are considering seeing this movie only for a certain actor -- as I did -- I encourage you to go, but you might be disappointed. This is an ensemble film and the action is fairly evenly spread out. Josh Hartnett has a few more lines than anyone else, but I find it patently ridiculous that the PR machine is trying to push any particular actor in the Best and\/or Supporting actor for this film. Both Hartnett and Ewan McGregor do well, but are no better than any of the other fine actors in this film. It's obvious that those two are being pushed forward only because they have names the public now recognizes. If they're really looking to hand out a statue for acting here, Tom Sizemore is long overdue for such recognition and he gives a standout performance.

However, this one was close to the so-called victimless crime, because the object was a priceless 17th century coronation staff from France, and being held in the Ontario Customs building. Thus we can watch for two hours and enjoy the planning and execution of the heist, including coping with last-minute changes in the security system.The cast is heavy, probably in payroll too. DeNiro, Brando, Norton, and Angela Bassett as DeNiro's girlfriend. Bassett's was the most disposable part, requiring no special acting skills, it could have been done by any actress between the ages of 30 and 50. Brando's is simply the fence, the excuse to pull off the heist, a man who is in debt and needs this one to survive. DeNiro want's to retire, is very hesitant to pull this one off in his own neighborhood, but the lure of $6Million (Canadian, or American??), the ability to pay off his club, to retire and to marry his girl, are too much for him to refuse.Norton plays the inside guy, a security guard pretending to be differently-abled, who is able to get all necessary details for planning the heist. Norton is the best actor here. He has a style about him, both in physical expressions and delivery of lines, that makes watching him very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed the scene where DeNiro's large thug shows up at Norton's, tries to push him around, but Norton turns the tables on him. The character he plays is wise and competent, if a bit cocky. So much that he tries to double-cross DeNiro at the end, and ends up with nothing.

Thus we can watch for two hours and enjoy the planning and execution of the heist, including coping with last-minute changes in the security system.The cast is heavy, probably in payroll too. DeNiro, Brando, Norton, and Angela Bassett as DeNiro's girlfriend. Bassett's was the most disposable part, requiring no special acting skills, it could have been done by any actress between the ages of 30 and 50. Brando's is simply the fence, the excuse to pull off the heist, a man who is in debt and needs this one to survive. DeNiro want's to retire, is very hesitant to pull this one off in his own neighborhood, but the lure of $6Million (Canadian, or American??), the ability to pay off his club, to retire and to marry his girl, are too much for him to refuse.Norton plays the inside guy, a security guard pretending to be differently-abled, who is able to get all necessary details for planning the heist. Norton is the best actor here. He has a style about him, both in physical expressions and delivery of lines, that makes watching him very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed the scene where DeNiro's large thug shows up at Norton's, tries to push him around, but Norton turns the tables on him. The character he plays is wise and competent, if a bit cocky. So much that he tries to double-cross DeNiro at the end, and ends up with nothing.

Seeing how you're still reading this, I'm assuming you've seen the film. So I won't have to tell you that it's a gritty horror film rather than the action movie which is the second installment, or that it's far superior in plot.Personally I regret the fact that the film opens with a brief plot outline. I would have preferred it if the film would have just explained this along the way, but that's my only gripe.This has to be one of the best science fiction\/horror movies of all time. A real classic. Though the aforementioned outline tells us there is a terminator and a protector, you don't know which is which (even though it's pretty easy to guess). Furthermore, it's never mentioned that the Terminator is a machine. If you would look at this film with a sceptical, yet open, mind, you'll get one of the best first film-experiences ever. Assuming that you don't know what the Terminator is, you'll see it do things that are just not logical. This guy is being gunned down in a bar, but manages to stand up again. What is going on here. It's not until after this scene, that you'll get a Terminator Point of View (POV) which explains we're not dealing with a man, but with a machine. Later in the movie, after Kyle Reese has explained that the Terminator doesn't feel pain, you'll see it limping after being run down by a truck. If the Terminator doesn't feel pain, then why is it limping. Again this is explained later, when the flesh is burnt off, and you see it sustained damage to the foot mechanics. It's stuff like this that I live for.Next, and I think this is the most important part, is the magnificent elliptic storytelling. This is easiest explained if we start in 2029. SkyNet is on the verge of losing the war, and sends back a Terminator to kill the mother of the leader of the resistance, John Connor, before he is born. In order to protect her, a protector is sent after the Terminator Sergeant Kyle Reese. Ultimately Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fall in love, make love, and Sarah becomes pregnant of John Connor. Thinking this thing through If SkyNet hadn't sent a Terminator back through time, Kyle Reese wouldn't have been sent, John Connor wouldn't have been born, there wouldn't have been a resistance and SkyNet would have won. Which means there basically is no beginning, unlike for instance in Back To The Future, where the past is altered which has it's effects on the present. Though the Terminator has been sent back in time to alter the course of history, all it really does is perpetuate it. (Twelve Monkeys worked according to the same principle). There is still the implication that your actions shape the future, but that changing the course of history is impossible, since changing the past will create the present that is.Accuracy is also one of the strong points of the film. After Sarah has completed a plastic explosive device, Reese mentions Six more of those and we'll be done. Counting the number of bombs used you will notice that only 7 bombs are being thrown. Having been in the army for 2 years with the Uzi as a personal weapon, I can tell you that there's a maximum of 30 rounds that go into the clip (actually 32, but to prevent jamming 30 is the maximum). If you would count the number of rounds being fired before the Uzi must be reloaded, you'll find that no more than 30 rounds are fired (unlike for instance Red Heat, where Schwarzenegger fires 13 rounds from a Magnum.44 which only holds 6).Also the reality of the violence is magnificent. I love movies which portray violence for what it is Horrible.

Seeing how you're still reading this, I'm assuming you've seen the film. So I won't have to tell you that it's a gritty horror film rather than the action movie which is the second installment, or that it's far superior in plot.Personally I regret the fact that the film opens with a brief plot outline. I would have preferred it if the film would have just explained this along the way, but that's my only gripe.This has to be one of the best science fiction\/horror movies of all time. A real classic. Though the aforementioned outline tells us there is a terminator and a protector, you don't know which is which (even though it's pretty easy to guess). Furthermore, it's never mentioned that the Terminator is a machine. If you would look at this film with a sceptical, yet open, mind, you'll get one of the best first film-experiences ever. Assuming that you don't know what the Terminator is, you'll see it do things that are just not logical. This guy is being gunned down in a bar, but manages to stand up again. What is going on here. It's not until after this scene, that you'll get a Terminator Point of View (POV) which explains we're not dealing with a man, but with a machine. Later in the movie, after Kyle Reese has explained that the Terminator doesn't feel pain, you'll see it limping after being run down by a truck. If the Terminator doesn't feel pain, then why is it limping. Again this is explained later, when the flesh is burnt off, and you see it sustained damage to the foot mechanics. It's stuff like this that I live for.Next, and I think this is the most important part, is the magnificent elliptic storytelling. This is easiest explained if we start in 2029. SkyNet is on the verge of losing the war, and sends back a Terminator to kill the mother of the leader of the resistance, John Connor, before he is born. In order to protect her, a protector is sent after the Terminator Sergeant Kyle Reese. Ultimately Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fall in love, make love, and Sarah becomes pregnant of John Connor. Thinking this thing through If SkyNet hadn't sent a Terminator back through time, Kyle Reese wouldn't have been sent, John Connor wouldn't have been born, there wouldn't have been a resistance and SkyNet would have won. Which means there basically is no beginning, unlike for instance in Back To The Future, where the past is altered which has it's effects on the present. Though the Terminator has been sent back in time to alter the course of history, all it really does is perpetuate it. (Twelve Monkeys worked according to the same principle). There is still the implication that your actions shape the future, but that changing the course of history is impossible, since changing the past will create the present that is.Accuracy is also one of the strong points of the film. After Sarah has completed a plastic explosive device, Reese mentions Six more of those and we'll be done. Counting the number of bombs used you will notice that only 7 bombs are being thrown. Having been in the army for 2 years with the Uzi as a personal weapon, I can tell you that there's a maximum of 30 rounds that go into the clip (actually 32, but to prevent jamming 30 is the maximum). If you would count the number of rounds being fired before the Uzi must be reloaded, you'll find that no more than 30 rounds are fired (unlike for instance Red Heat, where Schwarzenegger fires 13 rounds from a Magnum.44 which only holds 6).Also the reality of the violence is magnificent. I love movies which portray violence for what it is Horrible.

I had not read any of the books and missed most of the hype preceding the film. In fact, I hadn't even seen the trailer. So it was with the healthy anticipation that I generally have for the movies I choose to see that I bought my ticket and entered the cinema where I would be transported into a world that returned me to the fantasies of my childhood. I have since read the books and come to understand some of the gripes of the many purists who have lamented some of the changes in the film. But despite some of these (fully justified) complaints, this film will see me return for several further viewings. HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE captured my imagination from the first shots of Dumbledore as he douses the lights in Privet Drive until the camera pulls back in the final shots of the Hogwart Express taking the young wizards- and witches-in-training back for  their holiday after a busy term at Hogwarts. The film takes great care in creating the magical world to which Harry travels and the characters that inhabit that these fantastic places are beautifully brought to life by a set of actors who serve this film in no uncertain terms.Of the child actors, Rupert Grint fares the best as the irrepressible Ron Weasly. His work in the film perfectly balances the delightfully waspish Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and the delicate work of Daniel Radcliffe as the title character. Some have criticised Radcliffe's work as a trifle bland however, I feel this may have been a conscious choice on the part of the director Chris Columbus in the creation of a central everyman character with whom audiences can identify and onto whom they may graft their own personalities, dreams, wishes and fantasies. The other youthful characters' roles are greatly reduced from the book, most lamentably Neville Longbottom, whose arc in the book was truly touching, and Draco Malfoy, who does little more here than establish himself as a nemesis to the Potter\/Granger\/Weasly trio. The other regretted loss is Hermione's, robbing her of her climactic moment in the challenges that face the friends as they decode a series of charms in their quest for the sorcerer's stone. The adult cast is uniformly brilliant, with a Gandalfian Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, a suitably strict Minerva McGonagall in Maggie Smith and a perfectly slimy Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. Robbie Coltrane is outstanding as Rubeus Hagrid.The film and my subsequent reading of the books have turned me into a HARRY POTTER fan. Like everyone else, I anticipate the fifth book impatiently and can't wait for the next film. I can't help wondering however how major the sacrifices in the subsequent films will be. Certainly, the third and fourth books should not be crammed into the  comparatively miniscule two and a half hours that was able to serve the first film extremely well. All I hope for with each subsequent film is a journey into the magical world that captured me so brilliantly in what is the finest fantasy film I have seen in many years.
