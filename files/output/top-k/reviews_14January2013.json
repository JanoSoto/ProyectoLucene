This is one of the top 10 funniest spoofs ever made. In about the last 10 years no movie has been able to touch the brilliance of Not Another Teen Movie. In the last 10 years, most of these so called 'spoofs'(if you want to even call them that)go off of a popular movie, and then they make jokes about that movie, but not about the popular movie itself, the jokes are made to what is hot and hip and in the now in our modern day culture. For example, Epic Movie plays out The Chronicles of Narnia aspect, but yet they don't make any jokes ripping into the Chronicles of Narnia, instead it has the Centaur rapping to a popular song while he's showing his crib off to the girl. Basically what they're doing is mixing The Chronicles of Narnia with MTV Cribs and Rap videos. It's not funny though because it's not relevant to the movie itself, which is The Chronicles of Narnia. And the reason it's not relevant to the movie itself is because it is mass produced puke that's been spat out by 4th rate writers who can't write their way out of a paper bag. So most spoofs nowadays use this type of formula. Using pop culture within the moving they're suppose to be spoofing and it doesn't work, it's very stupid and unfunny. The only one that kind of worked with this style, and only because it made fun of the movies it was going after(at times) was Date Movie. And the only times that Date Movie was funny was when it made a joke relevant to the movie it was making fun of. And this is the exact reason Not Another Teen Movie is so freaking hilarious. It's first rate writing, actually some brilliant writing, mixed with some pretty good acting believe it or not. There are no cheap laughs or pop culture b.s. within Not Another Teen Movie. Every movie Not Another Teen Movie plays off of, it makes some great observations and relevant inside jokes towards that movie that it's making fun of and because the jokes make sense in their relevant nature, it's hilarious. Not Another Teen Movie doesn't go for the cheap joke, it's written so good that it doesn't have to go for a cheap joke that doesn't make any sense. It makes fun of everything from American Pie to Never Been Kissed. It also makes fun of She's All That a lot. Not Another Teen Movie points out how obviously beautiful Rachael Leigh Cook's character was in She's All That and the writers drive that point home with the hilarious spoof they do on the scene about the bet of picking a girl to be this years homecoming queen. Then Not Another Teen Movie makes fun of Varsity Blues, and they drive home the fact of how ridiculous it was to leave Reggie Ray(his name wasn't Reggie Ray in Varsity Blues, but it's the same actor) on the field and they also make fun of how many concussions he has left until he goes into pretty much a coma. Then they drive home that fact with Reggie Ray even more when the coach says 'Can He play?' 'He's Unconscious.' 'But Can he Play?' 'I don't even think he can breathe.'And Not Another Teen Movie doesn't just stop there. It makes fun of the movie process altogether. As one of the football players on the field in Not Another Teen Movie has a jersey on that says on the back of it 'Extra'. Hilarious stuff. This movie goes so deep and rings true on all levels that it goes after. Every joke is pretty much a hit, where as nowadays with the spoofs that are made, every joke is pretty much a miss. Not Another Teen Movie spoofs a lot of popular movies and it points out the ridiculous nature of all of those popular movies and because that ridiculous nature rings true and makes sense(And that's been the main problem for the last 10 years on spoofs, they don't ring true or make sense to the movie they're making fun of\/spoofing on), it makes Not Another Teen Movie a classic!

Angry at his intrusion, especially on the campus, a scene I loved, she becomes confused, her future plans. turned upside by this hunk, where finally she has to choose.

Roddy Piper plays a homeless drifter whom discovers the reason for the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor in the world when finding himself a box of glasses in a church. When he put on the sunglasesses, he can see that aliens truth faces and notice they have infiltrated society in diguises of wealthy yuppies. He sees through their subliminal messages in media outlooks such as books, magazine, billboards and television such as words like obey and don't question. The use of black and white whenever John puts on the glasses, give the word, a 1950's B-movie look as well, as tribute to them. I can't help thinking it's a Twilight Zone episode. The black and white also gives the movie, totalitarian look at it, as if watching fascism era footage. He soon joins the counter culture in a revolution to stop the invasion. Roddy was great in the role, he had such a rich and textured character in this film. His performance is still one of the more underrated and meaningful in a science-fiction film because it deals with something we live with every day, advertising and authority, and to not let either rule you. It's about being your own boss, and live life the way you want. Rather than looking not normal like Hulk Hogan, Piper doesn't looks like a WWE guy, but a regular Joe who stand under the moral nothing wrong with a hard day's work. He starts to see not only does the aliens hold a threat, but common human beings whom sold themselves out for greed. I think most people miss the over-all deeper message of the movie. No the evil in this world is not aliens from another planet, but the men and women who let greed rule them and would step on anyone for wealth. TV, advertising, and mainstream news does make people sleep or rather get dumbed down. We are manipulated on a daily basis as we are their slaves. America was based on the idea that everyone has an equal chance but this is just no longer the case, that's what set off Piper into fighting them. Pipers starts to quote one-liners only to feed how badass the character is. Some of them are good, some of them come out of nowhere. I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I'm all outta bubblegum. he quotes on the run, what kind of person says that when cops are chasing him. Shouldn't he not be public light at this point. Piper enlisted co-worker Frank (Keith David) after the world's longest fist fight over nothing. No, really. This scene was only suppose to be 20 secs, but John Carperter like the fight so much, he put the whole fight scene in. Carpenter allows 5 minutes of gratuitous Piper-David eye-gouging, an apparent bone to wrestling fans. The fight is brutal, and both characters nearly killed each other just because Frank is too proud to try on the magic dark glasses. It is completely stupid. Man, that guy is the worst sunglasses sellsman I've ever seen. Both men happen to stumbles (literally) into the scope of how big this reality of a galactic-size conspiracy when they find their secret base and a rich guy who show them throughout the base and how to stop them. He tells him, that it turns out those darn aliens are just intergalactic free enterprisers doing a little cross-worlds exploitation of our natural resources because the Earth is just another Third World to them. The media and the human power elite buy into this exploitation -- for them, it's just business as usual. All that information, for what reason. Why because he mistakes them for millionaires despite Roddy and Keith not wearing suits, looking dirty, and out of place. Come on, Carpenter, that's probably one of the most sloppy writing I ever saw. It's seem rush. On the way, both men meet up with one of the most scariest actor I ever saw in dimensional doppelganger of Kristie Alley, Meg Foster. She reads out the lines, barely giving out an emotion depth to it at all, and somehow she end up as the love interest to Roddy's character. She got what she deserve in the end of the movie, so look forward to that. This satire of Reaganomics and the greed is good era is a great genre picture with a clever subtext. John Carpenter still tells a story better than his contemporaries. His heroes are more interesting. He's a master of mood and timing, which probably comes from his instincts as a musician.

Roddy was great in the role, he had such a rich and textured character in this film. His performance is still one of the more underrated and meaningful in a science-fiction film because it deals with something we live with every day, advertising and authority, and to not let either rule you. It's about being your own boss, and live life the way you want. Rather than looking not normal like Hulk Hogan, Piper doesn't looks like a WWE guy, but a regular Joe who stand under the moral nothing wrong with a hard day's work. He starts to see not only does the aliens hold a threat, but common human beings whom sold themselves out for greed. I think most people miss the over-all deeper message of the movie. No the evil in this world is not aliens from another planet, but the men and women who let greed rule them and would step on anyone for wealth. TV, advertising, and mainstream news does make people sleep or rather get dumbed down. We are manipulated on a daily basis as we are their slaves. America was based on the idea that everyone has an equal chance but this is just no longer the case, that's what set off Piper into fighting them. Pipers starts to quote one-liners only to feed how badass the character is. Some of them are good, some of them come out of nowhere. I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I'm all outta bubblegum. he quotes on the run, what kind of person says that when cops are chasing him. Shouldn't he not be public light at this point. Piper enlisted co-worker Frank (Keith David) after the world's longest fist fight over nothing. No, really. This scene was only suppose to be 20 secs, but John Carperter like the fight so much, he put the whole fight scene in. Carpenter allows 5 minutes of gratuitous Piper-David eye-gouging, an apparent bone to wrestling fans. The fight is brutal, and both characters nearly killed each other just because Frank is too proud to try on the magic dark glasses. It is completely stupid. Man, that guy is the worst sunglasses sellsman I've ever seen. Both men happen to stumbles (literally) into the scope of how big this reality of a galactic-size conspiracy when they find their secret base and a rich guy who show them throughout the base and how to stop them. He tells him, that it turns out those darn aliens are just intergalactic free enterprisers doing a little cross-worlds exploitation of our natural resources because the Earth is just another Third World to them. The media and the human power elite buy into this exploitation -- for them, it's just business as usual. All that information, for what reason. Why because he mistakes them for millionaires despite Roddy and Keith not wearing suits, looking dirty, and out of place. Come on, Carpenter, that's probably one of the most sloppy writing I ever saw. It's seem rush. On the way, both men meet up with one of the most scariest actor I ever saw in dimensional doppelganger of Kristie Alley, Meg Foster. She reads out the lines, barely giving out an emotion depth to it at all, and somehow she end up as the love interest to Roddy's character. She got what she deserve in the end of the movie, so look forward to that. This satire of Reaganomics and the greed is good era is a great genre picture with a clever subtext. John Carpenter still tells a story better than his contemporaries. His heroes are more interesting. He's a master of mood and timing, which probably comes from his instincts as a musician. Give it a try, and put on the shades.

I have known about this movie for a long time, but was always hesitant to see it, because when something like this appears in theaters 6 months after a groundbreaking film like the Matrix, you fully expect it to be a complete rip off. I was sitting at home flipping through the channels and saw the Matrix on, but I didn't wanna see it for the millionth time and decided to see if the Thirteenth Floor was streaming and sure it enough it was, and what a terrific story it turned out to be! In the year 2000, scientists have found a way to transfer a persons consciousness into a fully interactive computer program which has the potential to replace video games. The creator however has discovered a major problem with the system and is found dead. The second in charge of the project soon learns the answer to this brutal murder appears in the simulator, which is a replica of 1937. The story is absolutely ingenious and I loved how the film jumps between present day and the 1930s, it was like watching two stories at once that you knew would eventually come together. Craig Bierko stars in what turns out to be one of his few leading roles and he's just terrific. I remember him as the bad guy in the Long Kiss Goodnight and I thought he was great then, and he's great now. To make the cast even stronger, they take the intense Bierko and pair him with Law & Order's Vincent D'Onofrio, who is quite possibly the most intense actor in Hollywood. To top the whole thing off, this movie has a huge twist in the end, a twist that will make a lot of people wonder about the true nature of their own reality.

However, not all the performances hit home. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Eliot Ness was anything but spectacular, which is a great shame as Kevin Costner is a very good actor. Also Sean Connery's portrayal of Jim Malone is by no means bad, it's just that his character is Irish and, yeah, whatever that accent was, it wasn't Irish.What the film does really well though is how it is shot. The sweeping shots of Chicago look magnificent. However, on a technical standpoint nothing else really impresses like it should. There is one scene in particular where they use slow mo. The reason I bring this up is that it is one thing to use slow mo but it is another to over use it, especially as it is only this one scene that uses it, it does really take you out of what is meant to be a pinnacle moment of the film and it never really brings you out of that area and gets you immersed in the film again. The music can also be distracting, for the most part it's okay, it does its job but when an important part of the film rears its head, it goes all operatic which really doesn't fit the tone or the setting of the movie, which again slightly draws you out of the movie. In conclusion, The Untouchables is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen, however, for what it is and how much of a defining moment the plan to bring down Al Capone was in history, it just wasn't enough and for what I was expecting, I was a little let down.

From gritty westerns to hard-boiled private eyes, Hollywood continues to provide stories showing that revenge is a positive thing. But here in the UK, we don't have that sort of mentality. This is arguably the closest to a classic quest for vengeance as we've produced and sure enough, this movie is as cold and barren as the city it's set in. This is a world with no heroes and a sketchy moral compass and like Point Blank or (for modern movie-goers) Payback, this is one of those films when bad people do bad things to badder people.East End gangster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) returns to his hometown of Newcastle in the north of England after his brother dies in a drink-driving incident. However, Jack smells a rat and begins to look into things. A complex web of lies, secrets and criminality soon emerges and Jack is forced to root through Newcastle's underworld in order to find out who killed his brother including local crime boss Kinnear (John Osborne) and shady businessman Cliff Brumby (Brian Mosley). But Jack's London colleagues aren't too happy either...Get Carter is a tough film to watch, even by modern standards. Caine, in a role that's the polar opposite of Charlie Croker from The Italian Job a few years earlier, is a mean son-of-a-gun and isn't afraid to indulge in the dark side to get things done. It's a shock to see him slap women about or show a total lack of remorse for his actions, regardless of who gets hurt. It's also a tough story to follow, mirroring the sort of Raymond Chandler novels that this film aspires to. But not only is this a hard-as-nails revenge thriller but there is something else, a faint whiff of coolness that blows through the picture. Caine, whilst playing a pretty unlikeable character, is magnetic as Carter, infusing a macabre humour into this darkest of roles. The soundtrack is also first-class - not especially prominent but the theme that plays over the opening credits simply works brilliantly well.Get Carter remains one of the most unique British pictures I can think of. It's hugely influential and is now considered iconic - hard to imagine Guy Ritchie having a career without this to base Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels on. It's a harsh but exciting ride through a side of society that Brits don't often see portrayed on these shores. Without Caine, this would have been a fairly forgettable flick but Caine's charisma and star quality shine through an otherwise grey and grim movie. It is also, as if you couldn't guess, so much better than Sly Stallone's half-arsed remake. Looks like my resolution is watch more older movies might not be so bad after all if they can match the quality on display here.

The soundtrack is also first-class - not especially prominent but the theme that plays over the opening credits simply works brilliantly well.Get Carter remains one of the most unique British pictures I can think of. It's hugely influential and is now considered iconic - hard to imagine Guy Ritchie having a career without this to base Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels on. It's a harsh but exciting ride through a side of society that Brits don't often see portrayed on these shores. Without Caine, this would have been a fairly forgettable flick but Caine's charisma and star quality shine through an otherwise grey and grim movie. It is also, as if you couldn't guess, so much better than Sly Stallone's half-arsed remake. Looks like my resolution is watch more older movies might not be so bad after all if they can match the quality on display here.

From gritty westerns to hard-boiled private eyes, Hollywood continues to provide stories showing that revenge is a positive thing. But here in the UK, we don't have that sort of mentality. This is arguably the closest to a classic quest for vengeance as we've produced and sure enough, this movie is as cold and barren as the city it's set in. This is a world with no heroes and a sketchy moral compass and like Point Blank or (for modern movie-goers) Payback, this is one of those films when bad people do bad things to badder people.East End gangster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) returns to his hometown of Newcastle in the north of England after his brother dies in a drink-driving incident. However, Jack smells a rat and begins to look into things. A complex web of lies, secrets and criminality soon emerges and Jack is forced to root through Newcastle's underworld in order to find out who killed his brother including local crime boss Kinnear (John Osborne) and shady businessman Cliff Brumby (Brian Mosley). But Jack's London colleagues aren't too happy either...Get Carter is a tough film to watch, even by modern standards. Caine, in a role that's the polar opposite of Charlie Croker from The Italian Job a few years earlier, is a mean son-of-a-gun and isn't afraid to indulge in the dark side to get things done. It's a shock to see him slap women about or show a total lack of remorse for his actions, regardless of who gets hurt. It's also a tough story to follow, mirroring the sort of Raymond Chandler novels that this film aspires to. But not only is this a hard-as-nails revenge thriller but there is something else, a faint whiff of coolness that blows through the picture. Caine, whilst playing a pretty unlikeable character, is magnetic as Carter, infusing a macabre humour into this darkest of roles.

To me that one is decent at best. It was far from perfect. This one however is the classic example of a bad horror sequel.The movie's plot is that Seth's son Martin has accelerated growth (what a way to speed up the plot!) and is trying to work on his fathers project. He meet a girl and they become friends (or love interests but in this movie it seems like they were just friends with sex). He finds out that the company that raised him want him to transform. Then (magically I might add) he starts to transform by running from the company to his love interest\/friend's houseboat that seems to be on land. After that they run to a hotel, then back to the company. He ends up having his transformation into a Kaiju monster complete (I say Kaiju monster because he looks nothing like a Fly) then rampages to fuse his DNA with the DNA of his adopted father.The acting is awful, the only exception is John Getz (who reprises his role from the first movie). The only other person you might know is Daphne Zuniga who's most known role is Princess Vespa in Spaceballs. Anything that tried to come off as suspenseful was instead boring. Some of the script is laughable, especially when the control room guy said that they wouldn't know what Martin Brundle would look like (Hmmm, have you thought he looked like a giant fly?).

Meanwhile, an evil sorcerer named Rothbart captures Odette and turns her into a swan that would only turn her back into a human as the moon rises. As Derek tries to find Odette by learning from his mistake, Odette and her animal friends Jean-Bob, a frog, Speed, a turtle, and Puffin, a bird attempts to bring her back to Derek.I first saw this film when I was a child and it has been stuck with me ever since even as a young adult (I'm turning 19 soon, by the way). It still holds up, but there are two problems that I do have with this classic. The animation is beautiful and colorful, but is a bit deflated some of the time. Derek is a bland character, but is a somewhat sympathetic character since he learned that to love a woman is to prove his love for her.Flaws aside, everything else still holds up. The story is very original and sticks closely to the ballet without any ballet dances which works for me. The characters are charming and likable; Odette is a beautiful and feisty character and I liked her hair as well. The side characters including Bromley, Rogers (whose line How To Offend Women In 5 Syllables Or Less made me laugh) and Uberta, who never fails to steal every scene in the movie. The animal sidekicks including Jean-Bob, Speed, and Puffin are excellent. The villain Rothbart, voiced by the late Jack Palace, is great and his motives, although over-the-top, are very amusing. The songs, on the whole, are pleasant and memorable to listen to especially Far Longer Than Forever. Even the ending is satisfying. The battle between Derek and Rothbart is the best highlight of the movie because it represents some of the past-Disney films with a style and tone to it.Overall, The Swan Princess isn't a masterpiece, but it's by no means a cult classic that has been stuck with me since my childhood. It may have received a mixed reception when it was first released, but I'm recommending this to those who love Disney and Non-Disney films.

If you follow your strong beliefs and make good, responsible decisions, you can be the best at what you choose.To be or not to be, that is a choice for us. You should promote yourself, not destroy yourself. You need to show your feelings and who you are to let people understand you.Dead Poets Society is a rare movie showing choices for education and for life. You can seize the day or just do what other people want you to do. It's a memorable movie with creative ideas and a dramatic plot. The movie will not only bathe you with happiness, but also make you think about yourself and your life. Life, for all of us, starts as a blank canvas; what we paint on that is our choice.

The film is told from the view point of a taxi driver named Travis, played by legendary actor Robert de Niro. It tells the tale of this taxi driver who begins to question the life around him during his time as a nighttime taxi driver and eventually attempts to put an end to the scum the city has produced. The acting, first of all, is brilliant. Robert de Niro is in this movie...Need I say anymore about him. A younger Jodie Foster is also in this movie as Iris, a young girl who is a prostitute who was unable to be saved by Travis one night and was set off with a bribe. This continues to haunt him and so, Travis leads a rescue mission to save Iris and reduce the town of its violence. The movie is simply said, flawless in every manner. There isn't a weak part about the film. The character of Travis is very interesting, the dialogue is moving, the acting and direction is brilliant and the story is great. Like I said earlier, this movie isn't for everyone and many will not like this movie if the genre of Drama doesn't suit them. The film is slowly paced but I had a blast from start to finish and by the end of the film, wish it were longer! Go check it out but I cannot promise that everyone will love this movie. Its to me, a true classic!
