This second one is pretty much just about me and will tell you nothing about the film. And... I'm just curious. How does One write a decent review WITHOUT revealing spoilers? Hmmm...I've been putting this off for a long time. I'm not sure I will enlighten anyone on this film more that the 244 reviews before me; so, I'm pretty sure I'm doing this for ME. Let me just preface this (for those of you who haven't visited my profile) by telling you I have a DVD problem (much like women and shoes. Take it sexist if you will but we all have one buying problem or another.) I own over 4,000 DVD's. Not as large as some (just search movie collections on tube sites) but much more than your average collection. So when I choose Phantasm as my favorite movie it's got some weight behind it. And I say MY favorite film because it's completely my opinion. I'm not here to make it yours. I used to manage a video store in Las Vegas. The last two questions I wanted to hear from a customer were, Is this SUPPOSED to be good? and, What do you recommend? To the first I would usually reply, I guess; the reviews are good. To the second I would always reply, Nothing. I tend to like B(ad)-Movies. Who wants to recommend a movie where the customer will come back angry? Hopefully no one. I would tell people that my opinion is most probably not theirs'. This said...The first time I saw Phantasm was in the summer of '79 at an outdoor theater in Oshkosh, Wisconsin when I was 13 1\/2 years old. (Ewww, it's a math problem...) I'm just saying I was very impressionable. I'd have to say it was my first horror movie. I could not have been introduced better. Friday The 13th was still a summer away. I may have also seen Tourist Trap in '79. Good times. I thought Phantasm was a foreign film. In my mind this movie could not have come out of the U.S. And time did nothing but confirm this belief. In the following years I was to see many, many Italian horror movies. For me Phantasm fit perfectly into that way of film making. Its richly colorful palate and its barely understandable storyline, not to mention the score, placed it squarely, for me, into foreign-film brackets. And just look at the last name of the director. How Italian can you get? I used to watch their lips very closely to see if there was an English overdub. None of this is true, of course. Although Don Coscarelli was born in Libya with obviously Italian heritage. Who would guess he grew up in Long Beach, California?So what do we have here? A (foreign-looking) horror-science-fiction-mystery. One of very few, I'm sure. I dislike not understanding a storyline in a film. In fact, I'm usually the guy that figures out, very early on, how the movie is going to end. A lot of the time the way I see an ending is better than the way it usually does. So I watched Phantasm over and over and over... Until I was fairly sure I got it. I also watched the sequels many times in hopes that this would help me further understand. Keep in mind Don C. just wanted the movie to be fun. Stanley Kubrick once said, A film can be real or entertaining, it's very difficult to be both. And entertaining it is! It's one of those movies you just let flow over you the first couple of times before you start picking at it. It's glossy, fast paced, and ever-so 70's. It, like many things to come in the 80's, didn't have to make sense. It just had to be cotton candy for the senses. Now I know there are a lot of you reading this and saying (probably out-loud) How did he not get this? I was 13 people! I'd (probably) seen my first R-rated film (let alone a horror movie.) My parents didn't own a VCR until 1981. And... I didn't own a copy of it until 1987. So all I had to go on was an outdoor theater experience... twice maybe. Eight years after that I was playing catch-up.My interpretation? You don't want or need that from me. Read the other 244 reviews. I'm sure they're full of interpretations and opinions. Besides, you know how I feel about recommendations. Just know that I watch Phantasm and its three sequels at least once a year. They are precious pieces of time for me. They certainly started a rather large ball rolling where my film collecting is concerned. I will give you one opinion on my way out. 75% of my favorite HORROR movies came out between '77 and '80.

The sadistic colonel in charge of his work camp, Colonel Yin (Soon-Tek Oh) acts like a dictator, and just when you think you can't hate this guy any more, he ups the stakes yet again.With Lance Hool taking the directors' reins, this proves to be a high old time for the action junkie, underscored by the genuine poignancy to be found in stories about prisoners of war. This is exciting much of the time, with kick ass battle footage, lots of explosions, lots of gunfire, and some breathtaking scenery. Chuck is a formidable hero as always, and Oh is a deliciously evil bad guy. Lending strong support are Cosie Costa, Joe Michael Terry, and especially John Wesley as the ailing Franklin. Steven Williams is good in an initially unlikable part as a captain eager to cooperate with his captors in exchange for better treatment.

Whenever he was cast as a good guy, he would be unbeatable, if not immortal. The prime example of this kind of aura that Mr. Schwarzenegger has established for himself is in the movie Commando (1985). And for most viewers, it is easy to suspend our belief when it comes to that, and come up with various explanations to how he can withstand such bodily strain and continue to push forward. The reason behind this was that Schwarzenegger was fighting ordinary people. But this crosses the line on believability.The story is about the ever popular End of the World prophecy that got nearly everybody cringing on New Year's Eve of 1999, where the devil is predicted on returning to open the gates of hell. Thankfully there's Schwarzenegger, playing a depressed ex-cop, Jericho Cane, who lost his family to some no-name robbers and now plays by his own game. But seriously, Schwarzenegger is going to save the day? How does a human being stop a supernatural force like the devil? That should be impossible! Well apparently not, but I still found the whole concept flawed.Character wise, Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't even give a truly convincing performance. It's obvious that he put on some weight too since his last appearance in Batman & Robin (1997). Plus, most Schwarzenegger films have good one liners, I only laughed at one here. His performance was just dry. Playing the devil is Gabriel Byrne and he's even worse. For the majority of the film, Byrne will just walk around with a smirk on his face blowing up things or killing people. He's not menacing at all. However, there was one good scene between Byrne and Schwarzenegger when the devil tempted Cane into joining him. That was interesting, but the rest was slow dialog. The writer, Andrew W. Marlowe who also wrote the script to Hollow Man (2000) didn't do a good job here.The makeup effects I do favor along the various horror elements that were randomly inserted in the movie. Those were okay, and I say okay because they weren't scary but it was ugly visuals, which makes them horrific. Even special effects master, Stan Winston headed the creature effects, which I was happy to see. However, the effects used even in here were almost barely on screen. I also didn't understand some of the editing in this movie. There was an alley fight scene and some of the shots switched out too often too quickly. That was frustrating to sit through. Lastly, the score John Debney composed wasn't great either. There was a theme, which is fine, but it wasn't memorable. There was also a motif for the devil but honestly that particular tune was more annoying. Every time it played, the audience will know the devil is coming but it's so annoying that audiences will roll their eyes when they hear it, instead of cringing in fear. Also, the tracks that covered the action scenes were too generic, there was nothing that made me sit on the edge of my seat hoping for the best. The music wasn't compelling. This movie works in some places but not many. The people who will enjoy it the most are the Schwarzenegger fans.Schwarzenegger's acting is plain, the action is generic and the music is too formulaic.

This movie provides real life lessons and over the top portrayals of the drug culture from the 1960's through the 1980's. By showing how one man became tempted by fast money and big risks, this film has successfully shown how drug smugglers become who they are and it also shows that they are just as human as anyone else. With a wonderful story and great casting, Blow has revolutionized the drug movie and brought many new ideas regarding drugs and illegal activities to light. George was the son of an honest working, but relatively poor father who could never make enough money to satisfy George's mother. While living a childhood with poor but loving parents, George Jung decided he never wanted to live the way his parents had. With his life decisions in mind, it seems that George never learned his father's lesson that money isn't real&#x85; it only seems real. When George became old enough to move out, Jung moved to California with his best friend where they began selling marijuana to support their newfound independence. Despite not making much, George saw the allure of the easy money and was immediately hooked. After peddling weed on California beaches, one thing led to another and George found himself shipping loads of marijuana to the New England area where he grew up. With the help of his childhood friends, Jung had begun making more money than he could ever imagine.His national marijuana operation ended after he was arrested in Chicago with 660 pounds of marijuana and was ordered to serve prison time in 1974. As the Depp narrates, his character went in to prison with a bachelor's in marijuana and came out with a doctorate in cocaine. As soon as he was done serving his couple of years in prison, George was working with one of his fellow inmates shipping cocaine from Pablo Escobar's ranch to the United States. It has been claimed that Jung was making anywhere from $1.5-$15 million per run from Columbia. With this easy money, one can see how his decisions were blinded by the many motivations. Despite this whole drug-smuggling operation seeming like a great story, this is only one portion of George Jung's story. Before serving his time in prison after his 1974 Chicago arrest, he lost his longtime girlfriend to cancer. The reason I find this so important to the story is that one could assume that losing his girlfriend, whom he planned to marry, may have hardened him in some manner. By having to cope with losing a fiancée, and having parents that have disowned you because of the decisions you've made, one may be led to believe that there isn't much to lose by beginning work as a drug smuggler again. This is why I believe George was so willing to work with Pablo Escobar and begin trafficking cocaine. I find this intriguing because most movies wouldn't be so willing to sympathize with the drug users and usually depict them as low-life's who have many psychological problems. Granted, George had a lot of issues, he was just a normal guy that took a few wrong turns and found himself regretting his life decisions. This movie does a wonderful job of differentiating the main character from other bad men participating in this line of work. Played by Johnny Depp, George is a character that you begin to sympathize with and almost root for as you watch the movie. Even if you do think drugs are evil and there are no excuses for supplying America with 85% of their cocaine, as you watch the movie, Depp's narration throughout the film begins to relate to you in different ways than you could imagine. This film does a great job of showing Jung's gradually conflicting motives between the love for his family and the love for money and luxuries. From becoming an independent man living away from his family for the first time, to a husband and a caring father, Johnny Depp was perfectly casted for this lead role as George Jung. Throughout the film George's appearance changes as he starts to do drugs and begins smuggling pounds of cocaine. Depp's long hair most accurately depicts the drug user of the 70's and 80's. Also, Depp's character does not look out of place in the lavish parties of the very wealthy drug lords. There are many different things about Depp that made him perfect for the role of this dominant, yet caring drug lord. As you watch Blow, depending on your view on drugs you may start off against Depp's character; but towards the end you will be on Jung's side, wishing that he could take back his bad mistakes. Regardless of his supplying cocaine to America, the end of this movie will bring you to tears in sympathy for George Jung. You will be wishing George listened to his father's words of wisdom about how money is not everything that matters in life. If you don't believe that you will end up feeling bad for this genius drug smuggler by the end of this movie, please watch it and prove me wrong.

For years I'd heard about how outrageous and empowering this film is, but I'd never seen it in it's entirety. I've seen bits and pieces on cable and seen parodies of it, but I really never saw anything that made me want to watch it. The story is an interesting one about these two ladies who go on a weekend vacation. The ladies go drinking and partying, which gets them into some trouble and leads to them going on the run. This is one of those films that has those classic moments that really shine over the rest of the film. I found Thelma & Louise to be quite forgettable, but it's those particular scenes that will stay with me. The cast was in class all it's own and I think that's why the critics loved this film so much. Thelma & Louise may have been revolutionary for 1992, but in 2013, it's really not all that extreme, and in the years since, there have been so many copycats, that it's hard to differentiate it from all the similar stories that came after it. Geena Davis is just unbelievably good as Thelma. I love Geena Davis, I think she's extremely underrated, and it's her performance that makes this film work. How she doesn't win the Oscar for her portrayal of Thelma is beyond me.

I found Thelma & Louise to be quite forgettable, but it's those particular scenes that will stay with me. The cast was in class all it's own and I think that's why the critics loved this film so much. Thelma & Louise may have been revolutionary for 1992, but in 2013, it's really not all that extreme, and in the years since, there have been so many copycats, that it's hard to differentiate it from all the similar stories that came after it.

I never really understood why everyone watched and spoke of great things about that movie until now. After watching Shawshank Redemption, it really opened my mind to a lot of different things. This movie not only provided, the drama and crime, but it also provided action and even a mystery. This movie is about a man who had a successful career as a banker; however, one day he came home to find out that his wife was having an affair with him. In anger he decided to pull out a revolver and fix the problem himself. So later on he is then accused of first-degree murder and sentenced to two life terms in prison. While in prison the banker had a series of obstacles he had to overcome, especially being a rich guy who had everything he wanted to be a convict who is stripped away from their life. After a few years in Shawshank Prison, the banker finally began to get acclimated. Later on, it did not take long for the banker to hear that he may be innocent and then try to devise a plan to show his innocence that just may or may not work. The main characters in this film were played as, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins; thus in my opinion, were outstanding actors and really portrayed their characters as if it were them living that life. I believe that the director of this film did a great job in producing such an awesome movie. This review is actually very hard to write because there is so many emotions I feel after watching the movie. How be ever, the movie offered a great deal of implied metaphors such as when Morgan Freeman uses slang to describe his feelings towards other inmates which allowed the audience to constantly sit on the edge of their seat not knowing what might happen next. This movie may not be your modern era film, but it definitely made an impact on the reality of life. The director, Frank Darabont, definitely put a lot of emphasis on how Tim Robbins' character was influenced by others throughout the movie. Same goes with Morgan Freeman, his character in this movie impacted a lot of people either in a negative way or even a positive way. In Shawshank Redemption, I think by the setting taken place in a prison really presented a more harsh times feel to the movie such as sexual harassment and brutal beatings by guards. Also I really enjoyed how every little phrase or word, both by an inmate or a guard, stood out and brought a different meaning to the movie. When you watch this movie you must pay attention to every little detail. If you don't, then you will be lost and continue to ask yourself, What is going on? That's just how it is with Shawshank Redemption. In this movie you would think it would be just your average prison film but it's not. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in a good mystery\/action and even a drama. This is an outstanding movie and I'm so glad I watched it because it definitely opened my mind about the reality of life's struggles.

It was by no means a straight remake of his first interpretation and the differences are many, with some aspects updated, others changed completely. Even the narrative itself is markedly altered, though the broad strokes of the plot remain intact.As is the case here, the collaborations between Hitchcock and Jimmy Stewart are numerous and generally very successful. The director liked to use him so much due to Stewart's demeanour, embodying the average Joe and enabling audiences to put themselves in his characters' shoes much more easily. It's a feature that works especially well in this particular picture, though the archetype has evolved somewhat over the years since its production and he can sometimes come off a little gruff.The choice of Doris Day for the female lead caused some concern at the time, as she was never a name that was associated with dramatic roles. It's a shame in some ways that she was so closely aligned with musicals due to her vocal talents, as her work in the film is excellent, particularly in the more emotional scenes, which showed her to be a quite capable actress when the situation called for it. There are also one or two scenes with songs shoehorned in, but they are done tastefully and fit with her role as a retired star of the stage.The famous Royal Albert Hall scene is where the film reaches its peak and it has stood the test of time well. The tension remains intact and the desperation of Stewart's Dr. McKenna is palpable.

It is a curious thing when a text attempts to handle that of demons, ghouls and ghosts. Deep down, I suppose, it is somewhat perversely pleasurable to convince ourselves of their existence. As years have passed, germs have replaced the invisible monsters that-once-were as the cause for illness; technology has been able to deduce whether or not haunted locales truly are as such while science; theories on evolution and modernity in general has done 'wonders' to disprove the idea that religion and so forth are as genuine as everybody thought they were for so long.There was a line in the Tarantino-penned 1996 horror film From Dusk til Dawn when the anti-heroic lead states that if there is a Hell, and that the monsters occupying an adjacent room are from it, then there's got to be a Heaven. Should the existence of ghosts, demons and whatnot run in tandem with the theory that there is a heaven and an afterlife? Probably, and yet in spite of all this sweeping modernity doing well to disprove the spirit world and the idea of an 'afterlife', there are still those who remain unconvinced of a ghost's inauthenticity; remain staunch that they've encountered one and remain adamant that the line between our world and the next not only exists, but is thinner than you think. One of the (admittedly, few) charms of the 1984 horror\/comedy Ghostbusters is how it exploits the belief of that line while keeping everything as reigned in as it does. This is not, for the best part, an all-out horror film depicting nasty, invading spirits doing their utmost to invade a densely populated human locale, although it does descend into that by the end. Moreover, this is a clash of the old and the new; an unabashed depiction of hauntings and ghosts as very much real but a depiction of science and technology otherwise associated with disproving God; Heaven; Hell and reincarnation through spirit being used to counter said entities.New York City must be one of the most populated zones in the world, but does that mean there'd be more or fewer ghosts there than somewhere largely vacant, such as that attic in an old, isolated English manor house from centuries ago located somewhere in the countryside. Regardless, the leads therein the film discover a fair few of them merely going about their routines in a manner that is underplayed and quite funny but, one senses, realistic to the cause should a large uncovering of spirits ever unfold. Ivan Reitman's film mixes the audacious with the bubble-gum, a depicting people coming into contact with spiritual entities although sadly never really learning anything nor becoming more enriched as a result of it. While the film is quite good fun and often funny, it comes across as too superficial to be anything wonderfully inventive nor much more than frivolously academic. It's often quite childish, even dull in places. Admittedly, where not every film of its ilk can be as good as The Sixth Sense, where the presence of ghosts in a characters life leads to an enriched bond with a psychologist, Ghostbusters does hit the odd mark.The film follows four New York City based men, two Caucasian; an African American and a Jew, who set up their own business in a disused fire station that specialises in ghostly phenomena. Initially, the men (still minus the African American) are ill-suited to the practical aspect of their work where the theory is all in the right place. Uncovering a poltergeist in a library archive, they can only run screaming for their lives when it turns uglier than they'd like. Buoyed by their experience, they have enough confidence to set up this business when a university cuts their funding and the enterprise turns into a ghost 'busting' organisation upon realising there's money in making the ghosts go away &#x96; a sort of supernatural pest exterminator. Among them is Bill Murray's psychologist Peter Venkman, a man whose womanising ways is evident in the opening and who remains largely sceptical on the whole library phenomena anyway where his partners do not. At the other end of the spectrum is Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler, a dry man and the most intelligent of the four who is too deep into his work to notice the affection shown towards him by their eventual receptionist. Somewhere in the middle is the funny-as-Murray but as-good-at-his-job-as-Ramis Dan Akroyd, who plays Raymond Stantz. Narrative is, of course, superfluous in a film like Ghostbusters; its end-of-the-world routine, as Sigorney Weaver's Dana Barrett discovers a gateway into a doom-laden alternate dimension, is as nonsensical as it gets in a film which might otherwise have been quite intelligently theological. The true pleasures lie in the film's would-be tryst involving the ever-humorous Venkman and the delight in the way he shares his scenes with Weaver, although we do not come to observe much closure to any of it &#x96; nor indeed do we Spengler's with the receptionist. The film is more interested in cracking on with its primary tract of special effects and unexplained alternative universes which, one assumes, comes complete with their own dynamic structures but the likes of which are not explored here. But it remains difficult to get angry with the film because it has with it a boyish energy; it does the rare thing for an American blockbuster in actually trying to sell to you this U.S.P. innocently and fondly, as if it cares for it so much and wants you to share in this fondness. In the ever declining cinematic world of 'event' movies within which we live, that alone is justification for checking Ghostbusters out.

Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a suspense, thriller film that is still effective today. I have not seen a lot of Hitchcock's films and the ones I have seen are the most known; Vertigo, Rear Window, North By Northwest and now Psycho. This film has become such an icon in horror and thriller films that it becomes so hard for a person in my generation to come in this film fresh and be ignorant. This film is very effective as the story requires the audience to not have an idea of what is coming next.As I said before, I came into this knowing all the iconic scenes but luckily I did not know about the main twist at the end of the film. This film was based on a novel by Robert Bloch but developed to the screen by Joseph Stefano. I have not watched any other works by Joseph Stefano and I have not read Bloch's novel but yet due to popular culture the film kind of takes the fun out of watching this film. Though stripped off of it's suspense at times but the film's story story was still entertaining due to its characters. I admire the fact that the film decides to take an unexpected turn and switch the focus on Norman Bates rather than Marion Crane. I find Norman an interesting figure and is something of a mystery. I do tend to give a more positive rating to films that dives into human psychology, which is the reason I liked films like Identity. Lila Crane is a great substitute of a strong female character and doesn't sacrifice the presence of women, something that is lacking in this film in my opinion. The film overall is great and the character Norman Bates is something that have influenced future films.Alfred HItchcock has been labelled as the master of suspense. Though I haven't seen all of his films but I felt Psycho is one of the films that solidified his reputation. To me, this film ties up there with Hitchcock's other film Vertigo. The film still does feel like a product of its time and may feel a little date in its effects, like when a certain someone falls down the stairs, but I watched this with that mindset and not allowing its dated flaws to ruin my judgement of the film. Psycho is still something that should be watched by the current generation and, mystery and suspense fans.John L. Russell is the film's cinematographer and in this film he ensures that everything does, every angle and every camera movement, supports in creating tension and suspense. The camera, a lot of the time, follows the characters ensuring that our focus stays on them. Shadows are important in shaping the tone and supports the characters' personalities and intentions. Some of these scenes are so iconic in its cinematography that it has attributed to the film's influence. Hitchcock may have decided to have this film in black and white because it is much cheaper to photograph it that way but I think this style is also something that he desired to avoid that feeling of a set.Bernard Herrmann is a legendary composer who have worked on the most acclaimed films; Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver and North By Northwest but I think this is his most iconic as it has been used and talked about by either critics or the general public. The film's tense moments are accompanied by harsh strings that shocks you as it screeches. Without Herrmann's score then the film would not give that same effect as it would with it.The most crucial actor that must be chosen perfectly is the role of Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has embodied the role of this damaged man so convincingly that it is horrifying to even think it. Janet Leigh was terrific, her acting did not outshine anyone but certain moments in the film like the suspicious police officer, shows more to her than a pretty face. Martin Balsam as the private detective was one of the most enjoyable ones in this film. I did not expect much from him because the last film I have seen him in is Breakfast at Tiffany's and he did not really do much there.Solid cast, beautiful black and white cinematography, legendary score, and great direction has earned this film a classic status and will remain that way until the end of cinema. I adore the psychological aspect of this film and the choice of black and white photography. This film has shaped modern thrillers and will continue to do so.

He's very enlightening and.....scary.Overall, this is a well-made, violent thriller about a guy who is mentally damaged. Some scenes are very graphic but this movie paints a picture that you'll remember for a very long time. I rate this film 9\/10.

I knew it was a complex, disturbing movie just from talking to other people. But, it also a well-made thriller with a wonderful lead performance by Christian Bale and the way the movie told the story is very mesmerizing. I heard the film is different than the book. but I love the way the movie painted the black-and-white picture of Patrick Bateman.Mary Harmon's movie is about a modern, iconic screen character named Patrick Bateman.

Lots of good race action and a great cast that work so well together. I never miss a chance to watch it when aired. Tom did a great job as Cole Trickle and Robert as his crew chief. The story line was good and as a Nascar fan I can relate to it with no problem. I also liked the way they made of real race footage in the movie it really added to the story line. The comedy was also very good just the right amount to keep you wanting for more. I would have to say this was one of Tom Cruise best movies and one that will always be a favorite among his fans.So In closing I would have to say if you have not seen it go out and rent it you wont be sorry.

Already being a fan of his work and knowing of his life, I was excited to see Vertigo, but nothing prepared me for what I was up for. It's different from Hitchcock's other directorial efforts, definitely being the most personal. Vertigo glimmers with the touch of autobiographical art that works so well in other movies by directors speaking from their soul, like 8 1\/2 from Fellini. The film is really as wonderful as its reputation holds it up to be. It's an enthralling piece that has turns so sharp it could cut flesh. Hitchcock creates an eerie mood that settles perfectly with the noir-eseqe story. It's psychologically engaging and challenging through the underlying suspense. Everywhere you look in Vertigo, there's a symbol. Each shot feels as if its been planned out and thought ahead by Hitchcock. The film editing hits every artistic note and the the score wows your ears. The entire movie plays like a ghost movie, but the fascinating thing about this explored theme is ghost changes with each Act. The ghost haunts your mind as it haunts the mind of James Stewart (who also delivers a fine performance), therein lies the brilliance. The film noir references create some poetically beautiful scenes that show the truth of human nature, whether its love, obsession, or insanity. Vertigo is technically ahead of its time, allowing audiences today to respond to it just as they would any movie released in 2013. It's a multi- layered film about complex characters, infatuation, and duplicity. Being autobiographical and knowing what we know about Hitchcock's life, some thoroughly depicted in Hitchcock (2012), Vertigo makes a lot of sense and we get to explore the heart and mind of Alfred Hitchcock. I believe, that Hitchcock, as a child fell in love with a proper, blonde woman, and she broke his heart. Now, as a response to that heartache, Hitchcock tries to recreate that fantasy to ease the hole left in his heart. The faux idea almost works as therapy for Hitchcock. Just my observation and a thought being thrown out there that could possibly explain his obsession and compulsion to the picture of his perfect woman he paints all over Vertigo. Vertigo capitalizes Hitchcock's life, symbolizing his filmmaking and the tendency to emotionally and psychologically attach himself to his leading actresses. The pieces of the puzzle to Vertigo feel like the pieces of the puzzle of Hitchcock's life, yet they fit together anomalously perfectly in the film, but I doubt they did in real life. Hitchcock was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to visit the lives of fictitious people and pliably craft that perfect woman expressively through art. His madness and determination are seen in Vertigo, through the James Stewart character. I wonder if Stewart knew he was playing Hitchcock himself in ways?In all honesty, I can identity with Hitchcock's tendencies. Clearly, not to the excessive and creepy levels of his life, but there's always that hole in myself I've tried to fill with the idea of the perfect best friend in my life, all have been beautiful, confident females. I can link my another obsession I have with Hitchcock's life tribulations my spurts with actresses. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Penelope Cruz, Marion Cotillard, Anne Hathaway, Gwyneth Paltrow are all women I've went through addictions where they stayed with me because of their work as actresses or their displays of their success in life. I've never been able to put my interest with them into sensible analytical thought, but the slight obsession has always been there.Vertigo touches me in the same ways that propelled Hitchcock to complete this film, it's rare when a movie can do that a viewer, but that's a reason directors sometimes make movies. We're all human and we all have things in common that we can share with each other. Regardless if you can link your soul to the artistic soul of Alfred Hitchcock, Vertigo is certainly something not to be missed. It's an exemplary mood-setting mystery that still has viewers in awe of the artistry and the plot twists that set the fantastic finale into place.
