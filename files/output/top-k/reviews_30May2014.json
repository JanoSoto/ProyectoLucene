You have more imagination and creativity than the majority of filmmakers working in Hollywood today. You're not afraid to go ALL OUT with your style to make the movies you want to make without worrying about what the critics would think. And you know how to do a lot of cool stuff with limited budgets. So why do you subject yourself to making garbage kids'movies like Spy Kids and poor imitations of exploitation films like Machete? However, when Rodriguez was good, he WAS good, and Desperado is probably him at his best.The plot of Desperado follows the character of El Mariachi after the events of the first film where he is now going after Bucho, the mob boss of Moco, the mobster who killed the woman he loved, Domino in the first film. Along the way, he comes across a woman named Carolina, a kid playing guitar, an assassin named Navajas, and many more on his quest to end Bucho.From a pure storytelling and scripting point of view, Desperado probably isn't a very good movie. Rodriguez, even in his heyday, has never been a particularly strong writer. He's always been a style over substance guy and this film's script clearly shows. Now I'm not saying the script sucked because the characters lacked depth or there isn't enough meaning and subtext because not every film needs to have those things, but as in it's a little lazy in its construction. For one thing, the character motivation of El Mariachi is really kinda vague and confusing. He wants revenge on the man who was the boss of the guy who killed his love, whom, really can't be held accountable for what happened and probably doesn't even know why someone would go on a vendetta against him like this in the first place. The film also doesn't really make this clear to the audience until the very end so a lot of the time, you'll just be confused as to why he's after him in the first place. It's even one of the FAQ's on this site. So in terms of character motivation, this film is a little weak.There's also some things in the film that just come out of nowhere, with no decent buildup or explanation. Midway through the film, El needs help to fight off Bucho's men so he calls up two friends who both have their own guitar-based weapon which is a really cool scene, but those guys are just randomly introduced into the film with no buildup whatsoever. They were never mentioned beforehand so it just comes across as a bit of a deus ex machina. There's also an incredibly stupid twist at the end of the film where it's revealed that Bucho is actually the Mariachi's brother. Outside of the fact that it's incredibly cliché to have the villain be somehow related to the hero in an action movie, there's also no real purpose to this. It's just a cheap excuse for the Mariachi not to kill Bucho at one point in the film when he has the perfect chance to. It doesn't even add much internal conflict for the characters as he just shoots him at the end anyways without any regret or guilt over doing so. So yeah, it's a pretty dumb twist.But while the film has those flaws, this is an undeniably entertaining movie. Robert Rodriguez may not be a great storyteller, but in terms of action, he's off-the-chart. This film has some really creatively staged, memorable shootouts that are clearly influenced by the works of John Woo, but have a certain exaggerated, almost comic-book-like quality to them and a sense of humor that make them incredibly fun to watch. Nobody in this film just falls down when they get shot, they either get riddled with bullets or they fly across the room while getting shot. There's also a lot of grace and choreography going on here, with Antonio Banderas jumping all-around and shooting people in all sorts of creative ways such as hitting a fan on the ceiling for it to drop on someone or kicking a guy across the room and then UNLOADING his pistols on him. The only thing that disappointed me, was the final confrontation, which was JUST the Mariachi shooting Bucho and then... the end. But overall, the action was pretty sweet.While Rodriguez isn't exactly Shakespeare, he DID manage to write some memorable scenes here. The opening scene has this great, spaghetti western feel to it with Steve Buscemi telling the story of how he came across the Mariachi in a bar in this exaggerated, stylized way with a lot of slow-mo and stylized lighting used for the Mariachi's entrance, it's a really fun way to open the movie. The camera movement is very dynamic throughout, and the action is FLAWLESSLY edited. He even squeezed in some memorable dialogue here and there with Tarantino telling an elaborate pee joke in a cameo midway through the film.The performances are a little uneven here, but Antonio Banderas STEALS the show here as El Mariachi. While Carlos Gallardos did a good job playing an innocent man on the run in the first film, Antonio is easily the more charismatic lead. He's more bada$$, he's funny, he's witty, and he's surprisingly believable in the action scenes. But Selma Hayek is a little bland as Carolina, the love interest for El. She looks nice but she doesn't have much personality beyond that. Joaquim de Almeida is a really generic, 80's\/90's action movie villain and that's all there is to him. He's efficient, but not particularly memorable. Steve Buscemi does a good job as El's accomplice and I wish we could've seen more of him.Overall, while Desperado isn't a particularly well-written film, the film makes up for it with an incredible entertainment factor. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 May 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Robert Rodriguez, what happened to you?

Anna and the King is Hollywood's second non-musical version of her story. Anna was a widowed British schoolteacher who travelled to Siam, as Thailand was then known, to become tutor to the many children and wives of King Mongkut. In reality she seems to have had little contact with the King himself, but her diaries suggested otherwise, and Westerners have long been fascinated by the supposed friendship which grew up between them. Some of the elements of this film will be recognisable to anyone familiar with The King and I. Both films mention Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin and feature a doomed romance between Lady Tuptim, one of the King's concubines, and a commoner. There are, of course, lots of outrageously cute children running about everywhere. The fictitious subplot in which Anna helps the King foil a military coup by a treacherous general, however, appears to be an invention by the scriptwriters for this film. Like The King and I the film was banned in Thailand on account of its allegedly disrespectful portrayal of King Mongkut; it would appear that the country's lèse-majesté laws protect not only the current monarch but also his predecessors. This rather heavy-handed censorship seems strange in a country which claims (or did until the recent military coup) to be a democracy; imagine the storm of protest which would have been unleashed had the British government, for example, attempted to censor Mrs Brown because of the way it depicted Queen Victoria. The film could not, of course, be shot in Thailand itself, and filming took place in Malaysia. The casting of Chow Yun-fat rather than a European like Yul Brynner as Mongkut seems to have been an attempt by the film-makers to placate local concerns, but does not seem to have succeeded in this aim. Racial sensitivities in the Far East are not always the same as Western ones- the casting of three Chinese actresses as Japanese characters in Memoirs of a Geisha gave rise to protests in both China and Japan- and to Thais the casting of a Chinese actor as one of their country's most revered monarchs may have seemed just as insensitive as the casting of a Westerner. Chow's interpretation of the role is rather different from Brynner's- more sensitive and less autocratic and self-assured. One thing which may have offended the Thais is the depiction of the relationship between Anna and the King. With Kerr and Brynner, it was clear that their relationship was based upon friendship and mutual respect, but the question of whether they had actually fallen in love was left discreetly unanswered. With Chow and Jodie Foster it is all too clear that they are in love, if not lovers in the sexual sense, and the historical accuracy of this is (to say the least) doubtful. The emphasis of the story has shifted somewhat since the days of The King and I. That film was made in the mid-fifties, a period when many regions of the globe were still under European colonial rule, something subtly reflected in the script. The Siam ruled by King Yul was a charmingly backward country which needed to be dragged kicking and screaming into the nineteenth century, a task which would have been undertaken by the colonial powers had its own ruler not resolved to do it himself. Here Anna arrives in Siam inwardly convinced of the superiority of Western culture and that her role will be to play a part in the enlightenment of a barbarian nation. As the story progresses, however, she realises that the real situation is far more complex and that the West has as much to learn from the East as vice versa. The teacher is taught. The film is visually attractive and beautifully photographed, and features an excellent performance from Foster, possibly the most accomplished Hollywood actress of the nineties. She also copes well with her character's British accent, something which cannot be said of all American actors called upon to play British characters. (Foster's gift for accents is one of a number of characteristics she shares with Meryl Streep, possibly the most accomplished Hollywood actress of the eighties). The film does, however, suffer at times from a lack of plausibility, particularly in the subplot involving the rebel general, something inserted to turn it into a standard thriller with an identifiable villain. Were Siamese soldiers of this period really so badly trained that they would have mistaken the sound of fireworks for that of gunfire? Anna and the King makes for enjoyable viewing, but it might have worked better with a different denouement. 7\/10 Some goofs. The story takes place during the early 1860s when King Mongkut would have been in his sixties, far older than the character played by Chow Yun-Fat. Reference is made to the King of France, even though at this period France was ruled by Emperor Napoleon III. Admittedly, the distinction might have seemed academic to the Siamese, but no French diplomat would have committed the solecism of referring to his monarch as le Roi rather than l'Empereur. And the royal children sing the song Daisy, Daisy, which was not written until the 1890s, possibly as a satirical comment on Daisy Countess of Warwick, mistress of the Prince of Wales.

When I saw this at first I didn't even know this was even a parody, nor did I really see Star Wars at the time if you can believe that. But as I got older and I became more of a fan of the Star Wars franchise, this film became even better and funnier. And this may sound controversial but this is my favorite parody film in the subgenere and it's one of my favorite films in general. I also feel this film helped set the standard on the parodies for Star Wars as there are constant ones today most notably the TV shows South Park, Robot Chicken, and many more.There is so much I really love about this film, the music is great I really like the theme song which is another one of my favorite theme songs because it has that adventurous and epic quality to it. And I even like the song Spaceballs in the self destruct sequence of the film which is exciting but also a bit funny. The production value is great, for a parody they really go all the way to give us a great vision which helps reinforce the humor and visual humor which I'll get to.However what really makes this parody work is it's story. Like any great parody it's not aware it is one, it plays it straight believing it's being serious when by it's nature it really isn't, if you catch my drift. I love how the film doesn't just parody on Star Wars but also parodies on some of the elements and clichés normally in sci-fi films.The characters are great and memorable. Two of my favorites are Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) whom you can guess is a parody on Darth Vader. He's just hilarious because of how bad he really is at being a power monger despite really trying and has success sometimes (I sad sometimes). It's just the main problem is he's simply an idiot, how he's had command of an empire is anyones guess. It's even funnier when he has two of his cohorts Cournal Sanders and the President (played by Mel Brooks)all three of them together are practically The Three Stooges in space.Barf played by the late great John Candy and this is one of my favorite roles from him. His character is pretty much a parody on Chewbaca as he's literally a humanoid dog. This character is funny because as usual with John Candy he has this laid back mannerism that can make easy switches depending on the situation, but most of all just has this smart Alec\/clever charisma that make him all the more funny.I really love the dialog it is just fraking hilarious, there are so many memorable lines as well as so many groin jokes almost more than the TV show South Park. I really love the use of the word Schartz which in reality means nonsense but make it seem at times their referring to groin. Though one of my favorite verbal jokes is when King Roland (played well by Dick Van Patten) gives out the major combination, it cracked me up because lets say this is combination you could get by mere accident or by not even thinking at all. But my favorite quote is from Dark Helmet which always cracks me up Evil will always triumph, because good is dumb!, I don't entirely agree with it.The sight gags are just fraking hilarious and at their finest. There are just so many of them that it would take more than one watch to get them all. Like when the film at times breaks the forth wall, like the vast amount of merchendise on this film for sale obviously a parody on the Star Wars merchendise subculture.My favorite one is in the Self Destruct sequence which is literally a live action Where's Waldo illustration art, as there are just so much going on but just so many random people from a pizza delivery guy, acrobats, it's just completely crazy. But this is funny because it parody on simply the size of Starships in sci-fi which are practically the size of a mall and it always made me wonder what else was going in in the ship.And it doesn't just homage Star Wars but other films as well like Alien, Planet of the Apes, Transformers and others, this was for it's time a really broad move, to show that you can stretch out the use of homage by blending it in to the story which makes it all the more funny because were the only ones that really notice these things. You can also say that this makes the film more than just a parody but a love letter to the sci-fi genre by doing this, and I think that's a nice touch because it a form of respect for it.So if your a Star Wars fan (longtime or new) or have seen Star Wars or are just looking for a good\/great parody comedy then this is the film to see, the force...I mean the Schartz is strong with this one.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"30 May 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the beautiful things about the Star Wars franchise is how much it has touched on so many areas, they've gained a life of their own, mainly the parodies and jokes on the franchise which just like the films themselves never get old, and the same with this film which is timeless to me.This film is another childhood relic of mine, it was also the first parody film I've ever saw.

He's just hilarious because of how bad he really is at being a power monger despite really trying and has success sometimes (I sad sometimes). It's just the main problem is he's simply an idiot, how he's had command of an empire is anyones guess. It's even funnier when he has two of his cohorts Cournal Sanders and the President (played by Mel Brooks)all three of them together are practically The Three Stooges in space.Barf played by the late great John Candy and this is one of my favorite roles from him. His character is pretty much a parody on Chewbaca as he's literally a humanoid dog. This character is funny because as usual with John Candy he has this laid back mannerism that can make easy switches depending on the situation, but most of all just has this smart Alec\/clever charisma that make him all the more funny.I really love the dialog it is just fraking hilarious, there are so many memorable lines as well as so many groin jokes almost more than the TV show South Park. I really love the use of the word Schartz which in reality means nonsense but make it seem at times their referring to groin. Though one of my favorite verbal jokes is when King Roland (played well by Dick Van Patten) gives out the major combination, it cracked me up because lets say this is combination you could get by mere accident or by not even thinking at all. But my favorite quote is from Dark Helmet which always cracks me up Evil will always triumph, because good is dumb!, I don't entirely agree with it.The sight gags are just fraking hilarious and at their finest. There are just so many of them that it would take more than one watch to get them all. Like when the film at times breaks the forth wall, like the vast amount of merchendise on this film for sale obviously a parody on the Star Wars merchendise subculture.My favorite one is in the Self Destruct sequence which is literally a live action Where's Waldo illustration art, as there are just so much going on but just so many random people from a pizza delivery guy, acrobats, it's just completely crazy. But this is funny because it parody on simply the size of Starships in sci-fi which are practically the size of a mall and it always made me wonder what else was going in in the ship.And it doesn't just homage Star Wars but other films as well like Alien, Planet of the Apes, Transformers and others, this was for it's time a really broad move, to show that you can stretch out the use of homage by blending it in to the story which makes it all the more funny because were the only ones that really notice these things. You can also say that this makes the film more than just a parody but a love letter to the sci-fi genre by doing this, and I think that's a nice touch because it a form of respect for it.So if your a Star Wars fan (longtime or new) or have seen Star Wars or are just looking for a good\/great parody comedy then this is the film to see, the force...I mean the Schartz is strong with this one.Rating 4 stars ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 May 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" U.S Marshals is one of those unique films of the nineties, because it is so rememberable and entertaining to watch.

The plot is basic but decent in its twists and turns. The only flaw that I can find within the film is the character Robert Downey Jr. plays. He does act very well, I just hated the character he played. His development is there, but it just doesn't fit into a common personality for his character. The need to get what he wants, even if it costs friends their lives is really undefined, and not well explained in the film.

The Sheik (1921), while historically significant and full of kitschy fun, is not what anyone would call a good movie with its direction-less writing, pedestrian direction, and lack of chemistry between the romantic leads.In contrast, TSOTS has a competent director in George Fitzmaurice, great chemistry between leads Rudolph Valentino and Vilma Banky, and the writing is much better, featuring characters with strong motivations and personalities. Heck, even Agnes Ayres and Valentino as the now middle-aged couple of the original film muster more chemistry for their ten minutes together in this film than they did in the entirety of the original! TSOTS comes off as the better film also because it knows what it is pure escapist fare. The actors all play their parts with an awareness that they're in hokum. That's not to say they camp it up Valentino actually underplays in many scenes, taking an approach opposed to his bug-eyed antics in the original. Vilma Banky makes for a beautiful and strong-willed heroine, much more appealing than Agnes Ayres' tepid (and slightly snobby) English captive.Of course, that is not to say that the film is not problematic. It is a misrepresentation of Arab culture, and the villain is a lecherous and violent Moor played by the white Montagu Love. Even worse is one certain scene, perhaps the most infamous in all Valentino's filmography, in which he, believing his lady love has lured him into being captured by a group of bandits, kidnaps and rapes her in revenge. Of course, he finds out the truth, rescues her from potential rape at the hands of Montagu Love, and begs her forgiveness (which she readily gives him), but it's still off-putting and the only aspect of the film which is inferior to the first, where a similar scene ends in the leading man feeling disgusted toward himself for even considering such an act. Many write this scene off as being more of a sadomasochistic rape fantasy than anything else, but I doubt most modern viewers will be comforted by that notion.I still thoroughly enjoy this film for its self-aware comedy and the healthier examples of sexual\/romantic chemistry between Valentino and Banky while recognizing its ickier aspects, but your mileage may vary.

Crime films are fascinating and great to watch - so if you're into crime, I recommend this film, Goodfellas. The directing is simply unmatchable and somewhat genius from Martin Scorsese. It's prestigious. The performances are done incredibly well by the actors; but in all honesty, as hard as it is to say, Pesci sticks out the most. Humorous at times dialogue, genuinely wonderful and serious dialogue, beautifully-scripted, top-notch performances and masterful directing - Goodfellas is a must see. It's one of the highest rated films on many major film sites, such as- Metacritic, Rotten tomatoes, and even this. As great as many other crimes films are, like the Godfather and Scarface, Goodfellas, in many ways, surpasses those films. But you could very well say that The Godfather I and II were the crime films of the 70s, Scarface was the crime film of the 80s and this is the crime film of the 90s. Also, Goodfellas doesn't fail when it comes to dramatic scenes, with chills and unexpected happenings - it's got it all. Robert De Niro's performance is well done too, and he was definitely the right choice of cast for the film, alongside the wonderful Liotta, and of course Pesci. Goodfellas is by far one of the greatest crime films ever made, and the critical acclaim and praise it's achieved since its 1990 release has been wonderful in every way possible. The fans love it, the critics love it, everyone loves it, more or less. Just make sure you see it soon - because it's truly marvellous.

We're back in Camp Crystal Lake, where a new gang of teenagers have had the less than sensible idea to try and become camp counsellors. Most of the films in the series follow a basic formula, and there are about ten more of these, each with their own idiosyncrasies that define them, for better or worse.Friday the 13th, Part 2 stands out for a number of reasons. For one thing, it's the first sequel, and the first to directly feature the killer who would go on to define the franchise Jason Voorhees. Notably, he hasn't even acquired his signature hockey mask yet, and instead obscures his face with a sack. Unfortunately, it looks a little stupid and impractical, and it's nowhere near as iconic as the hockey mask or even the white mask of Michael Myers in the competing Halloween franchise. But otherwise clad in a plaid shirt and dungarees, this Jason comes across more as a shady backwoods killer than the relentless undead monster of later sequels.The story is set up quickly and simply. After a direct flashback to the ending of the previous movie, we get a tense, jump-filled introduction which ties up the one loose end from the first film, the lone survivor Alice. Back at Crystal Lake, new counsellors are attending pre-camp training, led by Paul (John Furey) and his girlfriend Ginny (Amy Steel), who are the main protagonists. The other counsellors are merely fodder for Jason.This fact is obscured at first, as Paul takes most of the counsellors out for a last night on the town before camp begins. As a result, we see little of Paul and Ginny until later in the movie. Unsurprisingly, those who choose to say behind at the camp are sitting ducks, and for the next act, there is no clear protagonist.The director, Steve Miner, retains the atmosphere of his predecessor, but with slightly tighter pacing. He would direct the third instalment in the franchise; as a result, the first trilogy has some of the strongest continuity in the series. Thematically, this film is linked with the original in ways that the other films aren't.I liked the way that the story of Jason and his mother was told around the campfire early in the film. This tale encourages the characters to head into the woods to find evidence of Jason or the original Camp Crystal Lake, and it does not end well once Jason realises they have trespassed on his hallowed ground. This Jason is still haunted by the ghost of the late Mrs. Voorhees and we also see where he lives in a ramshackle cabin in the woods behind the lake, and this is where the final chase and fight end up.Ginny is revealed to be studying child psychology and discusses the effect Jason's upbringing and the death of his mother may have had on his behaviour. Cleverly, Ginny eventually uses her knowledge to manipulate Jason in the finale and buy time.Another recurring theme is that characters mention what they're going to do with the rest of their lives (using those words) which is deeply ironic, considering the fate that will likely befall them. One character declares she needs a couple of months to sort her life out, one idly muses about what he'll do for the rest of his life, another promises that she will never be 'late' again, and a disabled character declares he doesn't intend to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.Save a hockey mask, there's here everything that a Friday the 13th film suggests, including some good action (at one point, Ginny attempts to fend Jason off with a chainsaw), inventive and gory death scenes and plenty of neglectful sexcapades which lead to the arrival of Jason.

For one thing, it's the first sequel, and the first to directly feature the killer who would go on to define the franchise Jason Voorhees. Notably, he hasn't even acquired his signature hockey mask yet, and instead obscures his face with a sack. Unfortunately, it looks a little stupid and impractical, and it's nowhere near as iconic as the hockey mask or even the white mask of Michael Myers in the competing Halloween franchise. But otherwise clad in a plaid shirt and dungarees, this Jason comes across more as a shady backwoods killer than the relentless undead monster of later sequels.The story is set up quickly and simply. After a direct flashback to the ending of the previous movie, we get a tense, jump-filled introduction which ties up the one loose end from the first film, the lone survivor Alice. Back at Crystal Lake, new counsellors are attending pre-camp training, led by Paul (John Furey) and his girlfriend Ginny (Amy Steel), who are the main protagonists. The other counsellors are merely fodder for Jason.This fact is obscured at first, as Paul takes most of the counsellors out for a last night on the town before camp begins. As a result, we see little of Paul and Ginny until later in the movie. Unsurprisingly, those who choose to say behind at the camp are sitting ducks, and for the next act, there is no clear protagonist.The director, Steve Miner, retains the atmosphere of his predecessor, but with slightly tighter pacing. He would direct the third instalment in the franchise; as a result, the first trilogy has some of the strongest continuity in the series. Thematically, this film is linked with the original in ways that the other films aren't.I liked the way that the story of Jason and his mother was told around the campfire early in the film. This tale encourages the characters to head into the woods to find evidence of Jason or the original Camp Crystal Lake, and it does not end well once Jason realises they have trespassed on his hallowed ground. This Jason is still haunted by the ghost of the late Mrs. Voorhees and we also see where he lives in a ramshackle cabin in the woods behind the lake, and this is where the final chase and fight end up.Ginny is revealed to be studying child psychology and discusses the effect Jason's upbringing and the death of his mother may have had on his behaviour. Cleverly, Ginny eventually uses her knowledge to manipulate Jason in the finale and buy time.Another recurring theme is that characters mention what they're going to do with the rest of their lives (using those words) which is deeply ironic, considering the fate that will likely befall them. One character declares she needs a couple of months to sort her life out, one idly muses about what he'll do for the rest of his life, another promises that she will never be 'late' again, and a disabled character declares he doesn't intend to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.Save a hockey mask, there's here everything that a Friday the 13th film suggests, including some good action (at one point, Ginny attempts to fend Jason off with a chainsaw), inventive and gory death scenes and plenty of neglectful sexcapades which lead to the arrival of Jason. So it does the job.

I personally found this one to be more entertaining in a way, but not as scary or as creepy as the first one. It is however more freakish. This sequel actually does a really good job of connecting with the first Hellraiser movie and takes place just about right afterwards. I guess one of the reason why this one is most fan favorite is because of how it balances out the environments. Which takes place place in a asylum and some sort of dimensional hell. One of the factors that made this movie not as scary is how it shows the human side of Pinhead and his origin even if it's very slightly shown. The mystery behind Pinhead and his crew is what made him scary, like he is some sort of intelligent ancient being. This one seems to show Pinhead to be on the weaker side. Sure, sometimes villains should have some weaknesses. But the human side just takes away from a villain such as him. I don't know, but I just thought Pinhead would have been more effective horror icon if he was some sort of intelligent ancient being that has a certain code or rule that he abides by and thus can be reasoned with. This one does have more nightmarish elements though and seemed like a subliminal journey into the dark side of humanity and hell. This sequel really does indulges more into the creepy designs by Clive Barker. This is a entertaining flick that delves more into the Hellraiser universe and indulges more on Clive Barker's design and visuals.

Hospitals can be creepy with little creative effort, naturally playing on our fears of injury and mortality, and providing Michael with more inventive weapons such as syringes and intravenous drips.Here, Haddonfield Memorial Hospital is almost deserted, evoking post- apocalyptic abandonment.
