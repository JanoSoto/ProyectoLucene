[{"date":"3 December 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore was a delightful surprise to me, I'd never heard about it. It's a great comedy starring Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray. Max Fisher (Schwartzman) is a student who falls in love with Miss Rosemary Cross, a teacher at the university. This love is not only impossible because of the age difference, but also because Rosemary is widowed from her late husband of which she hasn't fully recovered from. But Max is a clever boy and tries to win her love with the help of the university's principle Herman Blume (Bill Murray). They're good friends and both have the same kind of humor. But when Herman meets Rosemary he falls in love with her too. Now the friends become rivals. This creates some very funny moments between the two of them. This movie is brilliant for it entire credits. The writing and directing is outstanding and the performances of the actors are nothing less. Schwartzman is so dedicated to his acting that you don't see him as an actor but as Max Fisher, the intelligent and devoted  student. Bill Murray again proves he's the king of comedy. His 'dry' humor, as we call it in Holland, is perfectly in line with the sarcastic humor of Schwartzman. It's the same sort of comedy as 'Wonder Boys'. It truly is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. A must see  ","genre":null},{"date":"3 December 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore was a delightful surprise to me, I'd never heard about it.
