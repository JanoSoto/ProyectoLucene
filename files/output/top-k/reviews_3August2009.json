[{"date":"3 August 2009","score":"","review":" Our drug laws behave as a price support routine for the criminal drug enterprise. They do not stop drugs. Regardless of billions of dollars spent and a high rate of fatalities, addictions, atrocity, demoralization and lives splurged in prison, it is easy today, as well as almost a decade ago when this film was made, for anyone who wants drugs to get them. For someone my age, says a Cincinnati honors student in the film, it's a lot easier to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.Who shoulders the drug law enforcement effort? Plenty of conscientious and sincere people. Also politicians who may know drug laws are exhausted, but don't have the audacity to be seen as gentle on the issue. And untrustworthy police and other officials, who find drugs a fruitful begetter of buy-offs, percentages and blackmail. And the drug cartels themselves, since the laws make their business so rewarding. If the elimination criminal penalties for and removal of legal restrictions against drugs were ever actively contemplated in this country, the opposition would accommodate not only dignified public servants, but also the kingpins of the illegal drug industry.These are the resolutions I gather from Traffic, which follows the drug traffic in North America from the bottom to the top of the sequence of inventory. They may not be your resolutions. Soderbergh himself does not endorse legalizing drugs, but affirms substance abuse is a public health problem, not a crime. Of course drugs generate crime, as addicts steal since they must, and a more realistic approach would culminate in a lower crime rate and a less dangerous culture.In one regard, Traffic is fundamentally about borders and what it means for an individual to cross those that are bureaucratic and territorial, mental and temperamental, physical and conceptualized. For Soderbergh, also, there were other borders to cross, those amidst independent film-making and Hollywood, amidst organizing a self-controlled conception and finding a larger audience to appreciate it. It helps that the cast is enormous and top-drawer, even down to cameos, some billed and some not, by Salma Hayek, Albert Finney and Benjamin Bratt. Their minor but particularly enthusing presence carries tremendous weight. The leads are likewise persuasive, such as Douglas, convincing as Conservative Ohio judge Robert Wakefield loses touch with the less quantifiable things in life such as how much he loves his family.With graceful restraint, Soderbergh introduces the characters in irreducible scenes that simultaneously let us know who they are when the story begins and who they soon will be. In an extensive mansion in the affluent Cincinnati municipality of Indian Hill, Wakefield's 16- year-old daughter, Erika Christensen, an honors student wearing a private school uniform, is introduced to freebasing by her boyfriend, a very socially aware smooth-talker played by Topher Grace, her noblesse oblige ethics dissolving. In San Diego, after a lunch of idle chitchat and foie gras at the local country club with a sprinkling of the neighborhood nobility, the pregnant Catherine Zeta-Jones, with ethereal charm and, for now, genteel diplomacy, spies another possible future after her husband Stephen Bauer is arrested and the family's assets are frozen. In a flash, besides the indirect self-assertion of Dennis Quaid, she is caught between her husband's affiliates, who are urging money she doesn't have to give, and the DEA, which urges collaboration she doesn't want to surrender, while Bauer remains eerily resilient behind bars.Granted Traffic unravels continuously, the altogether amount of characters requires that the film have a intricate framework. In order to function as a compelling film altogether, even characters who never meet work in opposition. To that end, scenes don't just cut together, they appear to propel and fall against one another intrinsically, rhythmically, coincidentally.Traffic develops swiftly, then swifter still as the story shuffles promptly from Tijuana to Washington, D.C., to Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle electronically monitoring Zeta-Jones outside her San Diego estate, then back again to Mexico. Soderbergh tends to discard as much exposition as he knows the stories can endure. Each new scene has to pull its own weight, dispense its own briefing for the greater entity. In Traffic, this prominence on plot efficiency was encouraged by an inspired resolution to give the three main stories different colors. Using a compass of techniques, shooting without color-correcting filters, for example, Soderbergh conceived a sweltering, faded ocher for Benicio Del Toro's Mexico, his performance captivating in his understatement, alternating from sociability to shyness, the film's softly kindling ethical axis, and a graphically contrasting icy blue for Douglas' surroundings from Washington to Cincinnati. In comparison, the San Diego scenes of cat- and-mouse between the DEA and Zeta-Jones seem to bloom with ripe, virile shades that highlight the story's day-to-day nonrational automatism and unexpected juxtapositions. It's an audacious artistic design with a pragmatic profit The colors inform the action, where you are and with whom, right away.This political crime drama, the cream of Soderbergh's diverse crop, is compelling expressly as it doesn't moralize with a unitary ideology. It is so subdued that at one moment, Michael Douglas's final speech, one wants one more declaration, reaching the bottom line, but, we having been shown the vast uncertainty of the drug wars, the movie lets us accommodate that thought for ourselves.

British director Simon West's Con-Air (*** out of ****), teaming Nicolas Cage with John Cusack, sizzles as a high flying take-off on all those vintage Airport movies, but the passengers here are convicts who skyjack their transport for a rendezvous in the desert with Colombian drug smugglers. At the heart of this superficial but stimulating action movie lies a less than subtle Hollywood commentary on what a macho man must do to conform to society.In Con-Air, Cage plays Cameron Poe, a former U.S. Army Ranger who pulls a stretch in prison for killing a knife-wielding drunkard in a brawl over his wife. Before Poe can recover, the villain's pals scoop up the knife, scram, and leave our hero to take the rap. Because Poe's Ranger training qualifies him as a lethal weapon, the court sentences him to eight years in a federal lock-up. While he is incarnated, Poe's pretty young wife Tricia (Monica Potter) has given birth to an adorable baby girl. In the second quarter-hour of Con-Air, Poe and his cut little daughter exchange amusing letters. During this interval, Poe matures enough so that his exemplary behavior wins him a parole.A short plane ride is the last obstacle between Poe and his freedom. Prison officials pile him onto a cargo plane with an all-star line-up of psychopathic murderers, among them Cyrus 'the Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich of Dangerous Liaisons) and Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames of Pulp Fiction), a vicious black militant. A clean-cut, sandal-shod U.S. Marshal named Vince Larkin (John Cusack of Grosse Point Blank) officiates the transfer. The plot thickens when abrasive D.E.A. agent Duncan Molloy (Colm Meaney of TV's Star Trek The Next Generation) wins permission to smuggle a trigger-happy undercover agent on board to cajole information out of a Colombian drug lord's son. Once they're airborne, the convicts stage an ingenious jail break; ice the D.E.A. agent, and commander the plane. Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin of Total Recall), then acts as an insider for Larkin. Meanwhile, Larkin clashes with Molloy who aims to avenge his dead agent by blowing the plane to smithereens! Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead scenarist Scott Rosenberg has contrived this hard-fisted hokum that excites and entertains even though it is hopeless predictable from fade-in to fade-out. Con-Air spends most of its two-hour running time in the air instead of behind bars. The early prison scenes establish Poe's friendship with a diabetic black prisoner named Mike Baby-O' O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson of Waiting to Exhale). The filmmakers have carefully balanced good African-Americans with bad African-Americans so as to avoid charges of racism. Rosenberg has penned some catchy dialogue that serves the dual purpose of foreshadowing the action and sounding quite quotable. Nothing happens in Con-Air that is not set up far in advance, so the movie never pulls any unfair tricks on its audience. Moreover, the characters spout dialogue about their predicaments that never leave any doubt for the audience about the destination of the action.Freshman director Simon West and Rosenberg endow Poe with such heroic qualities that it is difficult to believe that any court could have sent a man of his caliber up the river. After all, he is a Gulf War veteran who has just come home to his gorgeous young wife pregnant with a baby girl. Furthermore, the filmmakers hammer home Poe's Ranger's credo no matter what the dangers, U.S. Rangers never abandon their comrades. When Poe has a chance to leave the plane, he sticks around instead to save the day. What Con-Air lacks in credibility, it compensates for with its diversity of colorful characters and its pyrotechnics.Wearing scruffy shoulder length hair and flexing sculpted biceps, Nicolas Cage resembles Sylvester Stallone's Rambo as he thwarts his opponents. Cage's syrupy Alabama accent gets a little thick on occasion, but he registers as a respectable enough hero. John Cusack excels in his first dramatic action role. Before Con-Air crashes to a halt, Cusack's U.S. Marshal Larkin has been scorched, slugged unconscious, and nearly killed. As a sneering, egotistical D.E.A. agent, Colm Meaney is so convincing that you want to shoot him yourself.The filmmakers have assembled some really grisly looking actors as the convicts. These bad guys emerge as a truly venomous bunch that richly deserve their inevitable comeuppance. John Malkovich impersonates a character here who is just as despicable and cunning as the assassin that he played in the Clint Eastwood thriller In the Line of Fire. Malkovich's predatory, bald villain boasts that he has slain more men than cancer. As his henchman, Ving Rhames is equally as nefarious. Danny Trejo of Desperado fame creates a chilling portrait of lust run amok as a rapist named Johnny 23 with twenty-three hearts tattooed on his beefy forearm to represent his unfortunate rape victims.West keeps the action stirred up to such a whirlwind pace that its far-fetched elements don't detract from the excitement. Con-Air is West's big-screen movie debut and he displays a lot of promise as an action director. His action scenes ripple with adrenaline, especially the plane hijacking, an ambush in a derelict airplane scrap heap, and a rousing finale in Las Vegas. The explosive music of Mark Mancina and former Yes musician Trevor Rabin considerably enhances each of these slam-bang scenes. Yes rock music fans will recognize those distinctive, throbbing Rabin chords that punctuate the action.Nobody should imitate Con-Air or take its woefully exaggerated carnival of snap, crackle, pop violence seriously. Characters get shot, stabled, and dismembered beyond anything an ordinary individual cold take, but then this clever, slickly-packaged fantasy pokes as much fun at itself as at its audiences.

A clean-cut, sandal-shod U.S. Marshal named Vince Larkin (John Cusack of Grosse Point Blank) officiates the transfer. The plot thickens when abrasive D.E.A. agent Duncan Molloy (Colm Meaney of TV's Star Trek The Next Generation) wins permission to smuggle a trigger-happy undercover agent on board to cajole information out of a Colombian drug lord's son. Once they're airborne, the convicts stage an ingenious jail break; ice the D.E.A. agent, and commander the plane. Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin of Total Recall), then acts as an insider for Larkin. Meanwhile, Larkin clashes with Molloy who aims to avenge his dead agent by blowing the plane to smithereens! Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead scenarist Scott Rosenberg has contrived this hard-fisted hokum that excites and entertains even though it is hopeless predictable from fade-in to fade-out. Con-Air spends most of its two-hour running time in the air instead of behind bars. The early prison scenes establish Poe's friendship with a diabetic black prisoner named Mike Baby-O' O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson of Waiting to Exhale). The filmmakers have carefully balanced good African-Americans with bad African-Americans so as to avoid charges of racism. Rosenberg has penned some catchy dialogue that serves the dual purpose of foreshadowing the action and sounding quite quotable. Nothing happens in Con-Air that is not set up far in advance, so the movie never pulls any unfair tricks on its audience. Moreover, the characters spout dialogue about their predicaments that never leave any doubt for the audience about the destination of the action.Freshman director Simon West and Rosenberg endow Poe with such heroic qualities that it is difficult to believe that any court could have sent a man of his caliber up the river. After all, he is a Gulf War veteran who has just come home to his gorgeous young wife pregnant with a baby girl. Furthermore, the filmmakers hammer home Poe's Ranger's credo no matter what the dangers, U.S. Rangers never abandon their comrades. When Poe has a chance to leave the plane, he sticks around instead to save the day. What Con-Air lacks in credibility, it compensates for with its diversity of colorful characters and its pyrotechnics.Wearing scruffy shoulder length hair and flexing sculpted biceps, Nicolas Cage resembles Sylvester Stallone's Rambo as he thwarts his opponents. Cage's syrupy Alabama accent gets a little thick on occasion, but he registers as a respectable enough hero. John Cusack excels in his first dramatic action role. Before Con-Air crashes to a halt, Cusack's U.S. Marshal Larkin has been scorched, slugged unconscious, and nearly killed. As a sneering, egotistical D.E.A. agent, Colm Meaney is so convincing that you want to shoot him yourself.The filmmakers have assembled some really grisly looking actors as the convicts. These bad guys emerge as a truly venomous bunch that richly deserve their inevitable comeuppance. John Malkovich impersonates a character here who is just as despicable and cunning as the assassin that he played in the Clint Eastwood thriller In the Line of Fire. Malkovich's predatory, bald villain boasts that he has slain more men than cancer. As his henchman, Ving Rhames is equally as nefarious. Danny Trejo of Desperado fame creates a chilling portrait of lust run amok as a rapist named Johnny 23 with twenty-three hearts tattooed on his beefy forearm to represent his unfortunate rape victims.West keeps the action stirred up to such a whirlwind pace that its far-fetched elements don't detract from the excitement. Con-Air is West's big-screen movie debut and he displays a lot of promise as an action director. His action scenes ripple with adrenaline, especially the plane hijacking, an ambush in a derelict airplane scrap heap, and a rousing finale in Las Vegas. The explosive music of Mark Mancina and former Yes musician Trevor Rabin considerably enhances each of these slam-bang scenes. Yes rock music fans will recognize those distinctive, throbbing Rabin chords that punctuate the action.Nobody should imitate Con-Air or take its woefully exaggerated carnival of snap, crackle, pop violence seriously. Characters get shot, stabled, and dismembered beyond anything an ordinary individual cold take, but then this clever, slickly-packaged fantasy pokes as much fun at itself as at its audiences. One amusing scene involves the destruction of a classic sports car. Another features Cage battling with another convict because he refuses to head Poe's warning to leave the bunny alone.'

They two are brought together by rather special circumstances, moving in to the same apartment house where they spend most of their time alone, waiting and dreaming about love. Without knowing exactly how it all started, but at the same time sensing that something is out of balance, they finds out that their spouses are having an affair with each other. While this is going on Mrs. Cheng and Mr. Chow tries to understand the situation and spend more and more time with each other. The movie has many long takes and slow motion pictures. Every scene of the movie is very stylized. In one scene the picture is covered with flowers; the lamp, the glass, the dress, the curtains, the earrings and even the outside on which Mrs. Chan is staring out in! This is a very beautiful scene, hard to miss and very hard to forget. The movements are often very precise accompanied with music and with slow motion scenes. Looking at this movie, one is stuck immediately with the contrasts of yarning and loving, the ambiguity, and the complexity of love itself. One may have expected that the two that meet would develop a very revengeful affair with each other knowing that their respective spouses are having an affair with each other. So is not the case. Instead, they develop an honest and very true friendship that has nothing to do with giving back, neither one obliges a role of victims. What's also is interesting is that their spouses faces are not shown one single time in the movie, something that enhances the fact that their relationship is not based on being a fatal accident. There is a lot of attention paid to small details in this movie, for example are there subtitles that pass in front of our eyes. These have no largely significance for the movies narration; rather they fulfill a premise in the movie that also is stated in a key scene saying If you pay attention &#x96; you really see things. The soundtrack is wonderful and excellent assembles to the story. If you get the chance to experience passion in life- take it and do not feel sorry about it. It is a rare thing and more often, it slips you by chance.
