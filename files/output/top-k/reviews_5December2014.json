This sequel P*************ed me off! I love the original and consider it to be one of the scariest horror movies of all time. They took a giant dump all over Candyman's legacy just to make more money. There is some OK suspense at times, but I didn't give a damn about any of it. New direction was needed and once again, they didn't have the balls to go in a creative direction. There were two things they could have done with this sequel. They could have done a complete prequel, showing Candyman's origins. We get snippets of it in this movie and the first, but a full prequel could have been really interesting. They show Candyman's death as a human in flashbacks and it had no effect on me. It was emotionless and boring. To be even more audacious, Helen could have taken over Candyman's role and supplanted Tony Todd, leaving Candyman as a side character. The first movie was in a similar place as Halloween IV. They took the safe route in Halloween V, and they did the same with this movie. I wanted to see Virginia Madsen return and unleash hell. Her and Candyman could even reluctantly team up! They obviously saw dollar signs and gave us this predictable BS. The New Orleans setting had major potential and it's not fulfilled. Even the deaths are boring. If you like very bloody stabbings with a hook, this movie's for you. I get so tired of the incompetent cops storyline and it's become one of the most annoying horror clichés. The evidence is clearly there that something unusual is happening!!! The acting is OK. Tony Todd is fine, but he's on-screen way too much. He was so effective in the first, because his screen time is limited. He was a creepy person, but here he's on way too much. He also had way too much dialog. It isn't Tony's fault though. Kelly Rowan gives an inconsistent performance to say the least. Sometimes she's on, others she's off. She wasn't convincing enough for my liking. Bill Nunn looks like he doesn't wanna be there. He phones it in and collects that check. There is a clever tease in the ending, but the ending was horrible for the most part. When Tony Todd says he dislikes the sequels, you know there is something wrong. This is a boring sequel that should have never been made. I have yet to see Candyman III, but I'm dreading it.

The menace goes on to tell the guy that he would kill the other guy's wife, in exchange of the other guy killing his father. And the story goes on, based on that idea.Guy's wife was being accompanied by two men in an amusement park, they then lose her in a dark place for - at most - two minutes, in which Bruno kills her by strangling her. Thing is, the two guys have noticed Bruno following them a few times, yet, after knowing she was murdered they had given no statements of Bruno whatsoever? This point was not even reviewed in this so called mystery genre movie, these two guy's statements literally never existed in the movie, just completely ignored by the plot writer. And this is what I hate about this movie OH DID YOU THINK THIS WOULD WORK? HAHA NO BECAUSE IM GOING TO NOT MAKE IT WORK., I think that 's exactly what was in the mind of the plot writer as he went through with it, he kept making so much points and then invalidating them, that the movie was a practical bore and annoying, how can you enjoy a movie when every important point becomes suddenly disdained because of a coincidencial event? Too much coincidences occur that at one point of the movie I thought I f**king hate this movie and I went for a smoke, here is a list off the top of my head of points that were made, then disdained because the writer simply wanted to1. The murder Two guys were watching Bruno follow Guy's wife in the park, yet somehow did not give their statements (this was previously explained hence I won't go into details.)2. The alibi Guy's alibi was that he was speaking to a professor at a train during the time of the murder. He was able to recall the name of the professor and the professor was actually called to the station, yet somehow had forgotten the man that he had JUST MET yesterday. Also, the fuss over him not having a proper alibi was because He might have seen the man and then caught a later train, hence having enough time to murder his wife.. Question is, how did he know the man's name through his face? Does the tennis player know a list of professors who live in different cities\/towns?3. The lighter Goodness gracious! Really? This? First let me explain why this was so important Bruno says, he would take the lighter to the police station and say that this lighter he was asked by Guy to pick up from the murder scene so that his name would be clear, which would work because Guy has been seen talking to Bruno after the murder. However, a simple This guy is a menace, he said he would kill my wife in exchange of me killing his father. He read about me in magazines and actually killed my wife and is now pushing me to kill his father. I did give him the lighter in the train. I can even prove that he's the killer, I'm sure someone must've seen him in the amusement park.. I mean, anyone with one digit IQ would have been able to say that, right? Now the heart-breaker, the whole movie revolves around this. I had to watch around 100 minutes with this point being the main point in the plot, it is incredibly annoying and sad to watch such a weak motive become the main point.4. The mother of all clichés, the tennis match and the lighter falling in the sewers Guy's plan was to finish the tennis match by winning 3 sets in a row, to get to the park just in time to meet Bruno there and confront him, then take his lighter from him. Seriously, this was the mastermind, Guy's, plan to overtake Bruno. Guy loses his third set and starts losing time, BUT WAIT, Bruno somehow drops the lighter into the sewers and attempts to grab hold of it (sub-cliche 1). Guy keeps losing and time keeps passing, BUT WAIT, Bruno pushes the lighter deeper unintentionally (sub-cliche 2). Guy then wins the match, and Bruno retrieves the lighter.5. The final fight in the amusement park Many many things are wrong here. Police shooting in a carousel with children in it, and killing an innocent man? Bruno trying to kill Guy, yet after when the fight is over, they do not even try to guess why, they literally don't even ask Why were you fighting him? or Who is he?. Or when the lighter drops from Bruno's hand and then suddenly everyone believes Guy; their opinion changes so fast I could swear the only reason why that happened was because they didn't have enough tape to shoot.And another very important thing that I hate most How on earth does someone who wishes murder for someone else get the happy ending, like Guy was for his wife's murder? And if anyone would think he wasn't happy for her death I'd ask you this What was Guy's reaction to know his wife was killed?It's a waste of time, people. Unless if you're willing to know how a plot shouldn't be made.

First let me explain why this was so important Bruno says, he would take the lighter to the police station and say that this lighter he was asked by Guy to pick up from the murder scene so that his name would be clear, which would work because Guy has been seen talking to Bruno after the murder. However, a simple This guy is a menace, he said he would kill my wife in exchange of me killing his father. He read about me in magazines and actually killed my wife and is now pushing me to kill his father. I did give him the lighter in the train. I can even prove that he's the killer, I'm sure someone must've seen him in the amusement park.. I mean, anyone with one digit IQ would have been able to say that, right?

I had to watch around 100 minutes with this point being the main point in the plot, it is incredibly annoying and sad to watch such a weak motive become the main point.4. The mother of all clichés, the tennis match and the lighter falling in the sewers Guy's plan was to finish the tennis match by winning 3 sets in a row, to get to the park just in time to meet Bruno there and confront him, then take his lighter from him. Seriously, this was the mastermind, Guy's, plan to overtake Bruno. Guy loses his third set and starts losing time, BUT WAIT, Bruno somehow drops the lighter into the sewers and attempts to grab hold of it (sub-cliche 1). Guy keeps losing and time keeps passing, BUT WAIT, Bruno pushes the lighter deeper unintentionally (sub-cliche 2). Guy then wins the match, and Bruno retrieves the lighter.5. The final fight in the amusement park Many many things are wrong here. Police shooting in a carousel with children in it, and killing an innocent man? Bruno trying to kill Guy, yet after when the fight is over, they do not even try to guess why, they literally don't even ask Why were you fighting him? or Who is he?. Or when the lighter drops from Bruno's hand and then suddenly everyone believes Guy; their opinion changes so fast I could swear the only reason why that happened was because they didn't have enough tape to shoot.And another very important thing that I hate most How on earth does someone who wishes murder for someone else get the happy ending, like Guy was for his wife's murder? And if anyone would think he wasn't happy for her death I'd ask you this What was Guy's reaction to know his wife was killed?It's a waste of time, people.

The menace goes on to tell the guy that he would kill the other guy's wife, in exchange of the other guy killing his father. And the story goes on, based on that idea.Guy's wife was being accompanied by two men in an amusement park, they then lose her in a dark place for - at most - two minutes, in which Bruno kills her by strangling her. Thing is, the two guys have noticed Bruno following them a few times, yet, after knowing she was murdered they had given no statements of Bruno whatsoever? This point was not even reviewed in this so called mystery genre movie, these two guy's statements literally never existed in the movie, just completely ignored by the plot writer. And this is what I hate about this movie OH DID YOU THINK THIS WOULD WORK? HAHA NO BECAUSE IM GOING TO NOT MAKE IT WORK., I think that 's exactly what was in the mind of the plot writer as he went through with it, he kept making so much points and then invalidating them, that the movie was a practical bore and annoying, how can you enjoy a movie when every important point becomes suddenly disdained because of a coincidencial event? Too much coincidences occur that at one point of the movie I thought I f**king hate this movie and I went for a smoke, here is a list off the top of my head of points that were made, then disdained because the writer simply wanted to1. The murder Two guys were watching Bruno follow Guy's wife in the park, yet somehow did not give their statements (this was previously explained hence I won't go into details.)2. The alibi Guy's alibi was that he was speaking to a professor at a train during the time of the murder. He was able to recall the name of the professor and the professor was actually called to the station, yet somehow had forgotten the man that he had JUST MET yesterday. Also, the fuss over him not having a proper alibi was because He might have seen the man and then caught a later train, hence having enough time to murder his wife.. Question is, how did he know the man's name through his face? Does the tennis player know a list of professors who live in different cities\/towns?3. The lighter Goodness gracious! Really? This?

All of those elements make Cliffhanger not only one of my favorite Action films but also one of the best Action movies of the 1990s that is Slyvester Stallone and Renny Harlin at their best.Cliffhanger tells the story of Gabe Walker(Slyvester Stallone),a mountain climber and rescue ranger who goes up against sadistic criminal Eric Qualen(John Lithgow)who along with his hired guns are looking for three briefcases that's filled with 100 Million Dollars. With his back against the wall Gabe has to find the money before Qualen does stop Qualen and survive at all costs.Cliffhanger is a brilliant and unforgettable Action-Thriller that is easily one of the best Action movies of the 1990s and another Slyvester Stallone classic that is an absolute roller coaster ride from beginning to end that is an Adventure in highest order and when you watch the movie you will have a blast. It's also one of two films released in 1993(the film other being Demolition Man)that were Box Office hits for Sly Stallone and were seen as a comeback for Stallone after some Box Office flops. Right from it's now classic and memorable 13 minute opening scene(which perfectly sets the tone for the entire film)Cliffhanger is an Action movie that just grabs viewers by the throat and never lets go with everything done in an large,epic scale whether it's the Action or Suspense you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. It has everything a great Action movie should havea good story,incredible Action Good Guys Vs Bad Guys everything that makes a good and entertaining popcorn film while putting viewers on the edge of the seats throughout the film. While Cliffhanger is basically Die Hard on a Mountain Cliffhanger is one of the best films to take the Die Hard concept and place it in the Rocky Mountains giving viewers an intense and amazing experience. The Action sequences in Cliffhanger are fantastic,explosive and done with terrific skill and suspense and when the suspense stops the Action comes at you like a punch in the face. With every Action scene everything from the gunfights,explosions and stunts is big,loud and very powerful. The stunt work in Cliffhanger is truly sensational whether it's with the Action scenes or the Mountain climbing scenes giving the movie a realism and accuracy even though some things are exaggerated. While Cliffhanger is still an Action movie it's also a movie that is very beautiful and stunning to look at thanks to the photography by Alex Thomson. Thomson's photography is amazing and make the Rocky Mountains more beautiful than they already were giving the movie a stylish and memorable look that makes Cliffhanger standout from most of the Action movies during the 1990s. The main character Gabe Walker is very much an Action movie character that gets into fights and is heroic but doesn't use a gun instead using the mountain and his smarts to beat the bad guys. While an Action hero Gabe is also a character with depth because we see Gabe trying to climb the mountains again after a unfortunate incident that killed his will to climb a mountain. We see Gabe trying to not only save the day and trying to climb the mountain again but also try to repair his friendships. The ending of Cliffhanger is a fantastic and memorable conclusion because there is enough Action,thrills and excitement that will leave viewers happy and satisfied. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Slyvester Stallone is excellent and at his best as Gabe Walker,with Stallone bringing depth,intensity and charisma to the role. John Lithgow is brilliant and at his bad guy best as Eric Qualen,with Lithgow being delightful and evil. Michael Rooker is wonderful as Hal Tucker,Gabe's best friend. Janine Turner is terrific as Jessie,Gabe's girlfriend. Rex Linn gives an outstanding,hilarious scene stealing performance as Agent Travers,a corrupt Treasury Agent working with Qualen. Paul Winfeld is good as Walter Wright,a Treasury Agent. Ralph Waite does a fine job as Frank,a rescue ranger. Caroline Goodall(Kristal),Leon(Kynette),Craig Fairbass(Delmar),Gregory Scott Cummins(Ryan)and Denis Forest(Heldon)are memorable as Qualen's henchmen. Max Perlich and Trey Brownell are fun as Evan and Brett best friends who are thrill seekers. Michelle Joyner(Sarah)and Vyto Ruginis(FBI Agent Matheson)give good performances as well.The direction by Renny Harlen is outstanding,with Harlen always moving the camera and giving the movie a stunning and memorable look while doing a fantastic job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Harlen.The score by Trevor Jones is amazing,epic and suspenseful and fits perfectly with the tone and atmosphere of the film. Wonderful score,Jones.In final word,if you're a fan of Slyvester Stallone,Renny Harlin or Action films,I highly suggest you see Cliffhanger,an excellent,thrilling and exciting Action-Adventure Thriller that you will watch again and again.

It was made in black and white in the time when there was color film available. I know it was probably done on purpose but while it may help the message it does not help the visuals. The shots are not grabbing, not on their own.Also, the sound effects are not synced well. Quality of the recording is average. The music consists more of effects than of actual melody, which again maybe works for the message but definitely not for the aesthetics.What this movie has going for it are interesting themes, dialogue and good actors to speak it.The film is raw and direct. Has a feel of movies like Conan the Brabarian (1982), but with realism and intelligence replacing the action. It is about life, death, love, sex and cruelty, all set against the medieval time period. The dialogue consists chiefly out of the discussion of those subjects and has a poetic colour to it but not overly so. However, you must be prepared for a theatrical feel to the whole thing. Indeed many actors in this film are heavy theater performers.What is really good about Seventh Seal is that it is one of the, unfortunately, rare occasions when art is not pretentious or arrogant. You do not have to wonder hard about the spooky imagery. It does not try to patronize you with its poetry. It is perhaps cliché to even mention the scene that is most remembered about this film, that of the protagonist playing chess with death, but it is a good example. What is a more straight forward metaphor than that? This whole film is that way - straightforward.The downside of the story is that it does not have a lot happening in it. The storyline is mostly about the characters traveling through the countryside and meeting other people. There isn't one centralized structure to the story. But this does not stop the movie from being interesting.Max von Sydow is the main protagonist. To start with, this guy has an interesting face. He looks like a medieval knight, in fact almost like a caricature of one, with his underbite and long crudely carved face and short haircut. And he is a good actor on top that.Bibi Andersson who plays one of the side characters is possibly the prettiest woman I have seen in a very long time. She is conventionally pretty, but that is OK. And the film puts her in such poses and in such dresses and her blond hair shines in such light&#x85;.in short, I experienced a brief crush on an 80 year old actress.But Gunnar Björnstrand, whose name I had to copy from IMDb for fear of getting an aneurysm trying to type it, is the true protagonist as he gets the most lines and gives them his best. Max von Sydow is more of an observer, while Gunnar is the workhorse.Seventh Seal manages to be funny and grim, smart and blunt. It is totally worth the watch, especially if you are afraid of watching it because you got the impression of it being an overly artsy film. It isn't.

Its first offering Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?Mike Nichols was special. Some say gifted, but I've never liked that word as it applies to accomplishment; it implies, to me anyway, an elitist privilege that further implies a nonpayment of appropriate dues. Mike Nichols was born to a Jewish family in Berlin Germany in 1931. In 1939 his father, a doctor, had the means and the foresight to escape the oncoming holocaust just before it was to begin in earnest. There is a hell of a story in there somewhere, but I have never heard it. My point being that escaping from the Nazi's is enough dues paying for a lifetime.Yeah, he was special, but what astonishes me in reviewing his life work, is how he was apparently able to immediately impress everybody else that he was special. His first directorial assignment was not off &#x96;Broadway, not off-off Broadway, not dinner theater in Poughkeepsie, but on Broadway for established writer Neil Simon. The result was Barefoot in the Park for which Nichols would win a Tony award as best director. The play would become Simon's longest running play ever (around or above four years) and the 10th longest running non musical production in Broadway history! First at bat grand slam home run.Sometime in the 1960's legendary producer Jack Warner (yes that Warner of Warner Bros. Studios or Time-Warner if you prefer) thought the eccentric writings of playwright Edward Albee in his playWho's Afraid of Virginia Wolf might make a good movie. I don't know how he came to that conclusion, but conclude it he did, and he hired multiple Academy Award nominee Ernest Lehman to write the screen play, and then cast Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to play the leads.Just a few words about Liz and Dick; they were the Godmother and Godfather of celebrity pop culture. They weren't just big; they were the biggest&#x85;by far. They would dominate the tabloid press and intrude into the real news for almost twenty years. To compare them to modern celebrity like the Kardasians is not only ludicrous but blasphemous. OK, who should direct this spicy hot mélange? Why not someone who's never directed a movie before? Mike Nichols. Success on Broadway is not a guarantee of success in cinema. Bob Fosse's first foray was Sweet Charity which is a certifiable catastrophe. In stage craft everybody is always in full shot, in cinema you have to know when to push the camera in, when to pull it back, when to open the story up so it looks like a movie and not a photographed play. There is a certain grammar to cinema and it needs to be used correctly. It is essential in order to create and build the emotional tension that is so necessary for this film's success. In his first attempt, does Nichols succeed? Well, here's the stat line 13 Academy Award nominations. It was only the second and last film to ever be nominated in all the categories for which it was eligible. It won five, including one for Ms Taylor, surprisingly not one for Mr. Burton, nor one for Mr. Nichols (although that would be remedied shortly.) And! It was a financial success being one of the top 10 grossing movies of 1966. Nichols first at bat for a different team Grand slam home run.Pocket ReviewIf you didn't know who Virginia Woolf was before you see this movie, you will certainly be afraid of her by the end of it.George (Richard Burton) is a teacher at some unnamed small college and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) is the daughter of the college president. They are a middle aged married couple who are disappointed in how their lives have turned out, especially since their life together seemed to have started out with so much promise and advantage. Their coping mechanism is to blame each other for their failures both individually and as a couple, and this failure is complete, professional, emotional, and sexual. Oh, yeah, they also drink a lot, that's always helpful.In to this toxic alcoholic mix comes a young professor at the college Nick (George Segal) and his mousey wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) who Martha has invited over to their on campus house for a drink. They will serve as audience surrogates as together we will watch as George and Martha's marriage explosively dissolves. As the drama demands, they will also become participants to the wreckage, but more than that, they get to walk through the looking glass and see what bleak future may be in store for them. It is through the interaction of this fabulous four, that we, the audience, discover that George and Martha have constructed a nest of lies in order to keep themselves at least one hash mark above the median of sanity, and it is through these lies that the deeper psychological truth is revealed.What does it mean? Why should we care? Honestly I don't know. I have always had trouble figuring this movie out, but I have watched it several times, always with avid fascination. I wouldn't call it one of the best movies ever, but I would certainly call it one of the most extraordinary. Mike Nichols film directorial debut. It was a doozy. Thanks Mike... I think.

Why at all?In my review of The Master, I wrote This director has a very rare talent. Just like in There Will Be Blood, I started watching this film full of expectations. After about 15 minutes I was irritated, after about 30 minutes I was bored, then at first I did not care anymore. I wrote this review after about 1.5 hours watching the film. Obviously I was irritated again, even angry. The director for me is totally incapable of telling a compelling story. He is totally capable of turning potentially interesting characters into one-dimensional, shallow characters. I can easily say exactly the same about Magnolia. Like in any PTA film, renowned actors act very shallow, very one-dimensional. He makes very respectable actors look like very mediocre soap actors. Magnolia is worse than PTA's others. The most extreme case is Jason Robards, playing a character who is lying on his sickbed, nearly dying. But at the same time he is talking like a normal healthy man with energetic gestures. Completely ridiculous.Then there is his direction. Throughout the film there were poor imitations of other far more superior directors. You could see bit of Kubrick and De Palma. More obvious were the imitations of the great Martin Scorsese. Including the usage of soundtrack. But where Scorsese is the master of controlled use of music, PTA's music was mostly irritating. Right from the start even extremely irritating using a very boring song for minutes that felt like forever in the opening scenes. The use of soundtrack is also one of many references to Quentin Tarantino. Apart from trying to use hip music (where Quentin Tarantino succeeded and PTA miserably failed). Magnolia was obviously an attempt to copy Pulp Fiction's brilliant multiple story lines coming together in the end. Also in this case PTA failed miserably. Boring and shallow. Magnolia is just a soap. Having all kinds of intelligent and philosophical discussions about this film is just as relevant and interesting as asking the famous Who shot J.R. question.And then in Magnolia it rained frogs!!???

It's difficult to understand how a major American production company can let a major motion picture of its day lapse without renewing the rights! This seems to be the reason the ABC (Aust) are still running a copy struck from an old TV film print, and not a pristine remastered version.While at times the melodramatic aspects may seem a tad overwrought, this is compelling 40's viewing indeed. The story moves along at a good pace and offers a bevy of fascinating characters and situations. As with any works featuring the writings of award winner Robert Rossen, it has believable dialogue and here, it's delivered by convincing characters. If anything, the minor lapses are most likely due to fiddling or additions to the original draft. Rossen who preferred to work alone is well known for many superlative adaptations ie; 'The Sea Wolf' 41 ~ 'They won't Forget' 37 ~ 'All the Kings Men' 49 and 'The Hustler' in 61. It's said he was considerably upset by conflicts with Warren Beatty during the making of his last film 'Lilith' in 64. He died two years later at only 57yrs, survived by his lifetime wife and their children. As with other creative writers of this era, his career was heavily damaged during the paranoid days of the House of Un-American Activities. Being of Russian Jewish parentage he was always looking for an opportunity to stand up for the oppressed. Many of his political statements were excised from several of his scripts by film company exec's prior to release. In this film's case the uncredited script additions were by Robert Riskin; himself an award winning writer known for 'Mr Deeds Goes to Town' 36 and 'Meet John Doe' in 41, but it's rare that a screenwriter can alter another's work and keep the mood perfectly. The original story 'Love Lies Bleeding' by John Patrick was nominated for an Oscar - he later followed up with 'The Hasty Heart' 49 and 'Gigot' in 62The cast work perfectly together right down to the support players. The great Van Heflin as the kid from the wrong side of the tracks returning home having made good, but from questionable means, turns in another strong performance. As does Barbara Stanwyck; playing the rich kid with everything but love, with Kirk Douglas as the son of a scheming father who benefits financially because he shares a dark secret from Stanwycks' past. It was Lauren Bacall who recommended fellow drama school colleague Issur Danielovitch Demsky (now Kirk Douglas) to producer Wallis that resulted in his selection for the second male lead...in his first major screen role he makes a terrific impression.Prolific Ukraine born Director Lewis Milestone of 'All Quite on the Western Front' 30 and 'Of Mice and Men' 39 fame, was also nominated when 'Martha Ivers' was first screened at Cannes film festival. Award winning Director of Photography Victor Milner also known for 'Broken Lullaby' 32 and the epic 'Cleopatra' 35, leaves us with dazzling, moody, B\/W images. Perhaps another minor gripe for me, the make up dept could have done more with Heflin's appearance, in the days that followed a roughing up by several of Douglas' paid henchmen. But how often we still see this sort of thing in many productions to this day. Miklos Rozsas' all too familiar big score, adds some excitement but is perhaps a bit over the top, still, followers of his work will be kept happy. Unfortunately Producer Hal B. Wallis was grooming new-comer Lizabeth Scott for stardom and had Edith Head design several provocative and obviously over glossy wardrobe items that were at odds with her character's standing. Barbara Stanwyck also gets to 'dress up to the hilt' but at least it suits her situation. Watch for future producer Blake Edwards as the sleepy Sailor hitching a ride in Heflin's car. The Image posted for this classic on IMDb's title page, shows the cover of a Paramount DVD, perhaps they finally found a good negative and gave it a well deserved polish for a re-release...?
