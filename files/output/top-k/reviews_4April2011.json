[{"date":"4 April 2011","score":"","review":" Rugrats, created by Europeon born cartoonists Arlene Klasky, Gabor Csupo and Paul Germain, was Nickelodeon's second Nicktoon (name brand as an original cartoon for that channel)and one of the most successful, debuting in 1991 and ending in 2004 spawning 172 episodes and spin-offs.Centerd around Tommy (the brave ringleader), Chuckie (the voice of caution without a mother), twins Phil and Lil (identical twins same in every way but will randomly clash) Angelica (Tommy's evil cousin), Susie (another toddler and a voice of reason to Angelica's tactics toward babies and adults alike),Timmy McNulty (Angelica's sexist rival and cousin), Harold (a slob toddler and friends with the others) Kimi, (a younger baby who -SPOILER- become Chuckie's stepsister later on) and Dil (Tomm'y little brother, who is so young cant even speak BABY).The film The Rugrats Movie debuted in holiday 1998 and was a surprise hit. It was about Tommy's little brother being born and he, Dil, Chukie,the twins, Angelica and the family dog Spike (Kimi and Harold was not introduced yet,Susie made a cameo and Timmy did not appear at all) getting lost in their fathers invention, the Reptar wagon (Reptar is their Godzilla) and become lost in the wilderness, avoiding countless numbers of near-death situations ( in contrast to the show's warm and secure feel as its usually set in a living room) while donging a group of runway circus monkeys and a sinister wolf. The parents learn quickly of their disappearance (which is rare) and begin a state wide search with the press on their tails, with a climactic chase sequence with the babies trying to find their way to the rangers station only to be halted by a wolf and Spike sacrificing himself to save them.In my opinion it was a great film, but at times felt overworked (countless numbers of guest stars,Dil's birth sequence and a strange twist by adding a much darker and serious tone) but i viewed it as a great thing, (that was probably the first time fans saw the babies dodging freeway cars and savage animals). For those unfamiliar to the show, it would be average to a mere annoyance, especially being introduced to Angelica.The sound quality is wonderful, a huge orchestra score by The London Metropolitan fitting the more serious tone compared to the simple xylophone in the show. The graphic aren't mind boggling but a great jump from the series and added CGI effects, while the sky for the whole film is just real life footage (but not bad).Personally id advise this film to fans and families, with many innuendos and dramatic action scenes and heart for the older audiences to enjoy.
