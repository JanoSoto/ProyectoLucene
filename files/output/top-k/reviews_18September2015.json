[{"date":"18 September 2015","score":"","review":" I finally watched this movie after seeing it on a number of top movie lists. I have to admit it was even better than I thought it would be. I enjoyed the acting, the characters, the cinematography and the music. But the screenplay and the plot was what really made this movie as good as it was. I like the way the movie moved a long at a certain pace but kept building on the plot and things just kept getting deeper and deeper. Both from the side of the criminals and the side of the law enforcement. I cant say enough about this movie and would like to avoid spoiling it for everybody but I do admit you really need to see it. Some movies don't need a lot of special effects in order to succeed. As we can see in Fargo and more recently in Nebraska. I gave it nine stars out of ten and for me that is a near perfect score.
