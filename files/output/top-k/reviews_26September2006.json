Ghostbusters is a funny, science fiction movie. It is difficult to find a film more funny throughout the whole movie industry. In the finale the giant marshmallow man comes alive. This is a scene no one can forget, especially with Dan Aykroyd, known as Dr. Raymond Stantz on the screen. Another scary scene was when Gozer appears in Dana Barrett's(Sigourney Weaver)refrigerator. Bill Murray, known as Dr. Peter Venkman, is great in this scene, as in every scene he is in. He has a dry, ironic sense of humor. He does not have to use words to express himself as a comedian. This movie has an impressive cast, and excellent special effects. I enjoyed this movie when I was a child, and to this day I watch this movie on VHS; and laugh again and again like I had just seen it, even though I know about every line by heart.This movie has something for everyone. One was when Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) was recalling the Book of Revelation or another time when Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) tells about the possessed apartment coming into being. Also, when the grid was shut off was a very frightening moment. All the Ghostbusters are unforgettable and humorous in their own way. They work very well with one another, which is what makes it the best of movies.Manhattan is the heart of the subject due to the Gothic architectural grandeur of the city; it makes for the perfect setting. This movie's special effects look as great today as it did in 1984. It is more imaginative than most movies today. The shifting back and forth from comedy to the imaginative and ghostbuster thriller make it one of the best films ever in the hearts of many. It is impossible not to laugh,no matter how many times people see this movie. The audience can see the movie over and over again without tiring because of the comedy mixed with suspense. Rent or buy it soon, as it has truly held up as a classic and one of the biggest blockbuster movies ever made in the 80s!

My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can't think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck or the sword\/gun fight.I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars! I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to. It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).I am giving Raiders 9\/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10\/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?

They have no clue about substance, and thus they worship The Matrix. Unfortunately, substance is what the Matrix lacks. It is no secret why the box office has steadily began to fail since the invention of CGI. It has become too easy to do anything you want in Special Effects, thus *substance* is no longer as attractive. In movies such as Jaws, you could not do anything you wanted. The shark didn't work. They had to use orange barrels to show where the shark could be on the ocean. Thus *substance,* that is, the plot, had to take over where special effects could not take us.Unfortunately, the reverse is true of the Matrix. Special effects can take us anywhere now, and unless there is a really good plot, like in the Lord of the Rings (because the plot had been written in a time when splashy special effects were nonexistent) special effects are not enough to hold a story together.

I put this in, dozed off for a few minutes, then woke up thinking I was watching some bad Japanese movie. Then I remembered, no, it's the Bad News Bears. I didn't even recognize it as a BAB movie.

Maybe it was just as well they ended the series with this movie. Those kids were getting too old anyway. As it was, they just played secondary rolls here and you felt removed from them. And Kelly's love interest? How contrived can you get? He falls in love with a Japanese geisha girl, one he will probably never see again once he gets home? Get real, people!!! And they couldn't understand each other at all when they first met each other. How is it that by the end of the movie either she's able to understand English or he's able to understand Japanese? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that was ever explained.The baseball game was a joke. How do you suppose they could have had a fight on the field without causing an international incident?

It is not, however, for the faint of heart or those unprepared for its powerful and often alarming, in your face approach to the story it is telling.

Yet somehow this film manages to make me type that first statement of this review. Almost Famous made me a believer.Cameron Crowe directed and wrote the screenplay and used his own adolescent experiences to bring realism to the film. The dialog is often witty, dramatic, insightful, and many times all three. It's one of the best screenplays written in the last ten years. The main character of William Miller is a quiet, idealistic boy with a passion for writing who happens to make friends with people who are totally the opposite; they are loud, arrogant, foul-mouthed individuals who aren't against lying to preserve their reputation. But Crowe is able to make the audience believe in this friendship. Even more commendable is that he can make us LIKE these people. We feel for them and understand why they are the way they are.Of course this could also be attributed to the casting of the film. Patrick Fugit, a relatively new performer at the time of production, shows a great deal of acting prowess when playing the film's protagonist. He captures the innocence and fascination of a young man who has fallen in love with music. It's this particular trait that connects him with the characters. Because all of the characters share this love (and realistically), the friendships are that much more tangible.

Gone was the obvious claymation and now what appeared before me was an ape that could actually move and interact with living actors. At the time, I was 9 years old. Now I am 23, and for various reasons I have come to realize that the 1976 version of KING KONG is clearly the weakest of the three adaptations. However, it does bring a level of heart and feeling to the story that was missed in the original version.The original KING KONG portrayed the giant ape as little more then a dangerous beast. After capturing his beauty Ann Darrow, little was done to humanize the monster. This time around, the character of Kong becomes a living, breathing creature with feelings (both sexual and friendly). Aside from giving the ape more subtext, the 1976 changes the time period and original mission of the crew. Instead of setting off to shoot a movie, the original objective of Fred Walker (played by Charles Grodin) is to set off for a remote island that will prove to be the best oil reserve in the world. Also on board the ship is Jack Prescott (played by Jeff Bridges), an environmental missionary out to explore the new world and see if rumors he's heard of a fantastic creature on the island are true. While headed toward the island, the crew picks up Dwan (Jessica Lange in her film debut), the only survivor from a massive shipwreck. Aside from these changes, the story is very familiar. They arrive on the island, meet the unfriendly natives, Dwan gets captured by Kong, and everyone sets off to rescue her.Unfortunately, everything that impressed me so much when I was 9 is now dated and far from awe-inspiring... and the advancement of technology exposes certain flaws in the 1976 De Laurentis version that might not have been so apparent in the past. The film seems to have wasted so much money on their trick shots and special effects that they forgot to infuse everything with a visual style. While the 1933 original's special effects are no longer cutting edge, the film as a whole embraces the special effects and stylizes them in a way so that they never feel dated. KING KONG ('76) simply displays the special effects without the slightest artistic integrity. This is special effects showboating w\/o artistic infusion... and as a result the film can't escape the dated label.However, on the flip side, now that the films special effects are less distracting, it's easier to see some of the more subtle qualities in this version. The original KING KONG was happy to only tell the first half of it's Beauty & The Beast tale, the half in which Beauty never stops fearing the Beast. The 1976 version goes on to tell the full emotional tale of Beauty & The Beast. For the first time we see a genuine bond and appreciation between Dwan and Kong. Slowly Dwan realizes how pure Kong's heart is, and she sees him as a well-intentioned victim once he's shipped over to New York for all to make money off of.Also, despite a high camp factor, the film manages to have its moments. For example, the sacrifice scene in which Dwan is hypnotized by the gyrations of the natives is arguably the most interesting of the three versions. Other scenes that really help to strengthen the emotional bond between Kong and Dwan take place on the journey home to New York. While both the original version and the 2005 remake decided to jump straight from Skull Island back to New York, this film examines the changes that take place in its leading characters during this transitional time.It's impossible for me to see the 70's KING KONG as anything more then the weakest of three interesting films. But the story of KING KONG is one that has fascinated me every time. Just like with the original and the newest version, I can watch this film over and over, year after year. What I can especially appreciate in this version is it's emphasis on compassion and creating a bond between man and ape. Unfortunately, in it's efforts to do so it loses some of the excitement and adrenaline that the original had.

Also on board the ship is Jack Prescott (played by Jeff Bridges), an environmental missionary out to explore the new world and see if rumors he's heard of a fantastic creature on the island are true. While headed toward the island, the crew picks up Dwan (Jessica Lange in her film debut), the only survivor from a massive shipwreck. Aside from these changes, the story is very familiar. They arrive on the island, meet the unfriendly natives, Dwan gets captured by Kong, and everyone sets off to rescue her.Unfortunately, everything that impressed me so much when I was 9 is now dated and far from awe-inspiring... and the advancement of technology exposes certain flaws in the 1976 De Laurentis version that might not have been so apparent in the past. The film seems to have wasted so much money on their trick shots and special effects that they forgot to infuse everything with a visual style. While the 1933 original's special effects are no longer cutting edge, the film as a whole embraces the special effects and stylizes them in a way so that they never feel dated. KING KONG ('76) simply displays the special effects without the slightest artistic integrity. This is special effects showboating w\/o artistic infusion... and as a result the film can't escape the dated label.However, on the flip side, now that the films special effects are less distracting, it's easier to see some of the more subtle qualities in this version. The original KING KONG was happy to only tell the first half of it's Beauty & The Beast tale, the half in which Beauty never stops fearing the Beast. The 1976 version goes on to tell the full emotional tale of Beauty & The Beast. For the first time we see a genuine bond and appreciation between Dwan and Kong. Slowly Dwan realizes how pure Kong's heart is, and she sees him as a well-intentioned victim once he's shipped over to New York for all to make money off of.Also, despite a high camp factor, the film manages to have its moments. For example, the sacrifice scene in which Dwan is hypnotized by the gyrations of the natives is arguably the most interesting of the three versions. Other scenes that really help to strengthen the emotional bond between Kong and Dwan take place on the journey home to New York. While both the original version and the 2005 remake decided to jump straight from Skull Island back to New York, this film examines the changes that take place in its leading characters during this transitional time.It's impossible for me to see the 70's KING KONG as anything more then the weakest of three interesting films. But the story of KING KONG is one that has fascinated me every time. Just like with the original and the newest version, I can watch this film over and over, year after year. What I can especially appreciate in this version is it's emphasis on compassion and creating a bond between man and ape. Unfortunately, in it's efforts to do so it loses some of the excitement and adrenaline that the original had. Thankfully, we have the 2005 version to perfectly blend the best qualities of the previous versions into one thrilling masterpiece! ... B- ...

I think he spends a little too much time on prolonged, embellished sequences of lush shots of Sissy Spacek's body as well as a few others, but his suspense evens it out.I just wish Carrie's final breaking point where she uses her telekinesis to slaughter all of those who hazed, humiliated, and devastated her was as prolonged as his almost aggravatingly wanton opening shower scene or the walk through her house near the end, or other scenes of that nature. Why, in a film about vicious unleashing of cold, hellish vengeance and wrath on the meanest possible people who play the meanest prank or con or sham I've ever seen on film does the rising action have to be so overlong and without an at least minimally violent forewarning and why does the pay-off have to be so short and to- the-point?Really! What's wrong with that scene of almost orgasmic wrath upon the people at the prom being fifteen minutes long, focusing in on each and every person who has in the film specifically picked on her and their brutal deaths? Nancy Allen's gabby friend cracking up at the dousing of the pig's blood simply being hosed down? Why was she not hosed so hard that she was elevated with such force from the house against the wall that she started vomiting blood or dying of suffocation? The snobby, immature teacher who made cruel fun of Carrie's comment in class being electrocuted for, what, six or seven seconds? How about being fried to the point of his skin turning to a crisp? And especially Nancy Allen and John Travolta! The cruelest and most unbelievable vicious characters in the movie just get blown up in their car?! They seriously should have been turned over in their car by Carrie's telekinetic powers, yes, but the car should of just caught aflame, which should've slowly engulfed the car as Carrie uses her mind to crush the car into a smaller, tighter place where there is no escape, so that the two evil people are forced to watch Carrie's saucer-sized eyes of retribution as they slowly burn to death in a cramped space with broken bones? And Carrie's mother should've been crucified with even more knives. Even more, yes. Even one in her eye.Carrie deserves the cruelest, most inhuman revenge ever heard of up till 1976. Why not?! The whole movie up until her breaking point is about her horrible suffering and being sheltered in a terrible psychologically debilitating way by her mother. The audience deserves more than what they get in the climax. The movie is great, and the revenge is sweet, but if only it could've been a little more.Whether you like the film itself or not, you should at least admire Pino Donaggio's wonderful score. It's fantastic and works beautifully.

Because, for a great musical it has little in the way of great music.The reputation of Leonard Bernstein as a composer is one of the stickiest points about his career to discuss among lovers of American music and musicals. Bernstein was a great conductor. He was also a great teacher of music appreciation, as his series of Young People's Concerts on television showed. But was he a great composer? He tried to be, composing serious music that was for the concert hall, most of which has never caught on with the public.As for his music for the theater, the results are mixed. On The Town (based on the music for his ballet about sailors in New York, Fancy Free), Trouble In Tahiti, Candide, Wonderful Town and (best of all)West Side Story were popular hits of the 1940s and 1950s. But how successful do they remain. Forgetting West Side Story - which has his best, truly memorable score, Candide manages to get revived, but there are problems with the book (will they use Lillian Hellman's version or Hugh Wheeler's). Come and be Gay is a semi-standard, but how frequently does one hear This is the best of all possible worlds. Same problem happens with Trouble In Tahiti, which is revived even less than Candide. On The Town had a successful revival in New York four years back, but it's sole semi-standard (hardly sung by singers in concert or nightclubs) is It's a Wonderful Town. Wonderful Town has a good book (based on My Sister Eileen) but the tunes like That's the Way to Lose a Man and Ohio are serviceable but not permanent repertory. Those are the memorable musicals. His last one about the Presidency, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, was a flop from the first day (care to hear The Thomas Jefferson March?).The music in On The Town is, again, serviceable. Some of it is sprightly - like the duet between Sinatra and Betty Garrett, Come to My Place. But it is basically music that was written for the purpose of dance numbers (which it serves quite well - especially for Kelly and Vera-Ellen). Note the number about Miss Turnstyles, wherein Kelly is reading Vera-Ellen's biographical information, and we see her dancing in matching sequences to the descriptions. Or the ballet where Kelly finds himself abandoned by her when she fails to show up for a date (which I suspect influenced him and maybe Vincent Minnelli in the better ballet at the end of An American In Paris where Kelly dreams of the loss of Leslie Caron).The story of three sailors on shore leave in New York City for twenty four hours, and how they each meet the woman of their dreams is quite enchanting (if impossible) to watch. The parings are fascinating Kelly and Vera-Ellen both dancing into each other's life. Garrett (as Brunhilde Esterhazy) as a man hunting cab driver, pursuing and winning a frightened Sinatra (still in that annoying naive dimwit series of roles - though less annoying than in Anchors Aweigh). Miller as an anthropology student attracted to the Neanderthal looking Munshin is quite funny. Yet there is a missing element here from the musical not found in the film.Miller has a boyfriend, mentioned once or twice but never seen in the film. He is financing her education. In the musical, he does appear - a judge named Pitkin. Pitkin is a sweet, nebbish, who lets Miller's character Claire twist him around his finger for much of the musical. They are supposed to be going out to dinner that night, and she keeps putting him off, telling him to meet her later (she is busy with Ozzie (Munshin's character) at a variety of nightclubs). At the same time, in the musical, Alice Pearce's character Lucy Shmeeler is being pulled around by Gabey (Gene Kelly's character) while he is trying to romance Ivy Smith (Vera-Ellen's character).But after the fourth time, Pitkin gets tired of this mistreatment. He sings a song (cut with his character in the movie) showing that the hidden lion in his personality has been aroused in anger at Claire's selfishness. He has been always too docile (with his mother, his brother, Claire) and he has suffered for too long as a result. But the only person who hears this is Lucy (the other six have gone off together). Grabbing Lucy, Pitkin chases the sailors and the three girls, and is there at the conclusion - to help humiliate Claire and to renounce her. The lion has arrived. And there is a hint as he leaves with Lucy that possibly they might become a fourth couple. Pity this was not in the movie version, as Alice Pearce's character is treated by Kelly and the others as a good sport, but sent home alone.My comment may seem a trifle harsh, but in fact the musical is terrific as an entertainment for all the flaws I point out.
