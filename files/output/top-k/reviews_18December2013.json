I suspect it was because of how often the lightsaber is used throughout the course of Star Wars Return of the Jedi. I specifically remember always being horrified by what Darth Vader looked like underneath his helmet. Spoiler alert we finally see him unmasked, after all of the teasing George Lucas gave us in Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back.Han Solo is still frozen in carbonite at the beginning of this film, and there is a rescue action sequence for the first twenty minutes of the film (which is very, very exciting). Luke Skywalker has now become a Jedi Knight, and he is coming to save Han, his now longtime friend. Meanwhile, the Empire has almost finished building the second Death Star. The gang of heroic rebels must defeat the Empire in this finale to the Star Wars film saga.Like the latter two films, the performances are excellent in this movie. Luke has changed so much since the beginning of the trilogy that he is almost unrecognizable now. At the same time, I find Luke a much more compelling character in this film, because we see even more layers of him. There isn't much more to say when it comes to the acting, for all of the actors shine through in many, many ways. Even Lando (played by Billy Dee Williams) is fantastic in this movie.The special effects are--as always--phenomenal. I feel like the whole green lightsaber debate amongst fans is silly, but I must add my own two cents I find the green (or somewhat lime) lightsaber color very extravagant and gorgeous. It is by far my favorite lightsaber design--hilt and blade together--in the entire six-film saga. Space battles and flying teddy bears look a little silly, most of the time, but they are still able to be overlooked for the very fantastic writing and dialogue.I'd say that this film remains my favorite for the fact that the message to it is outstanding. We all struggle with the dark side of mankind. This film gives an excellent portrayal of such an ideology.The writing of Star Wars Return of the Jedi is enthralling, to say the least. I have to somewhat dislike the Endor scenes, but it was a nice change of scenery from the first two films. We have never had a jungle sequence, and I feel there was nowhere else to go. I also believe that many people would not hate this film (or sequence) if the Ewoks weren't a part of the film. I can relate. However, the dialogue is great in the film--and the events are just as great. I must say that the final duel between Luke and Vader gives me constant chills due to the acting, swordplay, and soundtrack.On another note that I always seem to forget in my Star Wars film reviews, the soundtrack is beautiful, especially within this film.When it comes to the set designs, I must compliment whoever built them. They did a fine job creating all kinds of realistic places. In all honesty, I feel like this film does a better job than any of the others when it comes to making the viewer feel like they are in a completely new world. It's very entrancing.Overall, I can't NOT give Star Wars The Return of the Jedi a full ten-out-of-ten stars. The film has been my life since I was an infant, and I see how glorious it is, even in my adult years. This is brilliant cinema.Merry Christmas, and God bless!

After seeing it twice I can safely say that for the most part, the film made an impression and it is hard to nitpick on a film that is directed so well that seeing it's flaws did make me feel awful. Objectively, the film does have it's flaws but it's a flaw that I felt that was only raised due to my personal tastes.The film is based on a book by Larry McMurtry and the screenplay was written by James L. Brooks. The film travels through the moments of these characters lives whether they are positive or negative, and the timeline span is quite huge. The film jumps from year to year, which felt spontaneously but that could have resolved if the film spends more time at that moment, but running the risk of feeling to overbloated and long. This does end up making the film feel very episodic and it may not be an approach that would appeal to everyone as some would prefer a flowing experience of these people's lives. Brooks wants us to experience the lives of both Aurora and Emma and not have us be focused on a plot in driving the film forward. This episodic approach does at times do make the film feel draggy and honestly a certain time period could have been a film on it's own if explored long enough. The highlight of the film is the relationship between Aurora and Garrett as the clashing of both personalities just brings out moments of humor and surprisingly at times warmth and happiness.James L. Brooks also directed this film and I must say that he has done a magnificent job. Brooks' direction is the reason that the film doesn't feel like going through the same motions again and again because he doesn't fill the film entirely with one note. There are times where you may feel like you are about to shed a tear and there are moments that would make you laugh, and because the film allows us to look into their lives in a natural and lengthy approach, it doesn't let the moments of humor and melodrama feel forced. There were moments where it might land on heavy sentimental territory but Brooks' balance with humor buffers that tone. This was Brooks' first film and what a great way to start off his directorial career by winning Best Picture and Best Director at the Oscars.The film's director of photography was Aandrzej Bartkowiak and he has worked on some notable films later on like Falling Down and Speed. Terms of Endearment was one of his early films and what he has done for Brooks' film is that he gave the picture a warm tone and has a soft look to it. The film's warm tone definitely a major apparatus in conveying the light heartedness that drives the film and it also allows the film to feel accessible. Brooks and Bartkowiak has opted to use an abundance of close-ups as the film is drama centered and the film primarily focuses on the characters reactions and feelings towards certain things, the expressions on the actor's faces makes this film feel wonderful and most importantly natural.The film's score is composed by Michael Gore and if I had to describe his work for this film in a nutshell, it would be beautiful. The score is driven with this light piano sound and it goes back and forth to being sad and cheerful, which kind of a great representation of life. Michael Gore doesn't seem to be working lately but he has worked on notable films like Fame and, a personal favorite of mine, Pretty In Pink. Gore's work here is definitely a standout and is a central key in having us laugh or cry throughout this film.This film has a stellar cast with almost all of the key players being nominated for their performances. Debra Winger was fantastic who starts off as being young, quirky and adorable to a matured, experienced and endearing person. The evolution of her character is amazing and that I really believed that she went through everything that was shown on screen. Shirley MacLaine won Best Actress for this film and it was well deserved though competing against her co-star was a tough one. MacLaine was able to shine throughout the entire film as she is at her best when she has someone to challenge with in a scene, so all of the moments where she is with Debra Winger or Jack Nicholson, it brought out the best of her. Jack Nicholson is not the focus of this film but he does make quite an impression in this film and I was also surprised he was able to come off as sweet and likable as my experience with his films are usually him playing someone frightening or intimidating. Jeff Daniels was not given the attention he deserved for this film, in my opinion he gave an award winning performance and he was able to come off as likable and sympathetic even after everything he has caused. This film is a type of film that challenges and brings out the capabilities of an actor and each cast member have shown off their most outstanding of performances here in this film.Terms of Endearment is not perfect in my eyes but it gets a lot of things right that it would be horrible decision to pass it up. James L. Brooks' wonderful direction and Michael Gore's score will have you laughing and crying from start to finish, and acting performances that will have you caring for the characters and the troubles and joys that they go through.

Thomas Howell comes from a rich family and has been accepted to Harvard, but, when his father expects him to pay for his own college education and won't finance it, Tom goes to drastic measures for a scholarship. It seems that Harvard has, in this movie anyway, a scholarship for the most qualified African-American that comes from a certain demographic. So, of course, he goes black face and gets some soul, brother. I said soul. What actually sounds like a pretty lame, almost offensive, and just plain stupid film turns out in fact to be one of the most thought-provoking 1980s comedies made. Granted, it might be biting off more than it can chew, but this film is genuinely funny and has characters that are three-dimensional due in part to good acting by Tom; Rae Dawn Chong, who plays a student he starts to care for; and teacher James Earl Jones. My two favorite moments in the film are when he tells his parents, Mom, Dad, I'm black! and when he tells teacher James Earl Jones, No sir, I didn't quite learn how it feels to be black, because I could at any time go back to being white. That moment really made the film for me, as it defines the difference between putting yourself in someone's place and actually being them. I see this film, from all the ratings, has a low mean, but I think it deserves better, as it's a very entertaining and funny film, while having moments that speak to the viewer in its indirect and subtle way without being preachy. I would definitely watch this again and would recommend it for those who like comedies with a little soul and substance to it.

Ron Howard's remake (or re-imagining) of Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas is one of the best examples of a film I adored as a child, yet find many little problems with it now, at the age of nineteen. One of my best, most faint memories of my passed Christmases was my amazing grandfather taking me to the theatres to see this movie. I was excited because I knew the old short, and even owned it on VHS. My grandfather was excited to see more Jim Carrey comedy. We had a grand old time, I must say. To this day, we still have a spot in our hearts for this soft-hearted little film. Most people consider the greatest films on the planet are the ones that take us out of our lives and place us in a world that we've never experienced before. How the Grinch Stole Christmas is my favorite example of such a film.An unexplained green creature, called the Grinch, hates Christmas for the solo fact that it brings back the worst memories, which--in turn--made him the bitter, lonesome thing that he is. When on the parole to wreak a few mishaps in the town of Whoville before Christmas, he meets--and saves, as a matter of fact--a young girl named Cindy Lou. Cindy sees the good in the Grinch. Cindy believes that ALL people have good in them, but can sometimes be driven to bitterness through careless actions by others. This sets the film into motion, with Cindy Lou trying to get the Grinch to join the little place known as Whoville for a big, wonderful holiday bash.To begin, I must immediately state a major bravo for Ron Howard, for he has accomplished such a notable film for the Christmas season. As I have stated there isn't many movies that take you into another world completely. How the Grinch Stole Christmas succeeds phenomenally at that. Ron Howard's directing is excellent, with all the set designs extremely well-crafted and suitable for Whoville. Even the mountain the Grinch lives in looks fantastic.In this film, Jim Carrey gives one of the most amazing performances in history. From what I've heard, he had an enormously hard time dealing with the suit, claiming it was extremely painful and hard to move around in whilst wearing (take notes Christian Bale). Not only is he hilarious, but he even gets the emotional moments of the film down so well that you cannot help but be moved a little on the inside. When you see hope on the Grinch's face, it truly touches you. Another bravo to Jim. Another standout was Anthony Hopkins as the narrator. Anthony gives a fantastic reading for the film, and definitely adds his own charm to it. When it comes to the rest of the cast, I can't say too much. Every role besides the Grinch and Cindy Lou were tiny, partial roles, so many of the other performances just weren't too extravagant. Cindy Lou was played by a seven- or eight-year-old, so you have to let her bad moments slide a little. This young girl plays a fine role, for the most part, and even has her very own moments that considerably warm your heart. The one character arch I thought was a little pestering was the slutty Martha May. Dear Father in Heaven, let her hang from Wholimbs upon Whotrees within Whoville.The writing is very interesting, in my opinion. Many, many subplots were added to the old, simplistic, thirty-something-page story to make it a nearly two-hour-long film. Besides the irritability of Martha May, I found other characters more of a necessity for this expanded version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The jokes, for the most part, are only funny because Jim Carrey breathes a LOT of life into them. I laughed aloud many times, that much is true. Jim really knows what he is doing. He also plays off of the other characters very well, like with the Cheermeister sequence. No matter what others tell you, there is a heart underneath this mass of skit-like comedy. Think of it as you do untangling the Christmas tree lights for decorating; it may be a bundle of mess, but giving it time lets you learn to appreciate it.The soundtrack has to be mentioned! I consider How the Grinch Stole Christmas to be a fantasy film, in a way. This soundtrack helps develop the tone and atmosphere so well, and I think it is a major plus the film has going for it.Overall, many people will be divided on this little Christmas candy, but I am definitely for it. It could be that I grew up with it. Nostalgia tends to grasp me when it comes to me reviewing movies. However, I don't think it is just that. I see a genuine attempt at a warming film underneath the bundle of story and characters. My score for Ron Howard's How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a seven-out-of-ten stars.

It's unbearably mean-spirited with a truly terrible performance from Alan King. The only thing worth mentioning about it is the Police song Every Breath You Take, and that's a cover! The second story is OK, with some suspenseful moments as Hays works his way around the ledge. But it gets pretty silly. The third story is the best and probably the one most people remember the film for. The cat fighting off the troll to protect the little girl is definitely memorable.Overall, it's a mixed bag but a watchable one. The first segment is very off-putting. I wonder why they didn't just make a whole film out of the third segment. Seems like they could have. Movies have certainly been made on lesser ideas. It's also a movie full of Stephen King in-jokes. Cujo and Christine appear in unmentioned cameos at the beginning, for example. So that's some added enjoyment for King fans.

It shocks you first, then gradually pulls you into its dark, twisted, but somehow irresistible world. In visual terms, it is flawless the sets are anti-utopian and mundane at the same time, the costumes not only contribute to the atmosphere, but provide thematic reinforcement (the clothes of Alex and his droogs are a fascinating combination of a socio-political commentary and sexual innuendo). Talking about the brilliance of Kubrick's cinematography is somewhat of a cliché. However, his use of sound in this case deserves a special mention the classical music is used highly effectively, and for multiple purposes. The sex scene between Alex and the two girls from the music store is one of the best erotic scenes in cinema, conveying all that it need to convey in a matter of seconds.Malcolm McDowell deserves a separate paragraph. He seems to have been born to play Alex DeLarge (and might have been, sadly not having any other memorable roles). He effortlessly combines childishness, vulnerability and likability with ultra-violence and perversion, portraying the ultimate anti-hero. In fact, one of the very few flaws of the film is that Kubrick;s efforts to erase the distance between the character and the audience are not entirely successful the use of a voice-over does not work as seamlessly as the 1st person narrative of the novel (perhaps Kubrick should have considered using short clips portraying Alex's thoughts and fantasies more often, not only at the end). However, this goes largely unnoticed due to McDowell's truly magnetic presence on screen.The film is undoubtedly a masterpiece; the only problem with it is the widespread notion that it is far superior to its original source, Anthony Burgess's 1961 novel, a mere blueprint, so to speak, for Kubrick's artistic vision. That is not the case, and perhaps Kubrick should not have thrown out the script that Burgess himself wrote for him. Famously, the American edition of the novel (the one Kubrick used), omitted a final, 21st chapter, that was deemed 'too optimistic', as it introduced the possibility of actual change to Alex's character. However, this not only altered the book's perfectly constructed tripartite structure (the film is not perfectly balanced, and the third part does lack the flawless pacing and rhythm of the first two), but also reduced the thematic complexity of the original. It no longer deals with the problems of coming-of-age, or familial issues, becoming almost exclusively a political commentary on ethics and choice. No one would call Kubrick's film shallow, obviously. And yet it is still surpassed by the novel, which is brilliant in both concept and execution.

It portrays the rawest, most real-feeling, vision of war that I have ever seen. Though the grave portrayals and subject matter exclude Saving Private Ryan from being a traditionally entertaining film, it is still very engaging. It falls prey to some issues characteristic of war films and some issues characteristic of Spielberg films, but those do not take away Saving Private Ryan's claim to greatness that it rightfully deserves.There is not an ounce of blood nor spray of bullets from beginning to end that doesn't feel real. Many highly violent films lose their impact entirely when the special effects are less than convincing and when character deaths feels too complicit to the story. Thankfully Saving Private Ryan has incredible, mainly practical, special effects, and the film is not afraid to kill even its most sympathetic characters in addition to literally boat loads of extras. The opening flashback to Omaha Beach is an incredible feat in cinema and likely the best subjective view of warfare caught on film. When the doors of the boats open and German machine guns mow down the U.S. soldiers without a moment's hesitation, it is truly shocking. For one shot the camera is in the position of a soldier near the back of a boat, his comrades in front of him. The doors open and all the soldiers in frame are ripped of their lives by an unstoppable hail of bullets. The fact that I would be dead if were there is effectively disturbing. Some other shots take place underwater. Down there the screams of the dying, pounding of artillery, and incessant chatter of machine guns are muffled. For a second I felt calm and safe, before a couple bullets penetrated the water and the soldiers beneath it, calming their struggle and causing plumes of blood to rise to the surface. The scene continues in this fashion for an extended time as it follows a group of soldiers fighting their way up the beach, eventually to victory for that specific skirmish. The Omaha Beach scene sets the mood for the rest of the film, and the final battle of the bridge matches it, providing a nice bookend for the rest of the story to play out between. Some death scenes are truly disturbing. They force you to look at your own mortality right in the face. I should mention that the direction is superb. The audience is able to achieve a new perspective on war from Spielberg's outstanding ability to link action and build a sense of omniscience coupled with harsh subjectivity. I didn't detect a false move in the entire film. While the film is a true achievement, its reliance on shock causes its impact to decrease with subsequent viewings (I've seen it thrice), but I still recognize it as a great film. One thing that detracted from Saving Private Ryan, conflicting with the realism, was its sentimentality, driven by John Williams' seemingly ubiquitous score. The sentimentality felt out of place and left a bad taste in my mouth. I could almost call the film cloying at times. Thankfully, during the parts that really matter there is no music and no forced emotion, only what happens right before your eyes which is enough to change you by itself.War films tend to be very pure. Many times they are almost exclusively about survival, an objective, and the non-romantic relationships between the soldiers. Saving Private Ryan fits into this category. For me this excludes a certain aspect of cinema that I crave. It excludes a sense of culture, artistry, and beauty. The film is too raw for my liking. Whenever the characters come to a new town they find it in a state of wreckage. The once beautiful architecture is reduced to rubble and potential strategic positions. Of course Saving Private Ryan relies a great deal on realism and the decision to maintain its purity as a war film certainly contributes to its realism. Nevertheless my complaint stands.For what is essentially an existential film, Saving Private Ryan manages to the fill its running time with engaging scenes, one after another. There are many incidental, almost arbitrary, occurrences. The taking of the French girl, the knocking down of a wall to reveal a platoon of enemy soldiers. The list goes on. Yes these scenes are sufficiently engaging even if each one does not contribute to a central story thrust. More than that they add to the sense of mayhem and disarray that surely accompanies soldiers embroiled in such a conflict. Whereas I might be tempted to label this style as fluff or meaningless in other films, the existential mode fits Saving Private Ryan very well.Saving Private Ryan is a great film. It is an achievement in cinema and also fascinating to watch. While a few issues prevent me from calling it a masterpiece I can confidently say that I will watch it again someday.33\/40 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Steven Spielberg's 1998 war film, Saving Private Ryan, is a monumental picture.

Some other shots take place underwater. Down there the screams of the dying, pounding of artillery, and incessant chatter of machine guns are muffled. For a second I felt calm and safe, before a couple bullets penetrated the water and the soldiers beneath it, calming their struggle and causing plumes of blood to rise to the surface. The scene continues in this fashion for an extended time as it follows a group of soldiers fighting their way up the beach, eventually to victory for that specific skirmish. The Omaha Beach scene sets the mood for the rest of the film, and the final battle of the bridge matches it, providing a nice bookend for the rest of the story to play out between. Some death scenes are truly disturbing. They force you to look at your own mortality right in the face. I should mention that the direction is superb. The audience is able to achieve a new perspective on war from Spielberg's outstanding ability to link action and build a sense of omniscience coupled with harsh subjectivity. I didn't detect a false move in the entire film. While the film is a true achievement, its reliance on shock causes its impact to decrease with subsequent viewings (I've seen it thrice), but I still recognize it as a great film. One thing that detracted from Saving Private Ryan, conflicting with the realism, was its sentimentality, driven by John Williams' seemingly ubiquitous score. The sentimentality felt out of place and left a bad taste in my mouth. I could almost call the film cloying at times. Thankfully, during the parts that really matter there is no music and no forced emotion, only what happens right before your eyes which is enough to change you by itself.War films tend to be very pure. Many times they are almost exclusively about survival, an objective, and the non-romantic relationships between the soldiers. Saving Private Ryan fits into this category. For me this excludes a certain aspect of cinema that I crave. It excludes a sense of culture, artistry, and beauty. The film is too raw for my liking. Whenever the characters come to a new town they find it in a state of wreckage. The once beautiful architecture is reduced to rubble and potential strategic positions. Of course Saving Private Ryan relies a great deal on realism and the decision to maintain its purity as a war film certainly contributes to its realism. Nevertheless my complaint stands.For what is essentially an existential film, Saving Private Ryan manages to the fill its running time with engaging scenes, one after another. There are many incidental, almost arbitrary, occurrences. The taking of the French girl, the knocking down of a wall to reveal a platoon of enemy soldiers. The list goes on. Yes these scenes are sufficiently engaging even if each one does not contribute to a central story thrust. More than that they add to the sense of mayhem and disarray that surely accompanies soldiers embroiled in such a conflict. Whereas I might be tempted to label this style as fluff or meaningless in other films, the existential mode fits Saving Private Ryan very well.Saving Private Ryan is a great film. It is an achievement in cinema and also fascinating to watch. While a few issues prevent me from calling it a masterpiece I can confidently say that I will watch it again someday.33\/40 ","genre":"Action, Drama, War"},{"date":"18 December 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Steven Spielberg's 1998 war film, Saving Private Ryan, is a monumental picture. It portrays the rawest, most real-feeling, vision of war that I have ever seen. Though the grave portrayals and subject matter exclude Saving Private Ryan from being a traditionally entertaining film, it is still very engaging. It falls prey to some issues characteristic of war films and some issues characteristic of Spielberg films, but those do not take away Saving Private Ryan's claim to greatness that it rightfully deserves.There is not an ounce of blood nor spray of bullets from beginning to end that doesn't feel real. Many highly violent films lose their impact entirely when the special effects are less than convincing and when character deaths feels too complicit to the story. Thankfully Saving Private Ryan has incredible, mainly practical, special effects, and the film is not afraid to kill even its most sympathetic characters in addition to literally boat loads of extras. The opening flashback to Omaha Beach is an incredible feat in cinema and likely the best subjective view of warfare caught on film. When the doors of the boats open and German machine guns mow down the U.S. soldiers without a moment's hesitation, it is truly shocking. For one shot the camera is in the position of a soldier near the back of a boat, his comrades in front of him. The doors open and all the soldiers in frame are ripped of their lives by an unstoppable hail of bullets. The fact that I would be dead if were there is effectively disturbing.

The new Ripley is even tougher than before, since some of the alien's DNA mixed with hers. She now has superhuman abilities and can sense when aliens are nearby. A group of mercenaries (headed by Wynona Rider) invade the scientific research ship, which results in the aliens being released.
