The plot is quite complex and begins with lots of different strands which are all brought together in a very interesting way though a quick explanation is that it is about four guys who get one of their lot to play a high-stakes game of poker which he loses. Thus they must get half a million pounds with-in a few days or be slowly cut to pieces.It is a movie that I can see becoming a cult movie, it has that certain feel to it. The wit in the movie is extremely clever and the directorial techniques quite unique. This movie I would term as experimental, though such movies seem to quite often come out of Britain. America dominates the mainstream market, so other countries need to experiment with their filmmaking to compete. Britain seems to do quite a good job at it.Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is what I would term as a grunge movie. The movie has a very dusky tinge to it and it is set entirely in the East-end of London (well, I can't say for sure as I suspect Harry's Sexshop, and maybe the bar, are located in Soho), a very lower class area. Everybody in the movie are criminals and this is made obvious. Even those who are clean are only clean because they distance themselves from what is happening. None of the characters have any really redeeming qualities, nor do they get through the movie due to any amount of skill. The card player, even though he is very good, could not overcome the camera which was scanning his cards, and as such lost.This movie delves deep into the criminal underworld of London. It is an underworld where there is no love or compassion but rather people trying to outdo each other. It is a world where only the strong, the smart, and the lucky survive. In fact, only six people do survive the four card players, and the loan-shark and his kid (not counting the father, but he knows how to keep his nose clean) everybody else winds up dead, including all of the crime lords, and through a stroke of luck, the four guys manage to keep their hands clean.Some British movies do suck, but this is not one of them. From seeing movies like this, it makes me appreciate the British Cinema a lot more. I could not say if Hong Kong Cinema and British Cinema influenced each other, but there is something that sets it apart from their American counterparts. It is also interesting to note that in the 1998 version of the British Oscars, Titanic was not mentioned once.

Michael Caine as Harry Palmer, a sergeant in army intelligence, gets out of bed, goes to the kitchen and makes his morning cup of coffee. The camera follows him as he grinds the beans, spoons out the coffee, and finally adds boiling water. Later in the film he makes an omelette, expertly breaking the eggs with one hand while chatting to a female colleague. These are important scenes in The Ipcress File; they establish the character's point of difference. Spy films proliferated in the 60's, inspired by the Cold War and the success of the James Bond films. Each new entry in the genre presented a bit of business that would help it stand out from the crowd. Bond may have had his Aston Martin and his debonair style but Harry Palmer had his horn-rimmed glasses and his domestic virtues. Harry Palmer is good at what he does but invariably rubs his superiors the wrong way. He is posted to British Counter-Intelligence to track down Dr. Radcliffe, a scientist who has been kidnapped by an international group of criminals who will try to sell him to the highest bidder &#x96; East or West. Palmer is under the command of Major Dalby played by Nigel Green, but finds his previous boss, the snobbish Colonel Ross, played by Guy Dolman, still hovering on the scene. Double agents and brainwashing were two of the favourite plot devices of movies from the period, and The Ipcress File ticks both items on the checklist. When the missing scientist is returned, it is discovered that he has been brainwashed. The claims for the effectiveness of brainwashing in movies have become more preposterous over time. Although the techniques on view in The Ipcress File are not the most far-fetched, they are nonetheless the least convincing aspects of the film. They consist of a high-pitched noise and cheap disco effects projected onto the subject strapped to a chair inside a metal container. Michael Caine plays Palmer with that same air of insolence that he brought to nearly all his roles in the first half of his career. The film also strips away any glamour espionage may have had. The operatives spend a great deal of time filling out forms &#x96; L101's and Motor Pool Requisitions. Mostly it's just legwork, explains Jock, a colleague Palmer befriends played by Gordon Jackson.A noticeable feature of the film is the camera work. After nearly 50 years, this appears as eccentric rather than chic. Many scenes are shot with the view obscured by what appears to be the nearest piece of furniture. Other scenes are shot at gravity defying angles. Although these effects now seem quaint and overly self-conscious, The Ipcress File is still a sharply told tale. It seemed that no British spy movie of the period was complete without a John Barry score. Barry was very experimental during the 60's, and produced one brilliant score after another including this one for The Ipcress File with effective use of the cimbalom in the main theme.Even if The Ipcress File doesn't qualify for classic status, Caine is still a good reason to watch this film, he gave it a unique edge back then that still makes it easy to watch today.

It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first Mortal Kombat instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first Mortal Kombat movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last Mortal Kombat movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too.

He is brought to Dr. Sweeney, the principal. Sweeney taught Danny's older brother Derek, who he claims was one of his brighter students, and has since visited him in prison. He makes Danny write a new paper, which will only be read by Sweeney. It is to be called American History X, and is to be based on Danny's own beliefs living in contemporary America, based primarily on the influence his older brother has had on him. That same morning, Derek Vinyard is released from prison. In his absence, his neo-Nazi gang has grown into a well organised and powerful unit, of which Derek has become the cult figure orbiting it's ambitions. But Derek has changed in the aftermath of his disillusionment with the Aryan Brotherhood in prison. He wants out, and he must now fight to influence Danny once again to save him and the rest of his family from the legacy which he has created.A film perhaps noticeable for a certain dispute which erupted in the aftermath of filming, which caused director Tony Kaye to since disown the work. From what I can gather, from reading different online sources, Edward Norton was allowed by the studio to participate in the editing of the film, which angered Kaye due to the scenes in which Norton chose to include and to cut-out; subsequently cutting in longer scenes of himself. Essentially, Kaye was not satisfied with the end-product. Which is a wonder, as the film could not receive enough praise from some critics, and it's legacy has pitted American History X into every list made in the 21st century of greatest films ever made, etc. Personally for me, it's one of the finest dramas I've ever seen. It's a harrowing, yet breath-taking, study of hatred and racism in contemporary America. Derek Vinyard &#x96; once a very bright and promising student, now an ex-con trying to piece his life back together&#x96; can be interpreted as being the epitome of disillusioned youth and reckless anger which he vents through racism and violence. Edward Norton's performance in this film has to go down as one of the finest and most powerful cinematic performances in history. Apart from his fine physical transformation into the ripped physique he flaunts, as an actor he captures the essence of Vinyard's character, from his hate-fuelled skinhead charisma, to his post-incarceration reformation. Vinyard sports a vulgar swastika tattoo on his chest, and there's one scene in the film in which Derek steps out of the shower after being released from prison. His hair has grown back, and he stares at the tattoo in the mirror for a moment. It's over in a blink-of-an-eye, but Norton's superb acting encapsulates the regret, pain and the dangerous journey ahead of his character in that one single look of emotion on his face.The story is told in nonlinear narration; something which Tarantino revived and made popular again in the early nineties with Reservoir Dogs, and later, the even better Pulp Fiction. The flashbacks in the film are presented in black and white, and the present in colour. This is a simple, yet genius technique employed by director Tony Kaye. As well as Norton's class performance, there are others worth mentioning, notably, Edward Furlong as Danny. Furlong narrates much of the film, via readings from his paper which he is writing for Sweeney. Avery Brooks plays Sweeney and in a very memorable role as a mentor to the brothers as he attempts to make the young men realise their mistakes, as well as potentials, in reverting them back onto the right side of the track. Elliott Gould has a small role as the history teacher, who we also see in the flashbacks as he dated Mrs. Vinyard for a short period. This all comes to a head at a heated argument at the dinner table. It's one of the most strongly acted parts of the film. Other performances come from Beverly D'Angelo who plays Mrs. Vinyard, while the comedian Guy Torry provides a very memorable performance as the African-American inmate Vinyard befriends while in prison working in the laundry.American History X is one of the best and most compelling films of the 90s. Brutal in it's authenticity; it attempts to offer a solution as well as redemption to the protagonist and his younger brother. At this point I note how the film opens with the serene image and sound of waves crashing onto a beach. It ends with this same image, but in the aftermath of a bitter and devastating ending in which everything comes to a head and erupts into violence. A must-see film, and one of the finest cinematic experiences and breathtaking dramas I've ever seen.

Bridget Fonda's character makes some interesting and independent choices, yet the script couldn't resist putting her back where she she started. A serious plot twist that developed between Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick was quickly and conveniently done away with, after only a few moments of screen time. The movie spends a few moments here and there at local concerts with the likes of Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, and pans over the writhing mosh pits in an effort to remind this that this is the new 90's style of being young. Does not work with this story. As attractive as Kyra Sedgwick is (and a decent actress) I would not have chosen her for the lead female role. Her personality and appearance to not fit the style of the movie, and she looks woefully out of place at an Alice in Chains concert, like she wandered out of an elementary school library to see what was going on. Is it worth a watch? Yes it is. There are some genuinely funny moments that I had missed as a kid, involving cameos by Jeremy Piven and Eric Stolz. Bridget Fonda is just adorable and her style holds up pretty well after 2 decades. However, from what I hear, we have Singles to thank for the parade of youth watching over the next 10-15 years, from Reality Bites to Friends, bringing us more and more white post college young adults exchanging remarks and looking stylish. And let's not forget the coffee shop. The question that begs is... Were Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden truly looking for a break through the big screen? I won't deny that this really helped a-list all those guys. Nirvana backed out. Is Chris Cornell ashamed? hmmm...

The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands.Was never really a fan of The Amityville Horror. I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in Amityville II The Possession are based on the Defoe family.While ...The Possession is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed Halloween III Season of the Witch that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off The Exorcist. Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of The Amityville Horror was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

In terms of accuracy they're pretty terrific, there are a few differences but they're not significant. In real life Tommy was a huge, powerful man whilst Pesci in the film is diminutive but no less terrifying. Tommy wasn't shot in the face so his family couldn't have an open coffin as featured in the film, he just disappeared and was never seen again (which is exactly what happened to his girlfriend a short time later). The famous 'funny how?' story was not actually something which happened to Henry Hill but was something which really did happen to Joe Pesci whilst he was working as a waiter for some genuine Mafioso. Tremendous performances all around, De Niro his customary excellent, a career making turn from both Ray Liotta and Loraine Brocco and did you spot a then unknown Samuel L Jackson as Stacks? In many ways though it's Pesci who dominates, prior to this he was largely known as a comic actor with Home Alone and Lethal Weapon 2, such a small guy but just full of unbelievable aggressiveness, he makes you shudder. What I really like about it is that it shows you both the good side and the bad side of being a gangster. On the good side you are the 'movie-star with muscle' everything just falls into your lap and you live the life of Reilly, even when you go to prison you're treated special. On the bad side you have to do things like dig up the rotting corpses of other gangsters you've murdered and rebury them. Keep looking over your shoulder for the police and FBI all the time. And that your friends aren't really your friends, they'll happily rat you out if they think it'll save them or slit your throat if they think there's 5 bucks in it for them (F*ck you, pay me!)

One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why.

Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue &#x96; even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending.On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would be with each other verses the hot girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other.I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense.

What is the Dogme'95 Manifesto? Dogme '95 also known as Dogme#2 were rules to create filmmaking based on the traditional values of story, acting, theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology following close to a Vow of Chastity rule. Like a whore in a nun's church, Lars broke the rules in this movie by bringing a prop onto the set and used special lighting. Von Trier also used background music (Le Cygne by Camille Saint-Saëns) in the film. The whole Dogme '95 movement collapse with this movie. Due to trying to live up to the Vows, the movie suffers from errors on screen such as boom mics or cameraman getting into the shots. The idiots also marks the second film in von Trier's Golden Heart Trilogy, which includes Breaking the Waves (1996) and Dancer in the Dark (2000) which had a woman put into wickedness actions. The woman in this one is Karen (Bodil Jørgensen) who is taken some interest in an anti-bourgeois group, leaded by Stoffer (Jens Albinus), whom spend their time acting like mentally disabled people in public to challenge the establishment through provocation. The idiots start to see that with they can get away with a lot with playing dumb, and see a romantic ideal of being disability gives until reality hit them hard. The movie is spoken in Danish, but I can't understand the message they are trying to say with this film. I can't decide if that dogma filmmaking method is admirable or intentionally hamstringing itself arbitrarily. The characters are unlikeable. The mocking of Down syndrome is rude. Then there is the pointless gangbang scene. That part of the film was pure hardcore porn. I know Lars Von Trier lived in nudist commune environment and yes, I know Danish has more lax attitude towards nudity and sex than the US apparently has by comparison, but honestly what was the point of that scene? It felt out of place. I felt that the Gruppeknald scene was just there to feed Lars Von Tier's pervert ego. Trine Michelsen is only in the movie for this scene since she is a porn star. Not a big porn star, but more importantly she is the daughter of the most influential Danish movie critic at the time Ole Michelsen. Ole Michelsen is famous for saying he reviews all types of movies except the type his daughter stars in. Lars von Trier makes a cameo in his movie in exactly just for this scene, by having Ole Michelsen was forced to review a movie that has the director sleeping with his daughter. That's pretty crude. For me, the idea that if someone is broken. I should be able to sympathize with their horrible behavior that demeans a group human beings that are already in an oppressed position to begin with is just no. That ending did nothing for me. I didn't feel sorry for any of them at all. This is not an art for art sakes, or whatever they made up to sound sophisticated movie, it's Z Grade exploitation either desperately trying or pretending to have a meaning. Mange tak, Lars.

My grandmother knew that, and she took me to a production of the musical Oliver! at a local theatre. I remember it started and becoming instantly perplexed and enthralled. The first scene I can picture quite distinctly the orphans running around the stage, singing food, glorious food!. However, I had forgotten that this indeed was that musical; until I started watching. When I heard the song, it brought me back to that theatre and I became all the more excited about watching this movie. What is better than a movie adaptation of a Broadway musical based on a Charles Dickens novel that I saw as a child? Not much, in my opinion, although I was hoping for more recollections similar to that first one. What a shame. You probably know the plot of this tale but I will tell it anyway After young orphan Oliver Twist dares to ask for more gruel at an English workhouse, he is punished, runs away, and finds himself among young pickpockets in the great city of London. They are all cared for by a jolly man named Fagin. But Fagin's boss, Bill Sikes, is not so jolly. His whole goal seems to be making the lives of the boys, his wife, and Fagin more difficult. The musical is a fun and enchanting way to tell this otherwise dark tale. The songs are upbeat, though, in my opinion, not super memorable or catchy. The highlight was Ron Moody as the peacemaker Fagin. All in all, a fun way to experience the Dickens classic.

My grandmother knew that, and she took me to a production of the musical Oliver! at a local theatre. I remember it started and becoming instantly perplexed and enthralled. The first scene I can picture quite distinctly the orphans running around the stage, singing food, glorious food!. However, I had forgotten that this indeed was that musical; until I started watching. When I heard the song, it brought me back to that theatre and I became all the more excited about watching this movie. What is better than a movie adaptation of a Broadway musical based on a Charles Dickens novel that I saw as a child? Not much, in my opinion, although I was hoping for more recollections similar to that first one. What a shame.

What am I going to say about the film Roger Ebert has dubbed the greatest of all time that hasn't been said before? EVERYONE knows that this is one of the most innovative and masterfully constructed movies ever told. It was drastically ahead of its time in terms of cinematography, editing, sound design, you name it. But we all knew these things long before I started this article.I could certainly write a whole review about the acting, so naturalistic and understated for a picture of the time period. Welles is a revelation as Kane, with this marvelously smug yet confidential line delivery like he's talking down to you and honoring you with a secret wisdom at the same time. Agnes Moorehead is positively creepy as the loving mother who has completely turned her emotions off in order to do what's best for her son. Dorothy Comingore absolutely blows me away as Susan Alexander Kane, probably the most fully realized character not featured in the title. Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, the movie is full of great performances. Again...we knew this going in.I could speak at great length about the film's groundbreaking narrative structure. We begin with the end of the story, then we get a brief overview that lays the ground work for the sub plot that creates the structure for the rest of the movie. Then we see different, shifting periods in Kane's life through the eyes of several different characters who all have their own take on who the man was. This may not seem so significant in an age where film makers like Nolan and Tarantino regularly turn chronology on its head, but these men owe a huge debt to Welles for showing them how it is done long before they were born. But...we knew this.I could write a piece in which the central point is that Citizen Kane is one of the most quietly busy films ever made, rife with symbolism.
