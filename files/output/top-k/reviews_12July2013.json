This 1963 Bond film, pushed out a mere twelve months later when people went bonkers for the franchise's opening film Dr. No, veers the series into Cold War territory for the first time whilst maintaining a lot of what made the first film so effective. That is to say, the fictitious criminal organisation made up of super-villains capable of filling in as Bond's latest nemesis is still around in the form of SPECTRE; while tensions between the East and the West circa. 1963 are kneaded into proceedings without bossing things too much. There is a great dynamic therein as this quasi-escapist franchise finds its feet so early on without wanting to alienate its audience too much &#x96; to do this, one would need to veer the film too deeply into furrowed territory that toyed with a fear of nuclear war and this, it would seem, was not where things were deemed necessary to go so early on.This second instalment is arguably better than its predecessor, a more unapologetic film; a meaner film, a leaner and more complicated narrative involving set ups; double crosses and preordained traps on top of an affecting tale of the complexities of one woman's changing morals thrown in for good measure. The film carries with it more of a brutal tone &#x96; the body count is higher, characters of whom we have genuinely come to quite like are mercilessly killed off and the whole thing carries with it more of a sadistic tone. Take, for instance, the core villain pairing; who at once waltz around their offices thwacking the sides of chairs with riding crops and take time out to enjoy moments of absolute triumph over the enemy by abusing the situation and inducing power-exchanges not limited to the requesting of the recipient's begging of their life and adoration of the dominant's shoe.Where the previous film refused to show Joseph Wiseman's villain until much later on, From Russia With Love plays its hand in the opening scene when it depicts Robert Shaw's hulking thug Red Grant engaging in an early instance of one of those aforementioned games of sadism, pain and death. He is skulking around the gardens of a manor house in the dead of night. Whom he's stalking is James Bond, at least somebody who resembles James Bond &#x96; an individual whose rubber mask may create the illusion of the series' famous hero but doesn't necessarily have to reflect said man's skill in combat. Armed with a fibre wire to Bond's pistol, Grant is able to negate the surroundings and wipe the dummy out before the lights come on and the training exercise ends, thus emphasising his own skills in combat. Grant strikes us as more of a physical match for Bond, where No may very well have been the intellectual match but was not the physical threat to Bond once his empire had collapsed around him.Where Grant is the muscle, a certain Rosa Klebb (Lenya) is the sociopathic mind charged with organising base level operations on orders of those at the top of SPECTRE. In a film that takes its time to both preordain and depict fights between scantily clad gypsy women so that they may try to conquer the other for the 'honour' of being with a certain man, Klebb is a welcome antidote to questionable gender politics as she swaggers around her scenes and generally bosses people around. Take, for example, the instance when she first inspects whether Grant is up to the task of fulfilling a specific role Grant's oiling down at the bereft of a young woman in a bikini terminates the second this other female enters the fray and barks orders thus a certain engendered order is established.SPECTRE launch a plot that involves garnering revenge for the already deceased Dr. No, something that involves Klebb mischievously garnering access to an electronic device of some value that's already in possession of the Soviets. Furthermore, the plot involves a faux-defection by that of a young Russian girl named Tatiana Romanova (Bianchi), who has specifically asked for Bond to transport her to safety &#x96; device in tow. What most parties are unaware of, however, is how SPECTRE have designs on making a profit out of the whole escapade in eliminating Bond for themselves on top of selling the machine back to Soviet Russia. Bond (Connery), meanwhile, is enjoying leave with a girlfriend whom he met during Dr. No when he gets the call to report in. On a sunny day in the park with champagne and a hamper, the tearing of one away from where one lives and those whom one loves for business (business that will eventually see one deployed to a grottier and more inherently dangerous locale like Turkey) is apparent as early as this in the Bond franchise. More modern entries would be champing at the bit to get Bond away and gone to somewhere more exotic so that the adventure may begin.Adventure is still the buzz word, but being 1963 and at a time when the franchise was what it was, the adventure is structured and more interesting than usual. In Istanbul, feverent conflict between the native Capitalist allies and the Communist Bulgarians threatens to boil over without ever quite doing so, but SPECTRE exploit this and there is a genuinely engaging dynamic to each of the parties being omnipresent for each of their respective reasons. There is still a down trodden feel to things, like the world of espionage and such is unglamorous and quite dangerous; where the women are not meek, good looking allies but people out to exploit you - where creativity and care is required if you're the writer of this content if you're to create a believable universe wherein realistic things can happen but not to a too complicated-a extent. This entry is very much enjoyable.
