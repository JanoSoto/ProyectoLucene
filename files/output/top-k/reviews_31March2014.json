Why? Because this is a classic, textbook case of what happens when studios stop caring about making good films. This is precisely what happened here. Batman Forever was a huge hit, so naturally, Warner Brothers believed that making the next film even more lighthearted, would make double of what Batman Forever grossed. They also wanted the film to be more Toyetic so they could make more money by selling more toys. To begin with, Michael Gough's performance as Alfred is good as always, and in the film, we finally get a glimpse of what his and Bruce's relationship is like, also he has the best line of dialog in the film. There is no defeat in death, victory comes by defending what we know is right. I also liked the setting up of Robin and Batgirl's relationship. Sadly, these were the only moments of enjoyment I received from the film. Most of the main cast members are all excellent actors, but with the exception of Michael Gough, no one gives a good performance! To be fair however, I can't put the blame on the cast. Because not even the best actors in the world could've done well with such a horrible and shoddy script. In this case, no one came out unscathed, not even director Joel Schumacher. I can't put all the blame on him either, he did what he had been paid to do. However, I CAN blame him for certain things. It was his idea to make the film an homage to the 60's Batman TV show, which was the reason why the film was so hated and poorly received by both fans and critics. No one going into this film was expecting a comedy. This may have been what the studio wanted, but it was the furthest thing that what we, the fans wanted! At the end of the day though, I have to tip my hat to Schumacher, and give him credit. Not only did he admit that the film was junk, but he also apologized for disappointing the fans, which is something I really wish other filmmakers would do. (I'm looking at you George Lucas!) As for the whole experience am I saddened that this was the last film in the franchise? Yes. Had the film been good, would I have liked to have seen a fifth Batman movie and a possible Robin or Nightwing spin-off? Yes. In the end, whether it's films or in any other case, when money is the only concern, things will always end badly.

Comparatively, Silent Night, Deadly Night and Showgirls are the same way. Reading about the controversy they caused, the reactions they prompted, and the impact they left leaves a person more fulfilled than watching the actual product often does.Cruising was controversial as could be during its release in 1980. The film's portrayal of gay clubs and their patrons was deemed homophobic, and the film was criticized for having a narrow-minded look and attitude towards gay culture. Gay activists were offended, Christian-conservatives were offended, and I'm slightly offended because for a film bearing such meaty controversy, a relatively unexplored culture at the time, and boasting Al Pacino, this could've been such a treat.Instead, this is a film that's tonally all over the place, hints at subtexts and underlying ideas it never comes close to identifying or tying together, and feels incomplete all around. The film seems so set on shock value that it forgets other aspects to further fulfill its story. Maybe it's because I've been reviewing films for almost five years and occasionally feel like I've seen it all (and given the extremes films gravitate towards in current times) but Cruising's shock value seemed depressing minimal.Pacino plays Steve Burns, a rugged New York City cop tracking down a serial killer who is known to kill gays in the popular gay S&M community. In order to get into character and gain access to information within the gay community in a natural manner, Burns goes undercover as a gay man, frequenting local gay nightclubs around town dressed in black leather and suited up with slick latex outfits.The world of leather, seedy nightclubs, and homosexuality is portrayed about how you'd expect; dark, other-worldly, and often uncomfortable but not unrealistic. The booming bass of the club music and the exuberant sight of warm blue and black colors give the film's aesthetic something lively to look at. It's the scenes that take place outside of these clubs that are dreadfully tiresome and boring, turning in to your average suspense-thriller, a genre we kind of hope Friedkin would've done more toying with.Cruising has the original plot and the audacity to show us some pretty graphic scenes inside the gay club, but the suspense scenes lack any kind of a bite. The torture aspect of them is very slim and the entertainment factor is even lower. Pacino works with what he has (no pun intended), but even he occasionally looks cold and unfazed by this kind of repetitive material. The novelty of this picture is entirely rooted in the film's bloated controversy, and because of that, its reputation as an oddity from the eighties is probably the only leg it has left to stand on in present time.Starring Al Pacino.

Directed by William Friedkin. ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"31 March 2014","score":"","review":" Cruising is one of those film oddities from the 1980's that is far more interesting to read about than it is to actually view. Comparatively, Silent Night, Deadly Night and Showgirls are the same way. Reading about the controversy they caused, the reactions they prompted, and the impact they left leaves a person more fulfilled than watching the actual product often does.Cruising was controversial as could be during its release in 1980. The film's portrayal of gay clubs and their patrons was deemed homophobic, and the film was criticized for having a narrow-minded look and attitude towards gay culture. Gay activists were offended, Christian-conservatives were offended, and I'm slightly offended because for a film bearing such meaty controversy, a relatively unexplored culture at the time, and boasting Al Pacino, this could've been such a treat.Instead, this is a film that's tonally all over the place, hints at subtexts and underlying ideas it never comes close to identifying or tying together, and feels incomplete all around. The film seems so set on shock value that it forgets other aspects to further fulfill its story. Maybe it's because I've been reviewing films for almost five years and occasionally feel like I've seen it all (and given the extremes films gravitate towards in current times) but Cruising's shock value seemed depressing minimal.Pacino plays Steve Burns, a rugged New York City cop tracking down a serial killer who is known to kill gays in the popular gay S&M community. In order to get into character and gain access to information within the gay community in a natural manner, Burns goes undercover as a gay man, frequenting local gay nightclubs around town dressed in black leather and suited up with slick latex outfits.The world of leather, seedy nightclubs, and homosexuality is portrayed about how you'd expect; dark, other-worldly, and often uncomfortable but not unrealistic. The booming bass of the club music and the exuberant sight of warm blue and black colors give the film's aesthetic something lively to look at. It's the scenes that take place outside of these clubs that are dreadfully tiresome and boring, turning in to your average suspense-thriller, a genre we kind of hope Friedkin would've done more toying with.Cruising has the original plot and the audacity to show us some pretty graphic scenes inside the gay club, but the suspense scenes lack any kind of a bite.

Having watched it, all I can say is that I wished I'd watched it years ago.The Great Escape is the true story of a mixture of American and English soldiers who are being held in a prisoner of war camp in Germany during World War 2. This film chronicles their escape from this POW camp. I went into watching this film with no prior knowledge of how the escape was orchestrated and that was the thing that really impressed me; the sheer ingenuity of the escape and how methodical and carefully planned everything was. Each man brings their own strengths to the table such as James Garner's character Scrounger who is the guy who can get anything for you (similar to Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption) and Donald Pleasance's character Blythe who is a 'master forger'. Truth be told, I would have enjoyed The Great Escape even if it was fictional, but the fact that this is a true story is a real testament to those men that were involved.Acting wise I'd probably single Attenborough and Pleasance out as being the best, but that's not to disparage anyone else as everyone was excellent. This is another example of a film that has humour, tension and at times it was also quite moving. History had already written the script for this film so it's down to the actors to bring the characters to life and with the strong cast that we've got in this film that was always going to be a 'done' deal.I only realised after I'd watched The Great Escape that there was a documentary on after it which depicted the real Great Escape. I only wished that I'd spotted it as I would have really liked to have watched it (particularly so after watching this excellent film).This is a film that I would recommend to everyone. I knew nothing of the history behind this film so I found it particularly clever and entertaining. If you haven't seen The Great Escape yet, don't make the same mistake that I made and wait years to watch it. It's an important part of history and a damn fine film as well!

All of those elements make The Godfather Part II film making and Francis Coppola at their best.Set in Las Vegas,Nevada in the 1950s and in New York City in the 1910s and 20s,The Godfather Part II tells two parallel rise and fall stories. The rise story depicts the rise of young Vito Corleone(Robert De Niro),showing Vito as an Italian immigrant who gets into a life of Crime and becomes a Don. The fall is the story of Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)who is still running the Corleone family in Las Vegas but has to deal with betrayal and the family falling apart.The Godfather Part II is simply a masterpiece of cinema and is the greatest and most ambitious sequel of all-time that is not only an instant classic from the moment you watch it but also an amazing and powerful follow-up to the original giving viewers not only a great continuation of The Godfather saga but giving viewers the sequel to end all movie sequels. I won't say which film is better because in my opinion saying Part I or Part II is better than one another would be disrespectful to the two films because both are works of art. With The Godfather Part II Director Francis Ford Coppola has created not only created just a sequel but a film that is more epic with a bigger and larger scope than the first film giving viewers a powerful experience that never lets you go from the opening frame. With The Godfather Part II viewers are not just given a movie about the Mob,Gangsters or the Crime world but a movie about the on going tragedy,sadness and doom that hangs over The Corleone family while showing the rise of a young Vito Corleone. This film is probably more darker than the first film because when we see the fall of Michael Corleone and the rest of the Corleone family is almost like the fall of the Roman Empire. Unlike most sequels The Godfather Part II doesn't make the same story like the original but gives us something new and fresh with a great tale that is on par with the first film. The Godfather Part II is an epic film in the truest sense of the word not just in the way it's film but the length of the film(at 3 hrs and 20 minutes)but the film moves by seamlessly that you forget you are watching a three and half hour film. I think the film moves at a fast pace is because of the amazing storytelling that Coppola does with the film giving the movie a nonlinear style with the movie moving back and forth with the time periods but never getting lost in the narrative. In GFII we are given two tales about Michael's downfall and young Vito's rise. Michael,while still a don and running the Corleone family has become more ruthless and colder then he was in the first film further isolating himself from his other family members and becoming less trusting with the people all around him whether it's business associates or family where everyone was his enemy which leads to Michael's tragic fall. In contrast we see a young Vito Corleone,a man who is about business but is also about his family and friends despite being in the violent world of the Mob and Vito handles things with calm and cool style. When we see Michael and Vito the lighting is different with Michael constantly being surrounded by darkness and Vito is surrounded in bright light showing the contrast in atmosphere. With Michael and Vito we see how complex and different they are not just as Dons but as people. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is outstanding with scenes and dialog that is memorable and on par with the first film. While GFII isn't as violent or bloody as the original and doesn't have a huge body count GFII still has a few violent scenes that done with attention to detail and build-up. The ending of The Godfather Part II is one of the best endings in movie history because it's sad,tragic and somber matching the dark tone of the rest of the movie and the ending will punch you in the gut. A powerful ending.The cast is perfect. Al Pacino is excellent,powerful and at his best as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being cold,intense and ruthless in the performance. Robert De Niro is brilliant in his Oscar winning role as Young Vito Corleone,with De Niro being cool and charismatic. Robert DuVall is wonderful once again as Tom Hagen,The Corleone's lawyer. John Cazale is amazing as Fredo Corleone,Michael's dim-witted older brother. Diane Keaton is outstanding as Kay,Michael's suffering wife. Talia Shire is sensational as Connie Corleone,Michael's sister. Lee Strasberg is terrific as Hyman Roth,an old time gangster and associate of the Corleone's. Michael V. Gazzo is captivating as Frank Pentangelli,a member of the Corleone family. Bruno Kurby and John Aprea are great Young Clemenza and Young Tesso. G.D Sparadin(Senator Pat Geary),Dominic Chianese(Johnny Ola),Frank Sivero(Genco)and Richard Bright(Al Neri)give great performances as well.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is amazing and stylish,with Coppola bringing a beautiful and haunting visual style to the film. Terrific direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is outstanding,powerful,haunting and beautiful matching the main scenes in the film. Great score,Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster films,Mob movies,the first Godfather or movies in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather Part II,an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest films and sequels of all-time and is a movie that you will watch again and again.

While its an older movie,and about 19 years old,it is still such a fun and great film. I just love it, even more every time i watch it! Its such a great example of true love, and not the expectation of love, that everybody has nowadays,with looking for that great looking,young body,or perfect person everyday...It really is a fun romantic comedy, that should have life imitate its own art... ) I have seen it quite a few times, and just love thinking that happiness can triumph over all else in life,as it should...To many times technology separates us, further and further apart, with nobody really knowing anybody; but, at the same time, knowing everything about that same person without any friendship. This film brings out the true stages of finding love.Meg Ryan and her supporting actor,do an amazing job of showing how love can transcend through everything in life and in happiness, even with that already perfect boyfriend...It really is a great Romantic comedy to enjoy. Its so filled with laughs and romance,it really doesn't disappoint you... Hope you enjoy it as well. It really is a great and fun film...

So movies like Chicago Hairspray & Sweeny Todd are all because of this awful movie? Well I have another question Does Moulin Rouge still hold up after so many years? OF COURSE NOT! It didn't even hold up when it 1st came out. But everyone was amazed with how great and original it is. Yes there's nothing more original the playing songs we all know and love and reusing plot lines the even Twilight would laugh at. (auidence gasps) That right I said it. Twilight is better and more original than this. 1st let me say what I like about it. 1. The movie looks brilliant. 2. The Cinematography is good when you can see it. 3. As the movie goes on the editing does slow down allowing us to see how well the shots are set up. That's all the nice things now let's talk about the bad stuff. 1. The remixes they did aren't good and the only good song is Zidler's Rap. I don't know what it's called but that's the only good song. 2. The editing goes by so fast no shot lasts more than 5 seconds. As the movies goes on it does slow down as I already said. 3. It's loud, stupid and there's no dramatic backing for it in any way. 4. Satine wants something more? What else could she want? To be an actress? Oh yeah this isn't enough. Being hailed as a goddess, men wanting you, women wanting to be you, performing every night to hundreds of people greeting you with applause. Yeah, I can see how being an actress would be ENTIRELY different from this! 5. They use the word love over & over & over and they never explain what it is. We just know that it's really, really good and everyone wants it. They just say the word over and over more than they actually do analyze it. 6. The woman who gave the Duke the hint that Satine and Christian have been seeing each other. WHO THE HELL IS SHE?!?! She's not a main character or side character.7. With the Duke wanting to kill Christian why didn't Zidler get out of the business deal with him? 8. With Satine dying why didn't she tell Christian? Hell why didn't tell the Duke that would probably turn him off! IT MAKES NO SENSE! Hurt him to save him?! THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING I EVER HEARD! All she has to do is tell him the truth and figure out a plan together! How the hell is she saving his life if he's destroying him psychologically? What's worse dying with the one you love or being emotionally assassinated by that same person. So Satine's breakup with Christian is about as convincing as Edward's breakup with Bella, but thankfully, Christian is about as smart as Bella, so he completely falls for it. 9. Truly in love? That's such bullshit! (mocking) Oh, all you need is love lovelovelovelove...Who treated anyone they truly loved this way? Why would you slutshame her in front of an entire audience of people? Who calls that love? That's not love, that's bitterness! Oh sure, her actions are abjectly stupid and she's the victim of bad, stupid writing. But him? He's just despicable! He's evil! For as many times as he sings about LOOOOVE, he treats her in the most insulting, dirty, mean-spirited way that you can treat a human being. And the dwarf's over here like Oh, she wouldn't do that! and yet him, the one that's in love with her can't figure this out? Oh yeah, love! I forgot about that! That's right! I'M SORR...you know what, I'm not even sorry, but we're still in love. SO LET'S SING ABOUT IT! In front of everyone and everything's okay! Oh wait, you're dead. Awww. How would you feel if your loved one had some stupid misunderstanding that sprung from bad writing and then threw out all of their negative, horrible bile in one fell swoop...IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY! 10. So just as Christian gets done calling her every word for whore in the English language, the dwarf suddenly drops down and--what a shock--quotes more songs. So the whore he said he would never be manipulated by is now letting himself be manipulated by, it just so happens that she's telling the truth? Singing fixes everything. F*CK THIS MOVIE!

With a fun if not dark story, it goes along and serves to entertain and with acting to match the insanity going on in the plot of the film, you should enjoy the madness. I personally felt the film was firmly good, I did feel it was overrated but still, it is a good movie.The story is strange but good and what ever goes down in it is fun and bright and only serves for you to enjoy it. It isn't an easy story to predict either and with some quirky going's on you can't help feel thrilled by this piece. A thing that really stands out about the plot is that it's in this weird dystopian future where everything is done differently and you feel as if you have literally woken up in Terry Gilliam's dreams.Jonathan Pryce in the main role is good in portraying his odd character who seems to be the only one who see's how flawed society is, and with strong support from the likes of Robert De Niro, you can see why this film is rated so highly. The characters are pretty much all crazy and meeting anyone of them in real life would be a challenge, they are fun to see though and it always seem's that Pryce's character is put into different situations constantly and it is great to see how they all turn out.Terry Gilliam at the technical helm as Director and one of the writers makes this film fun and creates a smart feeling film, but I couldn't help feel that the script isn't that smart and I fail to see why some rate this THAT highly. I did love the sets and even when using small toy sets for large shots, it works perfectly and you will see what I mean when De Niro zip lines from buildings, it is kind of funny to just see the little toy fly down into the streets, the sets work very well though and pass for reality.Criticisms well, the story is very stuffy and chocked full of things to get a grip on and so if you started watching about a quarter way through, you would be already be lost forever. I didn't feel the British feel of the film paid off well as the film is full of Brit's(and a few famous from UK TV) but they fail to materialise into a hilarious film. One more thing is the overrating, the story is good as I have said but it isn't cutting edge and although the idea is cool, it isn't executed to perfection, and is why I didn't rate it as a great film as so many others do.Those who like Gilliams work will be superbly pleased with this as his quirky ideas and mind pay off in this to create well, a quirky story. I also felt that people who like a cult classic kind of film to be a part of, this may be for you as the film has genuine feeling to it and even the ideas can sometimes be used in are society today. People who want a straight serious film then don't see it as the quirkiness makes it kind of funny at times, and takes any serious Drama parts away for good.Overall felt it was Firmly Good but as I say not any more so than that. This is a film I feel you should enjoy and if you have seen his work before then definitely you will, but if you also want a crazy film, set in the future then this really really really for you because, that is what it is.

Despite being adsorbed widely through pop culture via parodies and rip-offs, sequelizing The Blair Witch Project was a tricky proposition. Found footage sequels are common today but the style was rare at the turn of the millennium. More importantly, the original film was self-contained and didn't leave much opportunity for a follow-up. Commerce would not be denied. Ignoring all these problems, Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2 was quickly thrown together and released a year after the original.The film starts with an interesting hook. Instead of directly following the original's conclusive ending, Blair Witch 2 takes the meta approach. The film is set in our world, were The Blair Witch Project wasn't a true story but only a wildly successful movie. Thus the film dismisses the found footage angle entirely, progressing as a typical, third-person movie. The story at first focuses on how the real town of Burkittsville was affected by the sudden rush of attention following the movie. During this time, a number of businesses popped up, taking curious tourists on tours through the woods. Among these groups is Jeff Patterson, who makes decent money selling stick-men and genuine Burkittsville dirt over the internet. His freshman tour group, composed of himself, goth girl Kim, would-be wiccan Erica, and married couple Stephen and Tristen, quickly begin to experience strange things in the woods and in the broom factory Jeff calls home.Though the premise isn't without promise, Book of Shadows squanders any interest the set-up could deliver. First off, this movie stinks of the year 2000. From the obnoxious nu-metal soundtrack, to the fashion and style, this movie reeks of the turn-of-the-century. Compared to the striped-down, stark style of the original, Book of Shadows is a glossy studio product, as crass a cash-in that has ever existed.The movie is also exceptionally stupid. The film indulges in so many late-nineties horror clichés that it almost feels like a parody. The film is inconsistently told in flashback, cutting haphazardly between the past and the future. All this does is drain away any suspense, since it tells us which characters survive. Upon entering the woods and coming to the ruins of an old building, the tour group immediately indulges in drugs. They drink, smoke pot, and even whip a crack pipe out. Despite one of them being a pregnant woman. As divergent as the characters' backgrounds are, they all get wasted. They wake up in the morning, hung over, their camp site wrecked. Most of the rest of the film is devoted to them snipping at each other in the broom factory, nightmare sequences that may or may not be real, and occasionally the characters trying to solve a mystery. Not the mystery of whether real black magic is happening here. The mystery of what happened to their video cameras.There's a lot wrong with Blair Witch 2 but the biggest problem is its shotgun editing. Throughout the film, scenes will cut away to incoherent footage of people being stabbed and killed. The characters are haunted by incoherent visions. Stephen and Tristen dream about having sex, which turns into them slashing each other with their nails. Everyone sees visions of a backwards walking ghost girl. At one point, Kim sees Jeff in an electric chair, his body sparking and twitching. There are visions of ghost kids, barking dogs, and bloody murder. These fantasy scenes are cut into the film in a spastic manner. So much so that they are frequently funny, like when one of the characters starts chewing on a dead owl. What level of realty this takes place on isn't elaborated on.

Jeffrey Donovan would, years later, find fame on TV series Burn Notice. I bet he doesn't put this movie on his resume.

She's the kind of girl you'd meet in college who wouldn't stop harping on one or two topics, even if no one else was interested. You hate people like that. Stephen Barker Turner is hassled with a deeply unlikable character while Tristine Skyler, as his wife, spends most of the movie lying sick in bed. Kim Director comes the closest to likable as the goth girl but even she is forced to do incredibly stupid things by the senseless screenplay.

I viewed the 1998 re-edited film, which restores Welles' original vision (some interesting film history behind that, too).There are already so many good, detailed comments about the film here - both positive and negative, that I will attempt brevity, avoid spoilers and leave you with my general impressions only.Welles' dark and atmospheric thriller explores police corruption in two adjoining Mexican and American border towns during the 1950s. The iconic opening scene is absorbing, tense and ultimately introduces the corpulent, corrupt and life-worn police Captain Hank Quinlan, aptly played by Welles whose over-the-top performance is augmented by some remarkable photography (and that is an understatement). A potentially solid cast that includes Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietrich turns in a decent, albeit non-stellar, performance; although, I personally enjoyed Dietrich's portrayal of Tana. I was intrigued by the fact that Dennis Weaver had a supporting role in this film and was looking forward to his performance. Unfortunately, my anticipation was not rewarded, as I found his performance extremely lacking.The film is a mix. It is a good story with some inexplicable gaps in believability. A script that delivers some really solid, powerful and highly memorable lines is, at times, lazy and amateurish. A brilliant achievement in cinematography, its credibility is, sadly, diminished by some very obvious technical lapses. Still, the overall strengths of the film are so great, that they overcome some noteworthy weaknesses.Touch of Evil is a masterpiece of black and white cinematography. It is probably fitting that a film considered by some to be one of the last, if not the last, of the traditional Noirs is the darkest and most 'Noirish' of them all. It is a must-see for anyone interested in the possibilities associated with black and white cinematography as well as photography, in general. And, it should be viewed by film students, fans of the genre and anyone interested in the history of film.I rated this film an 8 to assess its technical weaknesses while recognizing the greatness of Welles' creative vision.

I was intrigued by the fact that Dennis Weaver had a supporting role in this film and was looking forward to his performance. Unfortunately, my anticipation was not rewarded, as I found his performance extremely lacking.The film is a mix. It is a good story with some inexplicable gaps in believability. A script that delivers some really solid, powerful and highly memorable lines is, at times, lazy and amateurish. A brilliant achievement in cinematography, its credibility is, sadly, diminished by some very obvious technical lapses. Still, the overall strengths of the film are so great, that they overcome some noteworthy weaknesses.Touch of Evil is a masterpiece of black and white cinematography. It is probably fitting that a film considered by some to be one of the last, if not the last, of the traditional Noirs is the darkest and most 'Noirish' of them all. It is a must-see for anyone interested in the possibilities associated with black and white cinematography as well as photography, in general. And, it should be viewed by film students, fans of the genre and anyone interested in the history of film.I rated this film an 8 to assess its technical weaknesses while recognizing the greatness of Welles' creative vision.

I viewed the 1998 re-edited film, which restores Welles' original vision (some interesting film history behind that, too).There are already so many good, detailed comments about the film here - both positive and negative, that I will attempt brevity, avoid spoilers and leave you with my general impressions only.Welles' dark and atmospheric thriller explores police corruption in two adjoining Mexican and American border towns during the 1950s.
