I'll have to watch it again to see if it holds the test of time. It doesn't only fail, it fails so horribly that it generates laughs the way the worst of worst B rate movies only could, except with much cheesier dialog's and overall style. It's been so long since I've seen it, yet I can remember the opening picnic scene, where everyone's getting ready for the Mission, to be laughably cheesy! At this point I knew I was going to be in for quit the ride and it went above and beyond my cheesiest and dreadfully written dialog and storyline expectations. I vaguely remember the part when one dude floats off into space, but I remember enough to know that it should make the cut for worst moments in cinematic history.So I'm sitting there plugging through the movie, it's horribly entertaining, yet in ref to visuals and special effects it felt as though I was watching a normal budget type of movie, then out of nowhere the movie introduces the alien. OMFG! I've never laughed so hard in my life. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I nearly cracked a rib. I was crying and I couldn't breath. I wasn't the only one laughing. It was a combination of gasps of disgust and laughter throughout the theater. One of my friends said something under his breath as a knee jerk reaction along the lines of ahhh geeeze and the combo of the disgust and laughter in the theater made this moment epic! I admit I laughed harder and longer then anyone else. It must have taken several minutes before I finally contained myself, only to have the movie pan back to the alien again and I was out for the count in laughing hysterics once more. No words could do this worst moment in CGI history any justice, all I can say for sure is, they could have used one of the creatures in the bar scene in Star Wars and had a more realistic looking alien. You have to put it in perspective of watching a real movie for over an hour only to be blindsided by this alien. Anyways, back when I was in college I took a whole bunch of stimulants for several days and wrote this really deep complex paper. Then I had to demonstrate it to the class, and it was nearly impossible to interpret it for the class and it just wound up being this confusing pile of crap, well that's exactly how this movie ends, except it's not that deep, just extremely lame, although the writer thinks it's the meaning of freakin life! Lieutenant Dan essentially gets submerged in water, yet can breath, gets a sense of enlightenment over his face and the movie ends. This obviously sparked quite a bit of laughter in the theater as well. There were even several subtleties in this movie that makes it all that much more epically horrible. For one, Lieutenant Dan looks like Michael Jackson in this movie, which just gives the movie an even sillier feel to it. He must of had a bunch of cosmetic surgery done just prior to this film. Now I can't remember entirely if it's just Lieutenant Dan that looks like he's been superimposed in every shot or if it's the whole cast, but it looked like he wasn't able to make it on set, so he filmed all of his scenes in front of a green screen at his house and mailed it to the set. Since I'm on a star wars kick, he almost looks like he's in hologram form like obi-wan kenobi after he dies and appears to Luke as a Hologram from time to time. Anywho, if you enjoy watching cinematic tragedies this may be a hidden masterpiece. It could be long and painful as well, but I'm fairly sure If I were to watch it again, the style is so bad that I would be surprised if it didn't maintain entertainment value throughout the whole movie.

He wrote the scripts to some of the best Twilight Zone episodes, his screenplays for movies and other TV shows never disappoint. His novels are in high acclaim. But it all comes sliding straight down into a dumpster with this movie adaptation of his novel, Hell House.For one thing the plot of the movie or at least the exact mission of the people who are investigating Hell house isn't really sure. This dying old rich man hires a physicist, a spiritual medium, and a physical medium to go investigate this old supposedly haunted house with the expressed purpose of finding out if there's life after death. Okay, that's fine, but could you please follow up on it ? They stay in the house while the physicist conducts experiments using the mediums. Stupid experiments like testing one of the medium's blood pressure and pulse rate. I had no idea that whenever I went to the doctors they were testing for evidence of the after life ! The whole point of their mission gets buried up when the female medium begins saying that the owner of the house had a son. Okay ? So ? They have lengthy discussions and even quarrels over whether or not the owner had a son. Who cares that's not even the point of them being there ! Do you want to know why the house is haunted by demonic spirits in the first place ? Roddy McDowall's character says why in one of the most stupidest monologues in a horror film which amounts to sex, drugs, alcohol, and vampirism being responsible for the evilness. May as well throw in Rock 'N' Roll too. Couldn't Matheson have just not have told us why so it would seem possibly more mysterious and perhaps a bit more scary ? Could the answer have been more cliché ? That could be any American household for all we know. The investigation then winds down into trying to rid the house of its evil spirits. I thought this was about finding out about if the after life exists or not. Or no wait, I thought it was about the owner's son ?The physicist isn't really a strong character. He always has a perplexed look on his face and spends a lot of scenes lying on a bed talking or sleeping. And how does he test for the spirit life ? He hooks the female medium up to a machine that measures her pulse rate. I guess everyone in a hospital is part of an experiment to see if the afterlife exists as well. His wife comes along for the ride and is a totally throwaway character who does nothing. The only legitimate performances are Roddy McDowall's and Pamela Frankin. They're at least interesting. The film does have a decent chilling atmosphere, but nothing too scary happens. There are however good special effects such as when the furniture in the dining room gets thrown around at them, but other than that nothing too exciting. They find a skeleton in the basement with (insert dramatic music for the Puritans watching this) what looks like to be a bottle that once held .... alcohol (insert thunder and lightening here). Blood seeps out of a shower, but its revealed to be a dead cat, a perfectly natural occurrence. And an embalmed dead guy in a chair who was the owner of the house (who is Michael Gough in a surprising uncredited appearance) . That's the only way I can really discuss this movie as isolated occurrences. The narrative of this movie is set up as a journal almost. Each scene gives the date and time written across the screen. Just a minor complaint, but sometimes it'll say Dec. 23 730 AM. Then the next time will be something like Dec. 23 830 PM. What did they do in between ? Aren't you curious too ? Sometimes the scenes will go on with only one character or two characters. Where are the other two ? There's only four people in this house are the others off investigating or still sleeping ? It's never followed up on. And in the end they bring in a huge machine that sucks out all of the spirit life. What ??? So this entire time the physicist knew spirits existed ? I mean they have a machine that gets rid of them. He could've just told the old man at the beginning that yes spirits exist and there most likely is an afterlife. This is really a low point for such a great writer.

After a while however I found it grating and annoying. Why can he not learn to speak properly? He figures everything else out without too much trouble but speaking seems beyond him. Even if we assume that his species don't use the medium of tongue flapping and instead communicate through their minds this doesn't explain his awkwardness using a tongue, he gets to grip with legs, arms, eating, pretty much every function he probably didn't have before this movie begins he picks up in no time at all. OK, so he has those little head twitches which show he is not comfortable using a neck I presume. So why isn't he stuttering using his knee joints or any other myriad number of joints the human body has to offer. If this had been done right there would have been a progression throughout the film of him coming to terms with all the human faculties, but the ones they decided to let him struggle with leave us with an endearing? alien. He had the means to learn the language before he went to earth so why didn't he?The dark descent into ridiculousness continues when he uses his magic 'balls' to uproot a few trees to scare off a guy shouting at him, to bring a deer back to life, and of course the lonely heroine. He doesn't think to use a ball to knock around the guys beating him up at the diner? He doesn't have any sense of self preservation which is essential to the survival of any species, speeding through the lights even though a lorry is bearing down on him. They have presumably evolved to a point where nobody dies but this is inherently ridiculous, and just paves the way for some bible bashing for the rest of the movie about how primitive and barbaric we are. It's easy for him to give his self righteous garbage about no living thing needing to die since he doesn't need to eat to survive. Let's all be vegetarians?Then we descend further into the murky abyss of ridiculousness with him apparently being able to tell the future of his unborn son who was conceived only the previous night using at least some of his magic 'balls' I presume. Then we learn that the lovable, preachy, deers have a right to life alien is in favour of abortion. Now this is murky water, but I think the moral ground liberals propose that abortion is alright is that the baby isn't actually alive, but it sure as hell smudges the moral lines when you know the child's entire future, suggesting that yes, the child is actually alive but this alien doesn't care. I presume that this is how his species who never die keep a firm grasp on population control on their planet. Their generation has an iron grasp on life and they aren't giving it up for future generations for anything, not even the right to life that he's been magnanimously drawling on about subtly throughout. It's almost as if someone with a strong pro abortion agenda wrote and produced this film as a mass pro abortion campaign. I guess we'll never know.Then he magically turns a quarter into a small fortune without using any sort of ball at all this time, by going into the nearest casino. Must have been lucky I guess. That ridiculous government guy is as cheesy and as forced a baddie character as I've ever seen. Then we get some more sloganeering at the end to give the false sense of something deep and meaningful. The sheer lack of anything having happened in this movie is offset by an overly zealous government official who gets the national guard out of bed to give the audience some helicopters to look at. At the very end you are left wondering why in god's name he even bothered to come to earth at all. He didn't do or talk to anyone important at all.

If this had been done right there would have been a progression throughout the film of him coming to terms with all the human faculties, but the ones they decided to let him struggle with leave us with an endearing? alien. He had the means to learn the language before he went to earth so why didn't he?The dark descent into ridiculousness continues when he uses his magic 'balls' to uproot a few trees to scare off a guy shouting at him, to bring a deer back to life, and of course the lonely heroine. He doesn't think to use a ball to knock around the guys beating him up at the diner? He doesn't have any sense of self preservation which is essential to the survival of any species, speeding through the lights even though a lorry is bearing down on him. They have presumably evolved to a point where nobody dies but this is inherently ridiculous, and just paves the way for some bible bashing for the rest of the movie about how primitive and barbaric we are. It's easy for him to give his self righteous garbage about no living thing needing to die since he doesn't need to eat to survive. Let's all be vegetarians?Then we descend further into the murky abyss of ridiculousness with him apparently being able to tell the future of his unborn son who was conceived only the previous night using at least some of his magic 'balls' I presume. Then we learn that the lovable, preachy, deers have a right to life alien is in favour of abortion. Now this is murky water, but I think the moral ground liberals propose that abortion is alright is that the baby isn't actually alive, but it sure as hell smudges the moral lines when you know the child's entire future, suggesting that yes, the child is actually alive but this alien doesn't care. I presume that this is how his species who never die keep a firm grasp on population control on their planet. Their generation has an iron grasp on life and they aren't giving it up for future generations for anything, not even the right to life that he's been magnanimously drawling on about subtly throughout. It's almost as if someone with a strong pro abortion agenda wrote and produced this film as a mass pro abortion campaign. I guess we'll never know.Then he magically turns a quarter into a small fortune without using any sort of ball at all this time, by going into the nearest casino. Must have been lucky I guess. That ridiculous government guy is as cheesy and as forced a baddie character as I've ever seen. Then we get some more sloganeering at the end to give the false sense of something deep and meaningful. The sheer lack of anything having happened in this movie is offset by an overly zealous government official who gets the national guard out of bed to give the audience some helicopters to look at. At the very end you are left wondering why in god's name he even bothered to come to earth at all. He didn't do or talk to anyone important at all. You'd swear his mission was to impregnate the woman and leave since that's all he accomplished.All in all, a very average movie which I felt compelled to review since I don't understand the amount of positivity this is getting. Maybe Jeff Bridges nomination convinced a few people that this was a good performance and not what it actually is. An outrageously over acted and ridiculous film with every cheesy stereotype in the book for good measure.

I didn't really get into the story apart from there was a gang of mean people that wanted to control things and the main characters didn't want to give in to them. No grand statements or anything. No deep moral or philosophical questions, IMO. The choices were pretty simple and predictable.Shane's a mysterious figure like a lot of western characters, someone who seems to just float on through a place with no particular direction or goals and has unexpected connections to other people. I guess it's his benevolence, the way he looks out for the main family so much even though he doesn't seem to care much about his own future that makes him meaningful. I can relate to that. Even if your life isn't going the way you want, helping people that have the right kind of values or who remind you of when you were younger or what you'd like to be is inherently rewarding and healing.The music was nice. The acting was fine although it always bugs me how fussy the ladies are in these kinds of movies. I don't get why they can't just relax and make their point. They're always working themselves up and biting their finger or falling onto a bed with their arms over their forehead and then crying. Seriously, just do something or move on. I guess that's what those characters are meant to be and how the world was back in the day.The fights are entertaining but kind of silly. I'm used to the sound effects and the constant punches back and forth. The only variation being an occasional dodge or a moment where they grab and straighten up their opponent before hitting them in the face.This movie was also a bit slow and boring; it could've been much shorter. I basically guessed what was going to happen. It's still fairly satisfying though. Jack Palance was cool. You do get a bit invested in the characters and it's easy to see how you might be in their position, wanting to live a simple life and getting bullied by a bunch of jerks. Nice to have someone drop on by to help out. It's a bit like E.T. or Jesus. Perhaps there's some symbolism there. About someone who comes out of nowhere and is willing to make sacrifices for the good people.So I guess this movie didn't have any major flaws but it wasn't that exciting or unique. Just nice and simple, a bit heart-warming and entertaining. The way Joey looks up to Shane is nice, perhaps very slightly annoying. But I think that's a cool, precious thing when kids find someone to look up to. You hope to be a responsible role model for them and give them some of your attention. I remember looking up to people as a kid. And I can do lots of things now that I would've found amazing as a kid, except now my standards are higher and I can still manage to be disappointed or unimpressed by myself. I'm used to myself, I'm with me everyday. So when kids are impressed, it's a nice reminder to appreciate what you can do )Perhaps Joey inspired Shane. Gave him a little boost of life energy, woke him up. Perhaps it's a kind of karma so that innocent people can get the help they deserve from stronger, less innocent souls.

It's entirely creepy. A psychological horror. It is scary the whole way through. The Shining is even more chilling than the icy Colorado setting it takes place in. It is the only movie that I can say has truly lingered with me when I think about what the scariest movies are. Second off, The Shining doesn't just earn a 10 because it's so very scary. This is a cinematic masterpiece. A horror masterpiece. Thank you, Stanley Kubrick. The Shining is timeless. Every single scene is crafted exquisitely. The set of the Overlook Hotel is luxurious. Kubrick's direction is immaculate. Stanley's camera throughout tells one wicked tale from frame to frame, as it's always lurking and ever present, overlooking the characters themselves as if it's the Overlook Hotel watching them. What some people describe is 'boring', and 'slow', is actually setting the tone beautifully for the tensest scenes. The Shining's not slow. That's why it's so great. The Shining is a movie that I just love. It's so awesome. I do have a hard time watching it over and over again because it scares the living bejeebies out of me, but whenever I do watch it, I fall right back into it and it is so good. Jack Nicholson as Jack is incredible in one of the very best and most referred to roles in all of cinematic history. Shelley Duvall as Jack's wife, Wendy Torrance, is just as exceptional. This is Stephen King's best on screen adaptation of one of his novels. Kubrick's ending is superior to King's. The Shining is insanely scary.

Underneath this facade is a film that like a shark hiding below the surface waiting to strike at unsuspecting victims. I can now see why the late Gene Siskel described this movie as first class junk and trash.North is what can be described as a perfect child and has a perfect life, except in one area his parents (Jason Alexander and Julia Louis- Dreyfus). North feels his parents do not appreciate him or pay him as much attention as they should. We are shown this by his parents not paying attention to him at the dinner table while they are in a heated argument. This one incident leads to him suffering in other areas of his life, including in academics, acting, and sports. North goes to his secret spot where he talks with a man in an Easter Bunny costume (Bruce Willis) and then decides that he will divorce himself from them. With the help of his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz), a Lionel Hutz-esque lawyer who unlike Hutz from The Simpsons is very unlikable and unfunny. The other person who helps him out is his friend Winchell (Matthew McCurley) who with Belt is planning on using North's story to have children take over.North wins the case and travels across the world to places like Texas, Alaska, China, France, and New York, with the stereotypical representations of the people going from seemingly innocent comedy to downright racist and hurtful. North meets an array of parents including Texans (Dan Aykroyd and Reba McEntire) to a nice New York couple the Nelsons (the late John Ritter and Faith Ford). Along the way, North realizes that what he really wants is to be with his real parents and goes to meet up with them.At the same time, a subplot goes on about the illogical and incomprehensible plan of getting children to take over and put Belt in office. The kids act like evil geniuses while the adults are bumbling buffoons who go along with this or are so frightened by the idea of their kids leaving them that they will bow to their every demand. Their plan, even in the film's universe, is illogical and wouldn't work. Going along with this plan are strangely a number of adults, including a hit man named Al (Robert Costanzo) who is tasked with taking North out so he does not return to his parents. Al lies in wait while North finally reunites with his parents and is shot, only to discover that the film sank to the level of having it's events all be a dream.Another large problem with the movie is the character of North. North wants to divorce himself from his parents because he says they are selfish and only care about themselves and leaves the other possible parents he meets for reasons like they are uncaring like with the set of parents in Alaska (Graham Greene and Kathy Bates) and so on. All of the problems that North finds with his parents and the other potential parents are all with him, too. He thinks the Alaskan parents are uncaring when he just dumped his real parents and he thinks his real parents are selfish while he is an egotistical little brat who thinks he is the greatest thing ever. He leaves his parents claiming their disaffection with him is ruining the rest of his life when it must not have been all bad if it just started taking a toll. Also, all we know is that he wants to leave them after they would not acknowledge him while they were in the middle of an argument at dinner. He is exactly what he hates. This is in no way the fault of Elijah Wood. Wood is a quite talented actor but no actor, no matter how good could pull this role off.The film is littered with talented actors like Bruce Willis, Elijah Wood, Dan Aykroyd, etc., but none of them manage to save the movie or put in a performance that makes the film bearable, and you can't blame them based on the material they're working with.

Al lies in wait while North finally reunites with his parents and is shot, only to discover that the film sank to the level of having it's events all be a dream.Another large problem with the movie is the character of North. North wants to divorce himself from his parents because he says they are selfish and only care about themselves and leaves the other possible parents he meets for reasons like they are uncaring like with the set of parents in Alaska (Graham Greene and Kathy Bates) and so on. All of the problems that North finds with his parents and the other potential parents are all with him, too. He thinks the Alaskan parents are uncaring when he just dumped his real parents and he thinks his real parents are selfish while he is an egotistical little brat who thinks he is the greatest thing ever. He leaves his parents claiming their disaffection with him is ruining the rest of his life when it must not have been all bad if it just started taking a toll. Also, all we know is that he wants to leave them after they would not acknowledge him while they were in the middle of an argument at dinner. He is exactly what he hates. This is in no way the fault of Elijah Wood. Wood is a quite talented actor but no actor, no matter how good could pull this role off.The film is littered with talented actors like Bruce Willis, Elijah Wood, Dan Aykroyd, etc., but none of them manage to save the movie or put in a performance that makes the film bearable, and you can't blame them based on the material they're working with. The humor is unfunny and racist at times, the premise is hurtful and heartless, and the lesson at the end is one we could learn from watching the far better and far more entertaining film The Wizard of Oz.This film is the three H's hateful, heartless, and horrible. Gene Siskel described the movie as first-class junk and claimed it made him feel unclean. He was being too nice. North is a horrible movie that will make you feel horrible inside instead of heart-warmed like you were obviously supposed to be.

I am a HUGE Hitchcock fan, and have seen all but three or four of his 40+ sound-era films, most multiple times, and have a particularly soft spot for some of the less celebrated films like Secret Agent, Sabotage, Saboteur and The Trouble With Harry.'Notorious', though, has always been a puzzle to me - it's one of his most highly esteemed films, up there with The 39 Steps, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Psycho, Vertigo and The Birds, yet it seems to have none of the inventiveness, wit, magic and charm that all these others overflow with, well at least to start with. Where are the great lines of dialogue in 'Notorious'? Where is the great theme music? The unforgettable bit parts and fantastic plot twists? Where is the suspense? For the first hour Notorious has none of these, and apart from the celebrated crane shot (even that a pale imitation of the earlier, better one in Young And Innocent), there are few truly memorable set pieces, whereas all Hitch's best films have at least a half a dozen apiece.The acting, too, is below par, with the leads both stiff and uncomfortable and struggling to find anything to do with their parts. Cary Grant in particular is playing entirely against type, playing a cold, distant and unsmiling government agent with zero charm or interest. In essence, what this means is we get a Cary Grant film without Cary Grant in it. Which is not good, obviously, and it makes me wonder why on earth Hitch chose him for this role when there were a hundred hard-boiled character actors that could have done the job much better - and a lot cheaper - and perhaps found some corners of the character to draw out and illuminate. As it is, for the first hour Grant brings nothing of any value to the role, and one can only assume it was his box-office draw potential that influenced this strange miscasting. Oddly enough the only other film I've seen where Grant is so badly used is yet another Hitchcock misfire 'Suspicion'.Bergman is solid enough, and continually improves as the film goes on, but it is Claude Rains who really gives the best performance in Notorious. He hasn't much to do either, but at least he invests what he does get to do with some genuine feeling. He's not really much of a bad guy (another flaw of the film), just a man having his heart played with and broken by a woman he loves. The nicest twist of the film is that his mother is far more diabolical than he is.In essence, the problem of Notorious is this the first hour drags abysmally, and is just as limp and lifeless a film as Hitchcock ever allowed his name to go out on. If it wasn't for the names involved, it's doubtful anyone would find any of what goes on there to be worth any attention whatsoever. But after that it picks up astoundingly, with the bit about the key and the wine cellar finally ushering in some much-needed suspense, and it becomes a recognizably Hitchcockian film at last. The acting all round improves and deepens, the tension mounts and Grant's sex appeal returns. But by then the damage is done, considerably more than half the film is over and you only get to see the good bits if you've stayed awake that long. Maybe the people who rate it so highly only remember the last half hour.In the end, for the most part this is just another of those odd-fitting films Hitchcock made for Selznick when he first came to Hollywood. It has all the big names and all the money in the world to make and promote it, but little sparkle or imagination. Well, until the end, anyway it crosses the finish line in style. But is that enough to save it? Does that make it a great film? I'm not so sure it is. Bt then, as Voltaire so perceptively once said Fools admire everything in an artist of reputation.

A former well known radio hostess, wrote a self help book because she was so impressed\/disturbed by the action or should I say lack of action by a minor (perhaps as the story plays out) major player in the story. Please note; Dr. Laura's book does not critique the film per se, but nonetheless as the author herself states it was the motiving factor and driving force for her authorship of the aforementioned tome. Now to my observations of the film itself. I truly enjoyed the film, I also note that the character of Mr. Keating is that of an idealist as well as that of a cock-eyed optimist in an overly realist and conservative academic setting. He wants the boys to grow up as men and not as robots programmed by their wealthy parents as well as the aura and tradition of the school during this chronological time. Of course he is betrayed by some of his students (in particular Cameron a weasel and rat if ever there was one) as well as the School Administration and parents of the DPS club members. The School wants a scapegoat to survive ( ah the power of $$$$$$$ again) the parents wants a scapegoat (to hide the type of people they truly are even though they would denounce publicly such people) The villain in the movie is Neil Perry's dad who is trying to live his life vicariously through both his son's lives. He sounds more Jewish than Waspy in the my son the Dr. attitude. Truth be told I cannot watch anything portrayed by the actor who plays the father as it has poisoned my feelings based on watching this movie. While it may be wrong I am a victim of my feelings in this case. Neil Perry's mom is also to blame as she knows her son's POV is correct, but she is loathe to confront her husband tyrant dare I call him a Jack Boot Gestapo type I am the law father. Well they both paid as did Neil the ultimate price for their actions. The mother sits there even shares her bed with the old man and never attempts to stop the emotional bleeding of her son.

The Headmaster is an old dog of a man who sadistically relishes the abusive punishment he is inflicting on the youngster, and as he can not break him he (the Headmaster) is so frustrated and infuriated that he beats him similar to Captain Blye with greater gusto and zeal.

Finally, rent\/buy or somehow get your mits on the flick, especially if you are an educator!!!!!

To be where you have been or take the risk and grab at the opportunity and maybe lose everything? This is that story of the down on his luck boxer, Rocky Balboa, who gets to fight the heavy weight champion for the title. A drama that consists of realistic dreams and goals involving authentic emotion and struggle.Amazing as this story may be, what will astound audiences even more is when they discover that this story reflects the life of its main star, Sylvester Stallone. Before this movie, Stallone was also down on his luck too. He needed a break in a career and this is the film that shot him to the top. Stallone had been in a few other movies before hand but none that truly focused on him or propelled him to popularity. That was his chance to make it big. What helps make the story feel even more authentic is the fact that Stallone had wrote the story. This is why it reflects as a parallel to his past.In the writing, Stallone also includes a love interest with a girl named Adrian played by Talia Shire. As the movie plays out, viewers will see her character transform thanks to the charm of Rocky. Together their chemistry blooms into something greater and it's the sweetest and most innocent thing. What's also great about Stallone's writing is that Rocky has a very large antagonist. It's not the heavy weight champion that Carl Weathers plays - Apollo Creed, it's much bigger. That antagonist is called LIFE. Life is one of those things where it can seem like nothing will ever straighten out. And that's real, for everyone because everyone goes through a struggle in his or her life. Very few have it easy all the time.The cinematography and editing is well put together too. James Crabe as the director of photography took some very large shots that helped emphasize the magnitude of this match. Richard Halsey and Scott Conrad's editing is cut appropriately so that each sequence has a consistent flow. And as for music, Bill Conti's score to the film is so emotionally attached to the story it's hard to let go of the feelings that it evokes. Either when it comes to Rocky being alone with a light tread on the piano keys or when he's training with all the string instruments playing, the right emotion is emitted. All around and excellent drama.This sports drama works extraordinarily well because of how relatable it is when it comes to the struggle of life; how to deal with its ups and downs. And the moral is to never, ever give up. Every element works here. ","genre":null},{"date":"8 January 2014","score":"","review":" How many times does an individual get the chance to make it big?

And it's even less when the thing that makes you, comes knocking on your door. It's extremely rare. And if it were to come, what would you choose? To be where you have been or take the risk and grab at the opportunity and maybe lose everything? This is that story of the down on his luck boxer, Rocky Balboa, who gets to fight the heavy weight champion for the title. A drama that consists of realistic dreams and goals involving authentic emotion and struggle.Amazing as this story may be, what will astound audiences even more is when they discover that this story reflects the life of its main star, Sylvester Stallone. Before this movie, Stallone was also down on his luck too. He needed a break in a career and this is the film that shot him to the top. Stallone had been in a few other movies before hand but none that truly focused on him or propelled him to popularity. That was his chance to make it big. What helps make the story feel even more authentic is the fact that Stallone had wrote the story. This is why it reflects as a parallel to his past.In the writing, Stallone also includes a love interest with a girl named Adrian played by Talia Shire. As the movie plays out, viewers will see her character transform thanks to the charm of Rocky. Together their chemistry blooms into something greater and it's the sweetest and most innocent thing.

A nuclear explosion commences, and Zardoz is subsequently free from his imprisonment. Meanwhile, not only does Lex Luthor escape from prison, Lois Lane finds out that Clark Kent's other alias is Superman. Superman agrees to give up his powers, so he can marry Lois, but with Lex Luthor joining forces with Zardoz and his cronies, Superman is powerlessThis is almost as good as the original. The story isn't quite as strong as the first one is, but it is a bigger spectacle with bigger action scenes, potent drama, and a poignant love story. The setup to let Zardoz loose is somewhat lazy, but effective nonetheless. I won't carp too much, because it worked, but I would have liked to see a more imaginative scenario play out. It also does what many superhero films tend to do after the first one. it stacks on the insurmountable odds for the superhero to overcome. It works in this movie, since it is done very proficiently. The visuals are a tad dated, and the middle section does become a tad tedious, with too many comedic sequences with Terrance Stamp (Zardoz) watching him abuse his power by destroying things, and causing chaos, became a tad redundant for me. What makes up for that is the riveting love story between Superman & Lois. What could have been a superficial love story is done with panache, and creativity. They take advantage of Superman's abilities, and do a lot of creative stuff with the love storyline. Subsequently, I thought making Superman powerless was a great idea. It made for some excellent drama. Christopher Reeves has more to play with this time around. He had a couple of good emotional scenes. This guy is Superman, and nobody else could have given the part justice like he could. Margot Kidder is even better than she was in the first movie. She had a couple of awkward moments in the first movie, but not in this one. She's much more comfortable, and it shows. Her chemistry with Reeves was on target. Gene Hackman is solid as Lex Luthor. He's not as big of a focus as he was in the first movie, but he still has a substantial role. Terrance Stamp is good for the most part in his stoic role as Zardoz. His act got a bit old in the middle section as I explained, but he played his part well. The annoying Clifton James (Aka, Pepper from a couple of James Bond films) is equally as annoying in this movie. His part was otiose. The finale is one of the most exciting things you'll ever see. The action scenes are often breathtaking, and it never lets up. After a bit of an inconsistent middle section, it ends things with a bang, including an emotional ending. Final Thoughts If it wasn't for the middle section, this would be as good as the original was. That being said, I don't see how you could want anything more out of a sequel. It has almost everything.

This is true but it's hard to say whether the story of Bambi is one only intended for children. It involves childlike characters and experiences yet the story arc as time continues tends to become more adult related and a slight bit one sided. It's not to say children shouldn't watch it; it's Disney. There just happens to be more to the life of the main character than just living in the forest. By the end of the movie, a message far deeper than its premise will leave a stain of a memory.The movie is basically a cycle of how the animals live in the forest and how they deal with the seasons and man itself. It's a satisfying cycle although cliché none the less. For this specific time line, no age bracket is skipped. The stages of becoming a toddler, young adolescent and adult are all covered which gives each age group that views this, something to relate to. The segment of becoming an adult and finding romance is where it gets a bit one sided. This particular segment makes the female animals look like they manipulate and end up making the male animal putty in their hands. This doesn't happen in real life for animals or humans as easily as it's made out to be.There are two other things that might turn off viewers. Next is the music; Frank Churchill did an excellent job at the score but the choir in the background in most of the music may come off as obnoxious. It's good the way they were used to represent the weather, but it still may get on viewers' nerves. And then there are the dark elements to this film such as man, Bambi's mother's death and the final chase scene. These can be quite intense and almost leaps over the line of the family friendly to adult animated feature genre. Especially the hunters, these faceless dangers are the ones who speak the message of how dangerous humans can be. If Disney didn't own the rights, one could assume an animal rights activists group produced this. That's how strong the writers to this movie wanted us to feel for these forest animals.But credit should be given where is needed. The animation is great for its time. It still has the classic Disney feature feel and still holds up great today. Also the characters are very amiable. The voices to every character are very soft, mellow and calm. There are only a few times when a voice is elevated to excitement or terror. The child voice- actors that portray young Bambi, Thumper and Flower have the most adorable voices. The best voice of the rest of the cast is Bambi's mother's voice. That voice has the most gentle sound one could ever hear. Overall it's a decent Disney film; it just needs to be shown to a mature audience.The story of Bambi is cute along with his friends Thumper and Flower, and the music is done well too.

Of course, it will always be remembered as the film which first paired Judy Garland and director Vincent Minnelli (although he was the one responsible for the Our Love Affair fruit\/cake orchestra in Strike Up the Band!) and the film which moved her from black and white ingénue into one of MGM's most photographic Technicolor ladies. It will also be remembered as the film which moved rising child star Margaret O'Brien into the realm of Judy's past as MGM's greatest young actress and for the many beautiful songs which were written for it in its translation onto the screen. There's even the unfortunately short-lived but much loved 1990 Broadway musical version of it which had been trailing around as a touring production for years before being perfected for the Great White Way. A T.V. series was also developed years later when MGM moved into that medium, but nothing can top the wedding cake of perfection that is this salute to the early part of the 20th Century when state fairs (like one perfected in song by Rodgers and Hammerstein the following year) were must-visit attractions and courting was the way young lovers romanced each other-by gaslight!From the moment that Judy pokes her head out the window to sing her love of The Boy Next Door, you know that her future as a maturing leading lady looks brighter than ever. Gone are the Mickey Rooney Let's put on a show! films, and even if she does put on a show here (in an impromptu duet with Ms. O'Brien), it's much more believable, as it is part of a house party where Judy does more than her share of trying to catch the eye of that particular boy, played here by the handsome Tom Drake. Her parents are played by Leon Ames and Mary Astor, and if it is at first jarring to see the vixen of The Maltese Falcon playing a house frau, just remember that she had played Judy's mother once before in Listen, Darling!.Older sister Lucille Bremer was Arthur Freed's big attempt to create a new leading lady, and while she's a likable young actress, she seems lost when shown on screen with the magnetic Judy and the perky Margaret. Then, there's the beloved grandpa, played by that old rascal, Harry Davenport, and the family's cranky but lively maid, Marjorie Main, who dominates the kitchen (and her ketchup recipe) much like Mary Wickes would do almost a decade later in two Booth Tarkington similar stories, On Moonlight Bay and By the Light of the Silvery Moon. Ironically, in the big Broadway musical, another MGM leading lady of the 1940's, Betty Garrett, would assume that part, stealing every moment she was on screen.The story is a simple one Papa Ames wants to move the family from St. Louis to New York and their desire is to remain there for the upcoming world's fair. O'Brien goes homicidal, burying her dolls and killing the snowmen, which leads to a comforting scene where Judy serenades the sobbing girl with Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. It should be noted that the original lyrics of that Christmas standard were much darker than what was heard on screen, yet perfectly in tuned with the sometimes darkened theme of the story. Such is the case with the Halloween sequence where O'Brien must assassinate the town grouch by pelting him with flour. You wouldn't see anything like this in a Greer Garson movie!Once Judy steps onto a streetcar for the famous Trolley Song, you've got the stuff that show business legends are made of. The team of Arthur Freed and Vincent Minnelli produced and directed some of Judy's finest works, and Minnelli proves that he is an artist in every way, making the film look as if it was taken right out of Currier and Ives. There's a big rousing version of Skip to My Lou! (which features a young June Lockhart amongst its dancers) and a sweet duet between Ames and Astor who re-establish their own love as they watch their growing children discover their first.While the World's Fair sequence is only briefly presented in the finale, it is the dramatic story leading up to it which makes this magical in every way. Simple times, maybe never as simple as this presents, yet still lovely, and something many audiences yearn for today, just like Judy sang with Over the Rainbow.

It should be noted that the original lyrics of that Christmas standard were much darker than what was heard on screen, yet perfectly in tuned with the sometimes darkened theme of the story. Such is the case with the Halloween sequence where O'Brien must assassinate the town grouch by pelting him with flour. You wouldn't see anything like this in a Greer Garson movie!Once Judy steps onto a streetcar for the famous Trolley Song, you've got the stuff that show business legends are made of. The team of Arthur Freed and Vincent Minnelli produced and directed some of Judy's finest works, and Minnelli proves that he is an artist in every way, making the film look as if it was taken right out of Currier and Ives. There's a big rousing version of Skip to My Lou! (which features a young June Lockhart amongst its dancers) and a sweet duet between Ames and Astor who re-establish their own love as they watch their growing children discover their first.While the World's Fair sequence is only briefly presented in the finale, it is the dramatic story leading up to it which makes this magical in every way. Simple times, maybe never as simple as this presents, yet still lovely, and something many audiences yearn for today, just like Judy sang with Over the Rainbow. Sumstuous costumes, lavish sets and rousing songs make this a delight from start to finish which the newer generations have brought into their hearts and cherished to make a family tradition for decades to come, and hopefully much longer.

All hell breaks loose when their only son proposes to the daughter of the uber-conservative Deputy Minister of The Union For Moral Order, and they're forced to straighten out for one night to entertain their son's future in-laws.This film is hilarious and touching. I think what I like most about it is the wonderful contrast between the over-the-top, outrageousness of the characters\/story and the honesty\/genuineness of them, as well. Although, out of context, those two ideas conflict each other, somehow La Cage seems to make them mesh so perfectly. Albin, for example, is the embodiment of campiness, and probably the most theatrical character in the film, yet he's also probably one of the most believable and heartwarming characters, as well. Through the fun of all his colorful outfits and sporadic shrieks, the emotions and relationships he has display his natural disposition to love all others, an attribute that we can all understand and admire. The film manages to be hysterical, witty, inspiring, empowering, and altogether priceless. The American remake of the film, The Birdcage, starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, has its own redeeming qualities and delivers a humorous and emotive story, but is truly inferior to the original. The balance of over-the-top and down-to-earth, that I was describing before, just doesn't appear in The Birdcage; it's too over-the-top and lacks any real substance. Also La Cage is written so well and is incredibly witty that it's incomparable and irreproducible. This brings me to my final point; YOU MUST WATCH LA CAGE AUX FOLLES IN FRENCH. I apologize for the caps, but the message is crucial. Anybody who speaks french will tell you that La Cage, when not in french, loses almost all its wit, as well as the actors' audible dedication to their characters. Please please take it from me. I've seen the film many times and I recently bought it on itunes, and much to my surprise and disappointment, it was dubbed in English. I couldn't stand to watch the whole thing because no one language can be translated, literally, into another. I was so used to the french and it just wasn't the same. If you don't speak french, don't worry because La Cage is still brilliant, in french, with English subtitles, but the bottom line is watch the film in french! I hope this gives you some incite on one of my favorite films and I hope you watch and enjoy it!

The approach and the angle are something I haven't seen all that often, if ever, I'll give the movie that much credit. Though if the whole angle is meant to give you the heebie jeebies, can it be said that it's an improvement? So what's the story? Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Philippe) are typical movieverse rich kids. Wealthy beyond all reason, bored out of their skulls and horny as heck. They're also step-siblings, which is perhaps the movie's biggest problem, seeing as their whole relationship is built around UST. It's just about as uncomfortable to watch as it would be in real life. I got the sense that this uneasiness was at least partly intentional, but it doesn't really improve the viewing experience even if you get that.Anyway, naturally these bored and misunderstood little darlings decide that the most logical thing to pass time is for Sebastian to try and seduce a virgin Christian girl who has promised to wait until marriage.

Henry silences his baby and he and the dark haired lady completely dissolve in a pool of love. Within this exaltation Henry makes first contact with his Lady in the Radiator. For a moment he truly is in heaven, but as the beautiful dark lady and the all white girl retreat, Henry faces the heartless puppeteer, whose rage blows away the stage and who confronts Henry with the tree of knowledge.

And one day, I read a sentence. And I closed the Bible, because that was it; that was it. And then I saw the thing as a whole. And it fulfilled this vision for me, 100 percent. ~ David LynchLife's absurdEraserhead shows a man called Henry Spencer, who's trying to preserve his naivety, maybe even his innocence. His path is never straight, albeit rather printing a zigzag shaped pattern almost as if it expresses life's randomness or its fragile and shaky basis; a ground-floor built from quantum mechanical components. Reality or nature reveals its duality in many a detail and situation, and Henry seems unable to tell dream or nightmare from the real. Henry's path through life crosses many nightmarish events, and his inner world reflects the exterior and vice versa, as if the textures between inside fluently blend into the outside, giving boundaries the uncertainty of twilight zones.Behind his naive looks his spiritual mind seeks a light in this gloomy day to day existence. He works as a printer in a pencil-factory, but he is having vacation at the moment. Fatherhood and marriage do not bring any release or distraction, albeit enhance the experience of a mental confinement. He wanders about the origin of his desires; who delivered them and why are they no good according society? Life and its rules permanently torture him like the cries of his baby in yet another sleepless night. Next to his bed a denuded plant in a mound of dirt and a picture on the wall of a mushroom cloud of an atomic bomb explosion decorate his room. The atomic bomb called Little Boy killed many a human being, yet ended the world war II. The denuded plant resembles the X family's grandma in such way that it expresses the uncertain barrier between life and death. Does the plant in its winter state expose Henry's Christian roots; a promise of an afterlife? From within the robustness of the rock St Peter pulls the strings in Henry's life in a way that it feels lacking warmth and a heart.Henry's mind does not leave him at peace as his desires grow and grow. Then in a dream he receives a vision. The Lady in the Radiator reveals him how to treat these rules and bonds. When she retreats Henry experiences a nightmare in which he is lying in bed next to his wife Mary, who is giving birth to four umbilical cords. Afraid of Mary's bonds Henry acts according his vision and smashes the life-cords against the wall. Soon he awakes and he finds himself alone with his baby. In the very beginning, when Henry was on his way home carrying his groceries, his mind drifted off in spiritual realms about cause and effect, about the origin of life, his life, the baby's life, life in general? The man in the rock, the puppeteer with the ripped open chest, seemed to control everything, but Henry remained uncertain about the man's residence. Maybe he existed within his own grey matter only? The hole in the roof suggested that his place inside the house was taken by force ... a result of education and social control.Dream or real, Henry fully engages in an affair with his beautiful neighbor. Henry silences his baby and he and the dark haired lady completely dissolve in a pool of love. Within this exaltation Henry makes first contact with his Lady in the Radiator. For a moment he truly is in heaven, but as the beautiful dark lady and the all white girl retreat, Henry faces the heartless puppeteer, whose rage blows away the stage and who confronts Henry with the tree of knowledge. Henry becomes very aware of his sins and he accepts that this can not remain unpunished. He loses his head completely or is it decapitated by the puppeteer (mind the name of the actress playing Henry's lover - http\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Judith_Beheading_Holofernes). His animalistic behavior might as well been orchestrated from his stem or from a small baby-head as he seems unable to resist innate desires. The pool of blood on heaven's floor can no longer bear Henry's head. His head tumbles down from the skies and bursts open in the middle of the road. Its contents provides excellent stuff for erasers.

Waxflatter keeps repeating a word over and over before he dies, and Holmes decides to investigate.

Can they solve the mystery, and can they get back into school? In the Conan Doyle stories, Holmes and Watson meet as adults, but it's stated up front that this is a speculative fiction. Those who know Holmes as an intellectual, probably asexual, with not much in the way of physical prowess, will see that here, he is an expert swordsman and also falls for Elizabeth. Watson here is a chubby young man (as stated in the script, though he really didn't look it), very bookish looking and not at all adventurous.The plot is reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark in that there is a lot of action and adventure, as well as exploration of the cult, which has its meetings in a cavernous place with a replica of a pyramid, where its members wear costumes and practice mummification. There are lots of special effects during the hallucination sequences as well as in other sections.This is a marvelous film for kids, and I have to say as an adult, I enjoyed it as well. The final silhouette of Holmes is delightful, as we see the man he will become.
