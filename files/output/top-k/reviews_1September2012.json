[{"date":"1 September 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Looking back at the cyberpunk blockbuster, The Matrix is like a time capsule and culmination of the science fiction movies of the 90's. It's scenes and ideas have become iconic, and that makes it a classic, although more because of its importance rather than it being a great film in and of itself.The Matrix certainly has a technical brilliance that had a huge effect on the way action movies were filmed. And unlike the deplorable shaky cam aspects of the Bourne movies, the style of The Matrix at least made the action movies that stole from it a little more visually pleasing. The Wachowski brothers certainly created a world that was fascinating to think about and entertaining to watch. While their movie ends up not going quite as far as it could and should have, they made a visually groundbreaking movie that incorporates a lot of interesting and complex philosophical ideas, although the movie doesn't quite live up to the ambitions it sets up for itself.Other movies from the 90's had similar plots to this one, most notably Dark City, The Truman Show and Strange Days in the fact that the world that we live in is far different that what it seems. The Matrix is, of course, a computer generated world simulating the world as it was in 1999, when in reality the year is closer to 2199, with all humans plugged into the Matrix, and used as batteries for sentient robots that have taken over the world. That premise alone is enough to create a good and interesting movie. The main character Neo, however, also happens to be the Chosen one; the human that will end the war between those humans that have woken up from the Matrix and the machines that want them dead. The interesting thing about the characters that have woken up, is that they can plug back into the Matrix when they need to. And since they know they are in a virtual reality, they can manipulate it to be great fighters and defy gravity and all that good stuff. Neo, being the chosen one, is thought to be able to manipulate the Matrix even more than the other enlightened ones.Keaunu Reeves plays Neo, in the same vein as Harrison Ford or Bruce Willis, in that his acting is going out of his way to do not much at all. This is fine enough, but since Reeves lacks the charisma that Ford and Willis posses, it makes it hard to really care about him as a character. However, Lawrence Fishborne as Morpheus, the wise and powerful guru figure, is an excellent and enjoyable character. He gives off the air of calmness and ease in a world that is controlled by fear and chaos. Carrie-Anne Moss is also excellent as Trinity, the kick ass chick that Neo inevitably falls in love with. And there is also Hugo Weaving, who plays Agent Smith, a program designed to look like a human inside the Matrix that is sent to kill all those humans that keep trying to wake people up. He and the other agents have significant abilities when it comes to altering the Matrix. They can dodge bullets with ease, and can easily fight any human. Weaving is a highlight of the movie, giving a memorable and vicious performance.One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is the idea of making a choice. This is most notably shown in the scene where Neo has the choice to take the blue pill, which will send him back to his bed and he will never have to worry about what the Matrix is, or the red pill, which is akin to some form of psychedelic. Neo takes the latter, and becomes enlightened, waking up in a tub surrounded by other humans plugged into the Matrix. The direct effect of taking the red pill is ambiguous, and creates a layer to the movie that makes it both more interesting and more fun. Choice shows up throughout the course of the movie, especially with the Oracle, a wise old lady who lives in the Matrix and predicted the coming of the Chosen one to end the war between man and machine.Neo then meets the characters on the flying ship the Nebuchadnezzar, including Morpheus and Trinity, as well as other characters that end up being completely inconsequential considering they all die. The character Cypher, played by Joe Pantoliano is probably the worst of these characters. He ultimately betrays the crew of the ship to Agent Smith because he wants to be plugged back into the Matrix. Pantoliano plays the character as a total scumbag that is considerably unlikable. This may be what the Wachowski brothers intended, but it doesn't make for an interesting character. There is simply nothing to like about the man; he is like a neighbor you avoid because he does too much cocaine.The Matrix has its faults, but it is an entertaining and important movie. The fight scenes are a huge part of the experience, based on those old school, gravity defying Kung Fu movies. The choreography of the fights is exquisitely done by Yuen Woo-ping, who would later go on to choreograph the fights in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. The use of slow motion and it's bullet time effect, which allowed the characters to freeze mid air and look exceedingly bad ass is another very cool trademark of the movie.This science fiction movie created an intriguing world and an exciting story. Visually stunning and action packed, The Matrix is a fun movie to watch, even though it doesn't live up to its own ambitions, and the end becomes tangled in a web of convoluted silliness. It is none the less an important and entertaining achievement.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"1 September 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Looking back at the cyberpunk blockbuster, The Matrix is like a time capsule and culmination of the science fiction movies of the 90's.

It remains one of the most expensive movies ever made, and looks it. Everything was built full scale, and often shot on real locations. A flawed masterpiece is what it is. Though I love Elizabeth Taylor, and she is wonderful in many ways here, particularly in the love scenes, to be honest she falls down when assuming the role of queen. Her dialog is often quite good, but her line delivery lacks subtlety and variety, her anger always expressed in the same demanding, unconvincing manner. On the other hand, she is perfectly fine when she's just acting as a woman or a mother. A good example is when she notices her son's ring on the hand of Octavian, which she understands means her son is dead. Her reaction, shown in the eyes, is brief, but deftly communicates her thought process. That is the moment she realizes she must end her own life. She is very moving, getting the most out of very little. It was the kind of subtle gesture few actors could do as well.Her love scenes with Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison), are filled with longing for the future and passion for the moment. They are mostly superior to her love scenes with Antony (Richard Burton). However, she is exquisite in the climax as Antony dies in her arms. Taylor's death scene is also beautifully done, her final line, Antony&#x85; Antony wait delivered with elegant simplicity. The same cannot be said of the earlier scene where she discovers Antony has married Calpurnia and after a long pause, screams, Antoneeeeeeeee!! So yes, her performance has flaws, but when she's good, she's wonderful. Much of what makes the film work are its visuals and to Taylor's credit, she never gets lost in the pageantry. Her costumes are just as spectacular as it gets. THe gown of gold she wears entering Rome is particularly stunning. As for the visuals, they are mind-boggling, but the interiors are often let down by the lighting. The night sequences, and especially the final sequence as Cleopatra prepares for death, however, are suitably dark and torch lit, very atmospheric, but day scenes, like the many bath scenes, are lit like a 1960s TV sit com. Where would all that light be coming from? This is ancient Egypt!! Believable lighting for the ancient world didn't really improve for decades. When Ridley Scott made Gladiator he understood how dark ancient interiors needed to be. What Cleopatra has all over Gladiator, however, is authenticity of crowds, and no digital fakery. There are two spectacular set pieces that continue to amaze, the first Cleopatra's entry into Rome, and the second, the arrival of her barge. Both occur in bright daylight, properly so. We need to see everything clearly to understand the vast scale. There is a shot of hundreds of slaves pulling a massive Egyptian sphinx that Queen Cleo and her son are perched upon. The slaves step in time to Alex North's beautifully ornate entry march. The point of view is near Cleo, looking down on the men swaying back and forth as they tug the heavy odalisque through a large city gate. The crowd of Roman onlookers is entranced as the sphinx moves slowly towards the awaiting Caesar and his assembly. As you watch this sequence you begin to realize that what you are seeing is something no different than ancient Rome itself.The same said about the arrival of Cleopatra's barge. In this digital age, massive space craft and spectacular vistas are commonplace, but this barge was the real thing. It may pale in comparison to what digital effects can do, but when viewed on the big screen, you can realize what a different time it was. Things were real. Crowds were real. And Cleopatra is perhaps the best example of this extravagance. The film is a testament to another age of cinema.Direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is intelligent and forward moving, often accompanied with witty dialog. Many smaller roles are superbly played, Roddy McDowell's Octavian being a standout. And though it's common to tear down Burton's performance, he is perfectly fine as Antony. The problem, however, is the character Antony itself. He's a weak man, and he not only gives up all for his love of Cleopatra, but even battles against his own people. He's somewhat of a fool and he doesn't garner a lot of sympathy. Unlike Ben-Hur with the spurned Messala battling Judah in a chariot race, or dictator Crassus battling the slave revolt in Spartacus, in Cleopatra there really isn't any villain. We only have the frailty of human emotion. This may be more complex, but doesn't pull us through the story as emotionally. Cleopatra is basically two love stories. One ends with an assassination and the other with suicide. Not a happy ending. Still, tragedies are often more compelling than films with happy endings. So, as long as you know what you're getting yourself in for, a four hour movie with some depth and spectacle delivered at a moderate pace, you'll probably enjoy yourself. Mankiewicz got his original two-part, 6 hour film (Caesar and Cleopatra and Antony and Cleopatra) cut down by two hours to become a single film. That the story still plays as well as it does says much about the quality of the extant material. In spite of its weaknesses, Cleopatra does hold up. Viewers with patience will find the experience rewarding.

And like always brad pit is looking handsome and morgen is intelligent but kevin is a winner in this movie. when i saw this movie last night i wasn't thinking that it will be so intense like its review says on IMDb but just after watching it for 30 min. it gripped me in such a ways which words can not define. this is movie which you will remember for a lifetime and discuss with 1000 people and everyone will have the different theory for the characters but i bet on that - everybody will be agree on the idea and the intensity of the movie.
