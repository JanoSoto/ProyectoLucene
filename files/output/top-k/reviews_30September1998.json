That is, until we meet the woman of our dreams and that woman politely suggests that if we don't go to see Meryl's latest, testosterone will continue its rapid build up with no outlet.  So off we went.Unlike a lot of men, I don't mind a good sorrowful, thought provoking, dramatic movie.  What does get under my skin is one that is sobby, blatantly obvious, and melodramatic.  Surprisingly, this movie falls under the former category.  I have secretly enjoyed several Streep performances over the years, starting with her moving turn as the divorcee of Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer.  Further, Sophie's Choice was simply incredible. Though Streep does not reach these levels in One True Thing, she comes close.  Aided by the superb William Hurt, subtle and sublime as always, and Zellweger, who, taking a page from Hurt, seems to do more with her actions and expressions than with words, Streep shines as the perky Mom suddenly blasted by cancer.  Anyone with even a semi-close relationship with their mother will feel a twinge in their soul as they see Streep's decline from mother-for-all-neighborhood-kids to a helpless woman struggling with intense pain while trying to maintain dignity. You'll give your own Mom a slightly tighter hug the next time you see her.Technical criticism  Shame on the State of New York!!

It pulled through its long running time without me thinking of the time even once. It had everything a lone drifter, romance, villains, battles, heroic deeds, triumphs, tragedies, a goodly measure of corn and pathos. After the second viewing I decided that I didn't even really mind the ending, which I had first thought as just too corny. Somehow it fit. The movies metaphors, the sub-text, worked just fine, at any number of levels. Maybe there was too much sub-text for it to become a success. Or maybe the sub-text was just unfashionable. Also, critics have moaned about the length (as they've complained about just about every other aspect of the movie), but the fact is that it could not really have been edited down much further and still worked. It was a good example of 'just right'. It should also be noted that I'm definitely not a Costner fan. Still, he pulled it off and he did it well. So shoot me...

Kevin Sorbo plays Kull of Atlantis who joins a noble army and ends being King and also ends up being part of an intricate plot to revive some ancient demoness. I read somewhere that Kull, before its release, was edited countless times from a new director. Well that basically destoys the movie. There were more holes in the plot then there are in the Moon and none of the characters really develops in the movie. Tia plays an unconvincing villain, with little depth, and with cliche lines. The rest of the cast just drags along with the boring and overused plot. The only redeeming quality of the film are its sets. Otherwise I would give it a 1. The movie more than deserves my 3 rating.
