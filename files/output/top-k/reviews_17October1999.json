It had the feeling and emotion that I had only seen in one other film before - All Quite on the Western Front.  Terrence Malick created raw emotion or what I would like to call moving poetry.  What kept people watching Private Ryan was the battles and how they looked through the viewer's eyes.  But what kept people watching Thin Red Line was what went on through the soldier's eyes; what the soldier's felt in their hearts.I can't quite explain the raw emotion which I felt because I felt different about the film that my friends did.

I.e., the messages that Burgess was trying to get across.  But then I started reading reviews of the film on the IMDB and was shocked to see what other readers thought of the film's message!  I was shocked to see how differently I view the world compared to my fellow citizens.But anyhow, here is my takeThe first thing I realized after viewing the film was how there was no point during the entire movie that I actually sympathized with the protagonist. This was an unusual experience for me, and the only other movie I can think of which triggered the same reaction from me was kids.  Sure, there were a couple of times I sympathized with Malcolm McDowell, the actor.  For instance, when he had his eyelids forced open or when he was forced underwater for an unbelievable length of time while being beaten.  But I never sympathized for the character, Alex.  In fact, I rather enjoyed this trough scene, and as a viewer I couldn't wait until he received his just deserts.  I was eager to see him finally repay his debt to society, and was ultimately dismayed that he never got the opportunity to do so properly.While reading reviews, some reviewers likened Alex's treatment with getting brainwashed, and being dehumanized.  But I saw neither of these to be the case.  Reviewers also claimed that Alex's treatment caused a loss of his free will, which I also argue against.  Let's examine these accusationsFirst of all, Alex was clearly not brainwashed, and I thought Burgess went out of his way to demonstrate this.  Brainwashing is when the person's own thoughts are intentionally muddled and replaced by new thoughts.  George Orwell's 1984 demonstrates brainwashing through propaganda really well. But in Alex's case, it was very clear that his desires did not change after the treatment.  He was the same old Alex -- just that he had a permanent restraining bolt in place.  Kind of like mental handcuffs. (Remember when the naked woman came out on stage? Alex wanted to rape her senseless.  His handcuffs prevented it).Many reviewers claim he was dehumanized.  I must ask these people  was Alex human when he was terrorizing society every night?  Or was he animalistic?  Before the treatment, we was unable to sit still long enough to experience real human emotion, such as parental detachment and loss of friendships.  Afterwards, he was free to explore these emotions -- he was free to explore sides of his own personality that were previously unknown to him.  People who question my use of the word free should understand that he is no more free that you and I are.Did Alex loose his free will?  No, of course not.  He could choose to experience all the same things he could before.  Just that this time he feels the consequences of his actions -- immediately.  The idea is that Alex would eventually not want to be evil anymore.  But he never reached this stage of the movie, as his narration proved. Most people's free will is similarly limited also.  But my free will is limited by conscience -- Alex's was not.  The question this raises is -- would this have always been the case for Alex? Who knows?In conclusion, Alex's treatment was in fact, a complete success.  He was just beginning to learn that his actions have consequences.  He was learning tough love.  What he really needed at that point in is life was a true friend, not a droog, who could help him learn his true humanity for the first time in is life.  Someone who could teach him that in order to be loved, he must treat others with kindness and compassion.  This last paragraph looks like I'm sympathizing with Alex, which is contrary to what I stated above.  But this is not true.  I'm sympathizing with Alex's potential - a potential which was never fulfilled.And the reason it was never fulfilled was because politicians, in their infinite wisdom, caved into public opinion (fueled by the media), and removed his handcuffs.  The implication is that all was lost, and he's back to square one, and now less human than ever.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"17 October 1999","score":"","review":" I just watched this film last night, and when I had finished, I thought I had figured out the meaning of this film.  I.e., the messages that Burgess was trying to get across.  But then I started reading reviews of the film on the IMDB and was shocked to see what other readers thought of the film's message!  I was shocked to see how differently I view the world compared to my fellow citizens.But anyhow, here is my takeThe first thing I realized after viewing the film was how there was no point during the entire movie that I actually sympathized with the protagonist. This was an unusual experience for me, and the only other movie I can think of which triggered the same reaction from me was kids.  Sure, there were a couple of times I sympathized with Malcolm McDowell, the actor.  For instance, when he had his eyelids forced open or when he was forced underwater for an unbelievable length of time while being beaten.  But I never sympathized for the character, Alex.  In fact, I rather enjoyed this trough scene, and as a viewer I couldn't wait until he received his just deserts.  I was eager to see him finally repay his debt to society, and was ultimately dismayed that he never got the opportunity to do so properly.While reading reviews, some reviewers likened Alex's treatment with getting brainwashed, and being dehumanized.  But I saw neither of these to be the case.  Reviewers also claimed that Alex's treatment caused a loss of his free will, which I also argue against.  Let's examine these accusationsFirst of all, Alex was clearly not brainwashed, and I thought Burgess went out of his way to demonstrate this.  Brainwashing is when the person's own thoughts are intentionally muddled and replaced by new thoughts.  George Orwell's 1984 demonstrates brainwashing through propaganda really well. But in Alex's case, it was very clear that his desires did not change after the treatment.  He was the same old Alex -- just that he had a permanent restraining bolt in place.  Kind of like mental handcuffs. (Remember when the naked woman came out on stage? Alex wanted to rape her senseless.  His handcuffs prevented it).Many reviewers claim he was dehumanized.  I must ask these people  was Alex human when he was terrorizing society every night?  Or was he animalistic?  Before the treatment, we was unable to sit still long enough to experience real human emotion, such as parental detachment and loss of friendships.  Afterwards, he was free to explore these emotions -- he was free to explore sides of his own personality that were previously unknown to him.  People who question my use of the word free should understand that he is no more free that you and I are.Did Alex loose his free will?  No, of course not.  He could choose to experience all the same things he could before.  Just that this time he feels the consequences of his actions -- immediately.  The idea is that Alex would eventually not want to be evil anymore.  But he never reached this stage of the movie, as his narration proved. Most people's free will is similarly limited also.  But my free will is limited by conscience -- Alex's was not.  The question this raises is -- would this have always been the case for Alex? Who knows?In conclusion, Alex's treatment was in fact, a complete success.  He was just beginning to learn that his actions have consequences.  He was learning tough love.  What he really needed at that point in is life was a true friend, not a droog, who could help him learn his true humanity for the first time in is life.  Someone who could teach him that in order to be loved, he must treat others with kindness and compassion.  This last paragraph looks like I'm sympathizing with Alex, which is contrary to what I stated above.  But this is not true.  I'm sympathizing with Alex's potential - a potential which was never fulfilled.And the reason it was never fulfilled was because politicians, in their infinite wisdom, caved into public opinion (fueled by the media), and removed his handcuffs.

The group ethos of this film, carried throughout all the characters, is what makes it so good.  The grand conflict of the Davids versus the Goliaths has you rooting for them while at the same time recoiling at their anti-social behavior.  It really made me think about my place in society.  Aside from the plot, the visual style is surprisingly and shockingly funny; things others would just narrate Fincher shoves into your face as close as he can. Things get a little surreal sometimes, but not to the point of confusion. Norton and Pitt are an awesome combo, playing off each other excellently.

Our image of God is our father and if our father's dumped us what does that say about God? (Roughly Paraphrased) This is a film where the main characters and those they influence are looking for some sort of meaning, any sort of meaning outside of Ikea furniture. Brutal violence and monkish asceticism provide one way out of the hellish reality the film portrays. In a strange way the violence in fight club almost becomes a fellowshipping between men. A forum to simply let it all go regardless of who you are fighting. The film directly relates the endless varieties of self-help groups to the idea of  fight club. In a way they are the same. Both attempt to purge by sharing communal pain and letting go of inhibitions.     The fight clubs touch a chord and quickly swing wildly out of control spreading like a cancer throughout the nation. The members of fight club become like pods from invasion of the body snatchers - human in form, alien in nature. This film suggests that the masses are so desperate for meaning beyond popular entertainment and yuppie culture that they will do anything to find it. They will die to themselves and live only for the cause. Using the medium of film seems an odd choice to convey this message, since it is effectively incriminating itself. However, the film makers self-conscious style suggest that they are aware of the irony and perhaps the film itself is a comment on the impossibility of organizing a secret society dedicated against the all principles of society. It is just as useless as making a pop film about the emptiness of popular culture. The irony of hearing Brad Pitt say that not every one can be a movie god or a rock star hints at this paradox central to the film.          Ultimately, the film is an entertaining vehicle that conveys the hopelessness that seems so widespread in society today. As Tyler Durden says this generation has no great war and we have no great depression. WE only have a spiritual war and our lives are a great depression. A generation with no more purpose, no more struggles, with peace without effort will create it's own struggle even if it's just a bunch of guys beating each other to near death.      This film does not cop out. Even if you disagree violently with it, Fight Club forces you come up with your own position on the issues it raises and for that fact alone, you should see it.

It may that things didn't translate well from the book... I'll have to read it to find out.I think that Fincher has learned a lot with respect to directing actors.  I walked out of Seven asking myself if that was really Morgan Freeman on the screen or some impostor.  The Game was saved by the overwhelming talent\/personality of Sean Penn and Michael Douglas, especially Penn, who is a genius.  In Fight Club, Pitt was good and his comic timing was definitely on.  But, I'm convinced that Pitt's best role will always be the stoner in True Romance.  Norton, whose performance in Primal Fear blew me away, was just kind of blah here.

I wonder if this film would have ever been released if it was not for the current trend in cult releases on DVD and tape. It may not be the best movie ever made, but it is definitely one of the best fantasy films of modern cinema. Sure, maybe some of the effects may be dated by today's standards or the film may have been marketed for children, but ... who cares? The work on the design of this production alone should have won it several awards, David Bowie's performance still stands out as incredible, and the story itself is a lot deeper than most will admit. But hey, at least that fact has not hurt the film's popularity. Only something as well done as this could withstand the tests of time in a film industry like ours.Regardless of anyone who might disagree as to how good or bad Labyrinth is, no one can deny it's power to generate a fan base that could survive without any means to purchase a copy for so long. Only something that can touch people's hearts and minds could do something like that. The eighties heralded so many well done fantasy productions that I wish it would become a filmmaking trend again someday. Labyrinth, The Never Ending Story, The Princess Bride, Return to Oz, and Legend were truly some of the most painstakingly detailed, amazingly directed, and beautifully scored films that I can think of. I may have originally viewed them as a young child, but over the years not one of them has disappeared from my memories. As one grows older one forgets the unmemorable, but not works of art like these. After just viewing Labyrinth again, I can see that even though I've grown and I've learned many things about filmmaking itself, this movie still amazes me. Even if some have a problem with the pace or are avid haters of muppets, they should sit down and give this film a chance. At times it almost seems as if the characters in the film are just walking through a wonderfully done canvas of colors, and I am not talking about the matte paintings. There are points where the viewer just forgets that they are even viewing a film and become mesmerized by the music, visuals, and feel of Labyrinth. One might think that Bowie's music, having been a fad of the eighties, would have also been awkward after a decade or so, but that is not the case either. The music just seems to fit as if it were never part of the real world at all but just more of what one would expect from mischievous goblins out to have fun or Jareth's attempts at wooing the heroine. If I had to pick one thing about this film that will truly leave anyone in awe, it is the ballroom sequence. I have not seen many films in my life that have given a feel of a hypnotizing dream like Frank Oz and Jim Henson did in that scene. The symbolism equally matched with a romanticized score, perfectly timed dance choreography and unbelievable costume designing make for one of the grandest scenes I have ever viewed.I'm very happy that now after more than a decade, this film has been restored and given a chance at new life. Maybe now more will learn of it and give it the appreciation it deserves.

Labyrinth, The Never Ending Story, The Princess Bride, Return to Oz, and Legend were truly some of the most painstakingly detailed, amazingly directed, and beautifully scored films that I can think of. I may have originally viewed them as a young child, but over the years not one of them has disappeared from my memories. As one grows older one forgets the unmemorable, but not works of art like these. After just viewing Labyrinth again, I can see that even though I've grown and I've learned many things about filmmaking itself, this movie still amazes me. Even if some have a problem with the pace or are avid haters of muppets, they should sit down and give this film a chance. At times it almost seems as if the characters in the film are just walking through a wonderfully done canvas of colors, and I am not talking about the matte paintings. There are points where the viewer just forgets that they are even viewing a film and become mesmerized by the music, visuals, and feel of Labyrinth. One might think that Bowie's music, having been a fad of the eighties, would have also been awkward after a decade or so, but that is not the case either. The music just seems to fit as if it were never part of the real world at all but just more of what one would expect from mischievous goblins out to have fun or Jareth's attempts at wooing the heroine. If I had to pick one thing about this film that will truly leave anyone in awe, it is the ballroom sequence. I have not seen many films in my life that have given a feel of a hypnotizing dream like Frank Oz and Jim Henson did in that scene. The symbolism equally matched with a romanticized score, perfectly timed dance choreography and unbelievable costume designing make for one of the grandest scenes I have ever viewed.I'm very happy that now after more than a decade, this film has been restored and given a chance at new life. Maybe now more will learn of it and give it the appreciation it deserves.

I mean, look at the title, could it be any less creative?  As it turns out, I was dead wrong.  Fight Club is the best movie I have seen in quite a long time.After seeing the movie, I looked for reviews and continually found people who did not like the plot twist at the end.  I personally think that it was the best part.  The first half of the movie for me seemed to be long winded and not really going anywhere.  The story didn't really come alive until the twist was revealed.  Once that happened, it made you think of all that happened in the first part that you may not have picked up on or saw differently before.  This made the whole movie experience exponentially more interesting.Maybe I liked this movie because I like the kind of plot twist\/unforeseen ending that I first saw in movies like The Usual Suspects (my favorite movie).  Now, the absolute ending was a bit implausible, but it did not in any way detract from the whole.  The ending cinematic was great and the plot twist, totally unexpected, made the movie what it is The best of the year. Otherwise it would just be a bunch of guys beating the **** out of each other.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"17 October 1999","score":"","review":"  When 'welcome to the dollhouse' (which I didn't particularly even like) and other similar movies in which the characters began to consider their personal condition more began to gain popularity, I was really into that. I was sick of the blockbuster phenomena and was glad that films like 'clerks' were becoming accessible.  However, through time, more and more and more and more of these movies came out and next thing I knew, America was ga-ga for self-indulgent film-making.  Which I don't think is wrong, but I think the manner in which it is done on 'american beauty' is a bit (a) melodramatic and (b) copied.  'American Beauty' is an amalgamation of, follow me here closely, happiness, office space and ordinary people.  In previous reviews, people mentioned annette bening's character being similar to mary tyler moore's character in 'ordinary people'--but I find that the family next door was closer to that of timothy hutton on 'o.p.'  The neighbour's father in this one (I'm awful with names) is more like mary tyler moore's character though he may have a bit of the father from 'shine' in him as well.  I did not dislike this movie necessarily, but I felt ...and still feel...that this movie is the defining film where people will say years from now, Boy, that american beauty sure did destroy the arty nihilistic films of the 90s.  It took what was more significant in indepedent film and blew it wide open for the backstreet boys generation.  The relationships were poorly developed, the dialogue was stilted, and the misunderstood artist characters are overdone.  It wasn't a bad movie--it really wasn't--but these angsty films are becoming too commonplace...   oh well, at least they're better than 'strange days.'
