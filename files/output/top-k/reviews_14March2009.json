[{"date":"14 March 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" To be fair I watched this movie before I watched the original story. This movie is convincing mostly because of the story line. It sounds like tall tales. In other words, not convincing as the original Planet of the Apes which do deserve an 8. This one is one of those movie I won't recommend my friends to watch except for the beginning ape chase scenes. The story falls on a couple of things that makes it difficult to accept. Time traveling through the future in an electrical storm in space seems too far fetched compared to the original movie, which traveled near light speed. The fact that the space station had a couple of space pod and Standard Operating Procedures, it's unlikely that any space station would be traveling around chasing space pods lost in electrical storms. Space stations' aren't built for chasing or rescue missions. They could have sent a couple of space pods, with a chimp is more plausible. The fact that humans became a slave, and yet they can speak English and talk, makes it unconvincing compared to the original movie which they aren't able to talk as the Apes are convinced that humans are unintelligent. The original movie the Apes assume humans to be stupid since they can't communicate is a more convincing story. The ending of the movie, I believe spoiled the movie completely and this is where the scoring is bad. In any good movie there are three things that's is key to scoring. The plausibility of the story, the beginning movie to pull us into the story, the ending that wraps up the entire move is the most important. The story fails on plausibility as mentioned here. Why are humans too passive is unconvincing. The fact that humans in this movie has no capacity to use weapons and being unorganized is very unconvincing. Humans are well known to be organized in times like these. The ending is really hard to rationalized into the story and no plausibility at all. It creates a Pandora's box. So if I were a movie producer and I was to do something different, time traveling through a wormhole, a black hole is more convincing, if we want to add to the old original story. The fact that a small space pod to travel long distance is unconvincing also even with all the technology in this movie. A human slavery is only possible through greater limitations of freedom as in concentration camps conditions is more convincing I believe, or the fact that the humans brains were neutered into stupidity, as in the removal of frontal lobe is another possibility. The fact that human slave they became a butler and a maid is an unintentional comedy and too unbelievable. The fact that they put humans in wood cage and to assume humans are too stupid to find a way to break those bamboo wood sounds unrealistic. Humans intelligence couldn't be that stupid given a slight 2000 years or more of evolution. I can continue to criticized this movie because of it's many mistake. In my opinion the movie compares slightly better than Snakes on the Plane movie. You can make another Planet of the Apes...if the story line is a plausible one, I believe and make some of the fixes mentioned here. As you noticed directors in general ignore good story writing but in animations where changes are very difficult and costly, a good story is much more possible. This is why Pixar Studios and Disney have such an impressive list of classic movies in spite of the fat that its a cartoon. While story writing can be written on the fly, it is this reason why Xanadu flopped, or in more recent one Disaster Movie was a complete flopped. The movie was made before the story and they had no idea as to the title of the movie.

Well as it turns out, none of this is true. The original scripts, characters and plot were so different in the original journal of the whills story, there is no way they could link up to anything created around the 1977 version of Star Wars.The thing that made star wars was not only the attention to detail in the scenes, weapons and ships, but as well the characters.

The point is, we had all the characters of our dreams all smashed into one movie with some great realistic special effects. The sad thing is, this makes Lucas out NOT to be the genius everyone thinks he is, because it took a LOT of evolution for these characters to form into the ones we see on the screen and as well a lot of input from people surrounding Lucas.

Brilliant case of deductive reasoning, don't you think, Schultz? LONG AGO we swore off of any most movies that had those telltale Roman Numerals in their titles. Admittedly, there have been some very well done, enjoyable, $ucce$$ful and Critically Acclaimed picture that continued the story begun in a successful film; but they're the exceptions to the rule. It certainly seems to be unimpeachable evidence that for every BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, THE GODFATHER PART II or THE EMPIIRE STRIKES BACK there are so many continuances such as THE FRENCH CONNECTION II, JAWS II & assorted siblings, SON OF KONG, SUPERMAN III and BELLES ON THEIR TOES.*ONE COLD Winter's night not so very long ago we fell off the sequels wagon; as there was nothing at all interesting on the 300 or so Cable Channels that were available, so we settled on this DEATH WISH II (Multiple Companies**\/Columbia Pictures Corporation, 1982). Well, we watched out of desperation and a heightened sense of curiosity; if nothing else. After all, we were now considered to be some kind of half-fast Movie Reviewer and besides, in an attempt to remain 'up' and positive, we were valiantly trying to see something good everywhere.WELL in observing the cinematic pot-boiler & coat tails rider, we were inclined to be more analytical; even in this the first (and last) viewing. Familiarity with and knowledge of the original left us few surprises and none of the emotional range of the one and only, original DEATH WISH (Dino De Laurentis Pictures\/Paramount Pictures, 1974).FIRST OF ALL, the ending of the original depicted Paul Kersey (Mr. Charles Bronson) leaving NYC and arriving in the Windy City. As he was disembarking the 20th Century Limited (or the Super Chief), the passenger train in Chicago's Union Station, he observes some street gang-type punks knocking the luggage from the hands of a helpless lady passenger. As the film fades out, the camera zeroes-in on and freezes a tight shot of Mr. Kersey delightfully sighting his hand as a pistol delivering an imaginary & symbolic bullet to the unsuspecting and unaware street scum.SO WHAT is it about our town, Mr. Big Shot Hollywood Tycoon? Does it smell or something? After all, we were rightfully anticipating seeing what Mr. Kersey's Vigilante could do with our fair city; besides, the Union Stock Yards are long gone. THEN, you have this sudden and unexpected switch of venues to Los Angeles. We know that they could use Mr. Bronson's machismo and marksmanship in La-La Land too, but you promised! (There, Schultz and meself just had to get that off of our chests!) ONCE established in the West Coast Office of his Architectural Company, Mr. Kersey starts out to clean up the new town. He sets out as before with his concealed fire arm to seek out, hunt and destroy the enemy street thugs that haunt our streets; wherever we may live.BUT IN THIS second DEATH WISH outing, Kersey's role is modified from the former. In the original screen story, his modus operandi was one of a decoy. He would put himself in dangerous situations; so as to invite attackers to try to take him in robbery. Once the offender(s) were zeroing in for the kill, they were shot. Mr. Kersey then split the scene.THE NEW IMPROVED VIGILANTE of this sequel seems to be more in the tradition of the Super Hero. Much like Batman or Mighty Mouse, Kersey would come in to save the day in various assorted Robberies and Rapes in progress. His escapes from the scene seemed less convincing in Los Angeles' much more spread out cityscapes than in the Big Apple's densely packed asphalt & concrete jungles. Somehow eluding detection and capture are decidedly much more plausible in the act of ducking down into the subway than waiting for a public transit bus at a street bus stop.APPARENTLY following in the tradition of Lieutenant Gerard from THE FUGITIVE TV Series, the N.Y.P.D. Chief of Detectives Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) tracks Kersey all the way out there to the West Coast. Much like Gotham City's Chief O'Hara & Company; he's always arriving just a little too late.CARRY OVERS from the original were few. Other than Mr. Vincent Gardenia, we are only to find Director, Michael Winner; whose work here seems to have little resemblance to the dark, gritty and horrifying work on the real DEATH WISH. Joining Charles Bronson in this cast are Miss Jill Ireland (Mrs. Bronson in real life), J.D. Cannon, Anthony Franciosa, Robin Sherwood and even a very young Laurence Fishburne.ME AND ME BUDDY, SCHULTZ are still smiling about watching this on that winters night; a reaction, we assure you, that no one had any such feelings and emotions in seeing the original film.OUR VERDICT make like a hopscotch girl and skip it!

Familiarity with and knowledge of the original left us few surprises and none of the emotional range of the one and only, original DEATH WISH (Dino De Laurentis Pictures\/Paramount Pictures, 1974).FIRST OF ALL, the ending of the original depicted Paul Kersey (Mr. Charles Bronson) leaving NYC and arriving in the Windy City. As he was disembarking the 20th Century Limited (or the Super Chief), the passenger train in Chicago's Union Station, he observes some street gang-type punks knocking the luggage from the hands of a helpless lady passenger. As the film fades out, the camera zeroes-in on and freezes a tight shot of Mr. Kersey delightfully sighting his hand as a pistol delivering an imaginary & symbolic bullet to the unsuspecting and unaware street scum.SO WHAT is it about our town, Mr. Big Shot Hollywood Tycoon? Does it smell or something? After all, we were rightfully anticipating seeing what Mr. Kersey's Vigilante could do with our fair city; besides, the Union Stock Yards are long gone. THEN, you have this sudden and unexpected switch of venues to Los Angeles. We know that they could use Mr. Bronson's machismo and marksmanship in La-La Land too, but you promised! (There, Schultz and meself just had to get that off of our chests!) ONCE established in the West Coast Office of his Architectural Company, Mr. Kersey starts out to clean up the new town. He sets out as before with his concealed fire arm to seek out, hunt and destroy the enemy street thugs that haunt our streets; wherever we may live.BUT IN THIS second DEATH WISH outing, Kersey's role is modified from the former. In the original screen story, his modus operandi was one of a decoy. He would put himself in dangerous situations; so as to invite attackers to try to take him in robbery. Once the offender(s) were zeroing in for the kill, they were shot. Mr. Kersey then split the scene.THE NEW IMPROVED VIGILANTE of this sequel seems to be more in the tradition of the Super Hero. Much like Batman or Mighty Mouse, Kersey would come in to save the day in various assorted Robberies and Rapes in progress. His escapes from the scene seemed less convincing in Los Angeles' much more spread out cityscapes than in the Big Apple's densely packed asphalt & concrete jungles. Somehow eluding detection and capture are decidedly much more plausible in the act of ducking down into the subway than waiting for a public transit bus at a street bus stop.APPARENTLY following in the tradition of Lieutenant Gerard from THE FUGITIVE TV Series, the N.Y.P.D. Chief of Detectives Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) tracks Kersey all the way out there to the West Coast. Much like Gotham City's Chief O'Hara & Company; he's always arriving just a little too late.CARRY OVERS from the original were few.

Cannon, Anthony Franciosa, Robin Sherwood and even a very young Laurence Fishburne.ME AND ME BUDDY, SCHULTZ are still smiling about watching this on that winters night; a reaction, we assure you, that no one had any such feelings and emotions in seeing the original film.OUR VERDICT make like a hopscotch girl and skip it!

The end result was a pretty enjoyable ghost story. Johnny Depp seemed perfectly cast here as Ichabod Crane - the New York City policeman (sort of a Sherlock Holmes-type) who gets sent to the sleepy village of Sleepy Hollow in 1799 to help investigate a series of murders in which the victims' heads have been cut off and never found. It was a typical quirky sort of role for Depp, who's teamed again with director Tim Burton. Crane wades straight into the legend of a Hessian soldier beheaded during the Revolution who now haunts Sleepy Hollow until his head is returned to him. The mystery is around who he chooses to kill and why he chooses them.That mystery is pretty well put together, although a bit confusing at times, and while it does all make perfect sense in the end, I had absolutely no idea who the person responsible for the horseman's killings was going to be. I did make a guess and it turned out to be wrong. As always, Tim Burton puts together a perfect blend of story and atmosphere that makes the movie very realistic to watch, and the special effects are very well done. Although the murders are graphically depicted, they're not especially bloody considering that they feature beheadings (especially compared to, say, the bloody gore of Burton's Sweeney Todd, which also featured Depp) and I would tend to call this a murder mystery rather than a horror movie as it's suspenseful rather than frightening. Enjoyable though it was, I found there was a period in the middle when the story seemed to lose its hold on me and I had to force myself to concentrate on it, and I'm not really sure why. I also thought Crane's arrival in Sleepy Hollow - an isolated 18th century town in which most everyone is related to everyone (a point made later in the movie) was accepted a bit too nonchalantly, given that he was a complete stranger, and small towns - even today - tend to view strangers (especially city folk) with some sense of suspicion. That may be considered by some to be an unimportant detail, but I did notice it, and it caused me to question the story's credibility from the start.

I have not read the book that the film is based on; although I am a big fan of the first three books in Ellroy's 'L.A. Quartet'. It is often said of Ellroy that his writing got better as it went along; and assuming that this film is closely based on the book, I would say that there's a good chance that is true as the story here is not exactly solid. The entire film hinges on one major and quite unbelievable coincidence that boggles the mind if you care to think about it. However, it's the style and atmosphere that saves it; and that's the main reason I loved this film! The plot focuses on your everyday hard-bitten cop, Lloyd Hopkins, who after investigating the murder of a woman in Los Angeles, comes to believe that a serial killer may be operating in the area. Naturally, the police captain doesn't believe a word of it and Lloyd is forced to investigate on his own; leading him to a revelation closer to home than he was expecting.Director James B. Harris creates a fabulous atmosphere for the film to take place in and ensures that L.A. seems to be every bit the gritty and sleazy location needed to facilitate a tale like this. Similarly, James Woods fits the central role like a glove and is always believable in the role; even when the plot is getting out of hand. The first half of the film is really rather good and plausible; but then the twist hits and it really requires a suspension of disbelief from the viewer. It's not that the twist could not happen; it's more the way that it does happen which comes off as silly. It's just far too convenient and the whole film is turned on its head from that point on. Still, the atmosphere is retained and the story continues to be gripping; which are the film's strongest elements. Certain elements of the film are rather nasty, and indeed the book was originally denied by many different publishers for being too graphic! Still, a lot of it focuses on dialogue and from what I know of Ellroy, this part of the film is quite faithful. It all boils down to a rather hurried and coincidental ending; but I really do feel that this is a film where the style of it is much more important than the plot line. For some it will no doubt be too much of a problem...but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good crime thriller!

When her daughter (Katie Sagona) is murdered by a mysterious serial killer (Robert Downey Jr.), Claire finds herself predicting the future, and discovers she shares her dreams with the serial killer. Unable to convince the lead detective (Paul Guilfoyle), her doctor (Stephen Rea) and even her husband (Aidan Quinn), Claire has to confront the killer alone before her terrifying dreams become real.This film is a mess. I don't want to knock Neil Jordan, the director, because I know that he has had other successes, such as Interview With the Vampire. But this just isn't one of them. This film is poorly conceived and poorly executed... I have few good things to say about it.Why was Claire being fed this stuff? How? Her psychic connection is never explained. And I believe she says she had dreams all her life? Were they always connected to the killer? Why were they never this vivid? Did the connection go both ways -- and if the dreams came from the killer, how did he know what was going to happen in the future? How did Vivian hide out so well?

The principal reason was what Hitchcock considered lately a big script mistake, which made the film to have a bad press at the release date. And yet, there are several reasons because of which I liked the movie.First, it has quite a modern look, with the street scenes in the 30s London looking very natural. Second it tackles with the problem of terrorism including a bus bomb that looks almost a premonition of a problem that the world faced many decades later. Third there are a few classic Hitchcock scenes in a higher concentration than usual for the films before Hitchcock crossed the ocean to begin his American career.The start of the movie sets the context by using the dictionary definition of 'sabotage' then to follow with a London blackout symbolized by one light bulb losing power, one of the object scenes that will become a Hitchcock mark later in his career. Then as the story of the villain German terrorist played by Oskar Homolka suspected by his American wife played by Sylvia Sydney develops we become interested by the Harry Potter like figure of the kid brother of Sylvia. And then ... Hitchcock kills him as the innocent bearer of a bomb in a bus, in a scene that was controversial at its time over-passing a taboo in the cinema stories of the time. Although this breaks the balance of the story, this does not look at all outrageous nowadays, and it allows for the classic scene of revenge between Sydney and Homolka, a scene created with pure visual means while the actors keep their full reserved style all over. Another interesting scene allows for the heroine to try to cure from her shock watching for a Disney cartoon in a cinema theater ambiance which plays the role of setting of much of the intrigue of the film.The film does not lack problems, one of them being the bad casting of John Loder as the positive detective character - positive but lacking any interest or charisma. The final scenes seem to provide an artificial solution to all problems. Yet, the interesting setting and the collection of several interesting thriller scenes make of this film one of the best of the decade in Hithcock's career, even better than what the director thought about it to be.

Granted the girl feels for him, but the guys at the party seem to look down on him. Well this sets some stuff in motion where he becomes friends with the complex he and his mom are living in maintenance man who helps make him a disguise where he is able to go to a dance and be with the girl and instead of living well enough alone he proceeds to do something to the guy who beat him, that makes said guy want to beat him up again. Well the maintenance guy turns out to be a rather good karate teacher and thus the teacher pupil relationship is born and the kid even is able to build a relationship with the cute girl. Good movie for the most part as it has some drama, action and comedy to keep a person entertained. Much more so than any of the sequels, I prefer to think of this movie as stand alone.

The film is even more famous though as the last hurrah for James Dean before his fatal car-crash not long after the movie wrapped production.What to say about Dean's performance - this in fact was my first viewing of any of his films and I must admit that I don't or at least here, didn't get him. There's no denying his cultural importance in movies, his early death obviously froze him in time as a permanent symbol of handsome youthful rebellion, he didn't get to grow fat and strange like his contemporaries Brando and in a different field (let's not call him an actor) Elvis Presley. However, his slurring, shambling performance, where he overacts and underacts by turn, left me mystified and cold but if his aim in the film is to get under your skin, the way he does Hudson's straight-up character, then in a way he succeeds.I much preferred the more conventional acting style of the two other leads Hudson & Taylor. The former is very good indeed, conveying his character's evolution from dominating prejudiced macho-male to, by the end, a man who makes a stand against the abhorrent little-town racism meted out to Hispanics, in a scene that one would have hoped had resonance in a 50's America just as the nascent civil rights movement was getting its start. I enjoyed Taylor's performance too, her character pushing at the limits of Texan conventions but generally knowing when to ease off and cajole rather than stomp and scream. In support I also liked the young Dennis Hopper as Benedict's son, who rebels against his heritage by going modern and becoming a doctor, Carroll Baker as the errant daughter Luz junior, almost seduced into Dean's world of decadence, debauchery and above all money, while Chill Wills shines as the perennial uncle who acts almost as a sort of sage commentator on the action.The plot moves along as it should with scenes succeeding like big chapters in a book and while the film does have its Little House On The Walton Prairie episodes of family hokeyness, there are ample compensations in the big scenes, notably the posthumous return from the war of the young Hispanic teenager Angel (Sal Mineo), played out in respectful silence after a vibrant celebratory sequence for the homecomings of the living, Hudson's domino-effect symbolic demolition of Dean's massive wine-cellar and particularly Dean's almost Citizen Kane - type moment as he rails at the world (and Taylor for whom he's forever carried a torch) incoherently to an empty banquet-hall in near-darkness, his disgrace complete.The cinematography is suitably grand and must have looked great on the big screen on its original release and director Stevens marshals his massive forces both human and geographical, adeptly. Gone With The Wind it may have wanted to be but isn't, but an ambitious and entertaining epic it certainly is.

By today's standards it may have warranted a direct to DVD sequel, but an actual movie release would have been out of the question. Quite frankly this movie should have been out of the question. Or at least maybe they could have worked on it a bit more before its release as it definitely has a rushed feel to it. The story has Alan Quartermane and his new wife (both of which played by the same actors) going in search of Alan's brother who had set out looking for the lost city of gold. Well they go in pursuit and go through some jungle adventures and some traps and the movie has the same fast pace as the first movie. It looks like it is going to be a cheap action movie, but one packed with enough thrills to keep one entertained, and then they make it to the city of gold and the movie just stops being entertaining.

It's not just that the young, charming, amoral and murderous Tom Ripley has been turned into a corn-fed young man with tragic flaws. That wouldn't necessarily be a problem. Although those who love Patricia Highsmith's unadulterated protagonist might fuss, changing things is inherent in bringing books to movies. A different take on a character can be interesting. The problem is that Minghella takes nearly two-and- a-half hours to tell Tom's story. Just about 139 minutes to be more exact. We learn far more about Tom's background than we need - how he met his prey's father and got to Europe, his homoeroticism, his soul searching, his yearning. (Note to Minghella Tom Ripley doesn't have a soul; that's one of the reason's he's so fascinating.) Minghella piles on miles of beautiful tourist scenery, throws in a new, major character, and in general just uses too much time. Once a director makes a couple of prestigious hits, establishes his name, maybe wins an Oscar, attracts big stars who want to work with him, and does his own writing, a key quality is usually lost. That's the ability of someone to say to him, Buddy, here's your budget. Exceed it and we'll take the picture away from you and Hey, kid, if you don't give us a finished cut that comes in at under 100 minutes, you lose the final edit. With Minghella's more sympathetic and less interesting Tom, we have a young man whose tragic flaws lead to murder and whose regrets lead to angst. Tom (Matt Damon) wants the good things in life. He's poor but is a natural chameleon and a willing opportunist. When he attaches himself to the wealthy Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), life is good. When Dickie gets tired of him, Tom knows life will no longer be good. He knows he most likely can become Dickie. So he takes steps to do just that. Exit Dickie. Now Tom is in a cat and mouse adventure, moving faster and faster to protect himself and his investment in this new, lovely life of leisure. There's Dickie's on-and-off fiancée, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) to deal with, Dickie's old pal Freddie Miles (Philip Seymore Hoffman) to deal with, a new character Minghella decided to layer into the story (an irritatingly mannered Meredith Logue played by Cate Blanchett) to deal with and another young man who may wish he'd never met Tom. With frantic improvisation, some wooing, some boyish charm, an additional murder or two and a bout of sobbing regret, Tom Ripley does what he must. Unfortunately, Minghella has taken a charmingly conscience-free murder story and tried to turn it into meaningful literature. Matt Damon does a fine job as Anthony Minghella's version of Tom Ripley, but don't expect the scheming, mooching, self-centered and charming Tom Ripley of either Highsmith's creation or of the Tom Ripley played by Alain Delon in Rene Clement's version of the story, Purple Noon (Plein Soleil). In a bit of nasty uneasiness, Highsmith, Minghella and Clement all turn us into observers who are rooting for Tom's success, but Clement manages to do this while telling Tom's story in 30 fewer minutes that Minghella needs. Minghella, however, also wants us to understand Tom. All we really need is to sit back and enjoy his attitude and his crimes. For fans of Tom Ripley, there's the excellent (except for the cop-out ending) Purple Noon, plus two movies made from Highsmith's Ripley's Game. The American Friend features the unlikely Dennis Hopper as Tom. Ripley's Game gives us Tom played skillfully by John Malkovich. Ripley's Game is a first-rate, queasy movie.
