Secondly, this is the best event film I've ever seen in my life. Third point, this film is the greatest, most accurate, and most beautiful novel-to-movie transition ever created in the history of cinema. Every actor did an amazing job with their performance. Actually, every character from Middle-Earth was transported wholly and completely from their realm into ours to film these movies. And last of all, the scenery, direction, and the soundtrack are honestly gorgeous. Just a sight to behold.Everyone in the theater shuttup immediately as the New Line Cinema logo came on the screen and sat there for a full three hours completely absorbed in the movie. Even the BABY that was in the theater didn't make a word during the film.Surprises that truly made me smile and almost even cry in sheer delight included the prologue at the very start of the film, and how jaw-droppingly gorgeous the war was, especially how Sauron flung entire legions of men from the earth with a blast of his sword. The fireworks in the Shire, just how funny the interactions between Pippin and Merry could be, the butterfly that helped Gandalf, Gandalf's and Saruman's fight ontop of Orthanc, how the one ring was truly a living, sentient character, Arwen and Aragorn's very well handled love-story, the amazing Watcher-in-the-Water's sequence, Boromirs redemption, how everyone in the theater APPLAUDED when Aragorn killed Lurtz, the decision to leave the singing boy out of the last score on the film during the breaking of the fellowship, and the very end of the film when Frodo and Sam depart together. Truly beautiful film-making.This film is a touching, magnificent, emotional masterpiece, one that is definitely in my top-10 films of all time, and a film that will live on in my heart for the rest of my life. I am absolutely in love with it. To sum it upWords fail me.But, alas, this film isn't perfect. (Honestly, no film is) I adored this film, with reservations. And since there are literally 23 billing gushing reviews on the internet from critics and movie-fans alike who praised the film for being spectacular, I'm going to be the jerk that talks about the things he didn't like in the movie and would've done differently if he directed this awe-inspiring epic trilogy.First off, I agree with Peter Jackson's decision to exclude Tom Bambodill from the beginning of the movie, although I resent him for doing so. Admittedly, including him would only mess up the pace of the movie. Jackson made it so that Frodo and his hobbit friends had to get to Rivendell as fast as they could, to escape the ever present menace of the Ringwraiths. But see, in the novel, I don't remember the Nazgul being on their trail quite so early. The hobbits could've still been attacked by the Barrow Wights, slowly devoured by an ancient tree, and saved by Tom Bambodill in the very beginning. Okay, FINE, I know they couldn't do this. Not only cause it would defeat the sense of urgency and threat, but because it would make this already incredibly long movie even longer. I, for one, did not mind the length of the film at all. In fact, I could've sat through six more hours and finished the entire trilogy, I was ~that captivated~. But I'm very perceptive, and I could feel the energy's of everyone around me, and how . . even though they loved the movie. . .they were getting restless because of it's length. Anyway, if I was Peter Jackson, I still would've filmed the Barrow Wights\/Evil Tree\/Tom Bambodill sequences and left them out of the movie, only to add it to the deleted scenes in what is sure to be an ~amazing~ DVD.Okay, so leaving Tom out wasn't really an issue with me, so why did I just waste a paragraph ranting about it when I could really sink my teeth into the things that bothered me? Let me give you an example. I loved the effects when Frodo put on the ring. His appearance in that dark world, where the Ringwraiths were the actual spirits of the nine kings, was amazing and totally called for; on Weathertop anyway. When they were off of the hill, everytime Frodo put on the ring seemed like they were revealing too much too soon. You know what they're doing, don't you? They're spoiling us. Spoiling us in the first film, of what is to a be an intricate and fascinating trilogy. Why ruin everything so soon? Don't show us so much this early in the story! Granted, I ~loved~ seeing Frodo put on the ring and enter the nether realm where the Eye of Sauron was watching him, and I ~loved~ how it zoomed him into the very heart of Mordor. But still, these are scenes and visuals that should be saved for the Return of the King, or at the very least the Two Towers. Frodo's eventual descent into darkness, due to the corruption of the ring, must be presented in gradual steps. I was really into what they did in the Fellowship of the Ring, but I truly believe that bringing this issue out so early in the narrative will just cause problems in the emotional structure of both of the following movies. But I'm praying it won't, and I trust Peter Jackson, so . . . onto my next little problem.Bilbo freaking out about the ring in Rivendell. And I don't mean freaking out in the good way. His face changed and distorted itself into a hideous grotesque. . THING. I don't remember that in the novel. Of course he was tempted by it's presence and wanted to hold it again, but they didn't need to do that weird face thing that they did. He looked like one of the demon's in the Devil's Advocate. You know how their faces went all evil and whatever!? Craziness. In Ralph Bakshi's truly horrible animated Lord of the Rings film which went through the first book and half of the second one, they handled Bilbo's scene in Rivendell much better. Frodo allowed him to see the ring and his hands went all jittery and his eyes were fixed upon the ring in a look of pure madness and desire. And if a god-awful cartoon can get that right, why can't the genius of Peter Jackson?While we're talking about Rivendell, I loved the scenes outside of the Council of Elrond, and even the council itself had it's moments, but. ..ugh, they could've at least MENTIONED Tom. And, and, they could've discussed ulterior motives for disposing of the ring, such as flinging it into the depths of the ocean, and how they couldn't do that since it was in their hands now and it was their responsibility, and simply disposing of it for future generations to be subjected to would be selfish and wrong. And where was Bilbo's little speech about how he'd take the ring himself into the cracks of Mnt. Doom? Leaving that out kinda hurt his character's development, in my eyes.Lothlorien . . Why couldn't they be blind-folded into the depths of the forests? Why couldn't Sam accompany Frodo to the mirror and look into it for himself, as in the novel? Another complaint, and possibly my biggest one, is Galadriel's temptation by the ring. Where the heck did that come from? Who's permission allowed this scene to exist? It wasn't at all like that in the novel. Far more subtle and less intense and, well, silly. C'mon, Galadriel's good, her temptation was supposed to ellude to her desire for the elves to remain the predominant race on this planet instead of fading into the west. But no, they had to go and conjure up some scary, loud visuals and film the scene while taking huge amounts of LSD. For shame. While we're at Lothlorien, why couldn't Galadriel have given Frodo the magic rope as well as those star tears? They're gonna need it in the Two Towers, darn it!And now for the Balrog. . . ugh, I'm NOT going to say he was a disappointment. I refrained from looking at his picture online for months before seeing this movie, just so I could be surprised when one of the ~greatest demons in existence~ appeared on the silver screen for the first time.Listen, I loved his look, I did. He was truly frightening and he cast a real presence of evil. My only beef (?) is with just how big he was. That's not right folks. I can understand Peter Jackson's decision here. We had just seen an unbelievable battle with a Cave Troll, and now we needed something to TOP that. Fine. You can do that. Just do that without having to make your next monster 75 feet tall. As I remember Balrogs, in my books, in my video games, and in my imagination, they're supposed to be represent the deepest, darkest of dark places with their mere presence, not because they were giants, but because they were EVIL. They're supposed to be huge, sure, but not ENORMOUS. Not King Kong, smack you in your face with my pinky-toe, gigantic. If he was a dozen feet, I'm absolutely positive he would've resonated with me on more levels and disturbed me in ways that only little school girls should be disturbed.And while we're at the Bridge of Khaza Dum, why couldn't the fellowship help Gandalf?? He was hanging there for what seemed like a minute. Surely they could've reached out and helped him back up. You see, in the novel, this wasn't even an issue, because Gandalf fell immediately as the whip wrapped around his ankles. No holding on for dear life there.Finally, in some scenes, the CGI looked too. . . CGI. I hate that. Not in the battle scenes, nah, I'm talking about in the camera zooming and shit. For example....Isengard, the trenches in the caves where Saruman bred the Urak-Hai. First of all, this breeding was only insinuated in the novels, never discussed in great detail. Why include it? It just slows down the plot. Secondly, all the camera movements, in heavily-laden CGI environments looked kinda....fake. Totally unnecessary, just take out the scenes altogether.In closing, I would like to stress just how much I truly love this instant classic. It's so good that it's literally tied with the Labyrinth as my favorite fantasy movie ever, and this is all on the first viewing. I'm definitely going to see it again this weekend though, and I truly believe it can't get anything but better under repeated viewings.Peter Jackson, from the bottom of my heart thank you.

Another complaint, and possibly my biggest one, is Galadriel's temptation by the ring. Where the heck did that come from? Who's permission allowed this scene to exist? It wasn't at all like that in the novel. Far more subtle and less intense and, well, silly. C'mon, Galadriel's good, her temptation was supposed to ellude to her desire for the elves to remain the predominant race on this planet instead of fading into the west. But no, they had to go and conjure up some scary, loud visuals and film the scene while taking huge amounts of LSD. For shame. While we're at Lothlorien, why couldn't Galadriel have given Frodo the magic rope as well as those star tears? They're gonna need it in the Two Towers, darn it!And now for the Balrog. . . ugh, I'm NOT going to say he was a disappointment. I refrained from looking at his picture online for months before seeing this movie, just so I could be surprised when one of the ~greatest demons in existence~ appeared on the silver screen for the first time.Listen, I loved his look, I did. He was truly frightening and he cast a real presence of evil. My only beef (?) is with just how big he was. That's not right folks. I can understand Peter Jackson's decision here. We had just seen an unbelievable battle with a Cave Troll, and now we needed something to TOP that. Fine. You can do that. Just do that without having to make your next monster 75 feet tall. As I remember Balrogs, in my books, in my video games, and in my imagination, they're supposed to be represent the deepest, darkest of dark places with their mere presence, not because they were giants, but because they were EVIL. They're supposed to be huge, sure, but not ENORMOUS. Not King Kong, smack you in your face with my pinky-toe, gigantic. If he was a dozen feet, I'm absolutely positive he would've resonated with me on more levels and disturbed me in ways that only little school girls should be disturbed.And while we're at the Bridge of Khaza Dum, why couldn't the fellowship help Gandalf?? He was hanging there for what seemed like a minute. Surely they could've reached out and helped him back up. You see, in the novel, this wasn't even an issue, because Gandalf fell immediately as the whip wrapped around his ankles. No holding on for dear life there.Finally, in some scenes, the CGI looked too. . . CGI. I hate that. Not in the battle scenes, nah, I'm talking about in the camera zooming and shit. For example....Isengard, the trenches in the caves where Saruman bred the Urak-Hai. First of all, this breeding was only insinuated in the novels, never discussed in great detail. Why include it? It just slows down the plot. Secondly, all the camera movements, in heavily-laden CGI environments looked kinda....fake. Totally unnecessary, just take out the scenes altogether.In closing, I would like to stress just how much I truly love this instant classic. It's so good that it's literally tied with the Labyrinth as my favorite fantasy movie ever, and this is all on the first viewing. I'm definitely going to see it again this weekend though, and I truly believe it can't get anything but better under repeated viewings.Peter Jackson, from the bottom of my heart thank you. You made this Christmas the most memorable one since my childhood when I was actually happy.

Many people including my sister thought it to be gross nasty, and who would ever in the right mind produce a movie written by Tom Green Me on the other hand  a great fan of Tom Green, enjoyed the movie.   The title Freddy Got Fingered I don't enjoy because the Freddy got fingered is not the central thing in the movie.The Cast of the movie made the movie a whole more enjoyable. Tom Green had some dramatic scenes but they were a little too dramatic. Rip Torn did an excellent job as the Father, He much reminded me of my Dad because he can be a plain jerk and that is what I love about Gordon( Tom Green) Dad. Marisa Coughlan did a brilliant job as Betty. When you first meet Betty you think what a total nut Then she reveals her profession and you are taken aback. The second time we see Betty we think whoa this character is very complex. Eddie Kaye Thomas did a wonderful job as the lovable Freddy seeming confused towards the Climax we actually see Gordon (Tom Green) and Freddy (Eddie Kaye Thomas) together and it is just hilarous when Freddy tells Gordon to get a job!!!!

Tonight, I did. I didn't live in the Sixties, I didn't witness the atrocities by policing of the North Vietnamese in Vietnam, and I certainly didn't think this film skipped on those details. Think of the biographies, or those from birth to death films, and try to tell me those don't look cheesy or lose your interest. Look at the fake prosthetics or variety of unfortunate child actors stumbling up the life a revered individual. My point is that if I wanted to watch I documentary I would. I would go rent the old films, go to the library, search the internet for some armchair losers opinion. I wanted to see a film that would give me a glimpse in to the life of an individual I unfortunately couldn't grow up watching, and that is what I received.Micheal Mann has delivered several excellent pictures to our world. He has presented us with many opportunities to witness the spectacle that is life, whether it be a dying Indian tribe, a bank robber who knows sacrifice, and a modern man willing to risk it all to put an end to an addictive chemical pushing company. What a fine choice by the producers to choose him as the main man. His use of composition and silence, seen in The Insider, work well at shadowing a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. It does not bother me to sit still for almost three hours to just gaze at a man's profile. And this is no ordinary man's story, it is the story of Muhammed Ali. I think he represented the man who was the champ well. Pacing the film in such a way that the viewer identifies the struggle, but it does challenge those viewers with attention deficit disorder. You are asked to put the pieces together and to follow along the tumultuous timeline, but remember, this is a man who did a lot, and again, people who are looking for greater depth, go watch Life. Overall, I feel Micheal Mann represented a figure so dominant in and out of the ring, with a quiet dignity that the man so rightly deserves.Will Smith, characterized by his goofy, senseless, egotistical roles fills the shoes of the world's greatest in this biographical vignette. Not looking for much and blasted with an overhyped Oscar nod, I was trying not to expect anything. I was rewarded with a powerful performance. Not only was Will Smith's physical transition clearly recognizable, you can see the Ali he crawled into by looking into his eyes. As serious as he is about his role, and there is no other that I can think of to fill it, Will is able to use Ali's humor and not begin to show any signs of breaking down and getting jiggy with it. He gives a solid performance and it appears that roles which demand great physical metamorphosis (i.e. Cast Away) create Oscar buzz, than so be it, however, it was the actors performance which sold me, not the muscle.Clearly this film was meant to be a nod to the greatest boxer who ever lived, and thankfully it wasn't sugarcoated. It shows the struggles of a man being pulled in a variety of directions and who only aimed at greatness. Micheal Mann delivered a great picture, and Will Smith performed to his true ability. I loved this film, and I appreciated its honesty. If I missed something, I'll read a book about it, but for now, I'll stick to watching Mann's vision of a fighter who won more than titles.

(and the scene close to the end with Sam trying to follow Frodo was a real tear-jerker for me).  films and books are extremely different media.  my sense is that Master Tolkien would've been pleased at this movie, and happy that it captured the essence of the struggle between good and evil he was trying to get across.my real hope is that many more people are brought into the overarching wonder, adventure, magic of the LotR world, as well as the subtle social and environmental commentary embedded throughout the series (by reading the books).In this vein, here are some of my favorite quotes**** FotR Quotes ****Ch.2 The Shadow of the Past--1. Gandalf- .. Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and grows again.Frodo I wish it need not have happened in my timeGandalf So do I, and so do all who live to see such times.

This film is without a doubt one of the best I've ever seen!  I was treated to a preview of this beautiful film in advance of its opening.  Like some of the others who have submitted reviews here, I too was completely thrown off by the trailer for the film.  I expected to find a mediocre love story taking place in the midst of some kind of quasi-thriller.  Boy was I in for a surprise!  This movie delivers on so many levels.  It was indeed a thriller (although of a different sort)...and also delivered as a love story on several levels.  Yes, the beautiful and talented Mr. Crowe affects what was in my opinion a convincing enough West Virginia accent, but more mind blowing was seeing him adapt his mannerisms, posture, and gait to the various ages, and stages, of Mr. Nash's life.  His performance was brilliantly subtle, yet right on the money.  What more can I say?  The man is a truly amazing actor!  Truly gifted!  As for other aspects of the film...there are those who find Ron Howard's style of directing to be somewhat heavy handed in attempting to extract emotions from the moviegoer - I don't necessarily share that opinion.  I prefer to think that his films are imbued with heart.  I enjoy his work, and I feel that this film especially was directed with a truly artistic touch.  I never felt as though I'd been manipulated.  On the contrary, I felt as though I'd had the privilege of being allowed on a very special and exclusive journey, and found the experience uplifting.  The film allows the viewer to peer into a great mind gone haywire...and to watch him use his genius to put it back together again.  It allows us to share in some of the challenges and uncertainty which exist in the daily lives of those who have a loved one with this type of illness.  To see Mr. Crowe's oh so subtle, very realistic, portrayal not only of what a schizophrenic experiences mentally - but how he appears to those watching from the outside...well, this was truly awesome! He masterfully avoided going overboard with the role.  Playing John Nash with quiet dignity...not at all over the top.  Both Mr. Crowe and Ms. Connelly bring tremendous honesty to their roles.  I was truly impressed seeing the love, the resoluteness, and at the same time the weariness that settles in under such circumstances on a long suffering mate, all flawlessly portrayed by Jennifer Connelly.  She took us through the gamut of emotions that Alicia Nash must have experienced.  In the first date scenes, Ms. Connelly is a vision, and throughout the film she is the embodiment of grace and beauty.  Also worth mentioning, Ed Harris turns in yet another solid performance as the very creepy government agent.  Paul Bettany is a real scene stealer as Nash's roommate and confidant.  The score is simply beautiful and sets the proper mood at all times.  The film is visually stunning.  I can't see how this film won't snag Academy Award nominations all around, but especially for Russell Crowe and for Jennifer Connelly. Crowe should definitely take home another Oscar for this one!  Please!  Do yourself a favor and see this film if you haven't already...and if you have then see it again - I just did!
