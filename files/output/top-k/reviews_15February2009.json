For Peter, this scoop could save his career and for Ellie, well, she needs all the help she can get to make it to New York alive. The two develop an unlikely relationship exchanging humorous jabs as they bus, hitchhike and hijack their way and of course while neither will be the first to admit it, there's no hiding their feelings for each other from the audience.Classic films tend to rely on the prowess of their marquee actors and Gable and Colbert are terrific together. Both are humorous and play a wide range of emotions. Gable is one of those stars that has that intangible it factor that just makes him seem so incredibly important in every scene. There is a strong tension between them the entire film that is funny at times and romantically intriguing at others.The writing, however, is what makes this a standout classic. The way Peter wiggles his and Ellie's way out of tight situation, namely those that would result in Ellie being found out, is genius. Robert Riskin does some of the best witty dialog and scenes. The best parts of the film are when Peter and Ellie are alone, either in their motel room or out in the forest. The tension between them is highest and it makes the dialog that much better. This is a film that you remember the scenes. Like a play they all carry their own weight and interest. What happens next is not as important as what is happening.It Happened One Night only suffers from a cliché ending. The humor shifts from wit to just laughing at the film in general because you know the inevitable will happen and anything that tries to stay in the way at that point is just--pointless. Anyone who loves classic situational and near-farcical comedy will love It Happened One Night and with good reason. It's enjoyable for all generations but it's very true to the era, definitely an escapist depression-era film because it concerns itself with the wealthy and pokes fun at them. There's even a song though it's incorporated in a more drama-focused way, no theatricality.~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It Happened One Night is a classic love story yet its best feature is that it surprises you it's not chock-full of clichés (though not devoid of them either) and it has an enduring sense of humor that all generations can appreciate.The film stars two classic screen actors in Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert playing Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews, one a recently fired journalist and the other a runaway heiress who meet on a bus to New York.

It also caused quite a stir among many minorities. Especially feminists who criticised its sexist, misogynist politics. When viewed today, and divorced from all the hype surrounding it, Fatal Attraction is a competent, compulsive thriller. But one that perhaps falls short of the enormous publicity it engendered.Even a casual fan will know the plot of Fatal Attraction. It wasn't even the first film to address the pitfalls of one-night stands. That was done before by Clint Eastwood when he directed Play Misty For Me. And that was way back in 1971. Its always seemed unusual to me that Fatal Attraction was the far more successful film, even though it were rehashing an idea already done.But still, there's no denying that Fatal Attraction is a rather involving film. Adrian Lyne's direction draws you right into the lives of the characters before you even know it yourself. Even when we see Michael Douglas eyeing up Glenn Close for a one-night stand, while Anne Archer is away for the weekend, we find it hard to pull ourselves away from the act of betrayal Dan is about to commit.Equally compelling is the consequences of the act. Watching it snowball into a growing mountain of problems Dan has brought on himself. But for all that, I always feel a nagging sense of disappointment once I've finished watching Fatal Attraction. In spite of the attention the film received, there is something a bit naive about it. Glenn Close's character, Alex exists as nothing more then an attack on Dan's traditional values.And the film becomes rather hypocritical in its second half. Dan's family seems to be the apex of all that is good and pure in this world. Something further reinforced by Adrian Lyne's lush, nostalgic direction. And yet when Alex tries to destroy that, are we just expected to ignore that Dan has all but done that himself? When he actually physically attacks Alex, I think we're expected to cheer him on. When in fact he set the whole event in motion.Fatal Attraction is a much better film in its first half. Because at least at that point, we don't know exactly how far this film will go. Fatal Attraction was the first of several questionable roles Michael Douglas would choose to play. And he does quite well as Dan. Watching him bend under the pressure Alex keeps piling on him is never less than engaging.And the role of Alex is the one that brought Glenn Close into the public eye. And the one that typecast her in the role of domineering, controlling women. Glenn Close certainly plays Alex to the hilt, becoming more and more deranged as the film goes on. But she is let down somewhat by the screenplay. James Dearden spends next to no time at all on Alex's background. We never even see her at her job. She just spends all her time hovering over Dan every step of the way. Aside from mood swings and paranoid obsession, Alex is a total blank.I've always thought Anne Archer is a greatly underrated actress. She always projects a forthright attitude coupled with an incredibly warm personality. And she's quite sexy too! And I loved her as Beth. She quite lights up the screen whenever she's around. Why Dan would want to cheat on her with Alex is a mystery to me!Adrian Lyne has brushed up a bit on his Hitchcock. And he does give us a few good shocks here and there. The bunny boiling has become the film's most famous scene. And its one that Lyne pulls off with aplomb. Beth walks up to the cooking pot, while her daughter does the same with her rabbit hutch. As soon as we find that the rabbit's gone, Beth takes the lid off the pot. Its a great bit of foreboding that works on two levels. And really packs a punch.Nothing else in Fatal Attraction quite matches up to that scene. Even when Alex slits her wrists as a manipulation tactic, that's something Lyne has stolen from Play Misty For Me. But its when it moves towards its climax that the film's flaws sadly begin to overtake it. As you watch the film, you sense some misogyny aimed at Alex's character. And that's what winds up shaping the film's finale.Lyne aims for a restoration of the status quo. Of conservative values winning out over Alex's vindictive behaviour. Quite a few scenes in the last 30 minutes are rather clumsily handled by Lyne. Like Alex kidnapping their daughter by taking her to a theme park. And then returning her. Why that is I have no idea? And then there's the grand finale. When Dan kills Alex in the harshest possible way. This ending was chosen over a far more low-key one when test audiences reacted badly to it. That only shows how willing Lyne was to cater to the demands of an audience. Even if it bent the film right out of shape.At the end of the day, I do feel Fatal Attraction is rather overrated. It does manage to keep you involved. But it comes saddled with too many flaws to make it a proper classic. It seems much too afraid of its own implications that it opts for a cop-out ending. Anything to wrap things up in a neat little package. When a film has this many double-standards, it becomes hard to swallow what we're seeing.

I started watching it last night thinking it would only be a normal American teen movie but luckily i was wrong. Normally I am not one who watches much on the side of American films because only a few of them ever pull at my heart strings but this movie was one that truly did. I cried through half the film, its just that awesome of a film. The way characters are developed makes u have to fall in love with Jamie and also makes you cry for Landon and Jamie once it becomes apparent something bad is on the horizon. The film was done perfectly proving you don't need exposure or sex scenes to show love between 2 people. Even though Christianity is strongly used in the film i could link it to my spirituality and my understandings and beliefs of what love is and what it can do to a person and i believe that these beliefs are universal and recognizable by people of all cultures and religious or spiritual background. The movie conveys a lot of things that i strongly believe in about love, relationships and life and therefore it truly touched me in a way most of the material and glitz filled American films fail to do.- Love transcends all, society, peer pressure, anything that may try to stand in the way does not prevent true love from taking root and flourishing.- Love knows no jealousy, hatred, pride, self centeredness, and resent. Love in fact is the purest of emotions one will ever encounter in ones life and when one does, and love takes root it can really change a person for the better.- Relationships are built on trust and understanding including one of love which was very prominent in the relationship between Landon and Jamie.- All in all this movie in a very short span of time reveals the beauty that one can find in the life that God has created for us no matter how early he chooses to call us to him. and how much of an impact the right life partner can have on the way one lives and views his life. As Landon says at the end of the film even though she is no longer there her love is like the wind he can feel it even if he cant see it even when one departs. shows that love for another person does not end when the persons life ends but when someone truly loves someone their souls become 1 and they live on in the souls of the other.this film was just pure brilliance one of the best movies i have ever seen. it made me cry with sadness as well as with happiness (and this coming from an 18 year old boy). If you see this movie coming on TV as you are flipping through channels or even if u have to go out to a store to get it i would strongly recommend it. I can only pray to God that I find a girl as perfect as Jamie.

The only problem is that its a little repetitive (when everyone just suddenly starts dancing). Other than that this movie is great.The highlight of this movie is the car chases. They are done excellently and I think they are some of the best car chases ever made.The movie is about two brothers ,Jake and Elwood, - The Blues Brothers who are musicians. The movie starts with one of the brothers, Jake, being released from prison. They visit the nun, who raised them as kids in a Catholic orphanage, and she tells them that they need $5000 to be able to keep the place running. Jake and Elwood decide that getting the band back together would be the best way to get the $5000. They go finding the original members of the band and convince them to rejoin the band. After they get all the members back they start playing. After playing at Bobs Country Bunker they go and play at the Palace Hotel. Along the way they end up making numerous enemies (the police, the Good 'ol Boys, the American Nazi party, and Jake's ex girlfriend. This results in numerous hilarious car chases. They end up getting the money and giving it to the Orphanage - but then they get arrested and go to prison (they play music there though, so its a happy ending).This is an excellent musical comedy - and I definitely recommend you to see it.

Jake and Elwood decide that getting the band back together would be the best way to get the $5000. They go finding the original members of the band and convince them to rejoin the band. After they get all the members back they start playing. After playing at Bobs Country Bunker they go and play at the Palace Hotel. Along the way they end up making numerous enemies (the police, the Good 'ol Boys, the American Nazi party, and Jake's ex girlfriend. This results in numerous hilarious car chases. They end up getting the money and giving it to the Orphanage - but then they get arrested and go to prison (they play music there though, so its a happy ending).This is an excellent musical comedy - and I definitely recommend you to see it.

While Alvy impresses the importance of adult education, Bergman films, and his general concern of maintaining a certain level of New York snobbery in the face of Hollywood, Annie becomes his understanding, nurturing muse, who attends the night school courses Alvy wants her to take, often wears the same clothes\/fashion sense that Alvy does, and with Alvy's encouragement, sings jazz standards in a club. Although we do notice at times Annie's charming transparency of innocence and wisdom, the film does tend to weight the point-of-view of Alvy more heavily. Despite sharing each other's breaking-the-fourth-wall memories of family, former relationships, and views on life, a lot of Annie's interior soul remains unanswered, while Alvy's is more in the forefront. This is the story of Alvy, in any case it is his inflexibility and private\/public obsessions that seem to doom every relationship of his, without the ability to empathize and accept consistently throughout the course of relationship the growing-up of his muse\/student, Annie.

It's not because Annie physically left him for another city or lover, but because Alvy remains steadfast as wanting to remain Annie's teacher.

It was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. In Rebecca it was actually great to see Hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text, forced to turn his technique to heavy Gothic drama, but for Mr and Mrs Smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was no Ernst Lubitsch.First, let's look at the romantic angle. The best love scenes in Hitchcock films were wild, passionate and slightly dangerous &#x96; the ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have? situation, and he was great at depicting that. This is something that makes a much earlier film, Rich and Strange, one of the few Hitchcock non-thrillers that really works. Hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. A light, tender touch is required and Hitch doesn't have it.Secondly, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock films could be funny &#x96; The Lady Vanishes is probably the best example &#x96; but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story. The master of suspense simply isn't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones. He cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller &#x96; snappy opposing angles of people talking, inserted close-ups of hands and feet, point-of-view shots &#x96; but doesn't allow for comic timing or focus on gags. For example, the business with Carole Lombard's dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close-ups, but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point, and have no comedic impact. Occasionally Hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy &#x96; for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club, where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive, sophisticated woman at the next table &#x96; but such moments are few and far between.Even the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith are not up to standard. I'm not sure this was Robert Montgomery's strength lay, and he is boring here. This was of course exactly where Queen of Screwball Carole Lombard's strength lay, and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera, fails to perk things up at all. Of course, neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay, which isn't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place, even if the basic story is a fairly good premise.The only full-on comedy Hitchcock made after this was the Trouble with Harry, and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness.

Finally did last night, on PBS television. It was made in the 1940s, my favorite decade for movie-making. It seems that movies then were more serious. They didn't get distracted with special effects, gadgets, trying to show how cool they are, or trying to further some political agenda. They could concentrate on story, character, human relationships, the drama of ordinary people in extraordinary situations. Three of my top ten all-time favorites are from the 1940s. So I was predisposed to like this one.I was disappointed. As others have posted, the movie has many good parts underlying well written novel, good acting, great photography, memorable events, memorable characters. It provides a wonderful glimpse into a culture now gone. Yet even around the halfway point I was getting disappointed. Why?I think the basic problem is that the novel it's based on is just too long to be made into a two-hour movie. Too many characters aren't developed well. Too many scenes had to be cut. Some examples- I'm sorry, but I really couldn't keep all the brothers straight. I was glad when some went off to America. When one died (fairly early on), I wished I could have easily rewound the film to remind myself what he looked like. Ten minutes later when I saw another brother I could have sworn that was the one who died.- The youngest boy, Huw, should have been made to age over the three year or so span of the movie. It really was distracting. Maybe they could have used a 14 year old actor who could be made-up to look 10 at the start. Maybe they could make him look shorter at first by having him stand on a lower floor than the other actors. He also seemed to behave like he was 10 the whole time.- Huw seems to fall in love with the widow of his brother. This is only hinted at. It should be developed! - How did the strike get resolved? What was the compromise? - Why did the boxer who helps Huw become blind? It struck me as odd. Why bother including that part, since time is limited? - The Maureen O'Hara character, Angharad, and her marriage didn't make sense. We get to see her husband in only two very brief scenes. He is a stereotype. When did they meet? Doesn't his father object? Show us more of his character and personality. Show us at least one scene of their married life.- The Walter Pigeon character, the minister, is a very important part of the film. We see him teaching and helping Huw, which is great. But his decision relative to Angharad needs more development. And at the end, we are left to figure out for ourselves what will happen.- The part about one of the older brothers who gets invited to sing before the Queen is wasted. I would drop two of the older brothers, including this one, from the film entirely. Use the time saved there to develop the relationship between Angharad and her husband.I hope I don't seem to be nitpicking.

The relationship between Belle and the Beast is both funny and endearing, the songs are remarkably good, and the animation is beautiful. A lot of the humour is very witty (even though most of it was childish, it can also give the parents a chuckle or two), and, while it is quite violent for a kid's movie, it gives very good messages; the most poignant of which is appearances aren't everything.It's based on a very old story, but it has been altered to become Disney-fied. Belle (French for beautiful) is a gorgeous but odd girl who confounds her entire town with her looks and strange ways.

But between the Beast's temper, Belle's stubbornness, and the constant plotting of muscle-man Gaston, determined to win Belle at any cost, this won't be so easy...As I said before, the relationship between Belle and the Beast is funny and endearing - funny, because at first, they can't stand each other. The Beast appears crude and frightening, and Belle is determined to be as difficult as possible.

Even now he remains an acquired taste and a sort of love him or leave him filmmaker. With Annie Hall the quirky barriers were broken down and the movie crossed over into a blockbuster film.There is little question that Woody Allen is a great writer and filmmaker. Even those that don't care for his high brow comedy will admit to his certain brand of genius with a camera and his keen scripts. Along with Marshal Brickman, Allen was also able to secure and Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director. Allen chose not to be present at the awards.Annie Hall is about the romantic adventures of neurotic New York comedian Alvy Singer and his equally neurotic girlfriend Annie Hall. The story follows their relationship from first meeting and the documents their rocky romance while making comments about love during the 1970s. Throughout the movie Allen uses different and innovative ways to tell the story from speaking to the camera, entering other people's narratives and even the clever use of some animation. Of course just like the later Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Radio Days, Annie Hall clearly has its share of semi-autobiographical elements. The film is total Allen representing the his socially inept and pessimistic view of dating and people bringing all his New York raised bias to bear. The relationship between the two main characters is also autobiographical as Allen and Diane Keaton dated and had a breakup in the early 1970s.Annie Hall gave Woody Allen a chance to capitalize on the success elements from his previous films with the subjects of anti-Semitism, life, romance, professional angst, drugs and death, his obsessive love of New York. Themes that would continue in his films until present day. This film allows his neuroses to take center stage and along with his pessimism and distorted memories of his childhood creates an alter ego for the screen that he refines and which the public comes to think of as actual Woody Allen. This film along with other Allen work combined with his personal life he had chosen to make public come together and make up the true but sort of fictional Woody. Few movies come through American culture and stand the test of time. Annie Hall is a fresh movie today as it was 30 years ago. The comedy is still just as relevant and the New York centeredness still exists 100%. The film has transcended just a flick at the metroplex and is now taught as part of film history at most universities.

Whereas affairs can be very exciting, relationships can be very real. And so is this film, it's full of truth. I therefore think it's much more valuable than the average romcom film.Although some things are funny in the book, they are more funny in a tragic way, particularly when it comes to the protective, risk avoiding habits of the Leary family. There is a lot of hope and insight in it however, as the more important characters in the film all grow into a richer, wiser person.You just have to see this film, you'll be touched more than you expected. It has a wonderful pace to give you some time to let in some of it's vast emotional depth. I would vote this as my favorite chic-flick because it really has something to say rather than just blab superficially about how love conquers all.Rather than your typical romance film, this is more about personal growth, as well as a character study in particular of Macon Leary. He has a trauma from a lost son but has learned to avoid difficulties and complications. He has become a shadow of himself, sleepwalking through life and muffling his own feelings under a comfortable blanket of apathy and common sense. He has lost the ability to become emotionally attached, but is given the chance to find it back through a woman (Muriel) that won't leave him alone. If only there were more women like Muriel...she has a past too, is divorced as well, has a problematic child and is afraid to be left behind.An 6.6 rating says more about the people that watched it than that it says something about the film.

Being familiar with the equally 'naughty' GOING PLACES (1974) from the same team of writer-director Blier and male stars Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere, I knew more or less what to expect the end result, then, is just as entertaining (and overstretched) but also, perhaps, a tad superior. Genuinely original and undeniably very funny, the films sees husband-and-wife Depardieu and Carole Laure going through a crisis because of the latter's perennial depression and resultant frigidity; the former sees a way out by asking perfect stranger Dewaere to become her lover, in the hope of relighting the woman's dormant passion. Still, while the two like each other, they begin to mope over their disservice to Depardieu and, soon, it's back to square one for Laure! The narrative takes an episodic form, wherein the trio first meet a flustered green-grocer &#150; a pre-LA CAGE AUX FOLLES (1978) Michel Serrault &#150; and manage to turn him into a lover of classical music (Dewaere is a Mozart devotee') and, later, a precocious teenage camper (Dewaere is also an instructor of Physical Education) who, picked on by his peers for being the son of an industrialist, is taken under her wing by Laure&#133;and ends up being the one to provide sexual gratification for the unemotional woman, even getting her pregnant!

It's doubtful there's a person alive who doesn't know the story of Dracula so there's no point in telling it again so how does this version measure up to previous ones? On one hand this is possibly the greatest looking version but that can't make up for how deadly dull the film is. The beautiful eye candy is certainly something to worship but without the strong story backing it up we're left with a real mixed bag. On a technical level the movie is pretty much flawless as the sets, costumes, editing, special effects and cinematography are all top notch. The beautiful rich colors of the costumes really stand out as does the magnificent looking colors of the sky, the castle and various other items. The special effects are also quite remarkable and especially the ones dealing with the aging Oldman. The way the make up takes Oldman's age from old to young is really a marvel to look at and the fact that the actor can still move and act through it is another major plus. I think Oldman gives one of the most interesting interpretations of the Count and he perfectly nails the tortured soul of the man. Oldman also has a very interesting line delivery, which worked for me as did his rather easy way of getting across his passion. I'm also a fan of Ryder's performance here and the naive quality she brings Mina. Hopkins too gives a strong performance, although I do with he had been given some better scenes to work in. The only one that really doesn't work too well is Reeves who should have never been given this role. While everything on the technical level is masterful, I'd have to blame Coppola for the majority of the film's lacking story. It really feels as if Coppola was so worried with the look that he forgot to do much with the story because in all honesty I was bored from the first ten minutes to the end. The film, running 127 minutes, feels twice as long and I can't help but wonder what went wrong here. I know many are going to get caught up in the story and perhaps rightfully so but this film has never worked for me and it's obvious that it never will.

Even though there are several movies I have yet to see, this one is definitely somewhere on top of my list of the greatest movies ever. Sometimes you'll come across a movie that will keep you thinking for days and weeks to come and in my opinion, this is one of those movies.The plot centers around Karen Blixen, who moves to Africa with Baron Bror Blixen, and marries him there. She is not in love with him and her real interest in him is his title, which he is quite aware of. Karen, who is not familiar with the African language or customs, struggles at first to establish her person, but with her kindness and eagerness soon starts to make people respect her. She also meets Denys Finch Hatton and Berkeley Cole, who are captivated by her way of telling stories. When the war breaks out, Bror leaves to fight with the British and Karen starts to realize that she actually wants him to be there for her. After a tragedy strikes, she has to accept that her wish will never come true and she starts turning to Denys...In my opinion, there are several key things that make this movie the masterpiece it is. First of all, the acting is probably some of the best I've ever seen, especially from Meryl Streep. It is true, that there are few, if any actresses, who can keep up her with her strong presence and aura. She completely vanishes in her role as the ambitious, but left alone Karen Blixen and brilliantly shows us the conflict her character is in. Robert Redford's performance is nothing short of hers, and it is a scandal that he did not receive an Oscar nomination for his role as Finch Hutton, a charismatic hunter, who is just not willing to form a bond with anyone to closely. Klaus Maria Brandauer also deserves a nod at his point. He frequently manages to dominate the scenes he is in, even though he has a lot less screen time than Redford or Streep, a shame.

Brian Cox is Hannibal Lecktor, who remains safely locked away and plays a minor part in the hunt. Joan Allen is a blind woman taken captive by Noonan and saved from slashing at the last moment.It precedes The Silence of the Lambs, by the same author, William Harris, but is independent and not quite so commercial. I GUESS it wasn't as commercial anyway, since it didn't receive nearly the media attention that Silence of the Lambs did.I'm not sure why. Maybe because it didn't have Jody Foster in the lead, and lacked Anthony Hopkins' touches as Horrible Hannibal. But William Noonan brings his own kind of menace to the role of the tooth fairy. Noonan is a strange-looking guy. The character is supposed to be seven feet tall and he's shot in such a way as to make the claim convincing. He's balding and dolichocephalic and always speaks in a direct, matter-of-fact mid-American voice. He's far more ambiguous a character than Hopkins, to whom I'm comparing him because he and Hopkins are the chief villains in each film. Noonan can feel human emotions. He sensitive. He meets the blind photographer, Joan Allen, and is attracted to her, so he takes her to a veterinarian friend and lets her feel the fur and the fangs of a giant narcotized tiger. Well, that's quite a thrill for her, so she seduces him. Can you imagine Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector being seduced? It's only later, when Noonan comes to believe that Allen has betrayed him, that his cool rage emerges.Tightly directed, except for a couple of action-scene clichés that appear in slow motion. The image of a red dragon has cropped up now and again during the film, and when Noonan's bullet-riddled body is spread eagled on the floor, the blood spreads out from his torso like dragon wings. The photography is uninviting -- not that it's inappropriate -- with all the lights apparently being fluorescent. Or, if they happen to be blue or pink, they seem to be coming from neon signs. It's summer but the entire film seems to be filled with chill.There are some gruesome scenes that might disturb some people, though maybe not much more exuberantly horrifying than some of those in Silence of the Lambs. Okay, so there's a man strapped in a wheel chair, set on fire, and rolled down the ramp of a parking lot into the camera with flame streaming behind him. True, it's worse than what my dentist does to me, but it's no more shocking than what Richard Widmark did with a wheelchair in Kiss of Death.

It's only later, when Noonan comes to believe that Allen has betrayed him, that his cool rage emerges.Tightly directed, except for a couple of action-scene clichés that appear in slow motion. The image of a red dragon has cropped up now and again during the film, and when Noonan's bullet-riddled body is spread eagled on the floor, the blood spreads out from his torso like dragon wings. The photography is uninviting -- not that it's inappropriate -- with all the lights apparently being fluorescent. Or, if they happen to be blue or pink, they seem to be coming from neon signs. It's summer but the entire film seems to be filled with chill.There are some gruesome scenes that might disturb some people, though maybe not much more exuberantly horrifying than some of those in Silence of the Lambs. Okay, so there's a man strapped in a wheel chair, set on fire, and rolled down the ramp of a parking lot into the camera with flame streaming behind him. True, it's worse than what my dentist does to me, but it's no more shocking than what Richard Widmark did with a wheelchair in Kiss of Death.

Brian Cox is Hannibal Lecktor, who remains safely locked away and plays a minor part in the hunt. Joan Allen is a blind woman taken captive by Noonan and saved from slashing at the last moment.It precedes The Silence of the Lambs, by the same author, William Harris, but is independent and not quite so commercial. I GUESS it wasn't as commercial anyway, since it didn't receive nearly the media attention that Silence of the Lambs did.I'm not sure why. Maybe because it didn't have Jody Foster in the lead, and lacked Anthony Hopkins' touches as Horrible Hannibal. But William Noonan brings his own kind of menace to the role of the tooth fairy. Noonan is a strange-looking guy. The character is supposed to be seven feet tall and he's shot in such a way as to make the claim convincing. He's balding and dolichocephalic and always speaks in a direct, matter-of-fact mid-American voice. He's far more ambiguous a character than Hopkins, to whom I'm comparing him because he and Hopkins are the chief villains in each film. Noonan can feel human emotions. He sensitive.

And then there are those that don't, but deserve to. Donnie Darko is one of those movies. What can only be described as an unclassifiable masterpiece, Donnie Darko explores the world of a seemingly disturbed teenager who is visited by a disturbing bunny named Frank, who tells him to perform certain actions before the world comes to an end. I'll refrain from going into any further detail and instead describe why this film is widely regarded as one of the most original films of the past decade. From the setting, to the cast, to the well plotted storyline, every aspect of the Donnie Darko film is memorable. One montage that is the most well constructed in any film is when Donnie arrives at school with his friends, and the song Head over Heels is playing. No dialogue is used while we are introduced to very important characters, instead the music's lyrics and the subtle gestures from the actors gives us great insight. This film is about love, family, acceptance, social expectations, and sacrifice. Multiple viewings may be required to help better understand the concepts of the film, which can be interpreted a number of different ways. But it is well worth it. The original version of the film is my favorite, while the director's cut tends to lend more of a helping hand to the storyline. The bottom line Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece of a film, you'll be hard pressed to find a more original and well acted movie.

A new group of teenage scientist, on a spaceship, find him and decide to thaw him out. Guess what happens. I believe it was John Carpenter in an interview who was asked if he'd return for another Halloween movie and he asked what else could be done. Carpenter joked they could send Michael to space and I'm going to guess Sean Cunningham and gang heard this and went ahead with this movie. This is a rather strange film because on one hand it has a lot in it to like but on the other hand it's just too stupid to take seriously. What I did like about the movie is the effort of trying something new even if it didn't work out as great as they were hoping. I think more of a flat out spoof would have helped things but as they have it now, the half spoof stuff just doesn't work. The characters are just so downright stupid and annoying that you can't believe any of the set up. Just look at the scene where Jason is thawing out and two of the scientists are wanting to have sex. This scene, as well as many others, just stick out like a sore thumb. There are some very good moments including one rather long sequence where a SWAT team goes after Jason who must in return pick them off one by one. We also get one of the most memorable kills in the series when one scientist has her face frozen before Jason crushes it on a table. The science-fiction look also comes off rather poor but this here is due to the low budget. There wasn't a single time where I actually felt like we were in outer space. The film does have a fairly nice ending and a great joke involving two cyber girls. As far as the New Line canon is cancered, this is a major step up from Jason Goes to Hell but this isn't enough to enter the top films from the series.
