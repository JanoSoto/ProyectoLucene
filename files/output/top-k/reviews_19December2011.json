The truly nerdy film fans (i.e. the ones who take movies far too seriously, the kind with large bellies, in their 20s and 30s, living with their parents, and with a copy of Das Kapital under their pillow) might debate for days on end whether people in LF were turned into zombies or vampires. I suppose if were to call them zombires (or vampombies) we could settle that quickly and get the nerds to focus on some other irrelevant detail in movie-land.The way Mathilda May escapes from the research facility is rather silly.

One would think that a bloody NAKED FEMALE ALIEN BROUGHT FROM A SPACE-SHUTTLE would be under observation 24\/7, by a dozen people at any given time. Not to mention that nearly all the people involved in the project are heterosexual males (then again, this is London, so I may be wrong), so really there should never have been a single solitary second during which Mathilda wasn't under very very very careful scrutiny.Speaking of which, Mathilda May couldn't have been surpassed by a better choice for the role.

Yet this 1937 classic is worth revisiting not only for its famous Gershwin numbers, but as the last of a series of classic-format films between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Deeply flawed, yet the tremendous effort poured into its production is evident. And, when viewed as part of a series, touchingly beautiful.Utilising talent from their earlier films, Shall We Dance pushes the established formula of light romantic farce coupled with stunning dance routines. But here are many innovations and subtle references to delight fans. At the end of their previous film together (Swing Time), Fred serenaded Ginger with the song Never Gonna Dance, so Shall We Dance? suggests a delightful comeback through association. Their respective characters have grown through successive films, as has their on screen relationship. Now, for the first time, both play fully fledged divas in their own right. Fred is Petrov, a Russian ballet star, and Ginger is Linda, a celebrated jazz dancer. Many of the gags involve rumours about the characters being secretly married or having children. By way of a complex plot, half conducted on a transatlantic liner, the couple do actually get married for the first time in their films together. Copy pictureThe star personas of both Astaire and Rogers have been carefully managed by the studios since their debut together in Flying Down to Rio (1933). Fred woos her with increasing conviction or intensity in each successive movie. To suspend disbelief effectively, the audience has to be thoroughly confused for a while about the nature of their relationship (in real life, both Astaire and Rogers are married to other people at this time). The on screen characters are not married at the start of the story &#x96; Fred is pursuing Ginger, as usual. But an offhand comment by Petrov to an over-persistent admirer (to the effect that he and Linda are secretly married) is blown up by the newspapers in the story. The only way they can dispel rumours is to get a divorce &#x96; which means they first have to get married.In terms of dance routines, most things had been done already, so Shall We Dance has to come up with something new. One idea is a duet on roller skates. Depending on which account we read, it took filming up to fifty takes to complete (unusually, as Fred would mostly insist on a single one). It's filmed in Central Park, and the idea is to make it look like something people would naturally be doing. It's also the longest dance Fred and Ginger have together in the film, and is made even more enjoyable by their singing Let's Call the Whole Thing Off.Another innovation is the way the story line is tied up. (Note &#x96; a light spoiler follows, but I think it's worth knowing what is coming in this case, so as not to miss the full effect). Petrov, now distraught that Linda won't dance with him, has a choreographed scene where he serenades with numerous showgirls who wear Linda masks. This in itself recalls earlier scenes involving a dummy positioned next to a sleeping Petrov, to 'prove' in the tabloids that they are married; and also in a flick-book he has that creates moving images of Linda. Unbeknown to Petrov, Linda yearns for them to be together. She insists on being taken backstage. Petrov's dance involves unmasking the lookalikes only to find that none are the real Linda. When he touches the real Linda's chin, he finds it is not a mask but really her. She extends her hand and, whoever the 'real' Petrov and Linda have been (they both have several identities even within the film), the audience is satisfied that the real living couple finally have a dance of love. Almost all the emotion of the film has been saved for this moment.Shall We Dance not only reprises two established stars; it examines the real life pressures and glare of publicity facing them. They were both under pressure during filming, Ginger Rogers received a real-life extortion notice and a death threat to her mother. The movie's final dance scene maybe hints at something that is beyond words, beyond the glare of the limelight, and something eternally personal &#x96; as the song implies They Can't Take That Away from Me.The film's weaknesses include living up to expectations when a formula has peaked.

The plot and characterisation has weaknesses too &#x96; Astaire is a very accomplished dancer performing balletic moves, but he was the first to admit he is no ballet star. Dance fans may feel unconvinced (similarly, the songs have been covered by much more competent singers). One of the main dance routines sees Harriet Hoctor, not Ginger, imported to dance with Fred &#x96; largely on account of her ability to tap through remarkable back-bends.

Its intent is to give us an offbeat look at society without taking itself too seriously. So if you go into this film expecting something HYSTERICALLY FUNNY (says the Washington Post), you might be disappointed.Another caveat this film is not about disabled people--not like, say, Shine or My Left Foot. True, the plot is about a sorority girl who gets into an inappropriate relationship with a mentally challenged boy, but that's just a metaphor for what the film is really hitting us with. The film simply uses this metaphor to illustrate the screwed-up norms of human society. Pay attention early on to the speech Christina Ricci gives about how sororities & fraternities end up dividing us, labeling us and creating differences where none really exist. I believe that encapsulates what this film is trying to tell us about our world, and you'll realize it's a lot more than just a romantic comedy.In order to fully appreciate this film, you CANNOT take anything at face value.

Almost every scene will have you wondering if the filmmakers were being ironic, and that's the beauty of unravelling a film such as this. It's very subtle but well executed, almost like Hitchcock's brand of humour in Strangers on a Train which, similarly, pokes fun at the veneer of polite society hiding the screwed-uppedness beneath (in fact, Pumpkin has a tennis scene that's reminiscent of the tennis scene in the Strangers).I'm not sure if everyone will like Pumpkin but I sure did.

Almost every scene will have you wondering if the filmmakers were being ironic, and that's the beauty of unravelling a film such as this. It's very subtle but well executed, almost like Hitchcock's brand of humour in Strangers on a Train which, similarly, pokes fun at the veneer of polite society hiding the screwed-uppedness beneath (in fact, Pumpkin has a tennis scene that's reminiscent of the tennis scene in the Strangers).I'm not sure if everyone will like Pumpkin but I sure did. If you're a fan of the 4 satires I mentioned in my 1st paragraph, I think you'll like it. If so, I highly recommend the Mexican film Casi Divas (2008) about a cut-throat talent competition, and the Spanish movie El Crimen Ferpecto (2004) about a man trapped in a department store overnight. Along with Pumpkin, these are light-hearted gems that make us think hard about the human condition. Oh don't forget Heathers (1988) which fits right in with the bunch, though a bit on the darker side.

There are many very good scenes including, of course, the ending where Scrooge finally makes good to Bob Cratchit who is played by Kermit here. Fans of the Muppets are going to get a real kick out of seeing their favorite characters getting to play the part of famous people from the story. Some of the highlights are of course Kermit but we also get Fozzie Bear doing Fozziewig and who better than Gonzo and Rizzo to play hosts? I think the film made the right choice in letting the Muppets work their way around Caine who is the main star here. I think Caine does a very good job with the part and especially when you consider this is a kids movie and he wasn't allowed to go as far or as dark as some of the previous versions. It appears that the actor is having fun with his fake friends and it also seems as if he's in on the joke and willing to substitute some of the darker moments for lighter ones.

In this decade, it was scarier to be afraid of something that you couldn't see. Jack Clayton proves that this formula works again with a movie that came out two years before The Haunting, and it could almost be its twin in that it is an exceptionally scary, strange, and psychological fright flick. The film is called The Innocents. Based on the famous novella The Turn of the Screw by Henry James, the film centers around Deborah Kerr as Miss Giddens, a young governess that loves children. Her first job is handed down to her by a man who is too busy to handle his niece and nephew, young Miles and Flora. She is aware of the death of the first governess, Miss Jessel, but her only concern is, for the time being, parenting the children. Therefore, Miss Giddens is sent to the beautiful Bly Mansion to take care of Flora while Miles finishes his term at boarding school. But after Miles is expelled from school and returns to the mansion, a newer kind of behavior is exhibited by the children that Miss Giddens finds extremely odd. Their behavior is almost too mature, too secretive. And then Miss Giddens begins to see two frightening figures that, according to the housekeeper Mrs. Grose, are dead. Could the house be haunted? Could the children be hiding something? Or could Miss Giddens be losing her mind?All of the movie buffs that watch The Innocents get the feeling that it's a psychological study disguised as a haunted house movie in that a sense of ambiguity is prevalent throughout the film. Is it ever made clear that Bly is haunted or the children are possessed? No. It is also never truly discovered what kind of twisted relationship Quint and Miss Jessel had, especially with the children. But that allows the movie to lend an idea of uncertainty to the viewer, which is a positive note.Most of the time, it's arguable that Miss Giddens is on the brink of insanity. She knows that what she's seeing and claiming is real, but it might not make sense to others. The film only takes Miss Giddens' side of the story, which makes us feel unsure of ourselves.Thanks to some delectable cinematography from Freddie Francis, The Innocents has a benefit to being black and white. At one moment, when Miss Giddens encounters Quint for the first time, the screen suddenly darkens around the character, setting a mood of unbelievable dread. And that mood stays existent as the movie goes on.Scripted by William Archibald, Truman Capote and John Mortimer (who provided additional dialog for the film), the story's symbolism and motifs are an important part of why the movie creates such fear and sympathy for the characters. Miss Giddens is seen crying and praying in the opening credits, her hands clasped together tightly. She is an innocent, only wanting happiness and peace around her and the children. She is seen this way at the end of the film, returning to her emotionally damaged state. The theme of innocence or corruption brings to mind something pure and beautiful that soon becomes horribly rotten, like the bug that crawls out of a statue in one scene of the movie. This theme is found more, however, in Miles and Flora. Just children, the idea that they are being taken over by the spirits of such horrible people suggests that they have been corrupted and are at a loss of innocence forever afterward.Even though sound effects are key in the film, the score, composed by Georges Auric, is exceptional and elegant. At times happy but other times disquieting, the music is a highlight, and the tune that Flora is constantly singing just brings chills each time you watch the movie We lay my love and I, beneath the weeping willow, but now alone I lie...oh willow I die. And last but not least, the cast is filled with talent. One of the most underrated actresses of her time, Deborah Kerr gives the best performance of her career, showing the right amount of subtlety, sexual repression, and questionable insanity that the character of Miss Giddens requires. Megs Jenkins and Michael Redgrave are also great as Mrs. Grose and The Uncle. Redgrave's screen time is minimal, but he makes the most of it. The performances that easily equal Kerr's portrayal belong to Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin as Miles and Flora, especially Stephens. Facially, he is childlike, but in his body movement, choice of actions, and interpretation of dialog (i.e. Miles's morbid and disturbing poem) suggest maturity and adulthood. In a scene when he intimately and grossly kisses Miss Giddens, he shows no sign of discomfort, reminding us why British horror movie kids are so terrifying.Overall, The Innocents is one of the best horror movies of all time with a hefty amount of symbolism, some excellent performances, an amazing creep-out factor, a fantastically original story, and an ending that leaves you with just as many questions as it does shivers. It's a film that reminds us that nowadays in haunted house horror, we may be used to poltergeist activity, but a real ghost doesn't terrorize much at all. They linger in an area of the house and the mind, leaving a subtle warning that you're never alone.

Such a 'look' is no doubt deliberate on account of the director, as the tricks and games certain people therein get caught up in often resembles a sort of inescapable trap with doom looming around the corner - people becoming flies in a trap already laid by that of a good looking man who's actually rather sour. People indeed speak often of how beautiful nature is, and then it goes and reveals its darker, uglier side.The film follows Joan Fontaine's Lina, a young Sussex based woman with a Christian upbringing and was born into a wealthy set of parents whom occupy affluent surroundings and enjoy the odd fox hunt. One day, on board a train, she encounters Cary Grant's Johnnie. Or rather, he goes out of his way to encounter her. Dwelling in a first class compartment, for which he does not possess a ticket, and eyeing Lina up in a literal manner in as much he begins at the feet and works his way up in a fashion which itself suggests a behavioural pattern, the two strike a brief conversation and successfully come across as two people of similar class backgrounds sharing a quaint train ride home. Johnnie cuts a suave figure, a well spoken and well dressed man of whom is brought to life by Grant in tone perfect fashion as introductions and pleasantries brood before appearing to give way to demeanours that appear wry or dangerous, and Grant takes the character from its foundations to a state of intent superbly; implementing facial expressions and subtle movements forcing both us and the lead into questioning things.In spite of the fact it is quite clearly verbally reiterated that Lina is just too good for a man like Johnnie, the two eventually come together and marry. This is born out of a fair degree of spite on Lina's behalf when she overhears her parents speak ill of her potential for marriage; something which, on top of the fact we are coerced into doubting whether Johnnie and Lina are a match anyway, plants enough doubt as to whether these people and their relationship will work. The bigger picture of things lies with the fact Johnnie reveals himself to have had many-a girlfriend in the past, so many in fact that he counts them instead of the more traditional noun of sheep if he should ever find himself awake at night still trying to get to sleep. A marriage to Lina on a wet and rainy day at a registry office gives way to the reveal he doesn't actually have any money at all and resulting in a tumultuous passage of play around these truths to occur.Cue a lot of aggravation; uncertainty as well as heaps of that titular suspicion, as Lina's world (or is it just her mental well-being?) rapidly comes apart at the seams as Johnnie moves mysteriously and odd things which weren't happening before begin to rear up. Is he after her money, which he will inherit should something 'happen' to her? Is his pet name for her, Monkeyface, merely a misdemeanour? Or is it an ever increasingly awkward sounding insult which runs in perfect tandem to the ongoing troubles unfolding around their existing together. Perhaps there's nothing wrong at all with Johnnie's behaviour, and she is merely feeling the psychological fallout of rushing into a marriage she wasn't ready for with a man she's with to get back at her parents. The film has a lot of fun with the premise, and it is a good; well-built and often fun thriller chock full of the sorts of things which may\/may not be there unfolding in a juxtaposed fashion to that of the Sussex coastline. The film is unfolded in that deft manner which would later become synonymous with Hitchcock's work; there is an awful lot of 1954's Rear Window in Suspicion's lead's psychological second-guessing of herself melded in with hard physical evidence which appears to be right in front of one's self, and yet remains prominently elusive.There is a scene much later on in the film, set in that same house as was mentioned in the opening, in which a police officer pauses to reflect on a series of expressionistic paintings of people or objects engaging or positioned in such a manner that requires a kind of foresight or ability to read into things so as to unearth what the genuine nature of what's being presented to you actually is. Such is what it is the lead faces throughout, a delicate and often poised piece that sees the director etch enough in the way of the terror born out the ambiguity surrounding the routine presence of one man, whilst consistently toying with us in regards to his actions and motivations. It is a sharp and often quite unnerving film which rarely features more than a mere handful of people on screen at one time and is all about the implied actions instigated by someone happening off screen acting as the fuel to the drama.

The bigger picture of things lies with the fact Johnnie reveals himself to have had many-a girlfriend in the past, so many in fact that he counts them instead of the more traditional noun of sheep if he should ever find himself awake at night still trying to get to sleep. A marriage to Lina on a wet and rainy day at a registry office gives way to the reveal he doesn't actually have any money at all and resulting in a tumultuous passage of play around these truths to occur.Cue a lot of aggravation; uncertainty as well as heaps of that titular suspicion, as Lina's world (or is it just her mental well-being?) rapidly comes apart at the seams as Johnnie moves mysteriously and odd things which weren't happening before begin to rear up. Is he after her money, which he will inherit should something 'happen' to her? Is his pet name for her, Monkeyface, merely a misdemeanour? Or is it an ever increasingly awkward sounding insult which runs in perfect tandem to the ongoing troubles unfolding around their existing together. Perhaps there's nothing wrong at all with Johnnie's behaviour, and she is merely feeling the psychological fallout of rushing into a marriage she wasn't ready for with a man she's with to get back at her parents. The film has a lot of fun with the premise, and it is a good; well-built and often fun thriller chock full of the sorts of things which may\/may not be there unfolding in a juxtaposed fashion to that of the Sussex coastline. The film is unfolded in that deft manner which would later become synonymous with Hitchcock's work; there is an awful lot of 1954's Rear Window in Suspicion's lead's psychological second-guessing of herself melded in with hard physical evidence which appears to be right in front of one's self, and yet remains prominently elusive.There is a scene much later on in the film, set in that same house as was mentioned in the opening, in which a police officer pauses to reflect on a series of expressionistic paintings of people or objects engaging or positioned in such a manner that requires a kind of foresight or ability to read into things so as to unearth what the genuine nature of what's being presented to you actually is. Such is what it is the lead faces throughout, a delicate and often poised piece that sees the director etch enough in the way of the terror born out the ambiguity surrounding the routine presence of one man, whilst consistently toying with us in regards to his actions and motivations. It is a sharp and often quite unnerving film which rarely features more than a mere handful of people on screen at one time and is all about the implied actions instigated by someone happening off screen acting as the fuel to the drama. In short, it is well worth the time.

The screenplay and storyline of the movie is not only intense, but deeply intriguing as well. The balance which is struck so masterfully by Tarantino to appeal to a wide variety of movie enthusiasts is what makes the movie spectacular.Being a self proclaimed Tarantino fan, the structure and flow of this movie reminds of his first ever film, Reservoir Dogs. The film was nominated for over 5 Oscar awards, but ended up winning only one, Best Original Script. Winning Best Original Script is no small achievement. This award is a testament to the quality and time that Tarantino puts into each of his movies, and the script and plot line in Pulp Fiction is no different.Additionally, the film has some of the best actors in the modern era starring in the movie. The star cast includes Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames. Jackson and Travolta team up in the movie to play a pair of hit men, contracted to certain jobs by their boss, Ving Rhames. Bruce Willis plays the other hit men that has a personal beef with the boss of Jackson and Travolta. Uma Thurman stars as the wife of Ving Rhames. Finally, Roth plays the psychotic husband of the couple that holds up the diner at the end of film. Each of the main actors in the movie have won at least two awards for their performances in prior films, showing the quality of each actor. Together, all six of them mesh beautifully to create a smooth yet emotional film.After receiving what seemed like no praise or appreciation from the media, Pulp Fiction finally won an Oscar, best screenplay. This is by far the most original and well made film that I have ever seen. Many people have said that because the movie switches scenes and plot lines so much that the movie is unorganized and has no true story line. I couldn't disagree with this statement more.The way that the directors mesh the different scenes and plot lines of the movie is what makes the film legendary. For example, the main storyline in the movie is the combination of Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), two hit men that work for Marcellus (Ving Rhames). At times, the film will show the two men carrying out hits, extorting money, or extracting information by all means necessary. One of the prime examples of this is the apartment scene, in which Jackson and Travolta enter the apartment of a handful of young men, believed to be holding cash and information.After they ask a few questions, poke around for a bit, and find what they need, they make sure that all of the men are dead, preventing them from causing future problems. This is meant to show the business savvy side of Travolta and Jackson, and evoke intense emotion from the viewer. But in the next scene, a completely different type of John Travolta is shown, which is what makes his character so dynamic and appealing to the audience.As Travolta and Jackson's boss leaves town, his boss, Mia (Uma Thurman), asks Travolta to take her on a date. Both of them are clearly high on drugs when they meet, making for an interesting line of action. Travolta takes her to a 1950's diner which doubles as a dance club at night. As the scene progresses, Thurman volunteers them for a dance, much to the dismay of Travolta. Travolta reluctantly accepts, following Thurman to the stage. The dance goes well, as the two perform beautifully and receive a standing ovation from the crowd. But, this is just the beginning of a disastrous night.As the two leave the diner, they return to Thurman's house. As Travolta goes to the bathroom, Mia discovers a bag of heroin, which she mistakes to be cocaine. As Travolta comes back to the living room, he finds her lying on the ground, motionless, with blood running down her nose. This leads Travolta to believe that it is an OD. Travolta brings Thurman to a friend's house, where she is administered an adrenaline shot, straight to the heart. This sequence of the film is a prime example of balancing slow, suspenseful action with intense, on the edge of your seat emotion. No other director has the talent or formula to combine drama, action, mystery, and suspense all into one screenplay besides Tarantino. Grossing over $107,000,000 lifetime, many fans and movie enthusiasts agree with me as well (Boxofficemojo.com). Each time I watch the movie, I realize that it is one of the FEW films that I can enjoy every single time. The legendary actors, skillful directing, and balance of several different plot lines creates a masterpiece. In my opinion, that is why Pulp Fiction is the greatest film of all time.

It's a mindless, joyous, rowdy ride through non-offensive material with two lead actors giving their all and forming simple and sincere chemistry. Now how can you hate a movie like that? The hate that this film has gotten is undeserving, really. It's nothing more than comedic fluff. Slapstick is a hard thing to achieve, and usually dumb laughs are the only thing a movie in this genre does achieve. Tommy Boy achieves great chemistry between two actors, good laughs, and sincere characters all in its short runtime. To begin with, when dealing with slapstick you need a likable, unoffensive star who is capable of being sweet and goofy. Farley just works. And he shows it explicitly here.Plot-wise, the film focuses on goofball Tommy Callahan III (Farley) who has just graduated College and is on to take over his father's company, Callahan Autos. His father (Dennehy) is about to get married again, but collapses and dies while dancing on his big night. Callahan Autos is trying to sell half a million brake pads, and now their time is shortened even more seeing as the death of their boss has left them very vulnerable.Tommy teams up with Richard (Spade), a goody two-shoes employee of his fathers who is jealous of Tommy's nice treatment and ability to be lackadaisical and be rewarded for it, to try and sell as many break pads to different companies across the US so they can make one last attempt to save the company.As you can imagine, the trip is where the duo are going to encounter the most antics. Some are funny, some are tone-deaf and go on for way too long. Tommy Boy does rip off some more successful films like the pool scene from National Lampoon's Vacation, but after a while, it begins to fade into the background and it's something that isn't obtrusive before long.This is a different kind of buddy comedy, because the buddies aren't really buddies, but rather, acquaintances. They're not two best friends hanging out, having fun on a road trip. One's antics leave the other one in a state of overwhelming disgust. Richard becomes Tommy's critic, smart-Alec self-conscious, and verbal abuser. In fact, Spade gets the most laughs out of everyone in the film. Farley is usually the but of every joke, as you'd expect. So maybe Farley isn't a good actor as much as he is a good punchline? Director Peter Segal also worked the camera when it was time to shoot Naked Gun 33⅓ The Final Insult, so it's possible that a year later he'd like to spoof the buddy comedy genre by ultimately incorporating two characters who just simply tolerate each other for much of the film. Of course that is as far-fetched of an explanation I think I ever went for. Tommy Boy is funny and that's all there is to it.

The plot is rather unrealistic as common in this type of films (the premise aside it's hard to believe that Brian couldn't identify the real Abby by her voice - the very feature he'd initially fallen for!) but the characters are not one-dimensional and one can relate to each of the three. Both Abby and Noelle are sweet and warm in their different ways, and Brian the lover is ardent and romantic yet not completely idiotic in his strange situation ) I agree with many reviewers that the phone sex scene is a bit off, but the following scene with the snicker throwing (and his putting it to his heart) makes up for it. It's just priceless. And I think it makes sense that Abby finds it even more difficult to tell him the truth after. The emotional development is delivered pretty well, I enjoyed seeing Brian start to really like Abby (the photographing and, to a degree, the sunset scenes) while still being dazed by combined Abby\/Noelle perfect woman's image, and also Abby\/Noelle interaction involving friendship, jealousy, competition... it really ringed true to me. The sunset scene was a bit off character I mean Brian is far beyond friendly in it and there's undeniable attraction, so one naturally thinks he'd either realize Donna' was the one for him and not Abby, or be considered flirting with his love's best friend in her absence. We actually don't see the former nor want to see the later! Abby's face expression is very touching in it, though. The movie hits its best in the part when Brian figures it all out and later the cafe scene. It gets to your heart to see how people can lose a chance of finding true love (or another good relationship, for that matter) due to their fear of rejection and lies. If the film stopped at this point it would be far more thought-provoking actually, but that would be another genre (and the movie would be Russian or French )).But some of the script deficiency is compensated by acting (esp. Garofalo's). And of course the dog is just dearie. The end lines cracked me up again!

The emotional development is delivered pretty well, I enjoyed seeing Brian start to really like Abby (the photographing and, to a degree, the sunset scenes) while still being dazed by combined Abby\/Noelle perfect woman's image, and also Abby\/Noelle interaction involving friendship, jealousy, competition... it really ringed true to me. The sunset scene was a bit off character I mean Brian is far beyond friendly in it and there's undeniable attraction, so one naturally thinks he'd either realize Donna' was the one for him and not Abby, or be considered flirting with his love's best friend in her absence. We actually don't see the former nor want to see the later! Abby's face expression is very touching in it, though. The movie hits its best in the part when Brian figures it all out and later the cafe scene. It gets to your heart to see how people can lose a chance of finding true love (or another good relationship, for that matter) due to their fear of rejection and lies. If the film stopped at this point it would be far more thought-provoking actually, but that would be another genre (and the movie would be Russian or French )).But some of the script deficiency is compensated by acting (esp. Garofalo's). And of course the dog is just dearie. The end lines cracked me up again!

Last night I was rewatching it at my friends' and couldn't help thinking it was unusually good! I guess it's all those 2000s romcoms with their WC humour and cartoon-like characters showed me the true depths of profanity ) This movie, quite competent in itself, now stands out more in comparison. The plot is rather unrealistic as common in this type of films (the premise aside it's hard to believe that Brian couldn't identify the real Abby by her voice - the very feature he'd initially fallen for!) but the characters are not one-dimensional and one can relate to each of the three.

I will add that Bruce Willis earns respect as a real actor; his star was well towards its apex when he played this role which could really have been done by many character actors who specialize in playing weasels. Willis took this ordinary supporting role and made it into a very memorable and even likable character.What I love about this film is the story itself, in that Sully Sullivan, an aging handy-man, APPEARS to be struggling with his life and what it meant, when in reality an entire town depends on Sullly to be....well....Sully. He is the thread that weaves the whole town and its many stories together. Even the few people who don't like him depend on him.(Possible spoiler) Toward the end, his son sums it all up and even pays him the ultimate compliment when he says to Sully It's not easy being you.

I look at it as a piece of artwork and appreciate the beauty of the storyline, script, and acting. But watching The Deer Hunter, I lost myself. It begins as a movie that is so filled with talent - Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, Robert De Niro - that you can't tear your eyes away from the screen. But by the time Steven, Nick and Michael are in Vietnam, you are not watching Robert De Niro or John Savage. You are watching the experience of thousands of young men who went to Vietnam. You are watching war.I know that the movie is not completely historically accurate. It was filmed in Thailand, not Vietnam, and there is no evidence of American war prisoners being forced to play Russian roulette, but the experience the movie subjects its viewer to is perfectly accurate. The viewer is overcome by Steven's (John Savage's) paralyzing fear of death and . Without glorifying it or making it gratuitous, The Deer Hunter gives a painfully personal account of the experience of war and what it does to a person.I have heard people argue that this movie sympathizes too much with the American soldiers and demonizes the Vietnamese. While this is valid, the empathy that the film conjures is for every person that has ever witnessed or been a part of the inhuman violence of war.The role Russian roulette plays in the movie is a symbolic and poignant one. The game of Russian roulette embodies the experience of Nick, Mike, and Steven as soldiers in Vietnam. The game is extremely violent and the violence is random, not to mention gratuitous and unnecessary by the time it is taken out of the context of war and played as a game for money. But Russian roulette mirrors the life of a soldier in a losing battle in more ways than just violence. The game embraces complete lack of control over one's life. These soldiers had no power and no safety net during the war. And to be able to pull the trigger without regret, or to go on living knowing you could have killed yourself shows a total loss of value for human life, especially ones own. These are things that soldiers and veterans of the Vietnam war had to deal with. This movie surpasses the average film by dropping all self-indulgent dramatics and pretension and becoming the vessel for a genuine human experience. These are the stories that need to be told.
