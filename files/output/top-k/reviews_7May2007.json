Overwhelmed with pity for Hoffman's character, I never gave the film's contents a second thought. Then, in 2004, I finally learned why I had been subjected to so much abuse during my childhood and adolescence by teachers and healthcare professionals that I can not sleep a wink at night. Yes, like hundreds of thousands of angry adults, I was diagnosed with a higher-functioning form of autism. And then my pity for Hoffman's character, or any semblance of respect for the man who wrote him, was replaced by something much, much worse. There is fear, there is anger, and then there is outright hatred. Among autistic individuals who grew up in the 1980s, Ronald Bass is easily one of the most hated men who has ever lived, and his attempt to backpedal to take into account the fact that autism is a spectrum rather than some crippling disease that simply must be cured has only made it worse for him.Aside from being very badly written (real people with high-functioning autism do not scream, cry, and hit themselves just because a variation occurs in their plans), it is also plain ignorant. This is not only apparent in the words of the performers, it is also apparent in the words of its supporters. Dustin Hoffman once said that playing this role was very easy because his character was essentially in a cocoon, while one commenter here tells us that character is totally unable to comprehend the real world around him. Both show such a ridiculous ignorance of autism that it would be funny if this matter were not so damned serious. Even today, as people try to tell us to our faces that we are not autistic because we do not scream and cry when someone breaks wind in our direction, we struggle to get our voices heard among so-called charities that are ostensibly set up for our benefit, yet do not allow our input. Supporters might call Rain Man the way forward for issue films. I call it dehumanisation.It also strikes me as flatly ironic that Tom Cruise, a man so ignorant that he makes creationists seem reasonable, does not like to emphasise his involvement in this film when autism has exploded into a burning issue on the world stage. That should honestly tell everyone who has not yet learned what real people with autism think of the matter all they need to know. The reason why Cruise does not point to Rain Man and claim this is evidence that he knows something about the suffering of the neurodivergent that he also helps contribute to is because a smart agent researched the issue properly and informed him that real organisations representing the autistic such as Aspies For Freedom would have his guts for garters. It also says a lot about a film, and none of it good, when he happens to be the most convincing performer involved. None of the other actors save Hoffman seem remotely convinced about the dialogue they are delivering, and in fact some of them look very concerned that they are coming across as ignorant. Rightly so.It is not often when a singular problem so utterly destroys a film, but the bad writing in Rain Man just utterly takes the cake. In Philadelphia, a real blueprint for so-called issue films, one key piece of dialogue from Tom Hanks describes the stigma and isolation of being infected with an illness that is almost universally fatal. Philadelphia gets it right because it goes to great pains to emphasise that the illness itself is bad enough, but it is the attitude of the beholder that makes it as unbearable to live with as it is. And while Rain Man attempts to do the same, it fumbles the ball by not just displaying ignorance on the part of everyone around Hoffman, but by practically announcing that its makers were just as ignorant, if not more so. Now, with reliable testimonies to the effect that such directors as Tim Burton or Steven Spielberg are on the autistic spectrum, the silence about the erroneous nature of films like Rain Man is literally killing us.You see, in the hysteria that films like Rain Man help to whip up, quacks are convincing parents to use unsound and unsafe medical therapies on their autistic children, with total disregard for the fact that such therapies can and already have resulted in fatalities. Autism cure charities attempt to block the autistic out of discussions of their own affairs, and attempt to negate our objections through exclusion. So when I tell you that Rain Man is not the Schindler's List or Philadelphia equivalent its defenders proclaim, but more akin to Triumph Des Willens, I want you to understand my full meaning here. Over a decade ago, I went to a museum in which products from eras gone by were exhibited. One exhibit, essentially a hall of shame, showed us ugly artifacts such as Darkie toothpaste or other such racially stereotypical adverts that would only be acceptable in a society where a social minority is legally subjected to second-class citizenry. And if we lived in a society that cared as much about the autistic as Ronald Bass would like us to believe he does, Rain Man would be part of a similar exhibit.Rain Man is a two out of ten film. I wish it were possible to give negative scores, but c'est la vie. That people mistake it for a good film about autism is a mark of shame upon the entire human race.

Only later when the plot develops we understand the intrinsic link between each plot device. The dream sequences are highly symbolic and their images represent Sams inner turmoil with his existence. We see later that they take a more sinister turn when he is interrogated and his dreams manipulated by his captors so that the viewer cant tell if what you see on screen is a dream or Sam Lowry's reality or indeed if Sams whole reality is in fact a dream.Brazil is very similar to 1984 and indeed borrows many of its ideas, the most noteworthy of which is the central big brother theme and the control of a totalitarian police state over its people.

Sam Raimi is known for his skills to make his audience involve in the movie and the one trick he does seem to use here is that he actually makes the audience sympathize with the character. That has of course added to the success of the film but takes away a little bit of the heroism out. Peter Parker hardly looks strong and determined and looks a little bit too sad. I would find it cool to be Spider-man but definitely not Peter Parker.And Mary Jane's character cannot be liked. I am sure that the masses do not agree but Mary Jane is shown to be a little cruel and self-centered raising a question as to what is it about her that drives Peter mad.

That has of course added to the success of the film but takes away a little bit of the heroism out. Peter Parker hardly looks strong and determined and looks a little bit too sad. I would find it cool to be Spider-man but definitely not Peter Parker.And Mary Jane's character cannot be liked. I am sure that the masses do not agree but Mary Jane is shown to be a little cruel and self-centered raising a question as to what is it about her that drives Peter mad. More than anything, it convinces me to control myself before falling for anyone.The Goblin character seriously looks like he was taken out of one of those 3-d animation movies. There is very little in this character that looks like it is in flesh and blood in a world we can identify with. This is the cartoonish effect I was talking about. The Green Goblin looks cartoonish. Perhaps modification of his suit and especially his helmet might have brought a bit more realism. And yes, slow down the camera. Bring in a few close ups. Speed is not everything! Overall, the movie is filled with fun and can be enjoyed a lot. But it does suffer from over-use or rather improper use of computer-graphics. A very decent adaptation of the comic book but there was a lot of room for development.

Quoting the first writing that comes up on the screen when the movie starts, the events depicted in the film took place in Minnesota 1987, although at the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred. Fargo tells about a man named Jerry Lundegaard who's in a desperate need of money. So he comes up with an idea to kidnap his own wife, hiring two thugs for the job. Jerry's wife Jean has a father who's rich so the plan is that the father, Wade Gustafson, has to pay the ransom for his daughter, which Jerry will make profit from. Jerry makes a deal with the thugs and carefully plans the whole thing, but things don't go quite as he thought they would.The amazing thing about this film is that it's really a true story, so what you see from the screen is pretty much what has really happened. It's tragic and it's sad. The screenplay's written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen and the movie's directed by the other of the two brothers, Joel Coen. What comes to the screenplay, it's very well written, but in my opinion some things could have been left out. I won't go to the details, as I don't want to give away any spoilers. Although there are those unnecessary things in the screenplay, the movie's still very interesting and detailed throughout. Directing has this nice flow, capturing images of cold landscapes, a coldness, giving the movie this darker edge, which is really like this sort of a background essence of the movie. It's pretty hard to explain, but it's important and necessary for the film itself.William H. Macy plays the role of Jerry Lundegaard and I must say I'm pretty damn impressed of his role performance, one of his best performances yet to date for sure. Macy's one of those actors who can really look believably nervous, which again gives the whole character this huge credibility. His just perfect for the role. Frances McDormand plays the role of a pregnant local police Marge Gunderson, which granted her an Academy Award for the Best Actress in a Leading Role. I agree on the fact that she's amazing in the film, but I really liked Macy's performance much more. There's still one role performance to mention and that is the role of Carl Showalter, other one of the two thugs, which is performed superbly by Steve Buscemi. That is by far Buscemi's best role performance yet to date and I've always honestly thought that Steve's more of a comedian sort of type, but the role of Showalter is a perfect example that he can do drama as well, though the character's is actually hilarious in certain parts of the movie, cooperated nicely by Peter Stormare in the role of the other thug Gaear Grimsrud. Stormare's performance compliments the whole performance of Buscemi, and to me Stormare is always enjoyable, no matter what the role was.Fargo is, all in all, a great movie. It's thrilling, very well progressing and it's filled with great characters performed by fantastic actors. It is definitely a thriller\/drama to watch if you're looking for something consisting of those genres. It's exciting, it's serious and it's a fine example how true stories should be translated on the big screen. Very nice indeed.

It never did! To watch this and enjoy it, you have to be either very drunk, on drugs, or disturbed psychologically. Just think a very colorful, in your face 2 hour music video that makes no sense. I understand what the director was trying to do, but why he did it this way and why it earned so much praise just boggles my mind. I think the director telegraphs his desires for the audience near the beginning, that everyone get as high on absinthe as its characters do. Only then, will this ridiculous movie be appreciated.

It's quite corny actually; you can't escape its B-movie sensibility and as a murder mystery it's not even that clever. What lifts it is the smart dialogue and the neat acting, (Gene Tierney was never better than as Laura), Preminger's cool, detached direction, (you would think he believed he was directing Chekov) and it looks terrific, (Joseph LaShelle won an Oscar for his camera-work), so as an entertainment it certainly works. My worry is that people who ought to know better have elevated it way beyond its station and I'm afraid I, too, have to hold my hands up here.

A lot of people consider it a black mark on Whoopi Goldberg's career. Although it does suffer from a few flaws, its quite watchable, it moves at a fair lick, and is in no way the turkey its often accused of being. Its nowhere near as bad as Theodore Rex. Now that was a turkey!After making her debut in The Colour Purple, Jumping Jack Flash was Whoopi Goldberg's first proper starring role, and a chance to flex her muscles as an actress. And she's up to the task. Some of the plot points of JJF don't always ring true, but its a testament to Whoopi's charm and magnetism that she turns an occasionally ludicrous adventure into a fairly entertaining comedy-thriller.Terry Dolittle (Whoopi) works a computer at a New York bank. Bored of such a hum-drum life, she finally gets a wake-up call from someone who taps into her computer. Someone called Jumping Jack Flash. Jack is in serious trouble. A British agent trapped in Russia, he needs help from Terry. The British Consulate won't acknowledge him, and he needs Terry to run errands for him. Everything from rooting out possible exit contacts on the back of frying pans to breaking into the Consulate itself and accessing their computers. All the while the situation gets more and more murkier, things go from one dangerous extreme to the next, and Terry and Jack's lives are both endangered.Although a lot of people have an astonishing hatred of this film, I can't say the same. I think JJF is great fun, with a twisty screenplay right out of a Kafka novel. It wouldn't be half as fun without Whoopi Goldberg at the helm, but its thanks to her dynamic energy the film's momentum is kept as steady as it is.The film pretty much rests on Whoopi's shoulders. And she does a great job. Delivering the laughs when they're needed, but also establishing a genuine fearful feeling when she gets in over her head. I especially liked the scenes of her conversing with Jack (Jonathan Pryce). There is real poignancy for Jack's situation, because it feels like Terry is the only friend he has.There is quite an exceptional cast too. Granted they tend to get reduced to mere minutes in the spotlight, but because there is such a large gallery of famous faces, they leave a lasting impression. Look out for the late Phil Hartman, Annie Potts from Ghostbusters, James Belushi, Tracy Ullman and even Carol Kane. One thing that surprised me about JJF is there are quite a few actors from This Is Spinal Tap in the film. So keep your eyes peeled for Michael McKean, June Chadwick and Tony Hendra.Penny Marshall made her debut as director here, and she does quite a fine job. She does sometimes overplay her hand, where the film tips over from genuine suspense to overblown farce. Such as the scenes of Whoopi Goldberg's dress caught in a paper shredder, being dragged along the streets of New York in a phone box, or wandering into Elizabeth Arden doped up on truth serum, but for the most part Marshall knows what she's doing. She's not as successful here as she was in her next film Big, her single finest hour, but JJF is still a lot of fun.The ending has genuine nerve jangling tension and equal parts pathos. Her near death at the British Consulate is exciting, although her escape from a police car is contrived. There's no way Terry wouldn't be handcuffed, and I don't know why there wasn't a grille separating the back seats from the front. But the final shootout at the bank is good. And the scene where Terry finally meets Jack is touching too.Jumping Jack Flash sometimes moves in fits and starts, but Penny Marshall's direction is assured at most of the right moments. Whoopi Goldberg hits a lot of the right notes, and its also a film that was ahead of its time in addressing the E-Mail system.So give Jumping Jack Flash a chance.

I must say that Suspiria is defiantly an acquired taste and is probably one of the most weirdest movies I have ever seen. Written by the brilliant Dario Argento who've brought such classics as Demons to our lives comes up with this fairy tale gone bad but shot beautifully, it's definitely one of those movies you'll never forget and the reason why I say it's an acquired taste is that not everyone gets this movie, because it's different, like I watched this movie with some of my friends and they thought it was to artsy and made no sense, but I definitely gets it. Also to add to this movie is the bloody and gory kills which are creative and suspenseful, the opening scene in particular is one of the movie's highlights, extremely brutal and you can really feel the pain as does the barbed wire scene which made me cringe along the flesh ripping, a silt throat, a stab in the neck and lots of bright red blood. I also appreciated the artistic flavor that Argento injected into his human slaughter via a use of bright red blood that looked more like finger paint than plasma. It worked for me.I think that Suspiria has stood the test of time over the years and even by todays standards it's still haunting yet mesmerising with plot turns and a real sense of mystery, a strong female lead and scary ass witches. It seems a pity that these days none of the horror movies that come out has this sense of style they all seem to be about the directer just spending loads of dosh on special effects and actors instead off perfecting a good story line.Jessica Harper (Suzy) was brilliant as the lead displaying strengh and vulnerability that made her outstanding, Stephani Casini (Sara) did fine as the lovable friend. Joan Bennet's (Madame Blanc) classy and somewhat cold presence gave the part the right type of feel. A young Udo Kier (Dr. Mandel) did OK with his small role.

I read the book, and slow witted that I am, didn't understand much of it. How many details can a person produce? E gads! Tom Clancy is obviously brilliant, but the movie sufficed for this lay person.I like Sean Connery, but grew weary of his lisp; maybe the sub echoed with it too much. Sam Neil is always good. Alec Baldwin was excellent, though his gorgeous looks were distracting. I liked the way in which the film slipped from Russian into English.Of course it was submerged science fiction. The Dallas as a decoy? Please. But hey, who said it was accurate? Neither is time travel for Spielberg or light speed for Lucas.

I finally saw it when it got released on video, and understand the glowing reviews.The movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We quickly get introduced to student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a bad-ass expression on her face, and any idea about Diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight. As Diana gets in trouble for this, we then meet her father, an aggressive type in his own right; clearly we can't totally blame Diana for her attitude.But then the movie really picks up, as a new thought germinates in Diana's mind boxing as a way to escape this grim existence. Her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely won't approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do.Just the first few minutes alone identified that I was in for a very gritty, non-Hollywood movie, but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that. Even before they get to any boxing scenes, you feel like you're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally arrive at the film's main story, there's no turning back.All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself\/herself has been sort of a cliché in cinema for many years (Rocky, Million Dollar Baby), but I still think that they did a great job with it here. In fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. Really good. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself in Hollywood movies after this one.

It's a French Do the Right Thing, which is its biggest problem. It apes Spike Lee so much that I don't think it ever finds a voice of its own.

Kind of reminds me of the American film Kids, too. Sure, the film is, I assume, steeped in honesty about its characters. But that doesn't mean I feel sorry for them in the end.

I do not intend to go to sleep by the light of a communist moon, is how Lyndon Johnson (Donald Moffat) puts it. But politics takes a back seat for the most part, as the movie examines what it means to have the right stuff.Director Philip Kaufman presents us with a two-ring circus and challenges us to pay attention. In one are the Mercury 7 astronauts, America's first men into space between 1961-1963, presented warts and all, some cheating on their wives while others cynically tell the media what they want to hear. In the other are the test pilots who came before, breaking the sound barrier and raising the gauntlet for the exploration of space, led by a man of few words named Chuck Yeager (San Shepard) who only wants his $283 a month and a stick of gum before riding a rocket to glory or death.You can't really tell people about heroes anymore without boring them or incurring their resentment. Kaufman wisely makes his case with Letterman-ish snark, playing against the Life magazine myth of the Mercury astronauts even as he adds to the astronauts' legend by telling the truth. There have been complaints, for instance, about the unflattering details presented in this film about the astronauts' training and selection process, involving isolation chambers and sperm motility tests. Kaufman uses this to make a point, however, that the astronauts did more than just risk their lives, they gave up any claim to comfort and dignity.Famously a flop in theaters when released in late 1983, The Right Stuff found new life on cable TV, which is why I'm convinced the movie stands as tall as it does today. The same episodic, whimsical, yet epic quality that made it such a hard sell in theaters brought it new life as people tuned into it unexpectedly on television and allowed its dense brilliance to unspool before them. I still think of Alan Shepard up in his space capsule whenever I am struggling with my bladder, and there's a scene just as wry or as powerful every few minutes for those who pay attention just a little.Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel has shot more memorable frames in movies like Being There and Passion Of The Christ, but The Right Stuff presents probably his finest cinematic showcase, boring in on a hundred moments big and small. The editing team behind Kaufman give him the license to do bold things by keeping focus and not allowing anything to drag out very long, staying alive to history's every beat. What's next, Ridley? we hear Yeager ask after another flight, and immediately we're watching impressionistic shots of Star City, Russia, looking like a vision of Hell as Sputnik is launched and America is put on notice.So many great actors in so many defining roles, it's hard keeping track. Scott Glenn is terrific as the terse Alan Shepard, yet he's in a movie where the other two big parts are filled by a guy named Shepard and another actor playing a character named Glenn. Even smaller parts shine brightly, like Moffat, Royal Dano as a spectral minister, and Harry Shearer and Jeff Goldblum as government emissaries assigned to make the astronaut casting call.The film's not perfect. It makes too much of astronaut Gus Grissom's problems during his splashdown, and overlooks another Mercury astronaut, Wally Schirra, almost entirely. But even the oddest detours, like one to an aborigine camp in Australia, have a knack for paying off.You are looking at a whole new ballgame, says astronaut Gordon Cooper (Dennis Quaid) at one point, and he seems to be speaking both for the Mercury astronauts and the movie we're watching.
