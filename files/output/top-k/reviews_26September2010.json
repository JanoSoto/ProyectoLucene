But while Herzog's Storszek may have been thematically typical of the movement, it's a bit of an anomaly in Herzog's own filmography, whose films, at least at the time, tended to be set in the past and were often structured as allegories or medieval fables.Storszek opens with a mentally unstable musician, Bruno Stroszek, being released from prison. This character is modelled on the life of Bruno Schleinstein, the actor who actually plays Stroszek in the film. Typical of Herzog's work, Storszek thus effortlessly blends fiction and documentary, Bruno, who always seems uncomfortable in front of Herzog's camera, acting as himself in a fictional story based loosely on his own life.Like most of Herzog's films, the tale is told via several symbolic episodes. First act a wet and oppressive Germany populated by violent pimps and prostitutes. Symbols like a shrinking boat and a bird which is confiscated are then dished out, after which Bruno rescues a prostitute and travels to America in the hope of making a better life for himself.Vast and seemingly unrestrictive, America is initially portrayed as a place of possibility and freedom. Gradually, though, Herzog begins to populate this world with his usual assortment of freaks and grotesque characters. More symbols and symbolic subplots are then revealed the story of a local murderer and body snatcher, the fact that Bruno's new hometown was the hometown of Ed Gein, warring farmers who fight over a thin strip of land, obsessions with metal detectors, a crazy old man's insistence that people are magnetic and that the dead emit magnetic fields, dangerous walks on frozen ponds, salty pretzels, mobile homes, a ski lift etc etc.End result by the film's final act, Storszek's faux-documentarian edge completely gives way to a kind of overt surrealism. And so Herzog has Bruno lose his home, lose his girlfriend (who returns to prostitution and leaves him for an obese trucker), and mount an incompetent robbery, all for 32 dollars and a Thanksgiving turkey. Chased by the police, Bruno then flees to a depressingly tacky town whose chief income is a large amusement park operated by Native Indians and awash with machines, neon signs, glitzy diversions, kitschy plastic facades and an assortment of fun-house fakery.Seeking escape, Bruno hops on board a ski lift. He thinks it'll take him up into the mountains, to some heavenly getaway, but of course the ski lift is stuck in a loop and can take him nowhere except right back where he started from. Realizing that the American dream is the German reality, Bruno shoots himself, committing suicide off screen.The film's final shot is of a solitary chicken, trapped in a fun-house, dancing (automatically, seemingly without thought) in a cage and making a fool of itself for bird-seed. This, of course, is Bruno's own trap the Myth of Sisyphus in poultry form, life reduced to a circus act too grotesque to contemplate. Joy Division lead singer Ian Curtis would hang himself in his kitchen moments after witnessing this very sequence.Herzog's cinema is a cinema of madmen (Timothy Treadwell in Grizzly Man, Klaus Kinski's numerous starring roles, the various mystics and deranged prophets peppered throughout Herzog's filmography etc). What's great is that you're never quite sure how nuts these guys are and how sympathetic Herzog wants you to be toward them. But while it's easy to dismiss Bruno as an endearingly simple man-child with a couple screws loose in the head (he is), Herzog's ultimate point is three fold. Yes, the amusement park may violently spit madmen out of its machinery, mad men like Bruno who either reject the illusion or are too damaged to cope. But those chickens whom the machinery doesn't reject are far more insane. Normalcy is irrational, and in Herzog's filmography it is often the mad who see this clearest.

That was shortly after this prequel, featuring a different cast, came to the silver screen, and I remember hearing about this film around that time. Since I was not nearly as impressed during my last couple viewings of 1994's The Flintstones (both many years after my second), I was in no hurry to see The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, especially since I knew it had an even worse reputation than its predecessor. It's been over 2 ½ years since I last saw the first live action Flintstones effort, and I've finally seen this second one, which is unsurprisingly not good.The Great Gazoo is an alien who is sent to Earth by his species to learn about human mating rituals. Back on Earth, in the prehistoric town of Bedrock, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble are two best friends who are both in search of girlfriends. They are the first ones Gazoo sees after he lands on the planet, so he decides to follow them around, even though he annoys them. Meanwhile, a rich young woman named Wilma Slaghoople is fed up with the snobbish people around her, especially her mother, and runs away. She goes to a restaurant and meets a waitress named Betty O'Shale, and they quickly become friends. Fred and Barney go to this restaurant and meet the two women. Fred gets a date with Betty and Barney gets one with Wilma. When the four of them go out together, Fred and Barney end up swapping girlfriends, but both of them are successful with their romance. Both couples are invited by Chip Rockefeller, Wilma's rich and arrogant ex-boyfriend, to his resort in Rock Vegas, but what they don't realize is that this is just a cruel scheme for Chip to win Wilma back! The main problem with the 1994 film is that it simply isn't funny, and that's most certainly a major issue with this prequel as well. The only part of this film I couldn't keep a straight face while watching was the I'm ignoring you part. There's one memorably lame moment with a farting dinosaur, and most of the other gags are just mediocre. I was also not impressed with many of the performances here. Mark Addy may not be bad as Fred, and I guess Stephen Baldwin isn't that bad as Barney, though I definitely preferred Rick Moranis' portrayal of the character in the first film. These performances certainly aren't great, however, and I certainly didn't care for Kristen Johnston and Jane Krakowski as Wilma and Betty respectively. Also, Alan Cumming plays two characters, which are Gazoo and Mick Jagged (obviously based on real-life Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger), and both his performances fail, especially the former, I would say. At the beginning, showing Gazoo with other members of his species on a spaceship before he is sent to Earth, it already looks like this is going to be a very unfunny comedy movie, and unfortunately, that beginning sequence doesn't lie.The first live action film adaptation of The Flintstones was a critical failure but a box office success, whereas The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas was both a critical AND box office flop. After watching it, that doesn't surprise me. I can't really think of anything wrong with the 1994 release other than the absence of laughs, but I would say that REALLY brings it down if quality, since it is supposed to be a comedy. Just like its predecessor, this prequel failed to make me laugh even one time, but this second film of the two also has inferior cast performances, and maybe a slightly more boring plot as well (I'm not 100% sure about that, as it's been a while since I last watched the first film), which makes it even worse. I only found it a BIT worse than the 1994 film, and don't absolutely hate it like many others clearly do, but some could find it a LOT worse, including some of those who like the first film. If you don't like 1994's The Flintstones, you probably wouldn't like this prequel. If you do like that movie, there's probably STILL a good chance you wouldn't like Viva Rock Vegas.

She goes to a restaurant and meets a waitress named Betty O'Shale, and they quickly become friends. Fred and Barney go to this restaurant and meet the two women. Fred gets a date with Betty and Barney gets one with Wilma. When the four of them go out together, Fred and Barney end up swapping girlfriends, but both of them are successful with their romance. Both couples are invited by Chip Rockefeller, Wilma's rich and arrogant ex-boyfriend, to his resort in Rock Vegas, but what they don't realize is that this is just a cruel scheme for Chip to win Wilma back! The main problem with the 1994 film is that it simply isn't funny, and that's most certainly a major issue with this prequel as well. The only part of this film I couldn't keep a straight face while watching was the I'm ignoring you part. There's one memorably lame moment with a farting dinosaur, and most of the other gags are just mediocre. I was also not impressed with many of the performances here. Mark Addy may not be bad as Fred, and I guess Stephen Baldwin isn't that bad as Barney, though I definitely preferred Rick Moranis' portrayal of the character in the first film. These performances certainly aren't great, however, and I certainly didn't care for Kristen Johnston and Jane Krakowski as Wilma and Betty respectively. Also, Alan Cumming plays two characters, which are Gazoo and Mick Jagged (obviously based on real-life Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger), and both his performances fail, especially the former, I would say. At the beginning, showing Gazoo with other members of his species on a spaceship before he is sent to Earth, it already looks like this is going to be a very unfunny comedy movie, and unfortunately, that beginning sequence doesn't lie.The first live action film adaptation of The Flintstones was a critical failure but a box office success, whereas The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas was both a critical AND box office flop. After watching it, that doesn't surprise me. I can't really think of anything wrong with the 1994 release other than the absence of laughs, but I would say that REALLY brings it down if quality, since it is supposed to be a comedy. Just like its predecessor, this prequel failed to make me laugh even one time, but this second film of the two also has inferior cast performances, and maybe a slightly more boring plot as well (I'm not 100% sure about that, as it's been a while since I last watched the first film), which makes it even worse. I only found it a BIT worse than the 1994 film, and don't absolutely hate it like many others clearly do, but some could find it a LOT worse, including some of those who like the first film. If you don't like 1994's The Flintstones, you probably wouldn't like this prequel. If you do like that movie, there's probably STILL a good chance you wouldn't like Viva Rock Vegas.

I think this is because Hollywood during and after WW II ended up helping Americans define the narrative of what it meant to be an American.

Because the US had no single racial identity that others we defeated had, the notion of a real (meaning white Christian) American was fabulated, together with a notion of collected values, that previously were incidental and unrelated. Hollywood's war gave understanding and thereby meaning. People felt good about themselves. The economy flourished; racism became more vile; political movements were born. So when we ended up in Viet Nam without thinking, these values polarized a people. One group clung to this notion of honor in the blood, the other reacting to it, mostly just as a reaction. But one group had the guns, the White House, the lies and a resurgence of fundamentalist Christianity. This film marks a major shift in that public meme.
