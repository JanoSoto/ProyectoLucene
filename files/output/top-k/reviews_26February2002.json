He spends 99% of his time starting up clubs and putting on plays. He doesnt, however, spend enough time on his school work. He meets Herman Blume after attending a speech Blume gives at Rushmore. Blume is immediately taken by Max's ambition and the two become friends.Shortly after, Max falls in love with a teacher at Rushmore, Ms Cross. He gets kicked out of Rushmore because of his bad grades and subsequently turns his attention to her. She becomes his Rushmore. Unfortunately, Blume falls in love with her too.This movie is, for lack of a better word, a masterpiece. Everything about the movie, from the acting, to the writing, to the direction are fantastic. Wes Anderson is a direction genius. His movies are very original, and still have a wide appeal. Anderson co-wrote this picture with Owen Wilson. The two also teamed up for Andersons' Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums, in which Wilson co-starred.Jason Schwartzman, in his first role, is endearing as Max Fisher, an overachieving underachiever. Bill Murray takes a chance with Herman Bloom, a type of character he is not accustom to. Personally, I think he should have at least been awarded an Oscar nomination for this role, but the Academy turned a blind eye, much like they did with Gene Hackman in The Royal Tenenbaums. In any case, it may be the best role of his career. Rounding out the excellent cast are Olivia Williams(Ms. Cross) and Seymour Cassel(Max's dad, Bert).

This is George Miller at his most dementedly brilliant and vivid imaginative yet.I have a story to tell. Even though I liked the first movie, I wasn't interested in seeing the second film because the first film is a bit too fluffy and I expect the same from the second movie although I'm familiar with George Miller's past work (most notably the Mad Max trilogy). However, my father offered me, my little sister and her two male friends the option to see Babe Pig in the City at a dollar theatre. I reluctantly accepted. But when I saw this film with the sparse few in the audience, it was an astounding filmgoing experience that's rarely duplicated. I was so overjoy by the sheer magic and wild imagination of the movie that I wanted to rejoice Praise George! in the dark screening. My dad, sister and her friends were, what shall I say, blown away. It's rare I cried at the movies - in particular, the injured wheelchair dog\/heaven scene hit me so hard I choked up and let tears roll down my creek, if only for a brief time. This is real emotion and pure film magic without the treacly manipulation and saccharinity of another (terrible and sickeningly manipulative) 1998 box office hit Patch Adams.Sadly, Babe Pig in the City suffered poor marketing and terrible timing, released in competition with Disney's A Bug's Life (which I admit to seeing on the first opening weekend). It was a big box office flop. The audience reaction was overwhelmingly negative because they expect the same from the first movie but were so surprised and appalled by the dark elements in Babe Pig in the City they were upset - overprotective parents and emotionally sensitive children and even close-minded\/ignorant moviegoers - and spread bad word of mouth, thereby ensuring the failure of the second film at the box office. Even before the film was released, George Miller had a difficult time editing some of the crucial scenes on the cutting floor because the test screenings were very negative and he needed to squeeze in time to complete the most complex visual effect shots just in time for release. This is a tragedy and a murder at the box office by audience apathy.What I mean when I said tragedy is that George Miller was said to be contemplating the second sequel with the cast from two Babe films. When the second movie bombed in North America, it bombed so badly one of Universal Studio execs was fired for greenlighting this movie with an unheard-of budget of $80 million and the plan to produce the third Babe movie was scrapped.Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel (bless his soul) unequivocally praised this film to the utmost extent of their ability at the end of 1998. They loved the film so much they never seem to get enough out of it. Read Ebert's amusingly jubilant and overly enthusiastic review - he said this film is even better than the original because it IS original, albeit a second in the series, and did not follow the sequel formula which makes it daring and groundbreaking in terms of originality AND sequel being *better* than the first (Toy Story 2 aside).Despite the flaw of the second film due to the heavy editing, we owe the great ingenuity of George Miller for Babe Pig in the City's awe-inspiring magic and hard-hitting emotion pertaining to the theme of life, redemption and death, not to mention fantastic production design, visual effects and cinematography by Miller's creatively talented crew.
