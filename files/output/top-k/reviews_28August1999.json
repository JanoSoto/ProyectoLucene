If you're wondering what event turned good, honest, flesh-and-blood aliens into vapid, doe-eyed angels, watch `Close Encounters' and find out.  People believed in this movie.  I mean, really BELIEVED.  Since it was released, alien abduction stories and manufactured anecdotes about Roswell have multiplied in the press, and they always feature the SAME aliens the floppy mystics on display here.  Perhaps we can't blame Spielberg; but in his place, I'd be embarrassed.And in a way it IS his fault.  Any sense of urgency this lethargic film manages to drum up comes about only because it seems to be saying, `This kind of thing might really be happening!'  Thinking about the movie as a kind of documentary is only charitable, since it's so dull otherwise.  For the awful truth is that Spielberg's aliens aren't just a blight on the popular press - they're BORING.  They're also incomprehensible.  They rush around doing alien things for three hours or so, kidnap a few people, land, play a Wagnerian motif at us several times, and then fly off.  Does this interest you?  Well, perhaps it would help if we see events from the perspective of a man who becomes (for some reason) obsessed by these aliens.  With any luck some of his obsession will rub off onto the audience.  Obviously it did rub off on some people.  To be charitable to those people, perhaps they were naïvely expecting some kind of pay-off at the end.There is one good thing about this film, and it's the musical score, by John Williams.  (And I'm not talking about the aforementioned five-note motif.)  I gather he liked the movie, and it's just as well, because he poured a lot of real musical material into it.  It's one of his best efforts.  There's one defect even here, though the jarring way he interpolates `When You Wish Upon a Star' towards the end.  It's by this and a couple of other references that Spielberg tries to claim an affinity between his film and `Pinocchio' (1940).  I'm surprised Disney didn't sue for defamation.

I'm not saying not to see this film because this is one incredible movie. But what I am saying is Everybody Knows is a song about a bunch of things that people do to deceive, cheat, lie, coerce, judge by race and many other issues that virtuous people believe that they could never be a part of. Pump Up The Volume is an important film because it shows how difficult life can be for everyone. Whether you are rich, poor, brilliant, not so smart, loner or popular socialite, we all have our problems. And this shows it from a high schoolers perspective. I think Pump Up The Volume was perhaps the complete antithesis of fun teen movies like a lot of the John Hughes comedies that came out in the 80's. Not that his films didn't show kids with their share of problems growing up, but this one is much grittier, much darker and more angry than Sixteen Candles, Fasttimes and even The Breakfast Club. PUTV had a lot to say and those of us that did see it when it came out instantly related to it. Mark\/Harry brings up a lot of issues that we should all pay attention to. And I think this film relates to people on a level that very few films can. It talks to it's audience. It has insight, it has advice and sometimes it just says that it understands.Every generation has their own version of stress When you are elderly, perhaps you are worried about when your number is up. Maybe you worry about if your retirement fund is adequate enough to survive on. When you are in the prime of your adult years, perhaps you worry about how your kids are turning out, if the mortgage is going to be paid on time, if your job is secure, taxes and such. But when you are a teen your worries may not seem all that great to some adults but when you are feeling secluded, or left out, or geeky or a failure because you can't live up to your parents expectations, or you feel like a loner because you don't play sports or you don't have as much money as some of the other kids, those are very traumatizing issues. That is what this film does. It breaks down barriers and shows that kids have a voice. Kids have a mind and if it is allowed to be used properly, then that voice can help others. Maybe even open other eyes to some of the inequities that surround us. Pump Up The Volume has so much to say and so much of it gospel. I really believe that this is more of an important film than people gave it credit for. It should be checked out. Besides all the hoopla that I just ranted and raved about, it does have a great cast, great music, a wicked story, and it is funny in many parts. So it does have something for everyone. But there is so much more to this film than what is first thought of. Maybe if films like this were more adulated, then we could see the warning signs for things like Columbine.

Two hours later, I left the theater exhilerated by one of the best and most surprisingly intelligent action films since THE MATRIX.   The 13th WARRIOR is an excellent addition to a sadly underused genre, the period epic actioner.  Not since BRAVEHEART has a film included such large scale exhilerating combat sequences, skillfully directed by action auteur John McTiernan.  While many may not believe that this as good a film as DIE HARD or HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, I strongly believe that in terms of direction alone, this is McTiernan's crowning achievement.Amazing action sequences aside, the intelligence in this film lies within its roots.  The film is essentially a retelling of the classic epic Beowulf.  Instead of the valiant knight Beowulf, you have thirteen valiant warriors.  Instead of Grendel, you have a huge clan of mysterious cannabalistic creatures.  The same questions surrounding Grendel apply to them.  Are they animal or man?  Or perhaps something even worse?  Having knowledge of the Beowulf epic does enhance the film, as the story has some holes you may not understand if you are not familiar with the epic.  The same may hold true for the book, which I have not yet read, but very well may after seeing this film.   The film also includes another great action performance by Antonio Banderas to add to his exciting turn in MASK OF ZORRO.  It also includes a supporting cast who should be commended for endowing their roles with such character even with only a few lines of dialogue.   Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies like Mel Gibson's BRAVEHEART or John Boorman's EXCALIBUR, which I also recommend to anyone who has not seen it and enjoys this genre.  I highly recommend to those who enjoy this film that they track down a translation of BEOWULF and enjoy the epic poem from which this high-powered film is derived.

The singer has a troubled teenage daughter.  The handyman and the singer engage in a courtship.  Then they set out on a sailing voyage.  (The handyman was once a fisherman, you see.)  Then... well I'm afraid to give away the ending. Actually, I cannot give away the ending to this film, because it does not have one.The posters for Limbo define the title as  A condition of unknowable outcome.  Limbo, I suppose, describes the state in which the characters find themselves.  But it also clearly describes how the audience is left hanging.  I'm sure there is a singular, artistic statement being made here.  I just don't know what it is.If this movie baffles me, why am I giving it **1\/2?

Then try watching John Carpenter's Vampires, which to me, is a cool hybrid of The Lost Boys with Mad Max. It's a great change of direction for the old genre of vampire movie, because it includes elements found in an action film as well as the usual horror routines. The performances in this film are awesome, especially by James Woods, who plays the macho vamp-hunter Jack Crowe. Daniel Baldwin is Crowe's tough sidekick, and Sheryl Lee is the hot-yet very doomed girl Jack tries to save. Thomas Ian Griffith, who plays a bad guy for the 3rd time, is Valek, a really scary-looking bloodsucker that makes Dracula look like Don Knotts! If you are looking for a great Halloween film to watch after viewing another cool chill film Army of Darkness (see my past review of AOD and you'll know what I mean!), Vampires is the right choice. Be warned though, if you can't take graphic violence such as disembowelments and close-ups of bloodsucking, this film is NOT for you!!
