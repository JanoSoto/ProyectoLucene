A brilliant mixture of great direction,acting,special effects,score and screenplay making this a all time classic horror film. This is Carpenter's greatest film and It's not only my all time favorite Horror film it's one of my favorite films of all time period.The Thing tells the story of 12 researchers in a u.s outpost in Antarctica with nothing really happening until the researchers discover that an alien that came to earth years before is stalking them and killing them and imitating them. Which raises the questionWho can you trust?Released in the Summer of 1982,John Carpenter's The Thing came out at a bad time having been released three weeks after Director Steven Spielberg's Blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial a much lighter take on Alien life and The Thing was ignored by audiences and hated by critics. Thankfully,The Thing has become a Cult Film and is now considered a classic and one of the best Horror films of all-time and the praise is rightfully deserved. The Thing is a film I love for many reasons because it brilliantly works as Horror film and Remake. One of the reasons I love the film besides the direction and special effects is the paranoia aspect of the film and when the characters stop trusting each other and start wondering who's human and who's not and Carpenter creates a dark end of the world feeling where the end will come from either aliens or man's own disturbing self destruction. The film is scary and frightening not just because of the effects and atmosphere but because of the characters and how they react when the alien invasion happens. It's very believable,scary and gives the film it's edge. This film was released before AIDS and HIV was more known around the world and Carpenter's film could be a metaphor. Even though The Thing is a Horror film,the issues and themes of fear,paranoia and distrust is still relevant in today's world.The screenplay by Bill Lancaster is superb and well-written giving the film and characters great lines and dialog. We don't know much about the characters and who they are but,we know them well enough to feel sorry for them and don't paint the characters as faceless victims. The snow and cold adds to the dark and frightening claustrophobic feel of the film and you feel isolated like the films characters where you feel that there's no where to go and no salvation for the men. The only film that can match the chilling and dark atmosphere is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Both films in my opinion are the two of the most terrifying films ever set in the winter and make me never,ever want to stay in a house or a hotel by myself in the snow. The Thing also succeeds as a remake and one of the rare occasions where the remake was different and better than the original.Where in Howard Hawks The Thing From Another World the alien was a big and large Frankenstein-like creature,The Thing in this film looks different every time it transforms so the alien can look and different and sound different each time and it's very inventive and terrifying. The Thing was the first in Carpenter's great apocalypse trilogy which also includes other Carpenter classics Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness. While none of these three films have nothing in common in terms of story lines or characters the thing they all have in common is the concept about the end of the world. The Thing is my favorite and the best of the trilogy because of the storyline themes,characters and great ending which has been discussed for many years. The Thing also moves at a fast pace and never slows down until the very end. The violence and gore in the film are intense and brutal truly match the horrifying tone of the film and the violence happens you as the viewer will feel it and will be disturbed. The ending of The Thing is uncompromising,dark and will have viewers talking about the ending for years,leaving you with many unanswered questions than easy answers and wouldn't fly in today's Hollywood and it's one of my all time favorite movie endings and one of the reasons the film is truly brilliant and why I love The Thing. The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Kurt Russell is excellent as R.J MacReady,the man who becomes the leader when things fall apart. A.Wilford Brimley is great as Dr Blair the doctor who goes crazy. Keith David is wonderful as Childs and is tough as nails. Donald Moffat is effective as Garry bringing depth and sympathy to the role. T.K Carter is great as Nauls and brings some humor to the film. Richard Dysart(Dr.Copper),David Clennon(Palmer),Richard Masur(Clark),Charles Hallahan(Norris),Thomas Waites(Windows),Joel Polis(Fuchs)and Peter Maloney(Bennings)give great performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant because Carpenter is always moving the camera giving the film a since of dread,eeriness and doom of not knowing what's going to happen or where. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by Ennio Morricone is frightening and scary and matches the dark,grim tone of the film. One of Morricone's best scores.The special effects by Rob Bottin are excellent some of the most ingenious,bloody,gory imaginative effects in film history. Shocking,surprising and unexpected,Bottin's effects set the standard for make-up effects still hold up years later.In final word,John Carpenter's The Thing is a flawless Horror classic that is amazing from beginning to end and is a film that belongs in every Horror fan and movie buffs collection and is John Carpenter's greatest film.

Would I do what Ben said and stay in the boarded up house, or what Mr. Cooper suggested by going down into the cellar and wait for help? Both options are set up for doom unfortunately.

As a film director he was also exceptionally pig-headed and obsessive, who frequently drove those he worked with to the point of desperation. A light touch was something he did not have. Some people think all his films are different. In fact, they all exhibit very similar and highly annoying characteristics. They are badly paced, since he appears to have had a poor idea of cinematic timing the inflexibility, and fixed nature, of his stills photography training constantly shows through. The shots are composed as if they were intended to be totally static. An example in this film is the interminable build-up to the final battle. Often there are passages of excruciating slowness.Secondly, in almost every picture there is at least one actor who is driven wildly over the top, usually from being forced to undergo a prolonged series of takes which render him near-demented. The prime example is G.C.Scott in Strangelove, but there are many others. Kubrick may not have been responsible for the casting of Tony Curtis, but the actor's performance here as a singer of songs bordered on the ridiculous.Thirdly, although Kubrick relied on using scripts by gifted writers he seems to have constantly wanted to distort these scripts along his own lines. The adaptations he made were not constructive, and never improved the stories. Authors he mistreated in this way included Burgess, Clarke, Nabokov, King, Schnitzler, etc. Typically, Burgess felt that Kubrick had used him as a film publicity pawn, according to Wikipedia. Burgess later called him Sidney Labrick. Malcolm McDowell shared these feelings, and spoke harshly about Kubrick. As evidence, both novelist and actor cited Kubrick's uncontrolled ego, made manifest in the film credits the only author credited is Kubrick. The sole thing truly great about Kubrick was his gigantic ego. If he was dim-witted, why was he so successful and rich? Bloody-minded doggedness does it, is the answer. Brawn bludgeons, beats and baffles brains.Kubrick once remarked that Spartacus is the only film on which I did not have absolute control, and this must be why it still retains superior qualities, sadly lacking from his later painful disasters like Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut and so on. Curtis is reported to have written that Kubrick's greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors. The ambiguity of this comment may have been because Kubrick perhaps was still alive at the time Curtis published it. Several actors fell out permanently with Kubrick Douglas, Brando, Scott, for starters. You might call these relationships one-on-one, if your tongue was in your cheek.In spite of Kubrick, Spartacus is a splendid, entertaining and fascinating film epic, featuring fine performances by several outstanding actors Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov, Strode, Lom, besides Simmons and Douglas. At this stage in Kubrick's career, all these personalities outweighed him, and, although I'm not totally certain, I don't believe any of them ever worked with him again.. The script is intelligent, perceptive, and often quite witty, although it tips over into excessive sentimentality at the end. The final ropy shots of Douglas on the cross make me think that Kubrick was trying to sabotage the film. However, allowing for the different eras in which they were made, it is a fundamentally better film than Gladiator. Both of these are far inferior to Troy, however.

As a film director he was also exceptionally pig-headed and obsessive, who frequently drove those he worked with to the point of desperation. A light touch was something he did not have. Some people think all his films are different. In fact, they all exhibit very similar and highly annoying characteristics. They are badly paced, since he appears to have had a poor idea of cinematic timing the inflexibility, and fixed nature, of his stills photography training constantly shows through. The shots are composed as if they were intended to be totally static. An example in this film is the interminable build-up to the final battle.

But if you have the staying power to participate in this emotional tale of two cursed lovers, watch and await, a film experience that is truly quite unique! The film is beautifully shot, and every time the frame fills with imagery of mountains and forests your heart yearns to walk the country shown on screen. When you think that this film was made in '85, and that today's genre films aren't considered complete without their epic cinematography, I'd say LADYHAWKE was something of a predecessor to films like LOTR. The score however is something you'll either love or hate. I personally would have preferred it if the film had a slightly different score, not so electronic, but a bit more staid. Then again, the buoyant score does a good job of saving the film from seeming too devastatingly solemn. Though LADYHAWKE was marketed as a fantasy (IMDB, Amazon and the like seem to link it with films like WILLOW), I prefer to look upon it as mytho-poetic. After all, the story is set in the real world, in 12th century Italy. This vast, gorgeous landscape of high mountains, misty forests and rolling meadows is overseen by the serpentine Bishop of Aquila (John Wood). In the dungeons of Aquila, a young and talented peasant crook named Philipe (Matthew Broderick) escapes. The Bishop, fearing that his unassailable power might be damaged by the audacity of the fugitive, dispatches a squadron to find and capture him. As Philipes antics continue, events finally unite him with the mysterious figure of Navarre (Rutger Hauer), and his loyal hawk. The two strike up an alliance, and Philipe gradually becomes embroiled in a very tragic and tangled reality Navarre is doomed to transform into a wolf every sunset. His hawk is no hawk at all. In her true form she is Navarre's love, Ysabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer). The lovers have lived this way for many years, under a curse, put upon them by none other than the Bishop himself...who lusted after Ysabeau, and summoned the curse as a means to end his own perpetual wretchedness. Navarre, Philipe, Ysabeau and a sympathetic monk, Imperius, embark on a mission to end the curse and exact revenge on the corrupt Bishop.The events of the story unfold rather objectively, which is a shame. There are moments in the film when you relate perfectly and easily to the tortured passion that lies at the core of the story. However, there are also moments when the characters come across as a little too unflustered by the situations they find themselves in. Brooding blonde Rutger Hauer in particular seems to express very little anguish at his characters predicament, and spends most of his screen time in a state of cool, calm, gallant pride. I took his casual manner to signify how embittered and hopeless his character has become, but nevertheless, there were times when I wished he would do something other than mutter. Also, as the fight scenes in the film are noticeably very strange and at times gawky, I began to feel that Hauer was not being given the liberally proportioned epic moments his character deserves. The scene in which Navarre confronts the Bishop has a very laboured feel to it, but maybe this was deliberate? Michelle Pfeiffer is, as ever, stunning; she has too little screen time to draw us deeply into her character, but when she does appear on screen, she is formidable, majestic and brave. Matthew Broderick is charming as the cunning but likable Philipe, and his performance acts as the resin of the film that holds everything together. Over all, I give the film 8\/10; it certainly isn't perfect, but the film exudes a poignant, haunted and mythic mood that every romantic will contentedly lose themselves in.

And it would hold its ground despite heavy competition of Coppola's well received Godfather films and the critically acclaimed Scorsese's gangster epics. Made 13 years after his previous picture, Leone's interlude as a producer didn't take away his passion to get the America project that was in the pipeline finally going. Eventually it bore fruit and would also turn out to be his ultimate one, and maybe his best. In it the former master of spaghetti westerns takes the time to tell a multifaceted story and crams several whole gangster lives into a nearly four hour long epic, still complaining about essential 45 minutes that he was forced to cut. Well, that's Leone for you...At any rate the result is an operatic classic based on the quasi-autobiography of a gangster turned informant, packed with period details of the 1910s, 30s and 60s. It's a nostalgic trip through half a century with time as the key player that washes over the viewer like a mesmerizing, beautiful dream in an opium den, however at the same time feels like a violent nightmare commenting on themes of past vs. present, memory vs. dream, love vs. desire and above all betrayal vs. friendship. Add to the extensive script that was honed for years an array of beautifully photographed scenes, breathtaking Technicolor cinematography and a truly numinous score, and you've got yourself a masterpiece. For it all is married with such a tremendous amount of meticulousness for details that one can't help but get lost in the gangster world of Lower East Side of Manhattan. Aside from Leone's superb visuals, the accompanying music that links times and suggests themes needs special mention as it single-handedly raises the aesthetic level of the whole production by another notch. Created by Ennio Morricone, the famous memories evoking melancholic pan pipes not only fit the film's emotional ride through passing time, but also help to transcend it.The flashback story, with bits and pieces falling into place like in a jigsaw puzzle, is what makes the films so overwhelming, so emotionally intense. This time around a Leone picture however is not so much about landscape and close-ups, but about characters and their environment, the area they live in and their history. De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello let it all come alive. And at the side of the young Jennifer Connelly the 13 year old unknown Scott Schutzman Tiler plays the young version of the protagonist Noodles and nearly steals the older one's thunder, which is no other than De Niro. On the one hand the street urchin's lightheartedness shines in the character's youth while the veteran actor immerses himself so completely in the aging gangster that the weight of his past becomes almost palpable.Sergio Leone not only made Henry Grey - the man on which the story is loosely based - a larger-than-life monument, but also himself as a grand narrator of adult fairy-tales. Actually, Once Upon a Time in America is two movies in one, and the overarching flashback structure makes it an unforgettable experience. All that of course was butchered on US release that sank the picture - even more reason to re-discover it as it was intended to be seen, in all its nostalgic glory.

Well, that's Leone for you...At any rate the result is an operatic classic based on the quasi-autobiography of a gangster turned informant, packed with period details of the 1910s, 30s and 60s. It's a nostalgic trip through half a century with time as the key player that washes over the viewer like a mesmerizing, beautiful dream in an opium den, however at the same time feels like a violent nightmare commenting on themes of past vs. present, memory vs. dream, love vs. desire and above all betrayal vs. friendship. Add to the extensive script that was honed for years an array of beautifully photographed scenes, breathtaking Technicolor cinematography and a truly numinous score, and you've got yourself a masterpiece. For it all is married with such a tremendous amount of meticulousness for details that one can't help but get lost in the gangster world of Lower East Side of Manhattan. Aside from Leone's superb visuals, the accompanying music that links times and suggests themes needs special mention as it single-handedly raises the aesthetic level of the whole production by another notch. Created by Ennio Morricone, the famous memories evoking melancholic pan pipes not only fit the film's emotional ride through passing time, but also help to transcend it.The flashback story, with bits and pieces falling into place like in a jigsaw puzzle, is what makes the films so overwhelming, so emotionally intense. This time around a Leone picture however is not so much about landscape and close-ups, but about characters and their environment, the area they live in and their history. De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello let it all come alive. And at the side of the young Jennifer Connelly the 13 year old unknown Scott Schutzman Tiler plays the young version of the protagonist Noodles and nearly steals the older one's thunder, which is no other than De Niro. On the one hand the street urchin's lightheartedness shines in the character's youth while the veteran actor immerses himself so completely in the aging gangster that the weight of his past becomes almost palpable.Sergio Leone not only made Henry Grey - the man on which the story is loosely based - a larger-than-life monument, but also himself as a grand narrator of adult fairy-tales. Actually, Once Upon a Time in America is two movies in one, and the overarching flashback structure makes it an unforgettable experience. All that of course was butchered on US release that sank the picture - even more reason to re-discover it as it was intended to be seen, in all its nostalgic glory.

And it would hold its ground despite heavy competition of Coppola's well received Godfather films and the critically acclaimed Scorsese's gangster epics.

In Sum, Ryan and Cathy are still dating, only becoming engaged at the end of the film and the Soviet Union is long gone. From that standpoint alone, the timing is off sequence, which can make for a bit of a conflict for those of us who have read Clancy's novels, or seen the previous films. For the uninitiated, the film is terrific, and opens up the possibility of an entire new series (which was never pursued, apparently). Cromwell and Freeman are striking in their roles, as is Ciaran Hinds as the Russian President. The remaining cast, McGill, et. al., are intense when they need to be and absent when not needed. Which is the problem with a film like this, since you have so much action going on it is easy to get lost in it. Rated PG-13 for violence and language, the terrifying scene of a nuclear weapon going off in a crowded city is enough for all of us to consider whether or not to let the kids watch.

I love his reaction when Stiller's Lt. Patrone character offers his theory of how the hijackers plan to get away with the loot by flying the subway to Cuba You're a sick man, Rico.The real sick man in this movie is the great Robert Shaw as the lead hijacker, who goes by the alias Mr. Blue. Shaw excelled at playing functional psychopaths, not to mention dangerous train passengers, and here he keeps the suspense on a low boil throughout. He doesn't want to kill anyone, not because he's a nice guy, but because he's a perfectionist who doesn't want anything to upset his plans. This sets him at odds with his trigger-happy associate, Mr. Grey (Héctor Elizondo).Matthau's got his own problem associate, the trainmaster who's probably feeling guilty about the subordinate he sent to visit the endangered car, and their back-and-forth makes clear this is a shaky bit of business for all concerned.Director Joseph Sargent makes a very dynamic, functional story hum with minimal drag.

I suspect Lumet got the idea for shooting his Washington Post interiors in All The President's Men from the gritty way the Transit Authority office is shot here, with those hot florescent lights that contrast so wonderfully with the dark subway scenes.What else to say? David Shire's masterful score will keep you on the edge of your seat whenever it starts up, and the editing by Gerald B. Greenberg and Robert Q.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"27 May 2012","score":"","review":" In 1958 and in 1972, audiences were able to see the most vile of all alien life forms come onto the screen; the blob. But the word vile would not be in the interest to use for these films. The blob in both previous films were slow moving and were barely on screen and when they were, it wasn't for long. Thirty years after the first blob movie, director Chuck Russell, The Mask (1994), takes charge of this franchise and decides to rejuvenate this creature once more. And although, it had a mild reception from critics, it is arguably the best movie of The Blob.The film actually starts out relatively the same as the first in 1958. However, there are several parts to this film's story that are quite different from all the others. For example, in the 1958 version, Steve McQueen starred as the so-called hero, a good-natured kid who was only trying to warn the residents of a flesh eating Jell-O mold. The viewer may be surprised however to find out, that the hero is not who they'd expect it to be.Kevin Dillon plays Brian Flagg, a punk whom nobody likes just because he's a little bit misunderstood. Co-starring with Dillon is Shawnee Smith who plays Meg Penny, a good schoolgirl whom which both encounter The Blob. Another thing that is different from the other films is that this movie doesn't have the main characters trying to find the authorities and convince them of what happened. It seems that the authorities find them more than half the time. Interestingly enough, Russell's direction put quite a twist on the beginning story line. It may not be original, but it definitely good to see something out of the ordinary.There were only a couple elements in this remake that did not really work here. The music was composed and conducted by Michael Hoenig. His music did have a lot of dark tones in it, but it failed to leave a memorable chord and it wasn't scary enough either. The other element that needed work was the dialog. Not all of it was bad, Dillon had some funny exchanges between characters with his wisecracks. But the issue was that much of it was predictable. The viewer will be able to tell what will happen next even before it happens. It's actually disappointing for a remake that was done this well.However, the good outweighs the bad by far. The Blob is so much more appealing to see for its grotesque and vulgar look. The Blob is no longer that solid maroon color from the past two films. To describe it in the most simplistic way, it looks like a mass of human brains that were mashed together as a whole. It really is a mess (in a good way) and that's not all. This particular Blob not only has looks, but is also quick on its feet! The special effects in this film are stunning.

But the word vile would not be in the interest to use for these films. The blob in both previous films were slow moving and were barely on screen and when they were, it wasn't for long. Thirty years after the first blob movie, director Chuck Russell, The Mask (1994), takes charge of this franchise and decides to rejuvenate this creature once more. And although, it had a mild reception from critics, it is arguably the best movie of The Blob.The film actually starts out relatively the same as the first in 1958. However, there are several parts to this film's story that are quite different from all the others. For example, in the 1958 version, Steve McQueen starred as the so-called hero, a good-natured kid who was only trying to warn the residents of a flesh eating Jell-O mold. The viewer may be surprised however to find out, that the hero is not who they'd expect it to be.Kevin Dillon plays Brian Flagg, a punk whom nobody likes just because he's a little bit misunderstood. Co-starring with Dillon is Shawnee Smith who plays Meg Penny, a good schoolgirl whom which both encounter The Blob. Another thing that is different from the other films is that this movie doesn't have the main characters trying to find the authorities and convince them of what happened. It seems that the authorities find them more than half the time. Interestingly enough, Russell's direction put quite a twist on the beginning story line. It may not be original, but it definitely good to see something out of the ordinary.There were only a couple elements in this remake that did not really work here. The music was composed and conducted by Michael Hoenig. His music did have a lot of dark tones in it, but it failed to leave a memorable chord and it wasn't scary enough either. The other element that needed work was the dialog. Not all of it was bad, Dillon had some funny exchanges between characters with his wisecracks. But the issue was that much of it was predictable. The viewer will be able to tell what will happen next even before it happens. It's actually disappointing for a remake that was done this well.However, the good outweighs the bad by far. The Blob is so much more appealing to see for its grotesque and vulgar look. The Blob is no longer that solid maroon color from the past two films. To describe it in the most simplistic way, it looks like a mass of human brains that were mashed together as a whole. It really is a mess (in a good way) and that's not all. This particular Blob not only has looks, but is also quick on its feet! The special effects in this film are stunning.

Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star left me disgusted that such an inhumane, inept, and socially unacceptable character had gotten his own feature length film and was doing things that didn't constitute for human on any social level to laugh at, that I nearly lost all faith that a good movie could ever be made by anyone even involved in the film. And as for The Waterboy, all I can say the character was easily the most unlikable of the unlikable for that year.Joe Dirt is more of the same formula, only manipulated slightly. Construct a character, ugly, indecent, and such an easy target for bullying and make him the lead character in a comedy so we can follow him along on one contrivance after another just to watch the poor sap become the butt of every joke. The manipulation of the Madison formula comes stems from the Joe Dirt character himself, who is mildly likable for one reason; he is not abusive, violent, or incorrigible. He has been given every form of hell, that his way of closure is just peacefulness and passiveness. He can actually be a fairly suitable misfit role model for Bucky, Happy, and the Waterboy, although that may be pushing it.But on with the movie; David Spade is Joe Dirt, in an unfortunate role after two hilarious ones in both Black Sheep and Tommy Boy. He is the hardcore, outrageous, mullet-headed (it's a wig by the way, since apparently he was born with a cracked skull) dolt who works as a custodian for an LA radio station, and resides in the luxurious boiler room of the joint. In a spur of the moment decision, Joe Dirt is forced to join the verbally abusive shock-jock Zander Kelly (Miller) on the radio (the character seems to have picked up David Spade's smart-ass qualities from Tommy Boy pretty well), where he is forced into talking about his life over the course of the next few days live on air.So we are presented with flashbacks with occasional interruptions of Dirt's childhood, where he was abandoned at the Grand Canyon by his parents, when he met the most beautiful girl in the world (Daniel) and her mean-spirited boyfriend (Kid Rock), along with trying to cope in a world where he is unwanted.The audience can vaguely side with the man because he is one of the few Happy Madison anti-character studies that doesn't make humor out of the character bringing things on himself. Instead, it focuses on the idiotic things the character says throughout the picture as a means to act tough and make humor out of the contentious interactions he has with others. He is an inept idiot, and one that confuses the audience. This is where the paradox of Madison films comes to life; we are supposed to root for this character during oppressive times, yet laugh when he is made fun of.David Spade is fine as the character, sometimes but rarely striking any laughs, and the atmosphere is muggy and brutal, like in many Sandler films. Sandler is not in the film, but has a producer's credit on it, and many of his regulars like Allen Covert and Kevin Nealon make quick appearances in, so the film replicates the close to home feeling they always have.I suppose if you have liked previous Sandler features, you're likely to enjoy this one. The main problem with Joe Dirt is, like its character, it is so desperate for attention that it will go to great lengths to achieve it, never erecting some form of credible discipline. The script becomes monotonous, as the character collides and travels down the long, straight road to the next comedy setup, the jokes are mild, unoffensive, and muted because of the rating, and Spade's performance is less than commendable.

In fact, I'd argue that it's probably near the top, as far as faithfulness goes. Unfortunately, there a few things wrong that kind of drag down my rating.I like Miguel Ferrer, so I was pretty excited when I found out that he starred in this movie. As I expected, Ferrer is the high point of the movie. Dees is one of those characters that you love to hate, and he was done to near perfection. Unfortunately, given that film is such a visual medium, it was more difficult to get into Dees' head than the short story, but that's pretty much an obvious and unavoidable issue. Still, Dees' commentary in the short story was the best part, leaving me feeling slightly sad that much of his internal dialogue was missing.As far as the other actors, they were all pretty much passable. None of them were ever bad, at least. A new character was introduced, as a foil to Dees, I suppose. Usually, when this happens, it's a disaster, but I thought it was handled fairly well. Unfortunately, the actress, Julie Entwhisle, was one of the weaker elements in the movie, in my opinion. She wasn't bad, but she wasn't great, either. Dan Monahan, as the editor, played his character as a cheerfully sleazy bastard. I usually dislike comic relief in my horror movies, but it was done well enough here that it didn't bother me. Michael Moss, as the Night Flier, was fine. Other people really seemed to enjoy him, but I did not find his performance particularly memorable.I guess what really bothers me is the plot. This is not unique to the movie, of course. I really don't understand what possessed Stephen King to write a story about a vampire who flies a Cessna. I'll just say it this is a stupid idea. However, the story really does work, even though the main conceit is too wacky to take seriously. I like how Dees and the vampire serial killer are compared and contrasted, even if it is a bit heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. Nonetheless, it raises interesting questions about morality, ethics, and the role of sociopaths in our society. Still, it's difficult for me to just let go of the ridiculous idea of a vampire flying a Cessna. I mean, really? That reminds me of a hilariously bad European movie I saw once about a haunted elevator. Yes, that's right, it was about a haunted *elevator*. I think it was titled Lift, if you're morbidly curious.While somewhat generic, there are times when the movie does rise above being your average direct-to-video King adaptation. Some of the special effects from KNB are quite good. There's a fairly well-done homage to Night of the Living Dead near the end. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was frequently a bit flat, leaving you with gross-out effects or grisly, black humor, rather than suspense. Certainly, that's not bad, but it makes for a somewhat less fulfilling horror movie. Instead, I think Night Flier works better as an exploitation movie, since it's so lacking in atmosphere, tension, and suspense.Some people were disappointed by the ending, but I found it to be perfectly acceptable and perhaps even satisfying. If I sound a bit unenthused, then keep in mind that many King adaptations end up being dismal failures, and that finding even an average or mediocre one is something of a coup. While not High Art, this is still enjoyable enough to recommend to other King fans, even if they're only familiar with the movie adaptations.

Unfortunately, the actress, Julie Entwhisle, was one of the weaker elements in the movie, in my opinion. She wasn't bad, but she wasn't great, either. Dan Monahan, as the editor, played his character as a cheerfully sleazy bastard. I usually dislike comic relief in my horror movies, but it was done well enough here that it didn't bother me. Michael Moss, as the Night Flier, was fine. Other people really seemed to enjoy him, but I did not find his performance particularly memorable.I guess what really bothers me is the plot. This is not unique to the movie, of course. I really don't understand what possessed Stephen King to write a story about a vampire who flies a Cessna. I'll just say it this is a stupid idea. However, the story really does work, even though the main conceit is too wacky to take seriously. I like how Dees and the vampire serial killer are compared and contrasted, even if it is a bit heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. Nonetheless, it raises interesting questions about morality, ethics, and the role of sociopaths in our society. Still, it's difficult for me to just let go of the ridiculous idea of a vampire flying a Cessna. I mean, really? That reminds me of a hilariously bad European movie I saw once about a haunted elevator. Yes, that's right, it was about a haunted *elevator*. I think it was titled Lift, if you're morbidly curious.While somewhat generic, there are times when the movie does rise above being your average direct-to-video King adaptation. Some of the special effects from KNB are quite good. There's a fairly well-done homage to Night of the Living Dead near the end. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was frequently a bit flat, leaving you with gross-out effects or grisly, black humor, rather than suspense. Certainly, that's not bad, but it makes for a somewhat less fulfilling horror movie. Instead, I think Night Flier works better as an exploitation movie, since it's so lacking in atmosphere, tension, and suspense.Some people were disappointed by the ending, but I found it to be perfectly acceptable and perhaps even satisfying. If I sound a bit unenthused, then keep in mind that many King adaptations end up being dismal failures, and that finding even an average or mediocre one is something of a coup. While not High Art, this is still enjoyable enough to recommend to other King fans, even if they're only familiar with the movie adaptations.

In fact, I'd argue that it's probably near the top, as far as faithfulness goes. Unfortunately, there a few things wrong that kind of drag down my rating.I like Miguel Ferrer, so I was pretty excited when I found out that he starred in this movie. As I expected, Ferrer is the high point of the movie. Dees is one of those characters that you love to hate, and he was done to near perfection. Unfortunately, given that film is such a visual medium, it was more difficult to get into Dees' head than the short story, but that's pretty much an obvious and unavoidable issue.

Like I said in the summary, I really don't know what to say or how to explain why it was so good but Ill give it a try. First off, the acting was incredible. Osmett, in my opinion, is the best child actor ever. Im almost afraid he wont be able to top what he did in this movie. Then again, I never thought he would top The Sixth Sense! Secondly, there were so many elements to this story you really need to watch it more than once. Narration was incredible and the vision of the future was spot on as so many futuristic movies have us living far beyond the technology that the movie dates itself in. The ending, Oh the ending! Its much like a M. Night Shyamalan film as it comes out of nowhere! I don't think anyone could honestly say thats where they thought the movie would end. On top of all this was a simple plot of an old fairy tale (or maybe a fairies tail) that is timeless in its own right. This movie can be seen by the whole family or at least by those children who can put it all together. Call me crazy but I made a point to read Pinocchio to my kids again, knowing they may watch this movie later on and understand it as I did! A must see, and then see it again.
