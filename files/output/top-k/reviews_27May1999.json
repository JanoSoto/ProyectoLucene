Basically, my problem with the criticism this movie has taken is, WHAT DID PEOPLE EXPECT????? It seems as if the Star Wars of old have gone from action, adventure movies that left you feeling good when you left the theatre to a modern times Hamlet trilogy. Shallow characters, thin plot line, too much childish humor are the main flaws pointed out by the detractors of this movie. The reality of it is, however, that ALL the Star Wars movies, maybe save Empire, had the exact same flaws. Was A New Hope that involved in the characters? Was the dialogue Tarantino esque? Was the plot line complex, with millions of little nuances that only the most astute movie goer would pick up on? Or, was Star Wars the greatest good evil movie\/s to ever come out? I think it is the later.Most of us fell in love with these movies when we were children, and though I can't imagine ever finding Chewy annoying, all of us who have waited for this movie have to take that into account when we villianise Jar Jar Binks. When I first saw the movie Jar Jar literally ruined the first half of the movie for me, but seeing it again I was able to tolerate him with much more ease. Though many of the scenes didn't need as much humor from Jar Jar as they ended up having, he is a character for the children to fall in love with, and they have. My little cousins, one 11 and the other 7, both went to see the movie last night and loved Jar Jar. They loved the exact things we, as avid fans, found annoying. There is a sense, I believe, by most of us who grew up owning all of the little action figures and watching the movies everyday after school, that these movie belong to us. That somehow Lucas owes us the best of the best, with absolutely no flaws. The fact is that this movie is truly for a new generation. It is for the kids who are the exact same age we were when we fell in love with this movie. While I was leaving the movie theatre on May 19th I heard many youngsters, some a little older than others, saying that they didn't know much about the old Star Wars but that they had loved this movie sooo much that they were going to go and rent the other three movies. That is what this movie is about.For all of you who hated this movie, or came away from it feeling let down, I advise you to see it again, or maybe even two more times. Go and just have fun. Don't think about how much more developed Qui-Gon could have been or how Obi Wan and Darth Maul could have been given bigger roles. Don't go in expecting Jake Lloyd to give an Al Pacino performance or Natalie Portman to be Princess Leia. Go to just have fun.

No movie has ever been captured, with such beauty, and elegance, from the sets to the c.g.i, to the fighting scenes. It's incredible Lucas has created a masterpeice, i heard some bad reviews, and to those who gave it bad reviews shame on you for missing the point... This movie has humor, FX's, Action, and the beginning of a love story which i believe, will be the best ever set on film. The old saying when lucas came out with A.N.H was, they don't make movies like this what i say is they should make more movies like this. Unlike the other great movie of the year, and probably the best movie of the year, till T.P.M came out of course the matrix, T.P.M, has more eye candy, and humor to hold you in your seats, and believe me i was hook't to the screen, i mean i had to use the rest room for like an hour during the movie, and did not go cus i did'nt want to miss out on anything. I'm so glad i didnt use the rest room. =0) Lucas has combined what i believe is some of the coolest looking characters in films history, and the casting of Liam Neeson as QUI GON JIN was perfect, i believe he has played the role he was born to play. And as for Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi, i have been a fan of his since trainspotting, and was ecstatic when i heard he was casted for this movie, and i think he is as perfect to play the role of Obi Wan Kenobi i think he pulls it off really well, especially the fight scene. But he was not the main jedi knight in it, and probably will have more screen presence in episode 2. As for Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala she was good in it, and she looks great in it, she is becoming a very beautiful woman, so i think she is also perfect for this movie, and she did a good job in it, so it works out fine. There is tho something about the film that botherd me well two things in fact, one that Darth Maul does not come out more in the movie, i have become his biggest fan, he looks so damn cool in that make up, and that double lightsaber is to die for... I hope some how someway he is back in episode 2, even tho he had something happen to him, which i won't say cus i don't want to give anything at all away, i want people to see this movie for them self's... But needless to say he is the best looking, character in the movie, he looks evil and by just looking at him, you can tell what he is all about, he is one hell of a character, like i said i want more maul, this is where i beg i guess, i know the chances of mr lucas seeing this review is slim to none, but in case he does see it, here is what i have to say, please please please, have maul back in episode 2, i mean i know millions of people would be blown away if he is back, and in more of the movie. I know i'll be happy to see him again... I mean the times he is on the screen i was jumping up and down on my seat on the edge almost screaming. Now to the second problem i had with the movie, simply put it was too short, i think it could have been another half hour long, so that we could have seen A more maul, B more of Liam Neeson C more of the queens, building relationship with Anakin Skywalker, speaking of who i thought young  Jake Lloyd was not great but not bad in it, he did a good job considering he is a kid, and all, i think he has a great future in the buisness... But getting back to my second problem with the movie, yes i would have like't it to be longer, for those reasons. But the good thing in all this, is that there is yet another one coming out in 2 years, so mr lucas can get all the info from us the fans, and see what we like, and dont like, so that he can shape the next one to fit the demand of the fans... I know what my demad is MORE MAUL.  =0) In all from a scale of 1 - 10 this movie is an 11, i mean you add everything in and you cannot do anything but marvel at how well made this movie is, and now i know lucas has had 20 plus to make this scrip't come to life, but still i think he has out done himself, i mean out of all the STAR WARS movies, this is without a doubt the best one, hands down, and i love the old trilogy mind you, i like them a lot but this movie is just incredible, i have seen it twice now, and plan on seeing it again like 30 more times, before the years over, so mr lucas you get an A+ from me, good luck on episode 2...

It was incredible and extremely fun.  As both a movie fan and a Star Wars fan I was blown away by this film. For that reason, I feel I must reply to some of the criticisms I've read about this film.  There was one person on this page who put it best in saying that anybody that disliked this movie just does not know how to have fun.  I think that is true and is a shame, because the same people who loved the original movies as kids 20 years ago have now grown up into cold-hearted, pedantic nit-pickers more interested in having a religious experience at the movies than having fun.  This movie was fun and captivating.  Many people have said that there was not much of a plot. That could not be more untrue.  There is a great plot filled with political intrigue.  Many people have said there is no character development.  The whole movie is spent developing Anikin, who is supposed to be the main focus of these three films.  Many people criticized young Jake Lloyd's performance, which I thought was excellent.  I've even heard people criticize Natalie Portman's performance, and she was incredible in this film.  People have compared this film to Episode 4, saying it did not have the heart or was not as good.  Come on, Episode 4 was a bad movie... it was hoaky and cheesy and campy and that was what made it great.  You cannot compare the two films. You've got different characters, different actors, different technology, different times, and different movies.  If you want to see the same old movie, then just stay home and watch the original trilogy on tape.  I've also seen the term Star Wars purist thrown around and you can basically through that out the window.  IT'S A MOVIE!!!! And in addition to that, it's a SCI-FI\/FANTASY movie.  Things are not supposed to make sense or be perfect.  It's just supposed to be fun and entertaining.  This movie delivers.  The special effects are beyond anything ever seen before, the characters are very likeable, the action sequences are intense and incredible, and I LIKED JAR JAR BINKS!!!!  If liking Jar Jar means I'm like a 6 year old, then I'm happy because the whole point of going to  the movies is to just have fun.  This movie pulls you into an incredible world and keeps you enthralled throughout.  The end lightsaber battle contains some of the best sequences ever put on film and is worth the price of admission on its own.  Don't analyze this movie by comparing it to other films. Analyze what the events of this film mean to the world of Star Wars.  Picking on this film is like criticizing the Mona Lisa because she's not smiling. Get real, get a grip, go see this movie, and enjoy it because it really is something special.  And if you leave the theater wanting more then you've got the point.  You're supposed to want more, that's why you go see the next movie.  Just go and enjoy this film, it's really excellent.

It was incredible and extremely fun.  As both a movie fan and a Star Wars fan I was blown away by this film. For that reason, I feel I must reply to some of the criticisms I've read about this film.  There was one person on this page who put it best in saying that anybody that disliked this movie just does not know how to have fun.  I think that is true and is a shame, because the same people who loved the original movies as kids 20 years ago have now grown up into cold-hearted, pedantic nit-pickers more interested in having a religious experience at the movies than having fun.  This movie was fun and captivating.  Many people have said that there was not much of a plot. That could not be more untrue.  There is a great plot filled with political intrigue.  Many people have said there is no character development.  The whole movie is spent developing Anikin, who is supposed to be the main focus of these three films.  Many people criticized young Jake Lloyd's performance, which I thought was excellent.  I've even heard people criticize Natalie Portman's performance, and she was incredible in this film.  People have compared this film to Episode 4, saying it did not have the heart or was not as good.  Come on, Episode 4 was a bad movie... it was hoaky and cheesy and campy and that was what made it great.  You cannot compare the two films. You've got different characters, different actors, different technology, different times, and different movies.  If you want to see the same old movie, then just stay home and watch the original trilogy on tape.  I've also seen the term Star Wars purist thrown around and you can basically through that out the window.  IT'S A MOVIE!!!! And in addition to that, it's a SCI-FI\/FANTASY movie.  Things are not supposed to make sense or be perfect.  It's just supposed to be fun and entertaining.  This movie delivers.  The special effects are beyond anything ever seen before, the characters are very likeable, the action sequences are intense and incredible, and I LIKED JAR JAR BINKS!!!!  If liking Jar Jar means I'm like a 6 year old, then I'm happy because the whole point of going to  the movies is to just have fun.  This movie pulls you into an incredible world and keeps you enthralled throughout.  The end lightsaber battle contains some of the best sequences ever put on film and is worth the price of admission on its own.  Don't analyze this movie by comparing it to other films. Analyze what the events of this film mean to the world of Star Wars.  Picking on this film is like criticizing the Mona Lisa because she's not smiling. Get real, get a grip, go see this movie, and enjoy it because it really is something special.  And if you leave the theater wanting more then you've got the point.

Why were they treating this film so poorly? I decided to cast their feelings aside, and not let the naysayers of the world, who I felt were just trying to pick apart George Lucas, ruin it for me.  Sadly, they didn't have to.  The film took care of that all by itself.Jar Jar Binks.  Ugh.  A completely CGI character who we never get a real break from onscreen.  His introduction comes way too soon, in a scene that is unnecessary, and ultimately seems forced.  McGregor and Neeson, the main Jedis, seem detached and bored during their interaction with this ill-conceived character.  To add insult to injury, Binks speaks as if he were a neighbor of Brer Fox or Brer Rabbit.  This made me more than a little uncomfortable with him, from the very first line of dialogue he spit forth, to the last unintelligible muttering for all to decipher.I realize the point of Binks was to provide comic relief, but what about the more serious and stronger moving plot one is used to in this film series?  A trade dispute?  Yawn.  I'm still asking myself why the more subtle (and exponentially more interesting) plot points weren't developed more in-depth; leading me to ask why this film was titled The Phantom Menace in the first place.  The actual phantom menace is revealed, but the idea, sadly, isn't taken anywhere.  One can assume that will unfold in EP. 2 or 3, but this film lacks the depth that this plot point could have provided.  With all it's comic relief, CGI animation, and lack of a thoughtful plot, at times I wondered if this film was conceived by George Lucas or Walt Disney.And let's not forget the dated material in this film!  The visually incredible pod race scene is almost ruined by a character that sounds like your typical 20th century NASCAR announcer.  That I could overlook. Including fart jokes later in the film however is intolerable.  I don't think I'll ever fully understand the intended purpose of that.And what about Darth Maul, the evil Sith Lord in this installment? Good question; what about him?  Severely underutilized, and gone just when you're getting to enjoy his dark element, he goes down as just another thing that could have been better about this picture.  He was an ace with the light saber when we did see him, but we didn't see him nearly enough.Speaking of light sabers, I'm curious how the proposed six films will appear back to back once completed.  In the middle trilogy, light saber battles were far and few between.  They were somewhat contained, although enjoyable to watch.  In EP. 1 the battles are incredible to watch, but they may be a bit too over the top.  At times I wondered if Jackie Chan had been called in for a stunt double.  Flips, rolls, huge leaps and the like were not uncommon.  These were some of the best action scenes of the film, but how will they compare to the middle trilogy down the road?  I think it will appear that Jedi's have adopted a lazier fighting style, and the original battles from EPS. 4, 5, and 6 will appear boring, and ill conceived.The final war scenes are a treat for the eyes when we got to see the amazing CGI army of robots.  However, they are fighting an entire race of Jar Jars, and at this point I had already seen and heard more Jar Jar Binks than I could stomach.  I quickly found myself turning to the dark side, and hoping that Binks would perish quickly.

We get to learn a lot about Spock, McCoy, and Kirk in the scene where Sybok shows them--or, in Kirk's case, is not allowed to show--moments from their personal histories.It's difficult to sit through this movie; it really isn't very exciting or engaging.  It does have its moments--the aforementioned scene being one of them, the brig scene being another, the confrontation with God being a third--and those moments are easily worth the price of a rental from your local video store.In short, if you're a fan of the true, real Star Trek, and you haven't seen this movie because you've been told it's the worst one, see it anyway. (Look at it this way your favorite band probably has an album or two that is weaker than its other albums, but which for you is still better than anything by a band you don't like.  For me, it's Test For Echo by Rush. I'd listen to that before, say, the Backstreet Boys any day.)  Yes, it has its insider moments (specifically, the scenes bookending the movie), but it is far, FAR better in that regard than the dull, insipid Star Trek Insurrection.  Watch The Final Frontier with an open mind, and you'll probably come to the conclusion, as I did when I rewatched it a couple of times recently, that while they should have stopped making movies after The Wrath of Khan, this isn't the worst Trek movie by a long shot.On the other hand, if you're the kind of person who LOVED The Voyage Home, and who thinks that The Next Generation was the best show on television, you'll probably want to give this one a miss and rent the adventures of Captain Baldy and First Officer Potsie instead.(For the record, the worst Trek film is in fact the lifeless Star Trek Insurrection, which has a horribly large collection of little fanboy moments and showcases horrible performances from Stewart and Brent Spiner.)

The first three films helped define my childhood and have stayed with me into early adulthood.  The themes and the sheer FUN of the trilogy are truly rare in this day and age.That being said, The Phantom Menace is perhaps one of the worst films I have ever had to sit through, and a disgrace to both Star Wars and Lucasfilm.  A true embarrassment, I was near tears through most of the film. Seeing it on opening night, I was thrilled as the trademark intro script scrolled up the screen.  Everything that followed was truly horrifying, starting with the most ridiculously stereotypical Asian alien bad guys this side of Ming the Merciless.  Add to that a completely dreadful script, way too many effects, no discernable plot line, and dreary action sequences, and you have yourself a real stinker.  And I won't waste any space talking about the apocalyptic disaster that is Jar Jar Binks.Poor Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and Natalie Portman!!  Three of the finest actors to grace the screen today, and they have nothing at all to work with. Meanwhile all the dialogue goes to Jar Jar and Anakin, played awfully by Jake Lloyd.  Sidenote  Am I the only one concerned with the fact that through the whole movie everyone calls the future Darth Vader Annie???Darth Maul would be a formidable villain, assuming, of course, that he had any lines, which he doesn't.  He is silent during his entire lightsaber duel with Neeson and McGregor, eliminating the verbal duel that was at the heart of Vader's fights with Luke in the original series.  His role seems detached and his presence does not seem to effect the sequence of events in the least.And let me say this  there are too many effects.  They are not even that impressive, not for a lack of technical wizardry, but because the action they portray is either confusing or non-existent, and there is none of the tension in any of the battle scenes which is even close to that found in its technologically ancient granddaddy, A New Hope.  In fact, considering the technology available, the scenario of the battle scenes seems pretty ho-hum-ish if not trite.There is not enough room to write all the terrible things about this movie. They even reduce the Force to microscopic organisms that live in the bloodstream.  This was the most disappointing movie experience I have ever had.

I'd been anxious to see it since its initial release in 1993.  It surprised me in its depth and technical skill.Three points make this film outstanding.  The first is the technical skill of the director and the luscious taste of the director of photography. The entire film is a feast for the eyes, taking full advantage of elaborate costumes and exotic locations.  The second strength is in the actual storytelling.  The plot is a fascinating tragedy, it feels almost Shakespearean.  The acting is nothing short of incredible.  Some of China's finest actors demonstrate their ability to carry a story that covers 52 years.  Normally, these two strengths alone would be reason enough to see a film, but Farewell my Concubine succeeds in satisfying one more category (the bain of any epic) historical accuracy.Farewell my Concubine is exceptionally accurate in portraying the monumental changes that were sweeping China at the time.  The film doesn't just treat these events as background events, but drags them right into the plot and pins the characters into their surroundings.  This is interesting when you consider that the story takes place in the Peking Opera, not the most likely place for these events to have effect.  Instead, as we see the new China emerge, we watch these vestiges of old society fall, and the work of all involved make this transition an achievement to behold.  The power of this film was not missed by Chinese censors who banned, removed, and then banned the film again several times over -debating whether or not its artistic brilliance was worth subversive portrayals of suicide and homosexuality.  Unlike The Last Emperor, this film was made by Chinese film makers and is in tune with its subject.  I recommend this film highly!As one last note, the version I saw was a DVD containing the original 170 minute version of the film, in its wide-screen splendor.  From what I understand, the shorter versions released internationally deleted and shortened some opera scenes for fear that they would be lost on Western audiences.

Whether or not you are a Star Wars fan, you will miss out on a great film experience if don't see it on the big screen.  In case you have heard critics bashing it for lacking certain dramatic elements, or hard-core fans bashing it for lacking the magic of the originals, let's put it in perspective...Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace is like the first act of an eventual six-part work of art.  Many critics seem to have overlooked this fact, and are quick to point out the shallowness of the characters and the lack of a smooth-flowing story.  It also contains one too many bathroom jokes, choppy editing, self-indulgent use of CGI, and somewhat annoying inconsistencies (for hard-core SW fans) with the previous Trilogy.  All bad points to be sure, by any film-goers standards.However, that is not what The Phantom Menace brings to the growing space-opera, or movies for that matter, as a whole.  In and of itself, TPM is an excellent setup, story-wise, for FIVE more chapters of a saga as well as an exciting and fun action film.  No film that I can think of, especially in the sci-fi\/action genre has ever been able to pull off such a feat.True Star Wars fans will watch with first-timers a two-hour escape into a new universe.  We see the Galactic Republic brought to life in beautiful shots of Coruscant, Naboo, and even desolate Tatooine, shedding light on what Luke, Leia, and Han were fighting so hard to restore in chapters IV, V, and VI. Creatures buzz with life, even the overused Jar Jar Binks, and at times, it is difficult to tell what is real and what is not in this film. (95% of the movie is computer-enhanced imagery.)The audience is taken into a galaxy far, far away that has all-too down-to-Earth conflicts.  Greed and the lust for power _begins_ to threaten a peaceful galaxy defended by the Jedi.  I was particularly impressed by the acting out of this conflict by the new cast.  Liam Neeson plays Qui Gon Jinn, a maverick knight who discovers Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a slave boy who has superior talents.  It will be fascinating to see how this boy becomes the evil Darth Vader in parts II and III.  Natalie Portman brings a strong performance as Queen Amidala, and Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  On the Dark side, Ian McDiarmid plays a subtle and manipulative Senator Palpatine.  The ultimate scene stealer is Darth Maul, played by martial-artist Ray Park.  You will not be disappointed with this villain, even though he only has four lines!Without spoiling the film, I would have to say that the final forty minutes of TPM are more action packed, better-looking, and exciting than the climaxes of the original Trilogy.  While ROTJ had three sequences, Menace has four  a ground battle for Naboo, a space battle that displays Anakin's abilities, a three-way lightsaber duel between the ultimate good (teamed-up Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan) versus the face of upcoming evil (Darth Maul), and a unique Queen-led mission to reclaim the throne.The film ends with everyone wanting more, much like when the curtain goes down on the first act of a fantastic play.  What will happen as the events of acts II and III unfold?  Go into Episode I with this frame of mind, and admire what a truly clever and entertaining movie it is.
