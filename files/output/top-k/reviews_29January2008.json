Everything is subtle, but it is so beautifully prepared, thought out, and executed by all.1. Were it for nothing else, the technical aspects of this film would have kept me watching until the very end. The music was perfectly placed to rise and fall with the internal emotions of the characters - especially Lily and Lawrence - and to express the turmoil of the social downfall of Lily. On top of that, you have phenomenal costumes and set with the most lavish colors. Lastly, and possibly what I found most fascinating about the film, was the lighting. it always seemed just bright enough or just dark enough to reflect the romance or dreariness. In addition, there is just not denying that the way the light fell upon Gillian Anderson in every, single scene is something I have never seen before.2. The all-star cast! Gillian Anderson. Eric Stolz. Laura Linney. Anthony LaPaglia. Dan Akroyd. Do I have to go on? I can almost guarantee that you'll find yourself, at one point or another, yelling at the screen. These characters are so manipulative and deceitful and malicious. And Lily is so naive and just won't accept love when it's given!! I think the best thing about the cast and performances in this film is that watching the film and listening to it are 2 completely opposite experiences.

Hammer has just picked up a desperate young woman named Christina who had been running down an isolated California two-lane rode. The room is dark and gloomy, you don't know what you're doing to me. The way it has got me caught, I'd rather have the blues than what I've got. The lyrics might not be so good, but Cloris Leachman's frightened urgency as Christina sets the movie on the fast track. It's not long before Hammer's car is forced off the road, he's beaten senseless, and wakes up on a bed listening to shrieks of pain as Christina, hanging from her wrists, is tortured to death in a vain attempt by someone to learn a secret. In the short time we knew Christina we'd come to like her. She knew people were after her. She tells Hammer to let her out at a bus stop while he drives on. That bus stop will be coming up pretty soon, Hammer says to her, and I don't even know your name. You forget. I'm a loony from the laughing house, she tells him All loonies are dangerous. Ever read poetry? No, of course you wouldn't. Christina Rossetti wrote love sonnets. I was named after her. Christina? Hammer says. Yes, Mike. Get me to that bus stop and forget you ever saw me. If we don't make that bus stop... We will, Hammer tells her confidently. ...if we don't, she continues, remember me. Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) is a private eye who specializes in divorce work. He has a suggestive, live-in secretary named Velda. He and Velda often set up honey traps for the poor-sap husbands, and a little side action involving blackmail brings in extra cash. Hammer is a hard head, has no respect for the law but seems to love dishing out vigilante justice. Beating thugs to within an inch of their lives gives him satisfaction. From the time he decides to do justice to the memory of Christina to the conclusion of the movie, Mike Hammer meets one person after another who he beats, slaps, crushes their hands and breaks their phonograph records as he tracks down the mysterious Mr. Big, a man determined to posses a leather box which stays warm...a box that you open only if you want to die. Kiss Me Deadly is a good movie for two reasons. It has great noir style and is one of the best photographed noirs, by Ernest Laszlo, I've ever seen. It also is directed by William Aldrich with supremely confident craftsmanship. Aldrich gives us efficient story-telling with no dawdling. He keeps the plot moving with a deft combination of tension, violence, menace and some fine, off-center characterizations from the secondary actors. The movie has narrative rhythm. It also has the curse laid on it of tedious analysis by popular culture enthusiasts and film critics who should know better. Says one critic, Kiss Me Deadly is the definitive, apocalyptic, nihilistic, science-fiction film noir of all time. Oh, come on. Kiss Me Deadly is a very well- crafted low budget pulp mystery thriller. Because that warm thing in a box happens to be nuclear, and because the movie ends with a bang, too many people, in my view, have read all sorts of pretentious allegories into the film. These people lay on the analysis of Kiss Me Deadly as heavily as makeup on a street walker. In 1999, for goodness sake, Kiss Me Deadly was even deemed culturally significant by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. I prefer the amusing viewpoint of A. I. Bezzerides, who wrote the screenplay. Bezzerides denied any intent to make the movie a metaphor for the potential horrors of the Cold War. I was having fun with it, he has said. I wanted to make every scene, every character, interesting. That he did, including a clever clue using a phrase from Christina Rossetti's fine poem, Remember. In fact, said Bezzerides of the script, I wrote it fast because I had contempt for it. I tell you Spillane didn't like what I did with his book. I ran into him at a restaurant and, boy, he didn't like me. Although the movie starts with some poor song lyrics, let's end with some good lyrics from Rossetti's Remember, written to her husband before she died. There're the key to Mike Hammer's puzzle...and the key was found in a beautiful corpse's stomach Remember me when I am gone away, Gone far away into the silent land; When you can no more hold me by the hand, Nor I half turn to go, yet turning stay.Remember me when no more day by day You tell me of our future that you plann'dOnly remember me; you understand It will be late to counsel then or pray. Yet if you should forget me for a while And afterwards remember, do not grieve For if the darkness and corruption leave A vestige of the thoughts that once I had, Better by far you should forget and smile Than that you should remember and be sad.

Ryder is Susanna, a high school graduate from a good family who attempts suicide and is then institutionalized. The script, in fact, is based on Susanna Kaysen's real-life account of her time in a mental institution in the '60s. In denial about her condition, she observes the crazies around her, finally becoming friends with an 8-year resident, Lisa (Angelia Jolie) whose biting insights and bucking of authority keep the place lively and keep Susanna going. As Susanna recovers and comes face to face with a devastating tragedy, she realizes that Lisa's type of resistance is not the way to go and that she must involve herself in the therapeutic process so that she can go home.This is a very dramatic and emotional story that I admit right up front left me sobbing. Though dark and often sad, it is a very life-affirming movie. The acting is beyond superb. Jolie, in her Oscar-winning performance, has the tour de force role, and she's magnificent. Jolie is one of those people whose once bizarre personality traits and now humanitarian efforts and relationship with Brad Pitt occasionally obliterate the fact that she's a fabulous and versatile actress. Ryder is stunning as the confused and depressed Susanna. Unfortunately, one of her first lines in the film is, Did you ever steal something when you had the cash? - if people did a riff on that when she was arrested for shoplifting, I missed it. She's another one whose personal peccadilloes have overshadowed some wonderful acting. These two women are surrounded by a marvelous cast of pros, including Redgrave as a patient psychiatrist, Goldberg as a tough but kind RN on the ward and Brittany Murphy as a deeply disturbed young woman. All of the women who play patients are excellent and will tear at your heart.Girl, Interrupted is a brilliant film and probably an underrated one. It's possible that people who hadn't seen it when Jolie won the Oscar were put off by her strange appearance at the Oscars as well as the interviews she gave about being in love with her brother, rough sex, and her use of sharp instruments. Then Ryder had her day. I truly hope none of that kept people from renting this movie, because it - and they - are beautiful.

All of the women who play patients are excellent and will tear at your heart.Girl, Interrupted is a brilliant film and probably an underrated one. It's possible that people who hadn't seen it when Jolie won the Oscar were put off by her strange appearance at the Oscars as well as the interviews she gave about being in love with her brother, rough sex, and her use of sharp instruments. Then Ryder had her day. I truly hope none of that kept people from renting this movie, because it - and they - are beautiful.

Based on Tarkovsky's own screenplay, it contains events of his life-time. Some press interviews and writings of Tarkovsky leave no doubt that all of these events are true recollections concerning his family, his life as he has lived it and felt it. All the episodes are really part of his family history, except for one, and he undertook to literally replicate what was fixed in his memory. Consider for example his childhood home, which is seen in the film. At the time the film was in production, not even the foundations remained, only a hole in the ground. The house was reconstructed from photographs in precisely the same spot where it had once stood many years before. This was extremely important to Tarkovsky because his whole personal attitude toward the film's content depended upon it. It would have been a personal drama for me if the house had looked different. Of course the trees have grown a lot at this place, everything overgrew, we had to cut down a lot. But when I brought my Mum there, who appears in several sequences, she was so moved by this sight that I understood immediately it created the right impression. The only fictional episode is the illness of the narrator, which is intended to convey the author's spiritual crisis. As such, this fictional contrivance is a foundation for all of the others, utterly true remembrances. The pace of the film is slow. As in most of Tarkovsky's other films, we see long shots, which lead to lengthy contemplations on the viewer's part, requiring the absorption of a considerable amount of fine visual details. This in turn leads the viewer into an emotional involvement with the characters. By using long shots and few cuts in his films, Tarkovsky gives the viewers a sense of time passing, and the relationship of one moment to another, as opposed to the speedy jump-cut, Hollywood style. Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called sculpting in time, which was, using the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium, to take one's experience of time and alter it. This film is the best example of the application of his theory. Not only does Tarkovsky sculpt in time by manipulating events in an apparent random-time fashion, he also manipulates time within an event by using mirrors, which reflects different times, past or future, which are not of the particular event. There are many such examples throughout the film. The beauty and lyricism of the images are due to Tarkovsky's unmistakable poetic style. The childhood memories, hypnotic in their intensity, are the most visually stunning film-making imaginable. These dream-like sequences are also the most enigmatic moments of the film, which most likely accounts for the film's alleged impenetrability. Mirror is about the lives of the most important figures in Tarkovsky's life his mother and his wife (interestingly, played by the same actress). From Tarkovsky's own admission, his father had no inner influence on him. His mother was the most important person in his life so much so that, for Tarkovsky, there was no question that she had to appear in person in several scenes. These scenes happen to be the most puzzling ones of the film, and are at times unexplainable, even for the author. For example, in a scene where Ignat is sitting and the doorbell rings, he opens the door and an old woman says, Oh, I think I've got the wrong place. She is Aleksei's mother, Ignat's grandmother, and yet they do not recognize each other. In another instance, in the film's epilogue, we see Natalya as an old woman walking hand in hand with her two young children, while the young Natalya is briefly seen in the background. This can only be interpreted as a lyrical dream sequence. Although Tarkovsky never made an explicitly political film, the relationship of the individual to history was central to his world view. In terms of a person's spiritual experience, what happened to that person yesterday may be as significant as what happened to humanity a hundred years ago. From that point of view, the film is about the nature of Russia as a mediator between the East and the West, as portrayed in the scene where Ignat reads Pushkin's letter to Chaadayev (October 19, 1836), and a little later in the film, in the footage of Russian soldiers holding back a demonstration of Chinese Maoists. Mirror is also about the Stalinist purges of the mid-to-late 1930s and World War II. Tarkovsky shows us archive footage of contemporary events with complete detachment in contrast with the extreme intimacy of the memories. It is expressed, for example, by the apparently strange inclusion of the documentary footage of the Soviet army crossing the Sivash marshes. The poem by his father, Arseni Tarkovsky (1907-1989), which accompanies the Sivash crossing, is particularly telling ... I will call up any century, Go into it and build myself a house.That is why your children are beside me And your wives, all seated at one table, One table for great-grandfather and grandson.... Except for Margarita Terekhova, whose portrayals are magnificent, there is very little acting required from the other cast members. Although silent, one should note the compelling presence throughout the film of Filipp Yankovsky, as Aleksei at age 5. The film undoubtedly benefited from the immense talent of cinematographer Georgii Rerberg. Upon his graduation in 1960 from the operator's faculty at the Cinematography Institute, Rerberg became the director of photography at Mosfilm Studios. Eduard Artemiev was responsible for the original music. Artemiev is a prolific film music writer (thirty-eight scores), (Solaris\/1972, Stalker\/1979). He was the first in the history of cinema to have used electronic music. Other music is by J.S. Bach, Pergolesi, and Purcell.

The action scenes are suitably big budget & suitably over the top although as usual for this type of film there are scenes which really push the boundaries of plausibility with Schwarzenegger falling out of a plane without a parachute & surviving by landing on a car, sustaining injuries yet seemingly getting over them very quickly & a scene which shows him hanging onto the side of a flying plane using just his fingertips. I thought the story revolving around the weapons could have been better & doesn't have much of an impact, for instance it's never revealed who exactly is buying them or for what purpose & surely one gun is pretty much like any other? I don't really see why having a technologically more advanced gun is going to make a huge difference, as I said surely a gun is just a gun? There is plenty of violence here & a body count to almost rival World War II, those who don't like strong graphic violence should give Eraser a miss.With a supposed budget of about $100,000,000 this had a lot of money spent on it, I don't think it was a huge box-office success & while it definitely didn't flop it was probably a disappointment for Warner Bros.

Cullen is caught on CCTV cameras stealing the information & the people behind the plan want her dead, in steps witness protection agent & US Marshal John Kruger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who is a specialist is 'erasing' the lives of the people he is trying to protect & relocate. As the stakes get higher & a lot of very important & dangerous people are implicated by the information Cullen has they have to get at John to reveal where she is, but John is the best there is & intends to bring the bad guy's down & save the life of Cullen...Co-executive produced & directed by Chuck Russell as Charles Russell this was an attempt by Schwarzenegger to get back to his roots after the disaster that is Junior (1994) which he made two years prior, while Eraser isn't up to the standard of say a Total Recall (1990) or a Terminator 2 Judgemnt Day (1991) in my opinion it's a damned sight better than either a Kindergarten Cop (1990) or a True Lies (1994). Anyway, the script by Tony Puryear & Walon Green apparently went through lots of rewrites from many different writers & so the final shooting script was referred to it 'looking like a rainbow' & also according to the IMDb Terminator 2 Judgment Day co-writer William Wisher Jr. did multiple rewrites during production as well so it's maybe somewhat of a surprise that Eraser is as good as it is. There's nothing deep or meaningful here in Eraser, it is what it is, an unashamedly violent big budget action flick. The character's are decent but I didn't like the idea of Schwarzenegger killing so many FBI agents who were just following orders, OK they were orders from corrupt officials but they were only doing their job & it just didn't sit well with me that Schwarzenegger was killing everyone in sight regardless of overriding factors. I mean he was supposed to be the all American hero of the piece wasn't he? Away from the moralistic side of things Eraser has plenty to enjoy if your an action junkie, there's explosions, gun fights, huge cool looking hi-tech futuristic weaponry, fights & some good set-pieces including one taken straight from the James Bond film Moonraker (1981) where Schwarzenegger gets thrown out of a plane without a parachute & he has to skydive after one to a great sequence in a New York zoo involving several Crocodiles.Director Russell does a good job & he directs with pace & a fair amount of energy. The action scenes are suitably big budget & suitably over the top although as usual for this type of film there are scenes which really push the boundaries of plausibility with Schwarzenegger falling out of a plane without a parachute & surviving by landing on a car, sustaining injuries yet seemingly getting over them very quickly & a scene which shows him hanging onto the side of a flying plane using just his fingertips. I thought the story revolving around the weapons could have been better & doesn't have much of an impact, for instance it's never revealed who exactly is buying them or for what purpose & surely one gun is pretty much like any other? I don't really see why having a technologically more advanced gun is going to make a huge difference, as I said surely a gun is just a gun? There is plenty of violence here & a body count to almost rival World War II, those who don't like strong graphic violence should give Eraser a miss.With a supposed budget of about $100,000,000 this had a lot of money spent on it, I don't think it was a huge box-office success & while it definitely didn't flop it was probably a disappointment for Warner Bros. According to the IMDb lots of scenes were written, lit & prepared to be filmed but never were & that drove the budget up. If that is true I cannot for the life of me figure out why they weren't shot, there's just no reason for it.

So as I said, it's cool to watch, but not that thoughtful as it probably aims to be. One last thing- a little goof which made me feel really awkward about the seriousness of the movie makers. I stopped the tape to see the problem written on the board in the hallway- and it took me about 10-15 seconds to solve it. It was hilarious- the problem was to write a simple 3*3 matrix and do some of the most basic, basic operations with it. Not even a problem, an easy exercise- for a 10 year old. And the second problem- I didn't even have to stop the tape there, I mean come on- a problem on which the whole crew of the professor worked for 2 years-2 years!!!- how on earth could be possibly solved with a couple of drawings?? and not a single mathematical symbol?? A couple of simple graphs, that was all. This was so embarrassing it made me seriously reconsider my appreciation of the movie. Not that it is significant- but how hard can it be to get a real mathematical problem-not the the prime-number-formula but Anything which cannot be solved within seconds, and barely Looks like a problem. Not to mention that after this episode any praise of Will's talents was kind of feeling stupid.

Too bad the Producers and Writer\/Director, Michael Cimino, spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the Johnson County war was really about. A lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing. The cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold, windswept plateau. The entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war.The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. The peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of Indians would do in much earlier Hollywood movies. The true fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, with a posse of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the TA ranch. I doubt any women took part in the siege. Ellen (Ella also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was a canard spread by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) in order to discredit her. The fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the WSGA.I object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction. There is no fact in the events, time lines, or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the Johnson County war (and events leading up to it) is beyond me.The movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the Federal Government intervention in a State Government's affairs and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were saved by the Calvary. Some effort was made to prosecute the Cattlemen who were responsible by the Johnson County attorney. But since Johnson county could not afford the court costs and the Governor of Wyoming, Amos W.

Ridiculous overacting, implausible change of heart by main character, forgettable milquetoast of a leading man (Donat), and repeated coincidences to push the seriously weak plot that are so unbelievably silly that everyone in my viewing laughed.The capper was the ending. After I watched it, I went to the National Archives in D.C. (I live there) to find original reviews on the movie (which I do often). The 1935 critical reviews are far more diverse in their opinions than the glowing write-ups on this board would lead you to believe. Many major critics of the day hated the movie and many more were confused by the silly and convenient ending which Hitchcock himself was forced to explain many times. I recommend that those interested do their own research into the opinions of Hitchcock's contemporaries without the modern hindsight and positive baggage the director's name conveys.I'm sorry to say this but the 39 Steps is, without any doubt on my part, Hitchcock's worst.

If you don't believe me just treat yourself to his fantastic Pulp Fiction, a dark, sharp, black as black comedy thriller concerning a few days in the lives of some desperate LA characters.Our prodigious director co-wrote the script (with Roger Avary), which contains some absolutely brilliant dialogue. This supreme black comedy has such a distinct laconic wit that you'll find yourself breaking up at the most gruesome and disturbing of scenes. The film's thriller element is at times chillingly effective, creating with ease heart pounding tension that will have you fidgeting in your seat and drying your hands on the legs of your trousers.The story itself, or three stories in one actually, is a fascinating tale of double-cross which will completely involve you, as will the equally fascinating character study which lies within the intriguing plot. There are some amazing people in Fiction! The total un-predictability of the movie works to perfection, as Tarantino controls and manipulates his audience whilst entertaining brilliantly throughout. He deliberately unsettles us early so that we're never comfortable, then draws us in effortlessly as the narrative unfolds. The finale is very satisfying (more than so), yet leaves you itching and pleading for an encore. This is highly addictive cinema! You never know who's gonna do what to whom, where the next sucker punch is coming from nor the next razor sharp line.The bold format works excellently, with the non-chronological sequence being a real plus. Apparently the original concept was to have the script 'linear', but the fact that this removed some main characters early in the piece was found to be unsatisfactory, and so a re-write was ordered. The result is astonishingly effective, and the editing is truly inspired, maintaining the ideal pace.Tarantino's film is graphically violent yet superbly visual, containing some startling cinematography and much effective imagery, including one particular hard drug scene that leaves a marked impression.Finally, one of the film's strongest points is the powerful acting. Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth are first on the scene giving us two great performances as the picture's initial desperate criminals. As a hippie drug dealer and his severely body-pierced wife, Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette both make solid impressions, as do Harvey Keitel and Tarantino himself. In the more pivotal roles are Bruce Willis as reckless boxer Butch, Ving Rhames as crime-lord Marsellus Wallace, Uma Thurman as the sexy drug-fiend Mrs. Wallace and John Travolta as Marsellus' Italian hit man Vincent Vega. All give strong showings. Frank Whaley and Christopher Walken also drop in on the action, but the plum role goes to Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winfield. Jackson gets all the very best lines and the most interesting character by far, and his performance is sensational, worthy of acknowledgment at the highest level.I could go on and on about what I consider to be the film of 1994 by a long shot. Quentin Tarantino will have you eating out of the palm of his hand. Even though the black comedy gangster thriller is a well worn genre, the movie's amazing originality will blow you out of the theatre, while its confronting and astounding style and layout will really keep you thinking. What a rush!Sunday, December 11, 1994 - Knox District CentreFriday, February 10, 1995 - Village Centre MelbourneMonday, February 27, 1995 - Kuhio Twins HonoluluHaving seen Tarantino's violent, graphic landmark Pulp Fiction four times, I must confess that even though it is a remarkable piece of story telling, it does tend to wear a little thin.Without the surprise element with which he so easily manipulates his audience first time around, Tarantino must rely on the depth and genius of his writing, and the shrewdness of his direction and the editing. In this light Pulp Fiction does tend to be over long and perhaps over indulgent, and may have even worked just as well in chronological order (haven't I changed my tune).On the other hand, all the outstanding performances certainly hold up to repeat viewings. As the thinking man's gangster, Samuel L. Jackson delivers a veritable tour-de-force in what is possibly the performance of 1994. John Travolta's showing is stylish and controlled, Uma Thurman proves herself to be a real handful, overdosing or otherwise, Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames are both ideally cast and make the very most of their characters, Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth (Honeybunny and Pumpkin) are incredible in their small roles (you could make a movie spin-off based on those two!), Christopher Walken's walk in is significant but rather drawn out, and both Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette are terrific as the young marrieds selling and doing drugs (every scene of theirs is extremely funny).One may conclude that Pulp Fiction could have been just as effective twenty minutes shorter, but who's complaining. The film is ultra-violent, so the squeamish should avoid it, as should those who don't enjoy contemplative, thought provoking cinema. Movie goers really need to be alert to put all the pieces together, and also to appreciate all the philosophical dialogue from Jules and Vincent.
