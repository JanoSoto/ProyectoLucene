Yes this was Dalton's second and last outing as Bond but, due to various legal problems over who owned the rights to the character and all that sort of business, this would be the last Bond film for 6 years. By the time the series returned things would look very different behind the camera as well as in front of it and the dangerously long period of reflection, coupled with the negative reaction to this particular film, would have dire consequences for the quality of subsequent entries.There's a lovely little story about Licence to Kill, namely that it would have been called 'Licence Revoked' but the studio's market research suggested that an American audience wasn't sure what Revoked meant. Whether it true or not its the only point in the production of LTK that the target audience were really thought about and for that we can be grateful because its a safe bet that most the people reared on Moonraker and Octopussy would have reacted in horror at this occasionally brutal, always brooding revenge thriller into which their beloved super-spy had been inauspiciously inserted. This is the logical extreme of Dalton's take on the character - very hard, very unpleasant, very cruel but often very enjoyable. If Roger Moore skiing to the sound of the Beach Boys is one extreme in the series then LTK is the total opposite - A Bond adventure that Fleming might recognize as tonally authentic but general audiences did not. The story allows Bond to be probed in a three dimensional way for the first (and last) time. In a story which deliberately resonates with On Her Majesty's Secret Service and in doing so gives the audience a cue as to the character's motives, Bond is in Florida to attend the wedding of friend and series stalwart Felix Lighter who is subsequently visited by the henchman of escaped drug lord Sanchez (Robert Davi) who kill his newly minted bride and then feed the great man to Sharks before returning the chewed up CIA agent to his adobe, just in time for Bond to arrive and discover the macabre scene. Sanchez flees to a fictional south-American country (does he know its fictional?)where he beyond the reach of the authorities. When it becomes apparent they can't and won't do anything, Bond sticks two fingers up at M, does a runner and goes off to get his own brand of fast track justice. If Licence to Kill has a problem its that it divorces Bond from his natural surroundings to such an extent that he runs the risk of looking like a guest in someone else's film. The movie is a little too eager to embrace the language and conventions of American actions thrillers, including the level of violence and so perhaps it lacks the balance of hard-edge and secret service theatrics that made the previous film so enjoyable. The other niggle is that Glen's direction remains decidedly flat, although he does manage to pull off a bit of a showstopper with tanker truck chase toward the film's climax. Ultimately though we have the purest portrayal of Bond yet seen trapped within a revenge story that doesn't feel like a Bond adventure at all. Some nice ironies aside, Sanchez is torched by Felix's Lighter (geddit?), Bond's 'farewell to arms' jibe etc..., it doesn't hold up as one of the better entries in the series because good as it is in places, it doesn't have the heart and invention of the series best.This was it for Dalton and what a shame because he was the first actor since Connery to actually take it seriously. We'll never know what he would have done with his third Bond but given the direction Brosnan's efforts have taken the series- wall to wall action, no plot, one dimensional characters, merciless product placement, self-parody - one half of him must wonder why so many more people preferred brain dead fodder like Die Another Day, while the other half laughs like buggery at the gap in quality between the two epochs in the series' history.

Meanwhile a strange man arrives at an inn, covered in bandages, hat and long coat and acting mysterious. When the other residents of the inn claim that this man is 'invisible', police assume they are suffering some sort of group delusion. Meanwhile Griffin arrives back to see Kemp, clearly (sorry!) invisible and suffering side effects of madness. With his friends trying to help him and the police trying to catch him, Griffin's inability to find a cure continues to eat at his sanity, sending him into a frenzy.The first thing to note is that any film that is over 70 years old will clearly not hold the same appeal to modern audiences as films made recently do. Those looking to this film to provide the same effects or violence as seen in Hollow Man (for example) will not only be disappointed but they will also be open to accusations of being simply unfair. However, viewed on its own terms, this is a great little film that has impressive effects, an exciting and tragic story mixed with some good (if a little hammy) acting. The basic plot works well, considering that it expects us to be right there with it without any real back story about who Griffin was. I'm not sure why this was done this way (constraints of running time maybe?) but it works well as the film is to fast moving to be slowed by a long build up. It still manages to show Griffin's descent into madness despite the fact he is already losing at the start of the film.The effects work well even if they (obviously) don't compare to what computers can do, however they still look good and the lead character is convincingly invisible; if anything it is actually more effective because the 'money shots' are sparingly used and then used to good effect. The pace of the film really helps as it is remains exciting and enjoyable all the way to the inevitable conclusion. The acting of the cast helps although it is Rains' film the whole way to the final scene (where he is finally seen!). He may overplay his madness but who can complain when it is such fun? What impressed me is that he is either invisible or behind a mask for the vast majority of the film but yet still manages to make a big impression regardless. Stuart didn't impress me one bit and seemed like her character would have been important with backstory &#150; but without it she just came across as a simpering starlet with little involvement in the story, trying to build a human side that was not the focus of the rest of the film. Harrigan and Travers are convincing and the support cast all run around and scream accordingly.Overall this is an enjoyable film that has good effects and an enjoyable plot. The script could have done more to create more of a human story and draw more emotion from the audience but the fast pace and convincing thrills cover this up well. I was taken by how dark the material was &#150; I never expected the 'hero' of the film to kill innocents, this helped me get into it because I was quite shocked by it; this was again more effective than the graphic and obvious gore of modern versions.

However during the night he becomes the masked and mysterious Iron Monkey &#150; robbing from corrupt government officials and giving to the poor and oppressed. In a typical knee-jerk reaction, Governor Cheng arrests anyone associated with the word monkey, men who look like monkeys and, just to be sure, actual monkeys. Among those arrested is hero and martial arts expert Kei-Ying Wong and his young son Fei-Hung. To protect the innocents Kei-Ying fights Iron Monkey but the fight is broken up by Iron's escape. Seeing the potential, Cheng throws Fei-Hung in jail until Kei-Ying can capture Iron Monkey; Kei-Ying reluctantly accepts. On his quest he befriends Yang who helps him out &#150; unaware that he is the man he must capture. However when a Government Investigator arrives with a troupe of rebelling Shaolin monks things are only going to become more complex for both Yang and Kei-Wong.Having recently seen Western audiences go ga-ga for pretty martial arts without any humour or real emotional involvement, I felt it was time to go back and watch some films that are fun to watch &#150; hence me sitting back down to Iron Monkey. For fans of the first three 'Once Upon A Time in China' movies, Iron Monkey will be a great addition to the collection because it not only has similar action and humour but also features a young Fei-Hung in a supporting role. The film starts with a relatively simple Robin Hood style story and then adds Kei-Ying into the mix. At this point it starts to find it difficult to manage the material and we lose sight of Kei-Ying for quite a while, during which time the plot doesn't really advance. This is not a major criticism because, while it lingers it does still entertain however you can't help feeling that the material is not managing to keep its threads together. However it does pull it together (albeit in a rather hasty fashion) for the finale and it still works. The humour is never really laugh out loud funny but I found it consistently amusing in the acting, script and delivery.Of course the vast majority of the viewers will be here for the action and I'm pleased to confirm that it is all pretty great. The wire work looks natural (well &#150; as natural as it can look I suppose) and all the leading actors are actually good at what they are being asked to do. Of course many Western audiences asked about Woo-Ping will start quoting modern films at you but it is important to remember that, long before the American dollar took any interest, he was making this stuff look easy. Having a talented cast helps, although not all of them really cut the mustard in the actual acting front. Rongguang is an unknown quantity to me but he does OK in the lead role. At times he floats close to being a bit bland but generally he is behind a mask and it isn't really his fault. Yen is a great martial artist and he comes close to stealing the film and, if his character had been a bit warmer, he would have done. He has the screen presence but not the charisma of Jet Li and I always feel he is better at bad guys &#150; here his action is great but his performance is too harsh for my liking. Wang is very pretty and does the action very well but the best female role is actually from Sze-Man Tsang (albeit playing a boy). She is a nicely human character and she also is physically very impressive. The comedy is a big part of the film and as such it is important to note the work from Wong and, more specifically, Yuen's Master Fox (whose final line is very funny); they may be clowns but lets not forget that the clown is as important as the action hero in making a well-rounded film.Overall, with the rather ponderous Hero just leaving our cinemas, now is the time to look back at this film and others like it to remember why this genre is increasingly popular. Iron Monkey is a fun film, it is as simple as that &#150; the plot may not be the most moving and involving story ever told but it is entertainingly told.

However during the night he becomes the masked and mysterious Iron Monkey &#150; robbing from corrupt government officials and giving to the poor and oppressed. In a typical knee-jerk reaction, Governor Cheng arrests anyone associated with the word monkey, men who look like monkeys and, just to be sure, actual monkeys. Among those arrested is hero and martial arts expert Kei-Ying Wong and his young son Fei-Hung. To protect the innocents Kei-Ying fights Iron Monkey but the fight is broken up by Iron's escape. Seeing the potential, Cheng throws Fei-Hung in jail until Kei-Ying can capture Iron Monkey; Kei-Ying reluctantly accepts. On his quest he befriends Yang who helps him out &#150; unaware that he is the man he must capture. However when a Government Investigator arrives with a troupe of rebelling Shaolin monks things are only going to become more complex for both Yang and Kei-Wong.Having recently seen Western audiences go ga-ga for pretty martial arts without any humour or real emotional involvement, I felt it was time to go back and watch some films that are fun to watch &#150; hence me sitting back down to Iron Monkey. For fans of the first three 'Once Upon A Time in China' movies, Iron Monkey will be a great addition to the collection because it not only has similar action and humour but also features a young Fei-Hung in a supporting role. The film starts with a relatively simple Robin Hood style story and then adds Kei-Ying into the mix. At this point it starts to find it difficult to manage the material and we lose sight of Kei-Ying for quite a while, during which time the plot doesn't really advance. This is not a major criticism because, while it lingers it does still entertain however you can't help feeling that the material is not managing to keep its threads together. However it does pull it together (albeit in a rather hasty fashion) for the finale and it still works. The humour is never really laugh out loud funny but I found it consistently amusing in the acting, script and delivery.Of course the vast majority of the viewers will be here for the action and I'm pleased to confirm that it is all pretty great. The wire work looks natural (well &#150; as natural as it can look I suppose) and all the leading actors are actually good at what they are being asked to do. Of course many Western audiences asked about Woo-Ping will start quoting modern films at you but it is important to remember that, long before the American dollar took any interest, he was making this stuff look easy. Having a talented cast helps, although not all of them really cut the mustard in the actual acting front. Rongguang is an unknown quantity to me but he does OK in the lead role. At times he floats close to being a bit bland but generally he is behind a mask and it isn't really his fault. Yen is a great martial artist and he comes close to stealing the film and, if his character had been a bit warmer, he would have done. He has the screen presence but not the charisma of Jet Li and I always feel he is better at bad guys &#150; here his action is great but his performance is too harsh for my liking. Wang is very pretty and does the action very well but the best female role is actually from Sze-Man Tsang (albeit playing a boy). She is a nicely human character and she also is physically very impressive. The comedy is a big part of the film and as such it is important to note the work from Wong and, more specifically, Yuen's Master Fox (whose final line is very funny); they may be clowns but lets not forget that the clown is as important as the action hero in making a well-rounded film.Overall, with the rather ponderous Hero just leaving our cinemas, now is the time to look back at this film and others like it to remember why this genre is increasingly popular. Iron Monkey is a fun film, it is as simple as that &#150; the plot may not be the most moving and involving story ever told but it is entertainingly told. The action is great and will keep your eyes on the screen, while the constant tone of amusement helps to lighten the film and cover the lack of real human involvement in the characters. There are better films around but this did what I wanted it to do &#150; it entertained me on many levels.

His mother and father are rather distant and pay him little attention when he is around the house. Fed up with school he decides to just skive off and spend the day hanging around, playing with his friends in the local theme park. It is while he is doing this that he spies his mother kissing someone other than his father. This marks the start of a chain of events that see him getting into more trouble both at home and at school.Although I have written a rough plot summary, I must note that I think this film is more about Antonie than it is any more traditional narrative. The film follows Antonie through the troubles he has in his young life, always painting him as a realistic character &#150; never too simplistic so as to be totally likable (what child is!?) but not a brat like some kids are in American movies. This is crucial to the film because it is so observational that it could almost be a documentary due to its style. This is down to the natural direction from Truffaut, a skill that is only helped by his excellent use of the locations, in particular the streets of Paris. Although his story is extreme in its fate, it is still engaging and touching to see Antonie's story and be involved in his young struggles &#150; whether it be school, distant parents or a lack of direction in life. The complex feelings around this time are well delivered, right down to the ambiguous ending where we are not told how Antonie actually feels.The playing from Leaud is excellent and I only wish that more child actors would be like him; natural, confident, vulnerable and convincing in front of the camera. He is well supported by people like Remy, Maurier, Decomble and Flamant but the film is his and I was very impressed by his performance. Of course, aside from him the other star is Truffaut himself and (as well as a cameo) his direction is great, natural, intimate and painting a convincing world for this story to occur within.Overall this is a small little film that succeeds in making the life of Antonie be very interesting and engaging. The plot may require the story to go beyond the day-to-day experiences of most of us did at that age but it is still emotionally involving thanks to a great combination of a superb and natural performance from Leaud, the direction of Truffaut and the great use of locations throughout.

That's why there are always some rough discussions being held about the rating of a movie. Everyone has a personal opinion, and you have to respect that. Besides that it IS possible to rate a movie on technical aspects. You may not like a film, but in a good movie there are always things you do like.Once upon a time in America is a fantastic movie. At least that's my opinion. The story is fantastic, because you're following three different threads, which in a way has much to do with each other. The Godfather Part II, another favorite of mine, tried to amuse the audience with two threads, and it succeeded very well. The huge difference of the Godfather II is it's speed, it's rhythm. I know a couple of people that don't like it, and that's because it's too slow. But not by far as slow as Once upon a time in America. That's probably one of the main reasons it's not being loved as much as other great films. You have to like Leone's style, but his Westerns are admired, although they're very slow too. But in a way I think people didn't expect it in a Mafia film, and did in a Western. Leone plays with switching to another storyline in this movie, and he does a fantastic job. The way some remarkable objects (the missing brick, the wall at the station) are used to remark a flashback is extraordinary.Another good aspect of Leone is that his scores are composed by Ennio Morricone since A Fistful of Dollars. Good music is the thing that gives a movie more weight, and makes you remember it. And again in Once upon a time in America Morricone succeeded compose one of the best scores ever made for a movie. Unfortunately this movie was way too long for theaters, so they made the biggest mistake possible. Instead of dividing it in two pieces, they deleted an amazing amount of scenes, what raped this movie. The latest DVD release will hopefully give some of it's beauty back, because this movie is a masterpiece. The only movie I've seen that could compare with this is The Godfather Part II, in style and supremacy. If you don't like slow movies, it's a pity, because a movie like this will not be made anymore. And perhaps that's good, as almost every succeeded movie has an equivalent or remake. Once upon a time in America still is a unique performance.
