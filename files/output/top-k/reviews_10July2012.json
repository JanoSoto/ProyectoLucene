It has few of the same actors from the previous Batman movies such as for Commissioner Gordon and Alred. But this movie takes place in a more modernized version of Gotham city and doesn't have that Tim Burton vibe to it anymore. When I first saw this movie as a kid at a mall when it first came out in theaters with my older cousins. I thought this movie was great and found it entertaining. So for when it came out it was probably a decent movie for youths, but watching it now as an adult there is just way too many flaws with this flick. Joel Schumacher just doesn't know Batman all that much. And it clearly shows with the villains, they are just wacky and just way over the top. It was like they both were trying there best to impersonate Jack Nicholson's Joker. All the actors and actress in this were in there prime when this flick came out but they just didn't know the Batman universe all that well. I mean it doesn't have to stick very close to the comics but it sometimes didn't seem like a Batman movie cause certain things are off. You probably won't notice certain flaws in this as a kid but as and adult you pick up on certain things. Jim Carrey had potential to be a good Edward Nigma aka The Riddler but he just didn't act like the Riddler all that much. His portrayal was just too over the top and he seemed to be trying way too much to stand out, only it just didn't work. Yeah he has obsession with riddles and puzzles in this but seem to lack logic and didn't have that cool mischievous and mysterious element to him. Instead he is a very obnoxious character that is bonkers and jumping off the wall. It's basically just Jim Carrey being over the top and acting like Jim Carrey in a lot of his movies. Yeah there are version of the Riddler that is just acts plain crazy, not as much as this one though. But the methodical and yet mischievous representation of the Riddler is still the best one in my opinion. Which was in the comic books and even in the animated series. That is what the Riddler is a methodical villain that really really does his planning and scheming. Tommy Lee Jones version of Harvey Dent aka Two Face was the worst though. Besides the half melted face and a coin the guy was nothing like two face. Tommy Lee Jones probably didn't know Two Face but he sure didn't do his research either. He just comes off as another Joker impersonator, Cesar Romero's version of Joker to be exact. But the director didn't know the demeanor and essence of certain comic book characters so not everything is to blame for these actors. Val Kilmer however is passable as Bruce Wayne and looked the part as well. Micheal Keaton is still the better Batman though. I liked how they didn't portray Batman and Bruce Wayne as a boyscout cause he isn't and Val Kilmer did this well with his cold and serious and yet charismatic portrayal of Bruce Wayne. This is probably the first movie I seen with Nicole Kidman and she sure was in her prime in this as well. Not talking about her acting wise but when it comes to her look anyways. Even if her role isn't major to the story at least there was some eye candy that didn't really add or necessarily take away from this movie. She is basically a more forward version of Vicki Vale(Kim Basinger). And has two love interest, well it can be one as well. Finally when it comes to Robin played by Chris O'Donnell, he was decent but I wasn't a big Robin fan but his presence in this is alright. Kinda gets annoying sometimes but this portrayal of Dick Grayson aka Robin but sorta spot on. Nothing outstanding but it was good. No Robin from Teen Titans that is for sure. All the actors in this movie had potential with the roles they were given, but just didn't know how to portray these comic book characters. Anyways this movie seem to be going in a pop-culture style or commercial direction for Batman that Tim Burton claim to not be a part of for his version of Batman. The action in this movie is just silly like your watching a Saturday morning cartoon. I still give this movie a 6, maybe I am being a bit unfair but this movie had a part during my childhood. Not a big one but a part of it and it's still sort of nostalgic. Probably because this might be the first live action superhero movie I have ever seen. Also the theme song to this is no Danny Elfman's theme song to Batman but this one is still good. Not memorable but it fits well as a Batman theme song.5.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 2012","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" What this is, is a very slight sequel to Tim Burton's Batman Returns but it's mostly a reboot.

It had a good story line in the beginning and you got emotionally into it during and after the tragic accident with Grace and Judith. Being a horse person, I knew the behavior of the horse afterwords was a little far fetched, but thats what happens with most movies. From the get go, I noticed the training methods of The Horse Whisperer were based on fear. This is definitely never the way to go while training horses, so I was skeptical. But I continued t watch, assuming I was mistaken. And for a bit, I believed I was! But the thing that really set me off was in the scene near the end where Tom got Pilgrim saddled. He tied the horse's leg to the saddle horn and made him run around and buck! This is extremely dangerous and could've resulted in a broken leg, snapped neck, even death for the horse. And I know what you're saying, its just a movie. But they had to get the shot somehow, didn't they? This training method could be considered abuse, using fear and force to get the horse to lay down. On top of this, the wife is cheating on her husband with Tom! This is downright unnecessary to the story and wrong. Her husband isn't a bad guy or anything, she just wants to be in the country. Overall, the 3 stars I gave the movie were for the beginning. I consider it animal abuse what he did to the horse. I have been riding for most of my life, I know what I'm talking about.

I was not ignorant of the fact that there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners. I rank this one among the best war films I have ever seen. It details the horrific events of history's ugliest battle from its bloodiest war. The battle for Stalingrad left one million dead, and this brilliant movie shows it all from the point of view of the German Sixth Army. If you know history then you're aware of the fact that this loss for Germany was the first major blunder that would result in the ultimate downfall of the Third Reich. Fresh from their previous victories, the members of the Sixth Army believe they are in for a relatively easy win. However, as the fighting grows more turbulent, the city quickly becomes a hell populated by the piles of the dead. Of course, the suffering doesn't really commence till the Russian winter sets in.Showing this gruesome conflict from the German point-of-view has many purposes. Firstly, to show just how quickly the tide of a military campaign can shift, even for a superpower. Secondly, it is easy for people of the modern era to forget the suffering on both sides. Soldiers have since the beginning of time been nothing more than the tools of politicians (regardless of the government) to cement their goals. The themes are quite relevant, and the story of these men a sheer tragedy. The production value is just stunning and you really are transported back to that time of old, the battle ruined streets of that city.

Intellectual movies, the kind that make you think and leave you thinking about days after seeing them. I couldn't be more wrong, this is without doubt the worst movie I've ever seen (well, maybe exceeded by Moon, which I could not even finished watching because of the the boredom). Don't get me wrong, I love quality science fiction. But this? What are these shots of several minutes of men staring at the nothingness, or those in which the actors go out of the screen and the camera still shows the last frame for eons with no other practical purpose than only prolong our agony in front of the screen? What is the purpose of the dog? How do the room looks like? I think could count 30 minutes in which are shown the actors just lying on the floor doing absolutely nothing. This film could be summed up in 1 hour without any of you missing any relevant detail to the story. Another thing, science fiction? Where? Even the twist at the end doesn't make it science fiction, and neither is enough to save this film and say well, it was worth it after all. No. If I could ask somewhere to recover the hours wasted in this movie I totally would. I don't know who rates and makes reviews on this page.

Basically the whole of the respective family and friends of businessman Helge (Henning Moritzen) have gathered together at the family-run countryside mansion to celebrate his sixtieth birthday. The family include his wife Else (Birthe Neumann), his eldest son Christian (The World Is Not Enough's Ulrich Thomsen), his younger son Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), and his daughter Helene (Paprika Steen). After seeing the people gathering in their rooms and catching up with each other, we find out that the other daughter of Helge, Linda, Christian's twin sister, committed suicide, and Helene has found her suicide note, but she hides it before the dinner. We see Michael have a fight with his wife, and we find out that he had an affair with and made a waitress pregnant, but he braves himself as the people start to eat, but then, after his father thanks everyone for coming and stuff Christian decides to make his own speech. He tells all the guests everyone about the fact that his father sexually abused him and his Linda when they were children; everyone ignores these accusations and they assume this is some sort of joke or a figment of his imagination, his father has a private talk with him about this speech, but he appears to apologise. He is encouraged to continue the slander though by hotel chef Kim (Bjarne Henriksen), as she knows about the abuse too, so he continues a toast and says that Linda killed herself because of Helge, to which his father confronts him again and threatens to reveal facts about him. Soon enough Helen's black American boyfriend Gbatokai (Gbatokai Dakinah) arrives to join the party, and this does not make Michael happy as he is racist, and speaking in their own language he gets many of the guests to sing along to a disgraceful racist children's song to offend him. After Else makes a toast to try and put Christian back in everyone's good books, he gets up again to accuse her of witnessing one of the rapes that his father did and not doing anything to stop it, to which he is dragged out by Michael and two other guests. After one or two more attempts to run back into the hall Christian ends up tied to a tree in the nearby woods by his brother and the other two men, but while he is not at the party a guilty Helen finally decides to read the letter she found written by Linda. In the letter Linda writes that she killed herself because she was haunted by dreams of her father raping her, and in a moment of anger Helge admits to everyone that he did indeed abuse Michael, and that it was all he was good for. He leaves the hall and the guests who are all shocked, Christian comes back to the hall and finds out that Michael is missing, and he approaches his father to beat him up and say that he will never see his grandchildren again. The next morning, and the end of the film, Helge admits that he did wrong in the past, and that he does love his children, but Michael is not in the mood to forgive him, Christian is returning to Paris with waitress Pia (Trine Dyrholm), and as he leaves the rest of the family quietly have breakfast. Also starring Helle Dolleris as Mette, Therese Glahn as Michelle, Klaus Bondam as Master of Ceremonies and Lasse Lunderskov as Uncle. This was the first film in a series known as Dogme 95, and something to do do with avant-garde filmmaking, these films had rules, such as on location filming, no inserted sounds, hand-held camera-work, in colour with no special lighting, no filtering, no effects (for something like a murder), a story in present day, no genre, in a certain frame format, and an uncredited director, the only other film I know in the series is The Idiots. Anyway, this new approach to filmmaking makes for an interesting watch, not just when you consider these rules, because it makes the story all the more believable, and it adds to the tense atmosphere, it is a compelling story about something terrible revealed in an event that should be happy, and all in all it is a most watchable drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Good!

Then comes Superman II when the three Kryptonian criminals manage to escape the Phantom Zone and they head for Earth so as to conquer it. Obviously, Superman is the only thing standing in their way, and he is also the only thing that can protect Earth from total domination.After the release of Superman there was incredible fallout between the director and the producers. Once all the debris had settled we were left with the same producers but a new director. Richard Lester had come on board to replace Richard Donner and he branded the Superman franchise with a slightly different style. One that appeals more to a comic book aesthetic more than the grand scale David Lean-esque epic style that Donner created with the first film. Thus, Superman II is a little campier and less magnificent than it's predecessor. There are certain things about it that I liked more than the first film, and some things I like less.Superman had a streak of light hearted humor and playful campiness to it, but Superman II accelerates that to a whole new level. The humor in the sequel almost seems to mock the superhero at times. It's fun and it makes the film entertaining, but it doesn't feel quite right, and it detracts from the overall impact of the film much more than Superman did.My biggest issue with Superman II, however, has to be the continuity and the plot holes that run rampant throughout the film. The film is full of logical fallacies which get on my nerves, and a lot of these you just have to look past because, at the end of the day, it is a Superman film. But what really got me was the logic in the plot at times. One of the major events of the plot is Superman having to give up his powers to be with Lois Lane. His mother tells him he will never be able to get his powers back after he gives them up, yet about twenty minutes after he gives them up and General Zod and company are attacking Metropolis, Superman returns all suited up and ready to fight. It never explains how he got his powers back and I'm just left wondering how something like that slipped through the cracks. It's pretty aggravating, and it made Superman II a slightly less enjoyable experience.But, looking past the gaps in the plot, as a simple superhero action flick Superman II really does succeed. There are some great fights throughout the film and some very excitingly well shot action sequences. The fight between the three Kryptonian villains and Superman in downtown Metropolis has all the Superman action we could ever ask for, and the final showdown in Superman's crystal fortress is awesome as well. Superman II has it's issues that keep it from being as good as it's predecessor, and I also didn't like it as much just out of personal taste. But it's definitely a pretty good film and as a Superman film it most certainly delivers. If you enjoyed the first film at all you shouldn't miss out on Superman II.

I remember reading a comparative review about Natalie Portman, with critics stated she's the present times' Audrey Hepburn. Upon hearing some good remarks from my officemate how Audrey did well on her movies Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany's, then maybe it is high time for me to see this lady predefine Natalie Portman's paralleled fame. I went to watch Breakfast at Tiffany's. The film was entirely great! I mean the story (first and foremost) was unexpected. Seeing the movie posters makes you think straight how the movie will turn out to be, but make you revoke your first impression upon seeing the rest. It was a good deal of a story. Nothing I could exactly remember in my movie experiences the same lucid story of a woman's desperateness to climb the top to provide for someone, while cloaking her pretentious strength and feebly endure her tangled situation. This is the first time I saw George Peppard and I must say he possessed the classic handsomeness and theatric skillfulness so unheard of that in my opinion (base on my research) was so underrated or underused. Audrey and George were cool together. Their tandem was a bit off because of their apparent differences but easily understandable as each other's milieu were understandable to his\/her own. You could quickly discern that the moment they met, Oh, he's the one. It's predictable, but what I don't hate about predictability is the storyline's beauty coating the entirety of the film to compensate for such clichéness. You may have predicted it but you still haven't understood the rest yet.George Peppard's performance was good. The first time I saw him use such skills was finer than any famous actor could claim for and averagely perform the act instead. He's was cool. The character was patient, conservative, looks weak and common at first glance, but straightforward and truer than any man you could imagine in the world. Audrey Hepburn was indeed superb. I can't find a word to truly describe her in this film. It's somewhere between best and average. I don't want to overrate her or even undermine her. She was really fun. It felt watching Katharine Hepburn in a different setting. She's fun, adorable, interesting, keen and makes you keep an eye until she broke the character's inner depths. I saw Natalie Portman's Black Swan before this, and I can see the two actresses' skinny stature comparable. But that was a pun.

Audrey indeed did well in this film and so much of her I wanted to see more.

It's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours or so because the action scenes are entertaining enough and Charlie Sheen's 'loose cannon' shtick is oddly compelling, but it should have been better. It has a cast that looks pretty decent on paper Sheen, Biehn, Paxton, Rossovich, Haysbert and even Law and Order's Merkerson. However, with the exception of Sheen and Biehn, they are underutilised, especially Paxton. Paxton is a good all-round actor, but here he barely gets to say anything at all! Even Sheen and Biehn play fairly shallow characters. For example, what turned Sheen's character (Hawkins) into the loose cannon that he is? As for Biehn's character (Curran), is he motivated by the loss of his friends in Beirut or by his sense of duty? I'm not sure the movie makes it entirely clear. Another weakness the movie has is that it lacks a particularly strong villain. Kadi, as Ben Shaheed, tries to paint a vaguely sympathetic picture for Shaheed's cause, but he simply doesn't appear enough. The main villain appears to be the Stinger missiles, if anything.The plot is a bit thin, but substantial enough to keep the movie going. Basically, Hawkins and Curran lead a bunch of Navy SEAL's in a quest to find some Stingers that are used against civilian aircraft. Curran woos a half-Lebanese reporter so she can help them out. One obvious plot hole is how this reporter can know more than the CIA, but I digress. The plot is good enough to be a vehicle for firefights, some obligatory friction between Hawkins and Curran and for Sheen to act stylish. For an action movie, that's probably enough. Also, although none of the actors have that much to work with, Sheen and Biehn almost make the film worth watching by themselves. Sheen does his 'loose cannon' act well, reeling off the odd vaguely humorous one liner (though his character is thoroughly unrealistic for a SEAL), while few people are better than Biehn at playing military characters. Indeed, he received praise from the US Navy for his calm, composed performance. As for the dialogue...well, who cares? Lots of profanity, some bravado, some one-liners - standard action movie stuff most of the time. Biehn does provide the odd noteworthy line you just toasted a man you put in the grave, but that's about it. It doesn't make Navy Seals a bad movie though. As mindless entertainment, it delivers. However, considering its nearly 2 hour movie length and reasonably strong cast, it should have been better. 2.5\/5 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Navy Seals is just another action film, for mine.

And the film's attempt at social commentary, well, that just sucked.A good deal of the problem rests with the main character. When he is not playing his sport, he spends a lot of time moping about his palatial estate, moaning about how being rich and famous isn't so great. And yet, like so many rich and famous people who find themselves in such a funk, he doesn't seem the least bit inclined to give up his wealth and fame.

I'm mentioning it because I had severe asthma attacks and had to leave the theatre at some point, by the excitement and emotional attachment. Well, ultimately my parents pushed me into it.

I deeply felt the 70s and the beginning of 80s were the best times of my life. There was hope, I felt it. No. This is not a parents guide, neither vanity, neither morality, it's just to simply state that I never got tired of seeing Star Wars despite all, not even by now, all the genuine three. And I have an eye for films, don't ask me specifically why or in what, but boy I can tell if a film is a hoax or not.By now I don't have any problems confessing my fan crimes, transformed myself as a Star Wars atheist. They begun with Empire Strikes Back, somehow with its special effects. Neither the tauntauns or the AT-AT walkers frame to frame animation caught my interest... something was changing, perhaps an excessive preoccupation to exceed everything, a megalomania quest... but Master Yoda did it, the psychological cave did and Freudian Vader did also. I forget my inner thoughts, the hope persisted and I sincerely cried when the Jedi returned, sacrificing himself for his son. I still do considering the ascension to Vader's redemption one of the best scenes in Star Wars universe. I was being taught to never lost hope for Darth Vader, my anti-hero, the revolted anger the one that suffered in silence, myself as a child. Somehow I always knew Vader wasn't bad but a victim and a pawn of circumstances, I was being Luke Skywalker in heart, excusing my family scars giving pause to guilt. Perhaps Star Wars compensated my lacking of a familiar functional structure. I saw THX 1138 definitely acknowledging that Star Wars saga was encrypted with philosophy, mythology and psychology, it was juicy and complex, my inner attachment wasn't in vain. I was delirious. Lucas was indeed my mentor. When I was lost, Star Wars was my anchor, I think it was also Luca's.The Ewok Adventure was released after Return of the Jedi, making me suspecting at that time that something wasn't going right, something disturbing the force, something paradoxical. The same director created both the trilogy and this... nonsense. How could it be? I understood by then that a film was composed by many pieces, Lucas only directed Star Wars IV in Star Wars first trilogy. If there weren't many key factors as its perfect edition (Lucas's wife included) Star Wars would be a flop. Lucas didn't compose the music, neither illustrated his imagination, nor put to effort the realistic special effects, or voiced Darth Vader, created the laser sound effects, C3-P0's soul, R2D2's bips and independent personality, Chewbaka's corporal expression, Yoda's puppeteering, Vader's breeding, Han Solo's acting, Luke's commitment, Ben Kenobi's humongous acting posture... and so forth. After that Return of the Jedi was re-released in theatres. I thought good, perhaps Lucas is creating the first 3. I noticed the credits were slightly modified, I didn't understand why.When I picked a look at some samples of the new remastered trilogy in 1997, I felt the same strange feeling when facing The Ewok Adventure, something wasn't right again. Something wasn't definitely right when the originals were shadowed from the market. My stomach got funny just by thinking Lucas was erasing and changing history, just by wondering Lucas was acting as the emperor of his appropriated empire. I couldn't believe Lucas was spoiling his own work... or indeed it was exclusively the fruits of his only own work? There was a disturbance in my force when I started to understand there were many many people involved allowing Star Wars to be a success as I discovered the beautiful art of Ralph McQuarrie.

All of it has been betrayed for economical interests, antagonizing the code of the good ones, effectively extinguishing the Jedi order, showing that indeed Society has a Sith partnership and the empire hides in pseudo principles absorbing everything to itself. Perhaps he'll return as a Jedi, but I already lost my hope. Jedi fans as myself became orphans of a pseudo world antagonistic to a raw cruel reality.

Neither I have seen anything that spectacular nor the world, or my father the one that lead me to this memorial day... In terms of space fantasy of course. I saw it at least 20 times at cinemas. I'm mentioning it because I had severe asthma attacks and had to leave the theatre at some point, by the excitement and emotional attachment. Well, ultimately my parents pushed me into it. They were feeling also as kids and they were establishing a bridge of communication with their son compensating the gap between us, perhaps the world was finally taking a break, a deep breath from previous political disasters which like a wave reached all corners of the world. I deeply felt the 70s and the beginning of 80s were the best times of my life. There was hope, I felt it. No. This is not a parents guide, neither vanity, neither morality, it's just to simply state that I never got tired of seeing Star Wars despite all, not even by now, all the genuine three. And I have an eye for films, don't ask me specifically why or in what, but boy I can tell if a film is a hoax or not.By now I don't have any problems confessing my fan crimes, transformed myself as a Star Wars atheist. They begun with Empire Strikes Back, somehow with its special effects. Neither the tauntauns or the AT-AT walkers frame to frame animation caught my interest... something was changing, perhaps an excessive preoccupation to exceed everything, a megalomania quest... but Master Yoda did it, the psychological cave did and Freudian Vader did also. I forget my inner thoughts, the hope persisted and I sincerely cried when the Jedi returned, sacrificing himself for his son. I still do considering the ascension to Vader's redemption one of the best scenes in Star Wars universe. I was being taught to never lost hope for Darth Vader, my anti-hero, the revolted anger the one that suffered in silence, myself as a child. Somehow I always knew Vader wasn't bad but a victim and a pawn of circumstances, I was being Luke Skywalker in heart, excusing my family scars giving pause to guilt. Perhaps Star Wars compensated my lacking of a familiar functional structure. I saw THX 1138 definitely acknowledging that Star Wars saga was encrypted with philosophy, mythology and psychology, it was juicy and complex, my inner attachment wasn't in vain. I was delirious. Lucas was indeed my mentor. When I was lost, Star Wars was my anchor, I think it was also Luca's.The Ewok Adventure was released after Return of the Jedi, making me suspecting at that time that something wasn't going right, something disturbing the force, something paradoxical. The same director created both the trilogy and this... nonsense. How could it be? I understood by then that a film was composed by many pieces, Lucas only directed Star Wars IV in Star Wars first trilogy. If there weren't many key factors as its perfect edition (Lucas's wife included) Star Wars would be a flop. Lucas didn't compose the music, neither illustrated his imagination, nor put to effort the realistic special effects, or voiced Darth Vader, created the laser sound effects, C3-P0's soul, R2D2's bips and independent personality, Chewbaka's corporal expression, Yoda's puppeteering, Vader's breeding, Han Solo's acting, Luke's commitment, Ben Kenobi's humongous acting posture... and so forth. After that Return of the Jedi was re-released in theatres. I thought good, perhaps Lucas is creating the first 3. I noticed the credits were slightly modified, I didn't understand why.When I picked a look at some samples of the new remastered trilogy in 1997, I felt the same strange feeling when facing The Ewok Adventure, something wasn't right again. Something wasn't definitely right when the originals were shadowed from the market. My stomach got funny just by thinking Lucas was erasing and changing history, just by wondering Lucas was acting as the emperor of his appropriated empire. I couldn't believe Lucas was spoiling his own work... or indeed it was exclusively the fruits of his only own work? There was a disturbance in my force when I started to understand there were many many people involved allowing Star Wars to be a success as I discovered the beautiful art of Ralph McQuarrie. I started my own quest in search of the hidden crucial elements. But I couldn't betray my master, not in a Sith way. I kept the hope... until I sceptically saw The Phantom's Menace. Coincidentally cutting relations with my father at a contemporary time. Wished he was at this début as he was in the first time.For 30 years I expected to see a complex intricate dark transformation of Darth Vader, to understand why there were so many parallels in this Father and Son Freudian story, reflected on my own family relation. Why one should follow the Jedi way expressed on the artist's work, the sequel of his philosophical pursuit of a better world, a better democracy, a recycled expression of Luca's principles? All of it has been betrayed for economical interests, antagonizing the code of the good ones, effectively extinguishing the Jedi order, showing that indeed Society has a Sith partnership and the empire hides in pseudo principles absorbing everything to itself. Perhaps he'll return as a Jedi, but I already lost my hope. Jedi fans as myself became orphans of a pseudo world antagonistic to a raw cruel reality. The Jedi order was betrayed and slaughtered by its innocence and naivety, Lucas abandoned his own therapy, his own parallels to the world he'd created, his idealism now transformed into cynicism, the tool of the survivors, the preachers.

It may not have gone many exotic places, much of it in one tiny village, but hey, neither did Titanic. But it's epic status is not what sets it apart from the rest; no, rather is its dramatic storyline and subplots, as well as very likable leads. Kurosawa's script (also a writer here) doesn't play this up as a period piece, thankfully refraining from anachronisms, and it says fresh in 2012 (although it was probably re-subtitled with the DVD release a few years ago). It also shows the Japanese humor that Kurosawa eagerly portrays in some scenes--genuinely funny, I might add--even if not full on comedy quality (it is a drama after all).After the opening credits, which features great drum based music, showcasing Japanese culture and the action element of Seven Samurai, we see a group of bandits about to pillage a village positioned in a basin with sides made of mountains, frequently demanding that the villagers pay them to keep them safe. A farmer from this small farming town overhears their conversation to come back when the harvest is over. A leader from the village suggests hiring samurai to protect them, ones that will take rice and shelter as compensation. So we see a down-on-his-luck veteran-samurai negotiating and freeing a child from harm, and a representative from the village asks for help. After much persuading the samurai accepts, but says the job will require at least seven. Next, we track down four more, a good natured one that is often the source of comic relief, and a master swordsman, who's quiet, yet well spoken, with philosophical lines. A villager is accepted to the brotherhood. Finally, a clown of a man, seldom not drunk at the beginning, who begs to come along, and they reluctantly accept.After this rich exposition, the committee tasked with finding the samurai return victorious, and you next expect a great celebration, possibly even a feast (this is a town where the villagers seldom eat rice out of season, only millet). Much to the chagrin of the seven, there is no outpouring, not even people in the streets. The men with daughters and\/or wives, are protecting them from who they think are going to rape them. The rest are simply afraid. So the wild card, the fool among masters, sounds the alarm bells in the village square. After all the peoples fear the worst and come out to defend themselves, the samurai delivers a wonderfully pointed speech about how they did not come to be feared and hated by the townspeople, but to provide a great service for below minimal payment scolding them for indecency and generalizations, and more than anything, whining about it, too.The next half hour or so, is showing the village and collected samurai readying for defense (traps, positioning, and the like), and teaching the villagers how to defend themselves with a sword or spear. And a lovely romance too scandalous for public approval, this is the only part that would gain a significant amount if in color. The picturesque setting with its wonderful fall setting, with leaves on the ground, a small stream and presumed cherry blossoms for this great love story Technicolor would have just made your heart sing.But of all the things in this movie that are good, nothing beats the last hour, an all out battle bandits versus the magnificent seven (yes, this is where that came from). I can't overstate it enough, of all the movies I've seen with battles or even wars in it, nothing, not even the brilliant western shootouts from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, can top this, not one second could be beaten by almost any other fights in the history of cinema. You may not like the long, suspense and plot building drama that precedes it, but no one can deny the masterpiece that is this battle. As a stand-alone movie, it would still be pretty good (and probably not too short, either).Long movie short, Akira Kurosawa's rich character development and perennially likable personalities (it seems as though a different person wrote each part, they're really that built up), along with what is the all time greatest battle I've ever seen, easily and gracefully earns Shichinin no samurai a high place in anyone's movie collection. http\/\/woltzpictures.wordpress.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 2012","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Coming in at over three hours, and being set in 1500s feudal Japan, Seven Samurai is a true historical epic.

I have never written a review for IMDb but after reading the first four or five reviews posted here I felt compelled. The plot involves an asbestos removal team which is hired to clean up an old insane asylum and during the job strange things occur perhaps of a supernatural nature. The exterior of the asylum is gorgeously photographed from the sky in its architectural splendor. The interior is convincingly portrayed as a genuinely decaying place. The story is not very original &#x96; except for the asbestos part which I found interesting &#x96; but, all and all, simple and promising and the setting was magnificent.This was not a very good film.To make a long story short, there are two distinct elements going on throughout the roughly 90 minute running time.The first is the relationships between the work crew which is shown and the relationships with the workers and their families\/significant others which is implied. Each character has something going on at home The Boss is on the outs with the Mrs. and his newborn because I accidentally hit my wife. The second in command (David Caruso) lost his girlfriend to the devil may care worker character (Josh Lucas) with all the contrived tension that would entail. The too smart for this job character is a law school dropout whose father is the state district attorney who, coincidently, prosecuted a case 15 years earlier that led to the closing of the asylum. And there is the slacker nephew of the boss whose primary function is to be the sounding board\/audience for the various meaning of life soliloquies of the other characters.The second are the tapes of old therapy sessions with patient 444 that the law school dropout finds in the basement. There are nine of them (hence the title) and are played in voice over. The patient was a multiple personality that the doctor is trying to make remember something terrible that happened in her past. The conversations between the doctor and the patient are actually not very good but the sequences of the playback are effectively creepy because of the dismembered voice feel they have. Quite frankly, it is hard to mess up such a scenario in editing because it is inherently eerie combining an unfolding conversation which, we are to believe, is leading to some important revelation and shots of men in hazmat suits scraping pipes, walls and floors of ancient materials. But the end result of these sequences is less than mediocre due to the weakness and meandering of the dialog.What I just described is the entire movie with the main plot point being Josh Lucas finding an old hiding spot which contains a cache of seemingly valuable coins. He comes back that night to take them home and, disappointedly, disappears after he is attacked by an unseen enemy in possibly the most cliché cinematic shot of the thriller genre. The one where the character is looking directly at the camera and says with a relieved facial, What are YOU doing here? and then contorts as he is attacked then cut away to the others wondering where he is. There are a couple other red herrings thrown in but anyone who has ever seen a movie before will know what is what.Spoiler Alert!Everyone but the boss ends up killed by&#x85;the boss. He didn't just accidentally hit his wife but killed her and his infant child at the beginning of the job. All of this is revealed in the OTHER most cliché cinematic shot of the thriller genre where the character comes to the realization in a series of flashbacks where supposedly unrelated throw away earlier behavior now has significant meaning. The movie ends with the killer standing in a cell where, it is implied, he has been staying throughout the entire job staring out the window. While he stares one of the personalities of patient 444, I take it the dominant controlling one named Simon, says something that is supposed to be either profound or at least conclusive&#x85;I think.

It is also mentioned several times that junkies squatters and teenagers periodically need to be chased off by an armed guard. Caruso in one scene is seen suspiciously conversing with two of them which is one of the red herrings I mentioned earlier. I really don't know.There is a fine line between an open interpretative ending and flat out lazy inconclusive writing. This movie crosses it.

I, like most people I assume, did not become familiar with Christian Bale till he became the new Bruce Wayne back in 2005.

I heard a lot of great things about the trilogy, especially with The Bourne Identity. So, I decided to get the trilogy for Christmas, and today, I sat down, watched The Bourne Identity, and I extremely enjoyed it. I thought it was a fantastic start to the Bourne trilogy.STORY A man's (Matt Damon) body has been recovered from the Mediterranean Sea by fishermen. When he is saved, however, he remembers absolutely nothing from his life, including his name. So, that means he has amnesia. When he starts to remember some details from his life, he finds out that his name is Jason Bourne. He, and his new friend, Marie (Franka Potente) go on the run from someone who's trying to hunt him down, so he could try to search for his identity.MY THOUGHTS The action\/fight sequences were the main qualities that made this movie great. They were well-executed, well-choreographed, well-shot, well-paced, and all in all, very well-done. The direction by Doug Liman was excellent. He knows how to direct a scene that was fast-paced and it keeps people on the edge of their seat. This movie is full of twists and turns; so if you haven't seen the movie yet and feel like you need to, be prepared to pay attention.THE ACTING Matt Damon does an outstanding job playing the hero, Jason Bourne. I think he was more believable as a hero than Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible (although I liked Ethan Hunt). Damon's fighting choreography &#x96; which were basically martial arts fighting moves &#x96; they were pretty impressive, and make the movie worth watching. Bourne is very intelligent; he can speak in many different languages, whenever he's in a different country; and he's also violent, like many other action heroes. Franka Potente does great playing Marie, a woman who Bourne meets at a bank in Switzerland, and he decides to bring her so they could get away from the CIA.The supporting cast features Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Julia Stiles, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Mr. Eko from Lost). I think the best supporting actor in this movie is Chris Cooper as the head of Treadstone at the CIA headquarters who's tracking down Bourne.IN CONCLUSION I thought The Bourne Identity was a great start to the Bourne trilogy. It was intense, fast-paced, well-acted (especially from Matt Damon), and very entertaining.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" After seeing trailers and commercials for The Bourne Legacy (which comes out August 10th), I had to watch the trilogy as soon as it releases in theaters.

As an adventure story alone, it's A-1 as to pacing, setting, engaging viewer interest, and realism. At times, it's very hard to see how it could have been photographed.The three protagonists, two escaped convicts and a young female railroad employee, face challenge after challenge aboard a runaway train in the ice and snow of Alaska. Meanwhile, an obsessed warden pursues them and a frustrated bunch of railroad employees back at the control center attempt to stop the train before it either kills those aboard or smashes into other vulnerable sites and kills even more people.As the realization dawns on the three main characters (Jon Voight, Eric Roberts and Rebecca de Mornay) that they may all be killed, they begin to interact in a series of shifts, transformations and reflections that remind one of Rashomon, except that it's happening to them in real time, not as distorted memories. (Kurosawa wrote the earlier screenplay.) Deep questions of life and death, the realization of freedom, courage, triumph, and the nature of a human being all surface as these three individuals, each with a different outlook, are brought together in a life or death situation.When we first see Voight chained in his cell, his spirit is unbroken as he does pushups vigorously. On the wall are many scrawls, but one stands out near the black power clenched fist Triumph over all. Voight wants to triumph over the warden (John P. Ryan), even if he has to die doing it. The warden calls him an animal. De Mornay at one point does the same. Voight sees himself more clearly as worse -- a human. This theme is reinforced by the quote from Richard III at the end. Lady Anne says to Gloucester Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity. He replies But I know none, and therefore am no beast. His witty reply that catches her in contradiction is Voight saying he is no animal, but rather human. When de Mornay, the otherwise sensible and law-abiding person, during one conflict urges Roberts to kill Voight, she shows her ferocity as a human. She who called Voight animal becomes worse than animal briefly.But although this theme is stressed, it is human to act in contradictions as contexts alter. Voight may be willing to die, but not just yet if he can help it. He may be ready to kill Roberts, who is not his enemy, but he also recognizes the urge and, in a redemptive sense of self-insight and perhaps shame, can overcome it and attempt to surpass his human nature, even to fly five feet like a bird. With what aim? To be free. Although he becomes a ghost-like and Christ-like figure disappearing into the Alaskan mists, he is headed beyond this life, beyond winning and losing, beyond escaping prison, and beyond killing the warden. He is heading into a place where none of it makes a difference to him. His desire to die now that he is free and never be imprisoned again is stronger than his desire to live and be chained up like an animal and treated like one. He prefers to be human and die.
