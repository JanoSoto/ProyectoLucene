Maybe I suspected something was wrong, maybe it's that I was in the army when it first came out, maybe I just don't know. But now I know, and very sadly, that I didn't miss all that much.The film is pictorially gorgeous throughout, the mark of David Lean's post mid-1950s directing career, but that almost ends the positive commentary. I found the film almost totally cold, most of the characters unsympathetic (and not always the ones you might think), the performances mostly of little depth if not totally wooden, and I had extreme difficulty following not just the changing feelings of the lead characters, but even the story line as the War and then the Revolution progress. Why Mr. Bolt won an Oscar for his screenplay adaptation of the book is a total mystery to me. We would be in the middle of one scene, under a specific set of historical circumstances, only to suddenly find ourselves in the middle of another scene, under very different historical circumstances, and with little to no explanation covering the change. If I got lost once, I got lost 6 or 8 times in the course of the movie. I simply do not understand most of the characters in this film. Lara does not seem to me to be all that mesmerizing to the point where the Courtenay, Steiger and Sharif characters are so besotted with her. Why she should be any more a muse for Zhivago's poetry than is his wife, or the Revolution itself, is not at all clear to me. Why after 20 or 25 years the Alec Guinness character is suddenly so intent on reestablishing a relationship with someone who might be the daughter of his late half-brother is unclear. I could go on, but the screenplay is a hodgepodge and what makes it worse it that the two leading actors don't really come through all that compellingly. Most at fault is Sharif, who is a fairly shallow actor (especially for an iconic role like this one, which really needs a Brando to do it justice), and who seems to lack any real emotional impact in both his visual appearance and in his spoken lines (his best performance for me remains his cat-who-ate-the-canary interpretation of a Nazi officer investigating a civilian murder in the otherwise not-too-great Night of the Generals). One almost expects subtitles like Now, Dr. Zhivago is sad, Now, Dr. Zhivago is contemplative, or maybe even Now, Dr.Zhivago is cold! Christie is not all that much better here, because I miss the all-entrancing beauty and internal qualities that this character should have as Zhivago's muse. For me, the best performances in the film come from Tom Courtenay as Lara's increasingly heartless Bolshevik husband, Rod Steiger's near-reprehensible-but-always-understandable seducer of Lara, Geraldine Chaplin's lovely and sympathetic portrayal of Zhivago's wife (looks aside, why he would want to tryst with Christie while Chaplin is at home is never very convincingly explained; is he as shallow as the actor portraying him?), and Guinness's somewhat sympathetic-under-the-surface half-brother. Unfortunately, Courtenay disappears fitfully, and then completely upon committing suicide (off screen, yet!), Chaplin disappears about 2\/3rds of the way through the film (off screen again!), and Guinness is more of an investigator into the past than a participant in it. Only Steiger has a completely meaty role throughout, and it is one of the best things he ever did. But we are still stuck with Sharif and Christie for three hours. Oh yes, and Maurice Jarre's music has only one real selling point, and that is Lara's Theme, which is quite beautiful, but it is used so often in the film in various dramatic guises - it seems to fit any situation - that it comes off like the Russian Revolution's musical answer to Dimitri Tiomkin's similar overuse of the title song every few minutes in that much more perfect movie, High Noon.Anyway, the film is too visually beautiful to just dismiss, so I must give it a 7, but without the scenery it would be a 5 (although without Sharif, it might have made it to 8!).

The genre was technically lurking in the background, somewhere behind the slasher genre and low budget zombie flicks. You could probably trace it back to such cinematic delights as 'Cannibal Holocaust' in the seventies (only you'd probably regret it if you did). Anyway, The Blair Witch Project may not have entirely invented the type of film which is purely watching shaky hand-held camera-work filmed (for the purposes of the story) by the characters we're following, but it did bring it back to the forefront of horror-movie making. Maybe that along means I should despise it. Only I don't.If you're not familiar with the 'found footage' genre then you probably don't watch enough horror films, therefore any interest you may have in watching three teenagers get lost in a woods will be minimal. That's pretty much the story. The three of them are film students and decide to make &#x96; you guessed it &#x96; a project on the (allegedly fictional) 'Blair Witch.' Naturally, things don't go according to plan and, if getting lost wasn't annoying enough, some unseen force starts to mess with their little school trip (and one girl gets a runny nose &#x96; if you've already seen it you'll know what I mean).You may have picked up on my use of the word 'unseen.' For all found footage films are cheaply produced (okay, feel free to shout me down with such epics as 'Cloverfield' and the odd high budget one, but MOST are!). That way the film-makers don't really have to spend that much money on special effects when they can just have the person holding the camera shake it about a bit and then run off. This is the Blair Witch Project all over. If you're expecting hordes of computer-generated monsters storming the woods and chasing our hapless teens down then you're going to be sorely disappointed.You have to realise that you're going to get long periods of time where not that much happens.

It really felt adlibbed (actually I think some was) and what you might expect from watching hours upon hours of footage filmed by just some bloke behind the camera.

I guess that could be explained by them slowly losing their minds due to their predicament, so, if you don't mind their constant swearing, it can be excused.So, if you're okay with 'found footage' films and are interested in the one that spawned a hundred inferior clones, then give this one a go. It's not long and you won't waste too much of your life on it. It's genuinely creepy here and there. Just don't bother with the sequel which doesn't even bother to be original and is just your standard horror cliché-fest.Oh, and if you don't think much to the way BWP ended, you're not the only one.

I was disappointed to see so many negative reviews, most of which complained about historical inaccuracies. This movie is not intended as a documentary of the battle. It's a drama based on the overall scope of events during a short period of several weeks at the height of the battle. The director takes artistic license to convey the apocalyptic carnage that was wrought by the Nazi's during their ill-conceived, make-or-break attempt to capture the city. This was total war and no person or institution was spared by either side during the battle. The opening scenes portraying the Soviet defenders crossing the River Volga to confront the Nazis are among the most stunning and terrifying battle scenes ever filmed, easily the equal of the heroic D-Day landings portrayed in Saving Private Ryan. Nothing is whitewashed or concealed. I am not a history expert but I assume and accept, as many other reviewers have noted, that there are extensive, albeit probably minor in the grand scheme of the movie, inaccuracies with respect to how the Russians managed their defenses, the frequent execution of soldiers deemed to be deserting their positions or retreating without permission, and so on. However I do believe the director portrayed the Russians in a very favorable and sympathetic light, as unbelievably tough, heroic and patriotic in the face of likely annihilation before a much larger and better equipped enemy. The story had to be told from the perspective of individual soldiers, mainly Vasily Zaytsev, a Hero of the Soviet Union who of course did not singlehandedly win the Battle of Stalingrad, but definitely made critical contributions by killing numerous Nazi officers and snipers, and more importantly, by inspiring the Soviets to fight on. Truly outstanding performance by Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushchev, and another surprise appearance by Ron Pearlman as a fellow sniper (in one scene the look on his face mirrors his role from Quest for Fire). The entire cast was great, this was a long, fascinating movie, it is no exaggeration to describe this movie as an epic production. Historical inaccuracies aside, the Soviets are depicted honorably as having fought back the Nazis to save their country, a turning point that spelled ultimate disaster for the ever-foolhardy Nazis.

The story itself is a great one, it was the downfall of the reviled Schultz when he muscled in on the numbers racket.Tim Roth almost gets to Oscar territory in this movie. Absolutely spectacular. Andy Garcia, ditto BIG time. Fishburnes part is very stolid and one dimensional as maybe the real Bumpy was but nevertheless he delivers.A so so supporting cast, a weak script - except for Roth's lines - and Scorcese-oid attempts at certain setups and shots hose it down quite a bit for me. Funny story, I originally rented Mobsters by mistake and found that film pretty awful, this one was much better.Bad direction at times, but mostly watchable with good continuity.

In Summer of '42, a couple of sex-obsessed but inexperienced teenage boys take their summertime girlfriends to the theater and their choice of pictures is Now, Voyager. As the boys try to cop a cheap feel, and as the girls swat away their advances, I don't know how much of the picture they actually got to see. But since this title was in a stack of unwatched movies, my own decision was an easy one to make.The title comes from an obscure line from the poet Walt Whitman in my summary above. The 'Voyager' of the film is the character portrayed by Bette Davis, an emotionally scarred young woman whose domineering mother has made her a cloistered wreck. With the help of a patient and understanding psychiatrist (Claude Rains), Charlotte Vail (Davis) discards the remnants of her abusive past and begins to grow as a self confident young woman, eventually catching the eye of a gentleman who shows interest in her aboard a cruise ship. As their romance blossoms, Jerry Durrance (Paul Henried) reveals the details of an unhappy marriage in which he's trapped, with a daughter suffering the consequences of a mother who like Miss Vail's own, is incapable of showing love or compassion.In sharp counterpoint to Mrs. Henry Vale's (Gladys Cooper) attitudes regarding wealth and societal status, Durrance offers one of the most compelling and effective arguments ever made in cinema when he speaks to Charlotte about finding happiness - two people having fun together, getting a kick out of simple, little things and finding beauty in them, and sharing confidences with a loved one you wouldn't share with anyone else in the world. It's the kind of advice that would make practitioners like Dr. Jaquith (Rains) obsolete if one would only take it to heart and follow it.Bette Davis had a way of tugging on viewer heartstrings in many of the roles she portrayed in her films. In this picture she quite literally transforms from an ugly duckling into an attractive young woman, while running a gamut of emotions coming to grips with love, losing it, and finding the way back again.

Even Hermie's (Gary Grimes) wistful encounters with Dorothy were realistic and dealt with youthful fantasy in a way that most viewers can relate to. Perhaps if the bedroom scene with Hermie and Dorothy had been handled as a dream sequence, their characters would have maintained a certain integrity that was diminished by what actually happened.
