It never grew old and tiring, it never seemed to let up. It was the best movie ever back then, I was transfixed in a world where anything happens.. So years later (yesterday, to be exact) I watch it again. I wanted to get that feeling of pure nostalgia, understand the moral of the story, and most importantly understand those adult jokes! And with all this build-up, you must agree, Shrek still holds up.What I loved best about Shrek was how it was a satirical view of fairy tales. Each setting, line, and situation mimicked some fairy tale of some sort. We have the clichés, but Shrek knows what they are and puts them in the shredder, creating the perfect piece of imagination. The plot wasn't spoiled, or rotten, it kept going and never let up. Now when I was a kid, I never understood any of the jokes, and you know back then all you were laughing at was the slapstick humor. Now, nowadays, the jokes were comedic gold! I'm surprised at how much adult jokes were hidden underneath, making this one of the riskiest animation films of all time. And that's a good thing. Shrek was sarcastically funny while Eddie Murphy's Donkey kept coming and going with fast-paced, witty lines that never let up. I enjoyed every piece of their dialog exchanges. So we have the good plot, the great jokes. What more could this film contain?! It contains one of the key things an animation needs heart and soul. And Shrek has every bit of it. One sequence (with Hallelujah playing in the background) was one of the most heartbreaking sequences in animation history. But Shrek knows how to sort out the two. Shrek isn't a joke-filled mess, nor a heartbreaking sob-story, it's a perfect blend of them both, then some. Shrek isn't the best animation film ever, but it sure is one of the best! Those who look down on animation as kid's escapism, think again. Shrek knows how to satisfy all sorts of ages, and does a perfect job of doing so. Shrek IS the greatest fairy tale never told. 9\/10.

He gets a tip that an important businessman(played by Khan himself, so you know he's evil!) is smuggling heroin, and when he meets with him to try to find out, he is introduced to Jane(Presley), and they fall for each other so hard that they appear in every scene from all montages that have ever been in Hollywood films. He also has to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth. This is one of the best spoofs I've ever seen. It fits in all the clichés from the tough police officer investigative crime thrillers. The Zuckers know exactly what they're doing... varying the marvelously written and planned jokes and gags, at times having only a single element in a sequence be off(and thus everyone else react realistically, and the laws of physics behave as they should, other than this one thing) so that the contrast heightens the impact, and, in the midst of all of this, there's actually a plot, and we do care about the characters, we want to see the good guys win and the bad guys burn. Sure, we're laughing on account of the slapstick, silliness, clever lines and wordplay, still, we also want to see what happens next, how it progresses(even for it following the simple formula of the genre it's referencing). And somehow, even when it goes where we expect it to, we're immensely entertained by the trip there(which might surprise anyway, in some of the details). I mean, when Leslie, already having been established as being clumsy, is told that this fish in the tank is expensive and rare, and that that pen is priceless, and tolerant of everything but water, we know where the bit is headed. There is a little moderate to strong language and sexuality, as well as brief female nudity.

I don't know, perhaps I needed to be around at 1970 to fully understand its appeal and appreciate it, since it certainly was a popular movie at the time, that even had an even more successful TV-series following it up, only 2 years later.Thing that the movie is known and praised for, is its heavy anti-war message in it. Well, not a message really but it makes a statement by turning a war situation into something comical. Perhaps this was something that really spoke to people at the time because of America's involved with the Vietnam war. In that regard, this movie is perhaps being a bit too much a product of its time and has lost it relevance and impact.But that does not make a bad movie of course. What does make this movie quite bad is that it simply isn't very fun or funny to watch at all. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I chuckled just once. The rest of the movie mostly consists out of people talking over each other and behaving incredibly immature.This was another real problem I had with this movie; All of the characters behaved like a bunch of brats and really not one of them was being likable enough for me. This was perhaps the biggest reason why I just couldn't ever enjoy watching this movie. But really, another big problem of the movie for me was that it didn't even featured a main story in it. It made this movie come across as a real pointless one, that was never being good, interesting or funny enough. It just isn't going anywhere with any of it. Perhaps it was to show the whole pointlessness of war but this doesn't make the movie any more pleasant or good to follow. Maybe it would had also helped if the movie did actually showed some of its war but now I really never had the feeling as if the movie was taking place during a war situation.The cast-list sound interesting, with people such as Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall and Rene Auberjonois in it but most of them were still pretty big unknowns at the time and their roles also aren't all that big. The movie doesn't have one main character in it but it instead focuses on a whole bunch of them, for an equal amount of time. This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie.Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either.

Why? Because all of them include the most gripping and thrilling stories ever. And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm, this amazing book, which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down.Tom Cruise, still in his early days of glory, is an ideal Mitch McDeere, the young, ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a well-paid job of his dreams. Unfortunately, this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and risk-free. But, at the time, who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs?This is the moment when the fun starts. The fast-paced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini, Lambert & Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody, it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book - you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots (even though the movie is still relatively long). This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also, I didn't like what the did with the ending, it should have stayed as it was described in the book.On another topic, I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently - let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However, that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way (one of the best scenes in my opinion).Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie, I still highly recommend it for its ever-occurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back.

The titles rolls for at least five minutes without much to recommend them for and the film opens in much the same vein. Although there are some amusing moments and a bit of fantasy in the opening 20 or so minutes, it is slow and takes a while to get going.

This is a bit harsh perhaps &#x96; but I was thinking what children (not the most patient demographic) would be doing during this &#x96; in particular I was trying to think of any child I know who would be entranced by the Portobello Road song and dance number!It is still OK at this stage though and the good news is that it gets better with plenty of action, fun, invention and wit moving forward. The plotting is still a little bit hmm but it gets to where it is going thanks to the timely mini-invasion. The soccer match, the underwater musical number and of course the battle at the end are all great fun and I imagine children will enjoy them as much as I did (well, moreso probably). The old-fashioned feel is nice and I did like the sense of good clean family fun which the whole film had &#x96; although I'm not sure why the script calls for Paul to expressly refer to his knob so often; it is too deliberate and scripted to be merely something cynical modern ears pick up on. The pacing of the film is generally good as well but it is a little slower than it needed to be and I think being honest they could have had 15 minutes out of this without too much bother and it would have been a better film for it; not to say it is bad for the length, just that it doesn't always seem to need it.The cast are quite fun and all buy into the family tone. Lansbury in particular sells the role and works very well with Tomlinson in the adult roles. The children are a little annoying until you get used to them having the cockney turned up to 11 throughout; odd that neither of the boys ever did acting after this considering I liked them better than O'Callaghan's Carrie, who has less to do. Regardless they all work well and even when the animated sections turn up, the humans don't get lost in the fantasy but remain solid characters.Bedknobs and Broomsticks isn't brilliant but it is a solidly fun Disney family film.

You can tell everything is a puppet with little effort.One thing I really like is the music. It is fantastic. I have the Lucio Fulci collection on CD which includes this music and others. Although, with that being said; it doesn't fit well most of the time. It is like the music was randomly inserted in most scenes and you'll have epic music when nothing is happening.That brings me to the editing. The editing is horrible. None of the scenes flow into each other smoothly. The shots do, but not the scenes. It is like he arranged the scenes in a careful manner and then just glued them together as is without any thought of their smoothness. Also, I think at the end where they end up in the basement of the hotel from the hospital was either because they lost footage, which happens in Fulci movies (CotLD's ending) or he couldn't think of a way of getting them back there. Nothing reality-warping really happened anywhere else in the movie.The zombies were pretty lame. They were slower than any other zombies I've seen in the past and to such a degree that they couldn't be a threat to anyone with how they were arranged. You could just run right by them and out the door to safety. Also, the guy, even when inches away and in no threat kept shooting them in the body instead of the head.

It will go instantly from silence to high action, then back to silence, and it won't be in any rush to scare you again. But unlike Paranormal Activity, which was high tension, low payoff, this one won't disappoint you when the scare comes. There are some great high-tension moments, some screamer moments, and some parts that are just truly creepy. It has a little of everything in the scare department.But, this IS a b-movie. So yes.

It had also been about fifteen years since I has saw this film when I sat to watch it on a typically wet and grey Bank Holiday Monday, and I did wonder if my memory of it being good were perhaps faded and optimistic. The film wastes no time in showing the viewer that it came to play, opening with a tremendous piece of stunt work (the dam jump) and following with a dramatic opening sequence full of bravado and spectacle which is only slightly marred by the rather obvious model work employed.The rest of the film cannot quite reach the impact of this opening sequence but it does try hard. Coming in at pretty much two hours (as opposed to the longer running times of recent Bonds), the film has a lot of pace to the telling and it seems there are action set-pieces and plot twists on a regular basis. The plot is enjoyable with decent villains and the typical excess that one expects from the franchise and it is done with a certain amount of humour without detracting from the action. Unfortunately this isn't always true and Martin Campbell doesn't always make the most of the sequences as the camera at times feels a little flat, like ti doesn't want to help the stunt-work with editing so much as it is happy just to watch the stunts; a decent approach but not one that always works. Likewise some of the incidental music is frankly terrible &#x96; distracting from the scene where it should have been adding to the atmosphere.While this is a problem you cannot fault the film for the set-pieces it delivers; the opening sequence is great but for me the most fun part is the tank chase, complete with typical Bond humour (straightening his tie with great comic timing). OK the use of models holds it back from really competing with the biggest Hollywood blockbusters, and the camera could have helped some of the action (at times it does feel a little like The A-Team, in that bullets always hit the ground behind characters) but it is more than satisfying. The cast is roundly good. Brosnan was in his first turn as Bond here and he mostly gets the mix of action and humour just right for the films &#x96; he has good time and seems smooth even if at times the material leaves him with nowhere to go (there are dark references but no path for him). Bean is a good villain despite the feeling of him working hard to maintain his crisp accent. Scorupco is a decent Bond girl but Janssen sticks in the mind most for her performance mixing sexual thrills with violence. Cumming is amusing while Dench gives a good account of herself and Llewelyn is funny in his sequence (although I'd rather he had not enjoyed it quite as much as he did, his final line about the sandwich is brilliantly timed).Overall Goldeneye is an enjoyable Bond movie that does well to capture the formula well with its cheeky humour, enjoyable set-pieces and typical world-threatening plot.

The plot is enjoyable with decent villains and the typical excess that one expects from the franchise and it is done with a certain amount of humour without detracting from the action. Unfortunately this isn't always true and Martin Campbell doesn't always make the most of the sequences as the camera at times feels a little flat, like ti doesn't want to help the stunt-work with editing so much as it is happy just to watch the stunts; a decent approach but not one that always works. Likewise some of the incidental music is frankly terrible &#x96; distracting from the scene where it should have been adding to the atmosphere.While this is a problem you cannot fault the film for the set-pieces it delivers; the opening sequence is great but for me the most fun part is the tank chase, complete with typical Bond humour (straightening his tie with great comic timing). OK the use of models holds it back from really competing with the biggest Hollywood blockbusters, and the camera could have helped some of the action (at times it does feel a little like The A-Team, in that bullets always hit the ground behind characters) but it is more than satisfying. The cast is roundly good. Brosnan was in his first turn as Bond here and he mostly gets the mix of action and humour just right for the films &#x96; he has good time and seems smooth even if at times the material leaves him with nowhere to go (there are dark references but no path for him). Bean is a good villain despite the feeling of him working hard to maintain his crisp accent. Scorupco is a decent Bond girl but Janssen sticks in the mind most for her performance mixing sexual thrills with violence. Cumming is amusing while Dench gives a good account of herself and Llewelyn is funny in his sequence (although I'd rather he had not enjoyed it quite as much as he did, his final line about the sandwich is brilliantly timed).Overall Goldeneye is an enjoyable Bond movie that does well to capture the formula well with its cheeky humour, enjoyable set-pieces and typical world-threatening plot. Some of the model work dates it a bit, while Campbell's safe hands direction perhaps doesn't help the action as much as he could have, but it still works and was good enough to bring the franchise back to life.

As we began watching this action-packed musical, we were a little confused at first. I love the plot, which is loosely based on the true story of the Biddle family of Philadelphia. I loved the fact that the story is about a Christian man who is rich and even eccentric! Played by Fred MacMurray, one of my favorites, he showcases a great singing talent. Leslie Anne Warren made her debut in this film and also shows her dancing, singing talent, as well as acting (and looks beautiful in her costumes). The scenery caught my eye, but at first, I thought there was too much singing and dancing. I think Robert Sherman, who wrote the beautiful songs for Mary Poppins could have composed some better, more catchy tunes. (Although Detroit had been on my mind a long time after the movie). Tommy Steele is absolutely adorable. (I loved when he was speaking to the camera and Fred MacMurray, Mr. Biddle, asks, Who are you talking to? Hilarious.John Davidson also looks great and showcases his singing, dancing and acting talents in his debut performance.

I think this was a great film, but the songs, again, could have been better--to keep viewers better engaged. (Maybe not so many songs, also).

He had delivered at least one action movie per year since Terminator. Eraser had an awesome trailer, to the tune of Enigma's wonderful I Love You, I'll Kill You, that rocked my world in the summer of 1996. I saw virtually every blockbuster that year, and the Eraser trailer was attached to every one of them. It came out out in the UK in the very last week of summer (and my first week back at school). I saw it at the now demolished UCI cinema in Edinburgh with a sold-out audience, mostly filled with guys out for a lad's night. The movie was rated 18, and even though I was 3 years below that mark, I still got in, which was fortunate since the cinema version is the only uncut version of the film that has ever been released in the UK. For its VHS and DVD release the mad BBFC saw fit to cut 4 minutes from Eraser, turning it into an incomprehensible mess. It capped-off an awesome summer season (or so my 15-year-old self thought), and put to rest any fears that Big Arn was slowing down (although he has only made 5 action movies, to date, since then).Arn is John Kruger (an amusing choice of name since director Chuck Russell also made the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street Movie), a Witness Protection Program Agent who is tasked with 'erasing' and protecting a high-level informant who can prove that there are traitors within the US government who are selling weapons to Russian terrorists. Naturally the informant is the lovely, and wide-eyed, Vanessa Williams, who involves herself in a subdued romantic subplot with Kruger. James Caan and the always great James Coburn provide respectable support as Kruger's antagonist and mentor, but the best support is no doubt Robert Pastorelli (an actor who I really liked who died of a heroin overdose in 2004), who plays a previous witness who is eager to please Kruger in his latest, impossible quest.Overall, it's hardly revolutionary, but what makes Eraser stand out from the crowd is the utterly breathtaking (literally) scene in which Kruger escapes a jet, mid-flight, without the comfort of a parachute on his shoulders. It's definitely one of the best action scenes in the last 20 years and, let me tell you, when that scene climaxed in the cinema, the packed audience of 'lads' totally sucked the air out of the auditorium. A massively exciting, and completely exhilarating, scene that never fails to get your heart racing.Alan Silvestri's score is one of the film's more underrated features. Silvestri scored Big Arn's Predator, a famous score in its own right, and while Eraser is not as famous as Predator you should not rule out the integrity of the score. When separated from the movie it is still one of Silvestri's best efforts.I guess the only complaint I could have about Eraser is that it's kinda anti-climatic. The best scene occurs at the end of the second act, leaving the final act pale in comparison. There's no iconic imagery to the film and it seems kinda forgettable when compared to other Arn characters who have endured the test of time. Nonetheless, it's at the top of the bottom of Arn's best movies, but make sure you the version you watch has not been butchered by the BBFC.The Blu Ray is in 2.401 1080p with Dolby TrueHD sound.

In the recent failure The Bounty Hunter, Gerald and Jennifer do the latter i.e. we see the pair traveling around the country and slowly realizing that they are in love, however, the chemistry there is rather implied than created. While Hugh and Meg handle their characters well enough to blending with the story and gradually getting intimate, and there is not third person to tell us that they are in love (like that stupid old couple in Bounty Hunter), but we feel that intimacy between them.Story wise, Rogers and Mangold circumscribe themselves to a fairy-tale like romantic-comedy that has tremendous potential to be something more. The improbabilities of time-travel aside, we still are left with characters that could have created a universe analogous to an epic Titanic, but instead produce a good chick flick. If going through a time portal is that easy, then the present would have progressed by light years. Just jump off the bridge, get back in time and show the past what can be done in future. Also, the fairytale seems too good to be true, what if Kate was a mental patient who dreamed of finding a suitable man after a failed romance with Stuart, something sinister like Mangold's previous venture Girl, Interrupted? After all, her speech, especially after realizing Leopold's true identity seems somewhat icky and delusional. Then again, we find ourselves glad for Kate and Leopold and are satisfied by the story's linear approach. Maybe if Hugh had given more characterization to Leopold, instead of seeming like a storybook prince, then the movie would have been a shade better. But his act is sincere and believable enough for the movie; Ryan is equally likable, though she does not have much chemistry with the supporting cast as she does with Hugh. Her wry humor helps though. Liev is funny too, maybe too buffoonish and farcical at times while Meyer lends great support throughout. Do not watch Kate and Leopold expecting it to be representative of something vital about society (there are scenes where Leopold seems puzzled at the changing attitudes of women, work and most importantly tastes, though). It entertains more than it inspires, and I don't mind a good entertainment!My Rating 6.8 out of 10 ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"7 May 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Who do a warrior people war with when all the wars are vanquished?

Top billed Bob Hoskins, in particular, in his Best Actor Academy Award nominated performance, is the person we follow through a convincing depiction of the seamy underbelly of London, a land populated by pimps, prostitutes, and mobsters such as the nasty Mortwell, played by Michael Caine. Hoskins's George is a low level mob member getting out of prison after spending seven years there, emerging into a world unfamiliar to him. He's given the initially thankless task of acting as chauffeur for high class prostitute Simone, played by the lovely and amazing Cathy Tyson. But before very long, they start warming up to each other, and the balance of the movie charts their evolving relationship. Ultimately George decides to do Cathy a favour by finding a long lost acquaintance of hers, but this leads to less than ideal circumstances for all involved. Director Neil Jordan, who co-wrote the screenplay with David Leland, has created a compelling if deliberately paced drama that's much more character driven than action oriented, although there are some brief bursts of violence here and there. The film also has quite the sense of humour at times, much of it coming from the engaging Robbie Coltrane as George's good friend Thomas. Thomas likes to create art using plastic spaghetti (!), and there is a nice light touch brought to all scenes with Hoskins and Coltrane, which prevents this story from ever being too much of a downer, although for the most part Mona Lisa is grim and gritty stuff, with fairy tale and film noir elements emphasized. By the end, George realizes how much he's been manipulated by his femme fatale Simone. Jordan completely pulls us into this vivid environment, and gets nice supporting performances from Kate Hardie as Cathy, Zoe Nathenson as Jeannie, and Sammi Davis as May, as well as a sufficiently slimy portrayal by Clarke Peters ('The Wire') as vicious pimp Anderson.

Lee takes over the directing reigns from James Whale for this entertaining entry in the Universal series. Basil Rathbone is great fun in the title role, Baron Wolf von Frankenstein, who comes to claim his inheritance upon the passing of his father, and in no time flat causes no end of problems trying to clear the family name. He finds that the Monster (Boris Karloff, in his final performance in the part) is still alive but not doing well, and that the evil Ygor (Bela Lugosi, in one of his best ever performances), an evil body snatcher who managed to survive a hanging and a resulting broken neck, has a powerful hold on the Monster, and that it is doing Ygor's bidding, all in the name of vengeance. Son of Frankenstein is notable for a number of things. To start with, it has good atmosphere as so many Universal horror films of the '30s and '40s did, but it takes place in a more modern setting, with Lee taking away some of the Gothic trappings of their other productions. We do still see wonderful lab sets, a foul looking sulphur pit which we know will have to be paid off at some point, and the standard issue angry villagers, although by this point the set up is familiar and rather formulaic. We know without a doubt that Wolf is going to be intrigued with his father's work, too intrigued for his own good, and that he will spend too much time trying to rehabilitate the Monster rather than just finding a way to end its suffering and saving everybody a whole lot of trouble. What makes Son of Frankenstein something worth savouring are the ingenious characters of Ygor, whom Lugosi plays to the hilt, and the tough, stolid Inspector Krogh, a one-armed policeman portrayed with conviction by the always delightful Lionel Atwill; fans automatically recognize that this is the character that inspired Kenneth Mars's Inspector Kemp in Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein. A decent supporting cast also helps, including Josephine Hutchinson as Wolfs' lovely wife Elsa, and old pros like Lionel Belmore and Michael Mark. Unfortunately, the Monster just doesn't get to do too much this time around, as the accent is largely placed on both Wolf and Ygor. But it's still a treat to see Karloff in the role, and the interplay between Rathbone and Atwill is great, as we see Krogh constantly regarding Wolf with some suspicion even though he has sworn to protect him from the presumptuous villagers, and as Wolf, racked by guilt, starts acting in an antagonistic manner toward the Inspector. Clocking in at 100 minutes, pretty long for a genre film during this period, when they usually came in under 80 minutes, the story is pretty involved, and enjoyable enough that the time goes by quickly enough.
