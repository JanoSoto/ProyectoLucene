I think, in many ways, this is a better film then the Sixth Sense, if only because its story is not so transparently constructed to provide a payoff.

Granted, Unbreakable must be taken with a grain of salt it's a comic-book fantasy, and its real-life trappings have confused some viewers as to that fact. The point is not that Shyamalan means Unbreakable to be realistic he just observes the action realistically to set the comic book elements in an interesting new context. Everything about the movie has been constructed to echo the plotting and character development of an origins issue of a comic book, and on that count, the film is a total success.     Bruce Willis has become a great and self-effacing actor as of late, and that's not a misprint. I felt he was robbed of an Oscar nomination for the Sixth Sense -- if only because his performance was more central to that film's mystery than Osment's -- and I might nominate him again this year if given the choice. He's an interesting choice for the heroo, but ultimately he's the right one he's low-key but not at all wimpy or ineffectual. And Samuel L. Jackson is excellent in support this is an unusually low-pitched performance for him, but he makes it work. Their rapport is phenomenal, and it drives the film.  There have been complaints about the plausbility of the action scenes, and about the slowness of the pacing. I find that Unbreakable moves slowly, but that it's a build, and not a drag. I found the major action sequence at the end of the film terrifying and beautifully controlled it expertly pressed the audience's buttons without smacking them over the head. Yes, some of the details are muddled, but in the best anything-can-be-explained-away comic book tradition.

About the only point that EVERYONE can agree on is that this is a great-looking and sounding film everyone somewhat pithily recognizes Shyamalan is a technically proficient filmmaker.  He has a command of the camera that is thrilling, and the editing rhythms are just beautiful. There's no need to hold this against him he's young, he's successful, and he's definitely talented.

I was driving to wherever, and I began to wonder how Hanks was going to get rescued.  It would probably be by a plane going overhead or he was going to make an attempt to sail off the island in some crude contraption of a boat and then be rescued by some ocean tanker that transports cars from Tokyo to Nova Scotia.  I then began to think of what expression I would have if I was the extra in the film that had the thankless non speaking role of the guy that sees Hanks first.  Would my eyes bulge from their forehead?  Would I look like I had just seen a ghost?  Would I just stare in awe as the tiny boat floated by and was dwarfed by the tanker that I was on?  Would I be smoking a cigarette and it would just stick to my bottom lip as my mouth became agape?  These are all tough choices to make for an extra with such a vital role in the film.  Which one of these reactions actually happened in the film?  Well if you have seen the film, you know exactly what happened and if you haven't then you'll just have to read a little further to find out.  But just saffice it to say that it is issues like this one that made the film a 7 for me and not the 9.5 that it should have been.  And that is a shame.Cast Away is a very good film, it's just that it could have been one of the best if only they would have put a little more care into it.  Even though the film is a good 2 and half hours, it deserved to be three.  When you go to great pains to have a story of this magnitude then why can you not close the deal and make the last act just as good as the middle one? What is good about the film is the first act and what is even better is the second one.  We are introduced to Hanks as a guy that lives and dies by his watch.  He is always timing everything and he is so busy that he has to schedule in his girlfriend for New Year's.  It is a promise, he guarantees her that he will be home for this festive time of year.  So far Hanks's character, while a little intricate and obsessive, seems like many of us.  We all live by the clock in one way or another.  It's just that he is a little more serious about it.  But in these times that we live in, we are all bound by deadlines, we are all aware of the time and we are all a little obsessive about our jobs at one time or another.  So again, we can relate to his character quite well.  Of course that all changes when the plane that he is on crashes in the middle of the ocean somewhere.  Hanks uses a raft to drift for days and he comes up on a deserted, almost uncharted island in the middle of nowhere.  It is here that the strength of the film is presented.  And this is the most amazing thing about the film.  We are not only entertained with Hanks on an island by himself, but we want more.  We are captivated.  At least I was.  The film moves slowly at times when he is here but it also captures the feeling of isolation, loneliness, despair, hope and a plethora of other feelings in between.  Hanks does an incredible job of conveying these emotions inspite of the fact that he is the only thing on screen.  He has no one to talk to so he finds an inanimate object and gives it life.  It's name is Wilson, a volleyball that has washed up on shore that Hanks breathes life into.  Wilson becomes a great character and when it is in danger at times, it frightened me and saddened me that it was.  I have not experienced an array of emotions the way I did when he was on the island.  And as much as I wanted to see Hanks get off the island, I was completely engulfed in his time there.  When he eventually did get off, I craved for him to be back on that tiny island, with Wilson, his coconuts, his caves, his fire and all else that was there.  Up until his rescue ( and you knew that was inevitable, from the trailers ), this was easily one of the five best films of the year.  But what it did once he got rescued was very weak and very poor.  There was so much more that they could have done.  There never was that reaction shot of the guy on the ocean liner that first sees him.  There was never really any reaction to him getting rescued.  It just happened.  I wanted to see everyone's faces and expressions when this man that has been lost for 4 years come home.  But not once did we get that.  And that is what I meant when I said that this films should have been 3 hours long, hell it could have been 3 and a half, that would have given us closure and maybe a little more honesty.  As it stands, it is a good film, but with the combined talents of Zemekis and Hanks, it could have been so much more.  And that makes it disappointing.7 out of 10- Still a good film and a fantastic journey, but it lacked once he got off the island.  However, Hanks should be nominated for best actor and if he wins, there should be no complaints.  It is an incredible performance.  This film is worth seeing but it also worth noting that there are quite a few better films out there so far this year.

He is always timing everything and he is so busy that he has to schedule in his girlfriend for New Year's.  It is a promise, he guarantees her that he will be home for this festive time of year.  So far Hanks's character, while a little intricate and obsessive, seems like many of us.  We all live by the clock in one way or another.  It's just that he is a little more serious about it.  But in these times that we live in, we are all bound by deadlines, we are all aware of the time and we are all a little obsessive about our jobs at one time or another.  So again, we can relate to his character quite well.  Of course that all changes when the plane that he is on crashes in the middle of the ocean somewhere.  Hanks uses a raft to drift for days and he comes up on a deserted, almost uncharted island in the middle of nowhere.  It is here that the strength of the film is presented.  And this is the most amazing thing about the film.  We are not only entertained with Hanks on an island by himself, but we want more.  We are captivated.  At least I was.  The film moves slowly at times when he is here but it also captures the feeling of isolation, loneliness, despair, hope and a plethora of other feelings in between.  Hanks does an incredible job of conveying these emotions inspite of the fact that he is the only thing on screen.  He has no one to talk to so he finds an inanimate object and gives it life.  It's name is Wilson, a volleyball that has washed up on shore that Hanks breathes life into.  Wilson becomes a great character and when it is in danger at times, it frightened me and saddened me that it was.  I have not experienced an array of emotions the way I did when he was on the island.  And as much as I wanted to see Hanks get off the island, I was completely engulfed in his time there.  When he eventually did get off, I craved for him to be back on that tiny island, with Wilson, his coconuts, his caves, his fire and all else that was there.  Up until his rescue ( and you knew that was inevitable, from the trailers ), this was easily one of the five best films of the year.  But what it did once he got rescued was very weak and very poor.  There was so much more that they could have done.  There never was that reaction shot of the guy on the ocean liner that first sees him.  There was never really any reaction to him getting rescued.  It just happened.  I wanted to see everyone's faces and expressions when this man that has been lost for 4 years come home.  But not once did we get that.  And that is what I meant when I said that this films should have been 3 hours long, hell it could have been 3 and a half, that would have given us closure and maybe a little more honesty.  As it stands, it is a good film, but with the combined talents of Zemekis and Hanks, it could have been so much more.  And that makes it disappointing.7 out of 10- Still a good film and a fantastic journey, but it lacked once he got off the island.  However, Hanks should be nominated for best actor and if he wins, there should be no complaints.  It is an incredible performance.  This film is worth seeing but it also worth noting that there are quite a few better films out there so far this year.

I was driving to wherever, and I began to wonder how Hanks was going to get rescued.  It would probably be by a plane going overhead or he was going to make an attempt to sail off the island in some crude contraption of a boat and then be rescued by some ocean tanker that transports cars from Tokyo to Nova Scotia.  I then began to think of what expression I would have if I was the extra in the film that had the thankless non speaking role of the guy that sees Hanks first.  Would my eyes bulge from their forehead?  Would I look like I had just seen a ghost?  Would I just stare in awe as the tiny boat floated by and was dwarfed by the tanker that I was on?  Would I be smoking a cigarette and it would just stick to my bottom lip as my mouth became agape?  These are all tough choices to make for an extra with such a vital role in the film.  Which one of these reactions actually happened in the film?  Well if you have seen the film, you know exactly what happened and if you haven't then you'll just have to read a little further to find out.  But just saffice it to say that it is issues like this one that made the film a 7 for me and not the 9.5 that it should have been.  And that is a shame.Cast Away is a very good film, it's just that it could have been one of the best if only they would have put a little more care into it.  Even though the film is a good 2 and half hours, it deserved to be three.

I did not find the stories in depth at all. In fact, I thought the movie lacked any cohesive plot, despite telling several different stories at the same time. This, I think, is where the movie fails. SPOILERS The individual plots are shallow, and where they are not shallow, they are unbelievable. I am surprised that anyone was really taken by the Catherine Zeta-Jones plot line. A young mother, who knows nothing about her husband's business, doesn't use drugs and seems righteous, careful and law abiding, ends up becoming an international drug dealer to save her husband. She has people assassinated using car bombs and handguns, she transports drugs across the Mexican border herself (drugs formed into the shape of little dolls). She manages to get the car bomb placed on a car outside a courthouse where the leading witness is testifying and there IS NO SECURITY. It's laughable. How naive is this movie? They have the witness holed up in a secluded hotel, protected by several DEA agents, and yet when they approach the courthouse they take no precautions whatsoever? It's ludicrous.Another plot line is the drug addict daughter of the leading man in the government's war on drugs. At no point is it explained why the girl is on drugs or what she is going through, the true effects of addiction. I believe at one point she states that she is bored. I sympathize. There is even a scene where she is completely out of her head and having sex with a local drug dealer. She can barely see when she finds a needle in his stash. We are supposed to be shocked that she's about to move on to the hard stuff. The question is if these are the hard drugs, what was she doing to get her to sleep with a drug dealer in a dangerous neighborhood in the first place? There is no impact in that scene at all as she's already doing outrageous things for drugs. Bad movie making, sorry. If we were supposed to feel shocked at seeing her lying helpless beneath this dealer, it didn't work. I have never felt so detached from such an integral scene to a movie. It was completely emotionless. To cap this plot thread off, Douglas has a speech to accept his position as Drug Tzar. He stutters, falters, and eventually says he can't do it (after what he's been through with his daughter). Anyone who did not see this scene coming from the first scene of the movie must be blind. It was all so damned predictable.Thing is, it's very well acted. Apart from the expected good performances, Catherine Zeta-Jones puts in the best film performance of her life (that I've seen). Michael Douglas is strong as always, and Del Toro brings life to a very dull and minimal script. The camera is used well, so are filters but none of this style can cover the simple lack of substance. The film is empty, and is more a study in the director's panache than than it is a piece of entertainment. The movie needed solid, simple structure, not steady cams clever sound design. It's a mess.I have a feeling that this one will not be remembered. Despite the good reviews it is receiving, a second look at the movie will reveal all the glaring omissions and plot breakers, not to mention the lack of originality (if you're bored watching this movie, try to spot all the stolen moments from other Movies like the French Connection etc). Two and a half hours of shaking the camera and adding blue filters does not a movie make. ","genre":null},{"date":"8 January 2001","score":"","review":"  Well, I didn't like this movie at all.

However, there is much more to see than Joaquin Phoenix's bare chest or the endowments of Geoffrey Rush and Kate Winslet. Witty quips keep us laughing through all but the most horrifying of moments, while ironic twists and deep themes give much to think about after the movie is long over. Quills is a true work of art, well crafted in both prose and performance.Within the walls of Charenton, a French asylum for the insane, the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) is locked away in a prison of luxury. The Abbe de Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), a very positive reflection on the loving nature of his God, seeks to treat the Marquis through the therapy of writing. Madeleine (Kate Winslet), the beautiful and pure laundry maid, is the woman that they both care for, each in his own extreme way. Into this precarious, but comfortable triangle, arrives the tyrannical Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine). Sent by the self-described despot, Napoleon, to calm the Marquis' exciting, yet embarrassing quill, the doctor is versed in such modern medical techniques as leeches, the iron maiden, and a calming chair which is used to repeated dunk and almost drown patients.Soon we are asking ourselves who the true sadist is here- the man who writes of prostitution, necrophilia and murder, or the man who forces himself upon a woman half his age, keeping her caged as a gilded bird? -the man who welds restraints and floggers via the hands of others or the one who shares it all with the world via his pen? And is the one who imposes such floggers and restraint upon himself a masochist, or simply a man true to his beliefs?It is interesting that a movie based on the man after whom sadism was named -- a sexual orientation that in actual practice is often concerned with the consensual disciplining of another -- reflects so much on the subject of disciplining oneself. We are shown the extremes of this - the facade of outer discipline in the Doctor, and the way he tries to impose it on others, - the maddening work of inner discipline on the Abbot, and- the desire to slip beyond discipline of the Marquis. The effect of each is shown on psyche of the man who lives it. All the while, Madeleine retains a reflection of simple, straightforward, acceptance of oneself, reminding us that Some things belong on paper, others in life. It's a blessed fool who can't tell the difference.As the Marquis literally uses a mirror to create words, his words seek to mirror life. His real sin a deep-seated *need* to open to the light of day the darkness that lies deep within the soul of man. He has the power, strength and insight of a man who knows his own madness, something that the Abbe later comes to understand all too well. Again and again, we see the theme of a man driven mad by the truth that burns within his soul, for whom writing is his only redemption. The questions of whether art can be used as therapy and whether such productions can be blamed as something so evil that it incites others to immoral acts is central to the movie. But the biggest question of all is who has the right to judge the artistic expressions of another, what drives those who would set themselves up to do this, and what hatred and immorality is stirred up when we start doing so. As a last note, I should point out that this movie is not necessarily true to historical accounts of the Marquis' life, especially in the manner of his death and in the nature of his relationship with Madeleine. Based on the out-of-print play by Doug Wright, I feel like much like The Crucible, this piece is meant to be more of a statement on the insanity that is created by the judgements of society, than it is to be a historically accurate treatise. I also believe that historical accounts of any person or event are only one viewpoint that has been filtered and changed through time, and therefore it does no harm to to entertain alternative interpretations and possibilities.

","genre":"Biography, Drama"},{"date":"8 January 2001","score":"","review":"  Yes, there is nudity, sex and perversion here -- just as with most modern blockbuster movies! However, there is much more to see than Joaquin Phoenix's bare chest or the endowments of Geoffrey Rush and Kate Winslet. Witty quips keep us laughing through all but the most horrifying of moments, while ironic twists and deep themes give much to think about after the movie is long over. Quills is a true work of art, well crafted in both prose and performance.Within the walls of Charenton, a French asylum for the insane, the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) is locked away in a prison of luxury. The Abbe de Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), a very positive reflection on the loving nature of his God, seeks to treat the Marquis through the therapy of writing. Madeleine (Kate Winslet), the beautiful and pure laundry maid, is the woman that they both care for, each in his own extreme way. Into this precarious, but comfortable triangle, arrives the tyrannical Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine). Sent by the self-described despot, Napoleon, to calm the Marquis' exciting, yet embarrassing quill, the doctor is versed in such modern medical techniques as leeches, the iron maiden, and a calming chair which is used to repeated dunk and almost drown patients.Soon we are asking ourselves who the true sadist is here- the man who writes of prostitution, necrophilia and murder, or the man who forces himself upon a woman half his age, keeping her caged as a gilded bird? -the man who welds restraints and floggers via the hands of others or the one who shares it all with the world via his pen? And is the one who imposes such floggers and restraint upon himself a masochist, or simply a man true to his beliefs?It is interesting that a movie based on the man after whom sadism was named -- a sexual orientation that in actual practice is often concerned with the consensual disciplining of another -- reflects so much on the subject of disciplining oneself. We are shown the extremes of this - the facade of outer discipline in the Doctor, and the way he tries to impose it on others, - the maddening work of inner discipline on the Abbot, and- the desire to slip beyond discipline of the Marquis. The effect of each is shown on psyche of the man who lives it. All the while, Madeleine retains a reflection of simple, straightforward, acceptance of oneself, reminding us that Some things belong on paper, others in life. It's a blessed fool who can't tell the difference.As the Marquis literally uses a mirror to create words, his words seek to mirror life. His real sin a deep-seated *need* to open to the light of day the darkness that lies deep within the soul of man. He has the power, strength and insight of a man who knows his own madness, something that the Abbe later comes to understand all too well. Again and again, we see the theme of a man driven mad by the truth that burns within his soul, for whom writing is his only redemption. The questions of whether art can be used as therapy and whether such productions can be blamed as something so evil that it incites others to immoral acts is central to the movie. But the biggest question of all is who has the right to judge the artistic expressions of another, what drives those who would set themselves up to do this, and what hatred and immorality is stirred up when we start doing so. As a last note, I should point out that this movie is not necessarily true to historical accounts of the Marquis' life, especially in the manner of his death and in the nature of his relationship with Madeleine.

The critics are all awed at the powerful performance of Benicio Del Toro. Steven Soderbergh is praised for his second great film of 2000. Either Moore or Gaghan has garnered a screenplay nomination.The fact is, this movie doesn't deserve that much credit. Yes, all of the actors... ALL of them, and there are many, many, many of them due to the three convergent story lines... did a fantastic job with portraying their characters. But the script leaves little time for any of them to truly develop the characters. A perfect example of this is Zeta-Jones. Her character begins as a naive housewife to a drug lord. She is disgusted to even see her husband in court. Then, without much on-screen metamorphosis, she hires an assassin to target the lead witness against her husband. That's pretty far from naive.Del Toro's Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez is more of the same. From what I have read about the film, he is supposed to be on a one man mission to stop drug smuggling, and willing to go to extreme measures to see this done though never crossing lines. Well, the critics must have been given a Cliff's Notes of the film to peruse during their viewing, because Del Toro's character is never portrayed that clearly on film. We know through two or three lines of dialogue that he wants the kids to be able to play baseball and have the parks back. We know that he fraternizes with the enemy, but his motives there are very, very hazy, especially when he explains to US DEA agents that he feels like he has sold out by helping them. In the end we see him watching a baseball game, as if to say he's a good guy?

But there is way too much going on for what was approximately two hours and twenty minutes of cinema. The scary thing is, it's not even an editing problem, I dare say there's nothing that could have been removed. But so much more could have been added. It would have saved us the jumpy three minute segments that dominate the first forty-five minutes of the film. It would have let the exemplary cast really delve into their characters. It would have allowed the story to really hit home in a way that wasn't quite possible in this version, lest you live in an American border town, I suppose.For those of you wondering, I scored the film a seven out of ten. It's supremely acted, well directed (despite the sometimes obnoxious filtering used in all Mexico scenes), and well, if under, written. But as a moviegoer, sitting through this, I had plenty of optimism that things would continue to get better and the film would grow into the triumph that had already been proclaimed by critics nationwide.

To tell the God's honest truth, I can't entirely tell why.  It's not poorly produced or directed or acted.  In fact, it's rather well made as a film.  The acting is quite good from such a stellar cast.  The symbolism and nuance and shading is quite deep.No, I hate this movie because of the message, if it has one, that it conveys, what the writer was trying to say, the way it portrayed people, what this movie means and why Hollywood likes this film.Basically, this film is a quite frank, and I would say somewhat fearful, message from Hollywood about what it thinks about people and what they ought to be.  Hollywood hates suburbia, normalcy, families, convential sexuality, the people who were popular in high school, the military, etc., etc., etc. So, their response, lets show them for what they really are.  Let's say that they're all repressed and degenerate and we are the normal, good, healthy people.  Of course, none of this is reality.  Hollywood is, especially at the creative level, populated by the quiet artsy kids who spent too much time alone in high school and came to Tinseltown as refugees so need to fire a backshot here.  This was this movie's inside joke to it's own, See, those people out there in Middle America aren't so normal and happy.  They are shallow, lonely, screwed up, full of hate and angst, etc. They should ditch the kids, move out here, get a pair of leather pants and a big bag of pills and do what will make them 'happy'.  This message is pretty thickly laid on from the get-go, and it reeks of agenda, of having been written by someone filled with fear and urgency about communicating this message.  This is why the movie got the Oscar, Hollywood got the joke, got the message, and appreciated it, appreciated deluding themselves into believing that maybe they really aren't so out of touch and that everyone out there on the other side of the screen is also trapped in adolescence and hedonism but since they're repressed about it, it's the people at night on Santa Monica Boulevard who are normal.  It was a major shot in the culture war here, and apparently Hollywood will never be disabused of it's own circular logic, since any dissent is simply dismissed as the surface level or living in the '50s and we are all required to look closer at what Hollywood thinks.I'm reminded of what Oscar Levant said about Hollywood Beneath the phony tinsel of Hollywood lies the real tinsel.Some spoilers below.Watching this film, yes, I can pick out everything I don't like.  But, just in the general sense, I get a nagging nauseousness and uneasiness watching this.  It's just something in the film, something about degeneracy and irresponsibility at every turn.  I really wonder how anyone could actually contrive some picture of life where no one is mentally above the age of 13. The writer obviously wasn't.  No one in this film seems to be able to think more than 5 seconds down the road, look deeply within themselves or do the work with themselves or do much more than react, rather than act to their circumstances.  And the characters, all, without fail, were at best one-dimensional.  They were nothing more than cardboard cut-outs, archetypes from what someone thought they were supposed to be.  We have the not-happy, burned-out dad in the middle of a midlife crisis who snaps and just wants to do his own thing, the mom obsessed with the nice house and finding her own inner strength (I had to grow up in a duplex!), the normal daughter caught in the middle, the flirty, sex-obssessed cheerleader tart who, big surprise, is still a virgin despite all her bluster, the creepy, film-student kid who can't see ugliness anywhere, the big, tough, I-hate-homos-but-secretly-am-one (another big shocker), Marine officer, and all the rest.  In a general sense, I didn't like, on a personal level, anyone in this film, couldn't identify or understand a one of them.  It hit me when I realized that there isn't one character in this film, if they were a real person, that I would want to know.No real creative thought or originality was put into these characters. They were, in the most basic and dry sense of the word, placed there simply to send a message, used as vehicles for an agenda, and not as characters in and of themselves.  The flirty cheerleader and the colonel are my favorite. The girl is unoriginal as hell, the joke told in every neighborhood.  And the colonel, is both an inside joke for homosexuals and liberals and serves to send the we hate the military and masculinity message from Hollywood. Also, note that the two homosexual couples shown in the neighborhood seem to be the only normal, well-adjusted people in the film (although they're only shown for a few minutes each).I almost wondered about this film in the way people talk about Hollywood and it's liberal Bolshevik agenda.  But, in that sense, this film was a failure in the sense that it was clumsily executed.  This movie shows that the culture war has gotten to the point where Hollywood's bolshies are simply too far away from the people they are trying to propagandize to be effective, they can no longer craft something that can be understood and accepted by the population.  This isn't the sort of sneaky, tightly crafted, New Institute of Social Research Frankfurt School stalking-horse sort of thing that the media could do in the 30s to destroy Western culture.

This isn't culture.BTW, a little footnote, things can get funny in a cultural war when they start moving in both directions.  We don't totally notice this sort of sly, under-the-radar sort of maneuvering, but not everyone in the industry has become totally corrupt.  If you watch the Oscars, Mel Gibson, maybe Hollywood's best stealth conservative, was presenting the Best Screenplay Oscar, which went to this film.  When Alan Ball, the Broadway-veteran writer (which tells the whole story about him and why he wrote this film...) came up, note that ole Mel didn't shake his hand, want to get close to him, and seemed distinctly uncomfortable around him.

We have the not-happy, burned-out dad in the middle of a midlife crisis who snaps and just wants to do his own thing, the mom obsessed with the nice house and finding her own inner strength (I had to grow up in a duplex!), the normal daughter caught in the middle, the flirty, sex-obssessed cheerleader tart who, big surprise, is still a virgin despite all her bluster, the creepy, film-student kid who can't see ugliness anywhere, the big, tough, I-hate-homos-but-secretly-am-one (another big shocker), Marine officer, and all the rest.  In a general sense, I didn't like, on a personal level, anyone in this film, couldn't identify or understand a one of them.  It hit me when I realized that there isn't one character in this film, if they were a real person, that I would want to know.No real creative thought or originality was put into these characters. They were, in the most basic and dry sense of the word, placed there simply to send a message, used as vehicles for an agenda, and not as characters in and of themselves.  The flirty cheerleader and the colonel are my favorite. The girl is unoriginal as hell, the joke told in every neighborhood.  And the colonel, is both an inside joke for homosexuals and liberals and serves to send the we hate the military and masculinity message from Hollywood. Also, note that the two homosexual couples shown in the neighborhood seem to be the only normal, well-adjusted people in the film (although they're only shown for a few minutes each).I almost wondered about this film in the way people talk about Hollywood and it's liberal Bolshevik agenda.  But, in that sense, this film was a failure in the sense that it was clumsily executed.  This movie shows that the culture war has gotten to the point where Hollywood's bolshies are simply too far away from the people they are trying to propagandize to be effective, they can no longer craft something that can be understood and accepted by the population.  This isn't the sort of sneaky, tightly crafted, New Institute of Social Research Frankfurt School stalking-horse sort of thing that the media could do in the 30s to destroy Western culture.  This film paints in too-broad strokes and comes out too obvious and strong in its attempt, too far away from people at large and their lives, and so it misses the mark.  Hollywood got the joke with this film, so they gave it an Oscar, but Middle America wouldn't.That's why this got the Oscar, Hollywood reacted to a message it wanted to hear, wanted to be flattered by, and so goofed.  Like I said, it's a pretty clear shot in the culture war, how far they've degenerated away from anything American or normal.  This isn't culture.BTW, a little footnote, things can get funny in a cultural war when they start moving in both directions.  We don't totally notice this sort of sly, under-the-radar sort of maneuvering, but not everyone in the industry has become totally corrupt.  If you watch the Oscars, Mel Gibson, maybe Hollywood's best stealth conservative, was presenting the Best Screenplay Oscar, which went to this film.  When Alan Ball, the Broadway-veteran writer (which tells the whole story about him and why he wrote this film...) came up, note that ole Mel didn't shake his hand, want to get close to him, and seemed distinctly uncomfortable around him.  Surprise, surprise!  This from the producer and star of Braveheart and The Patriot.  Funny indeed!

I mean if they did, there never would be any monster movies like this, and we'd miss out on the fun. Which in DEEP BLUE SEA is not so much figuring out who's going to survive, as it is determining who's going to be next on the menu...It's always nice when you don't require the auspices of an MST3K to make a bad movie more fun to watch, and there is certainly no heckling required with a film this DEEP. Like its predecessor ANACONDA, it takes itself JUST seriously enough with the special effects, but lets you, the audience, have fun with the rest. Now if only Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich had been able to see this before they made that mess with the giant lizard...  ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"8 January 2001","score":"","review":"  (Contains potential Spoilers)Renny Harlin, he who had the audacity and outrageous creative impulse to cast one-time amour and missus in the over-the-top gem THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, only to see that film consigned to Guilty Pleasure Movie Hell for his pains, is back with a vengeance.His mission to prove that he can still make a decent action film that will pack 'em in. Not that he hasn't been able to do that before, but in La-La Land you're only as good as the box office take on your last picture...need I say more?It's only too bad that the script he's been given to work with is straight out of the DEEP RISING\/LEVIATHAN\/DEEPSTAR SIX school. So does the film world really need another JAWS-meets-ALIENS knockoff? Only if the director can obey the cardinal rule of monster-mash-moviemaking keep it movin'.Now THAT Renny can do.Thanks to CGI and other visual and mechanical advances which far surpass the eccentricities and hardships posed for Spielberg and Company by a faulty shark nicknamed Bruce about three decades ago, Harlin and HIS mates fare far better in the WOW! Department. How? By giving us lightning-quick, brutally realistic, omigod-graphic shark attack sequences so stunning, we won't have a chance to contemplate how in the hell a movie this enthralling got made, about scientists who are a lot dumber than the sharks who snack on them.In this tale of mutant sharks turned homosapien gormands, we first must accept that Saffron Burrows is a geneticist, (yeah, I'm SO sure), who has possibly found a cure to Alzheimer's via shark brain research she's engaged in with partner\/ex-hubby Stellan Skarsgard, aboard the deep sea research station AQUATICA. (And as you well know, dear moviegoer if ex-lovers or ex-marrieds in any action thriller are not the heroes, then they're potentially Hamburger Helper.)Well, since we have her for the guys to look at, gotta give the girls their due, too. And so we have Thomas Jane as the resident shark wrangler, who has the body of an International Male catalog model, the brass cojones of a fish-loving Evel Knievel, the machismo of a younger Clint Eastwood, and all the charisma of...well, Saffron Burrows. You'll find more sparks in a twenty-year old car battery than you will between these two, but maybe that's just as well, considering the circumstances...So what do we do for the rest of the shark cuisine...uh, I mean sparkling character development? Well, there's Samuel L. Jackson as the mega-rich entrepreneur whose millions are funding the research; LL Cool J as the research station's chef, (okay, so that takes care of SOME of the charisma problem), Michael Rapaport as the loveably-quirky-geeky-genius, (read you know he's toast already), and THE SOPRANOS' Aida Turturro as Brenda, the AQUATICA's den mother\/weather lookout, (read again she's toast, too.)

George Lucas' masterpiece started the ball rolling for such gems as Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Breakfast Club, and Dazed and Confsued.  In my opinion, those three movies in addition to American Graffiti are the best teenage movies ever made because, simply put, they are as REAL as it gets.  Even though my favorite movie of all time is Dazed and Confused, I am happy to honor American Graffiti as the king of the teenage movies.  Dazed and Confused borrowed a lot from American Graffiti and, in a way, it was kind of fitting.  American Graffiti was about a generation that was still innocent.  Dazed and Confused, 14 years later, pretty much shows the generation that came about after the assasination of President Kennedy and Vietnam.  Even though they are set in completely different times, both sets of teens still cruise their towns at night, hang out at the local gathering places, think about the future, and even show the next generation a good time Dazed and Confused did it with the character of Mitch and American Graffiti did it with the character played by MacKenzie Phillips.And, if that wasn't enough, American Graffiti has Wolfman Jack in probably my most favorite scene of the movie.  Seeing it made me want to go find old copies of The Midnight Special.I might only be 19 years old but I can relate to what happens in American Graffiti.  George Lucas made a movie that will stand up throughout each generation of teenagers in this country.

What I liked most about this movie was the way it handled the situation and its cinematography. First, I believe if someone were to be stranded, there situation would be played out similar to Chuck's. No pirates, natives, snakes, buddies, abundant food supplies, and other plot devices every other movie of this genre uses. It is a man alone on a small island left to himself (and a volleyball). Hanks played this part so convincingly, I felt as if his character was always just teetering on the edge of insanity. Myself and others I saw this movie with felt real sorrow when Chuck loses Wilson. I felt this movie had a very strong ending. I believe it ended at the right point. We see how Chuck adjusts, but what he decides to do with his life is left up the the viewers imagination. I also believed the cinematography was spectacular. Granted, anything filmed in the South Pacific will look beautiful, the filming in this movie captures the feeling of being on the tiny island with Chuck. Four stars!
