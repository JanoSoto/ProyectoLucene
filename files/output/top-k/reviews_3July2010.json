[{"date":"3 July 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Featuring a talented cast with the likes of Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law (in an outstanding performance), and Cate Blanchett, this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel is like a Hitchcockian film for a modern generation, despite taking place in 1958, but can also be a stand-alone thriller. Through the viewpoint of the title character played by Damon, we also see the journey of a sociopath who believes that he finds happiness by assuming the identity of someone else and relishing in that person's lifestyle. The film's aided by breathtaking photography shot on location in Italy, a fascinating yet haunting score (including the jazz), some suspense, romantic intrigue (even the unrestrained homoerotic undertones), a top-notch script, and direction that helps increase interest due to the way the late Anthony Minghella made it. However, at times, the film seems slow and sluggish, and one wishes that Jude Law had more screen time. Also, it's just that the film's ending could've been altered, to make it more satisfying.
