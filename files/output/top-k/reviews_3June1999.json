Despite an intimidating opening scene, the first half soon settles down to establishing who everyone is - the bad guys drip malevolence, while the good guys dance in gay meadows. It is not until the second half that the politics and intrigue really get going.The film opens in England, circa 1550s. The country is divided, half of the population pledging allegiance to the childless catholic Queen Mary who is dying, while the other half attempt to place their protestant liege, Elizabeth, on the throne.Mary dies before providing an heir so the monarchy automatically passes to Elizabeth. However, she inherits a rebellious court keen to see her removed and a catholic monarch installed. Fortunately for Elizabeth, there are not enough candidates for the job. While, the evil Duke of Norfolk plots to put himself and Mary, Queen of Scots on the English throne, Elizabeth's supporters rush around trying to find her a suitable international king.The crux comes when she declares she is only interested in her English lover, Lord Robert Dudley. When her enemies learn of this, they try to drive a wedge between them. And from this premise the real intrigue flows.In terms of characterisation, the film scores some hits and some misses. Some curious casting decisions undermine a few of the characters - working class mainstay Kathy Burke moves to the opposite end of the social spectrum to play Queen Mary, Brit comic Angus Deayton has an unnecessary cameo, while Eric Cantona seems an odd choice, although his performance seems adequate.As to the main characters, Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is well charted from gamboling youth to ice-hard queen. The black loyalty of Sir Francis Wolsingham (Geoffrey Rush) is tested time and again and never found wanting, allowing him to grow from mistrusted bodyguard to Queen's adviser.Unfortunately the Queen's enemies are so numerous it is difficult to focus on one. Michael Hirst, the writer, chooses the Duke of Norfolk as the chief villain but we never really learn why,  or what his plans, beyond unseating Elizabeth, are. Christopher Ecclestone plays the Duke with the right amount of menace but we are never truly intimidated by his smouldering glare. Lord Robert (Joseph Fiennes) is an equally confused character. Is he guilty of the crimes he is accused of? Does he love the queen? Some of his behaviour suggests he does not, yet he constantly returns to her claiming he does. The uncertainty generated by Lord Robert is compounded by the fact that Joseph Fiennes does not belong in this film.Beyond the characters, many of the films finest moments come in the form of the brightly coloured set pieces - when the court takes to the boat lake, the arrival of the french prince and the coronation. Some of the blacker scenes also serve very well - the aftermath of the battle, the plotting in the Vatican.Despite the fine art direction, what we are eventually left with is a sumptuous, well made film let down by a slow start and a few undefined characters.

This person does this with agility, ease and sensibility, putting a sense of mystery and ponder of whom this could be.The proceeding scene introduces a couple of things. First of all, we meet a character named Gin, a seductive secret agent who appears to be tracking the described thief. She plans to become his partner, get close, then capture him right in the act of his robberies.The crook is named Mac, and is very old for his skill.

The result is often disappointment.Some people object to its unrealistic approach. Suggesting that the involvement of Forrest in some of America's pivotal moments in history is not only ridiculous but misleading. Another argument I've heard is the fact that a mentally handicapped individual could never attain the levels of success that Forrest does. They've missed out on a truly charming, endearing fairy tale that can help you look at life from a different approach, a simple one at that. And the dialogue is so inherently quotable, as the message behind it is so straightforward. Stupid is as stupid does.Forrest is a purely innocent, well-meaning individual, and there can be no fault found in him. It's the rest of the world that is realistic, impure, and flawed. And so, when Forrest hurts, we can't help but hurt for him, when he is successful, we can't help but be happy for him and when his heart breaks, ours breaks also.I can't tell if it's the music, the cinematography or the acting, but the scene where young Forrest breaks free of his leg braces to escape the bullies on bicycles, gets me every time.

But if you haven't seen it already, just try and see it with fresh eyes, and open your mind to a very charming film.

Some people have put down every single thing about it. As for me, when my roommate (who had already seen it) asked me what I'd thought of it I replied in all honesty, I loved every single frame of it. She concurred, and we've both seen it again since. I plan to buy it as soon as I can find it for sale. It's heavy on metaphors, which seems to have annoyed a lot of people. As for it's structural resemblance to 'Citizen Kane', that was one of the points. Glam rock was in part about copying others for copying's sake, like Brian Slade copied from Curt Wild, and everyone copied from Jack Fairy. The performances are all great. Some may nitpick about how the characters were portrayed, but I think they were all apt. Ewan McGregor has gotten plenty of slobbering, ecstatic praise from me in the past, and this only encouraged the worship. Toni Collette, so mired in ugly duckling roles since 'Muriel's Wedding', is wonderful, as is Christian Bale's brittle, disillusioned reporter role. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is, as Brian Slade, a glittering void, as cloaked in mystery at the end as he was at the beginning. Some of have criticized his role, but I think he did it just right, with a grand coldness. One believes that only such a creature could be the idol of an era that was, in the end, about glittering emotional voids and icy hipness. Why did he do what he did? We never know. That's one of the best parts. (I must embarrass myself here by noting, also, that Rhys-Meyers is so shockingly beautiful it's disgusting, like eating too much honey.

I suppose that not everyone can be expected to love this movie as much as I did, but I'm still a little surprised at some of the venom that's been spit at it.

It's also one of my favorites, due to the fact that it was crafted by the moviemaking god, Stanley Kubrick!  I love all of his movies, and this time, he has set out and proclaimed that he too can make a good scary movie!  One of the reasons that this film is so terrifying is that he was able to frighten us to the edge of our fears, and never resolve the pent up emotion and tension that has built up throughout the entire film.  It also is a horror film that shies away from blood and gore, or visual pyrotechnics, because Stanley Kubrick knew that that kind of stuff wasn't scary enough to create the kind of effect that he wanted.  Like Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, it relies on the psychological fright factor, instead of the usual bag of tricks involving blood and guts.  The only supernatural moment in the film involved Delbert Grady opening up the freezer, letting loose an animal of Jack Torrance.  Notice how careful Kubrick was in not going overboard with supernatural activity, because most of the horror existed in the mind. Jack Nicholson's performance gives the character his meat, his madness, and he utters one of the most famous lines in film history(which was actually an ad-lib)! Moreover, this is a psychological horror film that keeps you thinking all the time after you've seen it, and that is what really scares me about this film.  The more you think about it, the scarier it seems.  I think that was what Stanley Kubrick was trying to achieve, because this film is so intricately riddled with subliminals and ideas, that all mean and lead to something.  The only question is, what?  It keeps people going and going, debating and trying to figure out what all of those little details in the film meant.  Some say this was an artistic failure for Kubrick, which I think is totally wrong!  I think that the characters were beautifully defined, and the detail and terror of the film is that of a master.  This film is a masterpiece of modern horror and film, by the grand master of film himself!

I for one would like to see an American made movie featuring Jean Reno that doesn't suck (i.e. The Professional, Ronin, Mission Impossible) I think he is a great actor in search of a good story.Too long and not enough story.

The eerie desert setting of Utah coupled with the nice shiny new car which contrasted against the rough country with its rough redneck cafés and gas stops created an atmosphere of deep vulnerability and foreboding. The couple's quiet and ordinary existence contrasted harshly with the atmosphere of the unfriendly people and surroundings. Kurt Russell was a brilliant depiction of the average man in a situation where his wife has accepted a lift with a trucker when his car breaks down, and she does not appear at the truck stop they arranged to meet at. His reaction as the realisation dawned was brilliantly realistic and this drew you into the movie which despite a plot which some say has become too common, the movie was from then on never predictable. Russell's realism and humanity was so lifelike that it made you deeply fearful when he decided to pursue his wife and the kidnappers and made you cheer whenever things went slightly his way. The suspense built up like a thunderstorm with a climactic ending, with some of the most thrilling sequences of car-chases ever filmed. Ruussell as a hero in this picture, is so much more grabbing because the movie paints a picture of what would happen in the real world in a situation like this, and it is actually feasible too, there may have been the odd scene which slipped on this but this movie is so gripping because for the hero, his fix and his choices certainly aren't cut & dry, things don't always go right, as they do for the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Clint Eastwood.
