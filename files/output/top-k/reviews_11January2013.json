Not even the book written by an anonymous author can hide the facts that it's closely mirrors Bill Clinton's attempt to win over the people dismight conflicts such as his affairs, his participation in Vietnam War era protest, and others. Every thing about the film, just about speaks of him, even the actor playing an Southern governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) who mimics the president southern drawn, and charm. It's hard not to see him in Jack. The movie starts with an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton AKA George Stephanopoulos (Adrian Lester), whom joins the campaign whoms been impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton AKA Hillary Clinton (Emma Thompson). Emme Thompson plays the shrewdness role well, as a women whom dreams and hope are riding on a man whom does mistake after mistake, nearly derailing his chances to be president. She doesn't mind chewing him out or bailing him. She always doesn't mind the womanizing that takes it's toll on her, as long as she wins in the end. Henry also meets ruthless, redneck political strategist Richard Jemmons AKA James Carville (Billy Bob Thornton) whom character is so unlikeable, it's hurt the film. The character is too mopey, drunk, sexual harasser and indecisive that it doesn't match the entertaining Carville of the documentary The War Room,. It's not Carville. It's a downer character nobody ask for. Lastly he meets tough, but unbalanced Libby Holden AKA Betsey Wright\/ Vince Foster (Kathy Bates.) Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance in this role, as she able to show strong emotion when needed, while also breaking down heart-broken. The film get good when tackles Henry and Libby are forced to seek out information about a rival politician. It's really shows how deep, far and twisted, people will go to dig to make sure their candidate wins while also showing how deeply disillusioned, they can be with the whole political process. Thus is each character tested Do we do the right thing for the wrong reason, the wrong thing for the right reason? How low do we go? If we go too low, can we ever get back up? Both of them are forced to choose between idealism and realism when looking up and helping out a political contender. Kathy Bates' Libby Holden is the movie's most outstanding character and the one who most stirringly articulates its frustrations about the candidate. The film's single best and most serious scene, arriving in its abruptly melodramatic third act, finds Libby desperately begging the Stantons to assess their campaign ethics. It's heart breaking speech is brilliant. The satire film does a good job following the book's plot. I think Joe Klein would be proud. Oops-- I meant the anonymous author. Much of the charm of the Mike Nichols film is just looking at the array of vivid caricatures actor playing real-life people, but it's lacks to give us a great main character. Henry is a bland, passive presence occupying a good deal of screen time. Adrian Lester is great, but it's doesn't have that George Stephanopoulos charm to him. The boy scout works for a while, he knows Stanton is somewhat a phony since the beginning, but it's doesn't seem to matter to him. So why does the political process makes him disillusioned, if he knew all the long that this might be stressful? He knew what he was putting himself in. I guess he didn't know how much he was willing to take. It suppose to be by the end time, he comes a time when he must make peace with the idea that the purest of causes may be advanced by the most impure of champions, but he knew that before getting in. This is what hurts the film. It's not like Mr. Smith goes to Washington here, he knew in advance, how ugly it is. Does he change it for the better? No. Does he keep his moral ground? No. Henry doesn't learn anything new, but he does get a new job. The movie is slow-pace, funny at times, but hard to watch, cause how depressing it is. It exposes politics for what it is. A ugly, disgusting, game where idealism is crush, disappointment kicks in, and when you come out of it. You feel like you tired of it. That's what happen to the film.

The reasons were Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung. When your film has these actors attached you can't go wrong. I personally never have seen any Wong Kar-Wai films before. I heard they are really good and guess what, In the Mood for Love was fantastic. It almost felt like Stanley Kubrick directed a period romance film set in Hong Kong.I prefer my romantic films more character, mood and atmosphere driven like Il Mare, Lost in Translation, Splendor in the Grass and The Girl who Leaped though Time. I do sometimes enjoy schlocky, over the top melodramas or classic romantic films but I do prefer them slow, full with mood and atmosphere. In the Mood for Love perfectly fits the latter category. It's a very subtle, slowly paced character piece where you experience a unique form of relationship that is created by our protagonists. There is no clichés, misunderstandings, no annoying shouting I hate you!, I love you!. We just go on a journey with our characters and see the world around them, there own feelings for each other and the ending, while bittersweet, was very fitting for the film. Also helped the fact that our main characters were people in their 30's not some horny early twenty somethings. Plus they acted like real adults and that made this film infinitely more interesting because in most romantic films every single character acts like sex-hungry maniac. I really enjoy the fact that these films can be romantic and intimate without sex. A lot of western romantic films are centered around it and they get boring really fast. I should mention that the acting is great. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung show why they are one of the best dramatic actors of their generation. They both should have gotten Academy awards not that talentless skank Julia Roberts and just okay Russel Crowe. Everyone else in the film serves more like a background characters and they all are fine. On the technical side of things In the Mood for Love is exceptional. While the film is limited in it's locations, visually it never becomes dull. It looks and feels like a Stanley Kubrick film to me. The cinematography, the music, the costumes and the acting feels like Barry Lyndon and Eyes Wide Shut. I might be wrong, but to me it felt like those films. In the Mood for Love looks gorgeous and draws you in perfectly with the atmosphere it creates.There are a couple things that bothered me while I was watching it. First of all, it's very very slow. Just like Eyes Wide Shut, In the Mood for Love moves very slowly and at times it can drag a bit. And it can bore some of the less patient viewers senseless. I also thought that the ending, which was fine, could have been more interesting or at least provided more closure on the both characters.So is In the Mood for Love worth seeing? Yes and no. If you like complex, thought provoking, foreign art-house films or just art-house cinema in general then I would recommend it. If you are a big fan of Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung or just want to see convectional romantic film then I would recommend it.

The original was creepy and intense where as this sequel went a different approach, a tongue and cheek slasher...should have stayed with the original format, fair play they tried something different but to me that like wearing gloves on your feet. They had a good story with a bunch of creepy characters and just turned them into cartoon versions of themselves.Leatherface did not sit well with me at all. I love the character Leatherface but in this version he was very badly portrayed, would say the acting and directing are responsible. He just seemed like a caricature, almost like they was trying to hard to show you his slow mentality, too much lip licking and that stupid little chainsaw dance he done every time he was chasing someone. They should have tried a more subtle approach, rather than he keep doing the same thing throughout the film, yes we get the point he's retarded, we are not. Choptop was a horrible addition as well, he was annoying always repeating himself, chanting and again he seemed like a caricature, this time a badly done clone of the Hitchhiker from the original, I think they are suppose to be brothers but still does not make it acceptable to have a badly done version of the Hitch hiker repeating things that neither were funny or creepy, he was bugging the hell out of me. Even Drayton and Grandpa did not come off as creepy and well.Dennis Hopper was believable and not bad and so was the leading female. For a 80s slasher it's not bad, some good gore scenes, acting overall not too bad, except I was really disappointed by the villains portrayal in this movie, really spoilt it for me.The ending was pretty abrupt and seemed a bit unfinished.Not the worst but not the best either. If you are looking for a simple 80s slasher to give a watch this will do the job but if you are looking for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre experience you will more than likely be disappointed. Watching this film felt like Tobe Hooper put some poo in a brown paper bag, set it on fire and ran off and left me to clean it off my shoes.

He just seemed like a caricature, almost like they was trying to hard to show you his slow mentality, too much lip licking and that stupid little chainsaw dance he done every time he was chasing someone. They should have tried a more subtle approach, rather than he keep doing the same thing throughout the film, yes we get the point he's retarded, we are not. Choptop was a horrible addition as well, he was annoying always repeating himself, chanting and again he seemed like a caricature, this time a badly done clone of the Hitchhiker from the original, I think they are suppose to be brothers but still does not make it acceptable to have a badly done version of the Hitch hiker repeating things that neither were funny or creepy, he was bugging the hell out of me. Even Drayton and Grandpa did not come off as creepy and well.Dennis Hopper was believable and not bad and so was the leading female. For a 80s slasher it's not bad, some good gore scenes, acting overall not too bad, except I was really disappointed by the villains portrayal in this movie, really spoilt it for me.The ending was pretty abrupt and seemed a bit unfinished.Not the worst but not the best either. If you are looking for a simple 80s slasher to give a watch this will do the job but if you are looking for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre experience you will more than likely be disappointed.

Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 classic To Catch a Thief is one of these films since watching it is similar to being on an awesome vacation. You get to see some beautiful sights, go on some potentially dangerous yet fun adventures, hang out with some cool people who you hope to see again soon, and have a temporary escape from reality. These are reasons why we like to go on vacations and these are also reasons why we like going to the movies in the first place. The relatively simple story of To Catch a Thief goes something like this. John Robie (Cary Grant), aka The Cat, is a famous jewel thief who is now retired and running a vineyard in the French Riviera. But when a series of robberies occur which resemble his style, almost everyone believes that The Cat is on the prowl again. However, The Cat claims that he's innocent and in able to prove it, he will go searching the French Riviera for potential victims and catch the real thief in the act. During his search, he comes across a wealthy woman named Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who may be the real thief's next target, and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly), who eventually falls in love with The Cat. Probably the main reason why To Catch a Thief is such a memorable movie going experience is because of Grace Kelly. I absolutely adore Grace Kelly to the point that I would consider her my personal favorite actress ever, even if the main reason was because of her work in this film and Rear Window (1954). Grace Kelly simply looks spectacular in this picture. Between her natural beauty, her elegant wardrobe, and her lithe physique, she is literally eye candy every time she's on screen. Not only that, but her character is charming as well. I love that she's fascinated by people who are potentially criminals and that the possibility of danger turns her on. I also like how unpredictable she can be at times. You'd never guess when the first kiss between Grant and Kelly occurs or who makes the first move. Either way, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the scene played out. If To Catch a Thief had to belong to one character, it would no doubt be Frances Stevens. But the other characters are pretty good, too. Cary Grant is ideal casting for his role since we completely buy that there's a typical charm and coolness to The Cat, and Jessie Royce Landis is fun in her supporting role with the way she carelessly and excessively spends her money. The Technicolor cinematography in To Catch a Thief is just first-rate. The way in which the French Riviera was shot and put on film is nothing short of exquisite, especially with the nice blue ocean and the richly detailed architecture of the buildings in the Riviera. The cinematography also does great justice to Kelly's costumes. When the colors and texture of her dresses pops out at you to the point where you want to touch them, you realize just how excellent the Technicolor process was during that era of filmmaking. I love To Catch a Thief and I think it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated works. If this picture isn't a suspense-loaded powerhouse like most of his works, it's because it didn't need to be. To Catch a Thief was meant to be both a romantic love story and, most importantly, pure escapism complete with charming characters, eye- popping scenery, and a well told story to accompany it. So, for what it's meant to be, To Catch a Thief is an impeccable delight.

Either way, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the scene played out. If To Catch a Thief had to belong to one character, it would no doubt be Frances Stevens. But the other characters are pretty good, too. Cary Grant is ideal casting for his role since we completely buy that there's a typical charm and coolness to The Cat, and Jessie Royce Landis is fun in her supporting role with the way she carelessly and excessively spends her money. The Technicolor cinematography in To Catch a Thief is just first-rate. The way in which the French Riviera was shot and put on film is nothing short of exquisite, especially with the nice blue ocean and the richly detailed architecture of the buildings in the Riviera. The cinematography also does great justice to Kelly's costumes. When the colors and texture of her dresses pops out at you to the point where you want to touch them, you realize just how excellent the Technicolor process was during that era of filmmaking. I love To Catch a Thief and I think it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated works. If this picture isn't a suspense-loaded powerhouse like most of his works, it's because it didn't need to be. To Catch a Thief was meant to be both a romantic love story and, most importantly, pure escapism complete with charming characters, eye- popping scenery, and a well told story to accompany it. So, for what it's meant to be, To Catch a Thief is an impeccable delight. ","genre":"Mystery, Romance, Thriller"},{"date":"11 January 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Sometimes a film comes along in which after you've seen it, you felt like you've been on a very nice vacation. Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 classic To Catch a Thief is one of these films since watching it is similar to being on an awesome vacation. You get to see some beautiful sights, go on some potentially dangerous yet fun adventures, hang out with some cool people who you hope to see again soon, and have a temporary escape from reality. These are reasons why we like to go on vacations and these are also reasons why we like going to the movies in the first place. The relatively simple story of To Catch a Thief goes something like this. John Robie (Cary Grant), aka The Cat, is a famous jewel thief who is now retired and running a vineyard in the French Riviera. But when a series of robberies occur which resemble his style, almost everyone believes that The Cat is on the prowl again. However, The Cat claims that he's innocent and in able to prove it, he will go searching the French Riviera for potential victims and catch the real thief in the act. During his search, he comes across a wealthy woman named Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who may be the real thief's next target, and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly), who eventually falls in love with The Cat. Probably the main reason why To Catch a Thief is such a memorable movie going experience is because of Grace Kelly. I absolutely adore Grace Kelly to the point that I would consider her my personal favorite actress ever, even if the main reason was because of her work in this film and Rear Window (1954). Grace Kelly simply looks spectacular in this picture. Between her natural beauty, her elegant wardrobe, and her lithe physique, she is literally eye candy every time she's on screen. Not only that, but her character is charming as well. I love that she's fascinated by people who are potentially criminals and that the possibility of danger turns her on. I also like how unpredictable she can be at times. You'd never guess when the first kiss between Grant and Kelly occurs or who makes the first move.

I do like his film from the 90's and really enjoy his more recent work like Django Unchained which is in my opinion the best film of 2012 and Inglorious Basterds which was respectively the best film of 2009. And of course I absolutely hated Kill Bill and Death Proof, which I found complete waste of time and talent. Jackie Brown is by far his best work and one of the best films of the 90's up their with L.A Confidential, Se7en, Goodfellas, Casino, Heat, Ed Wood and other classics. It's almost perfect in every way perfect casting, acting, dialog, pacing, soundtrack and so on.The cast is absolutely exceptional. We have Samuel L.Jackson, Robert De Niro, Pam Grier, Michael Keaton, Robert Forster and Bridgette Fonda. They all not only give award worthy performances but also their characters are great. I love the conversations between them and they feel like real people unlike the most of characters from Tarantino films. I also liked the slow pacing which is usually missing from most Tarantino films. I like my films slow and relaxed and letting us enjoy the characters and the atmosphere. I have to mention that Jackie Brown is very restrained on the Tarantino formula. It has very little violence and also the pop-culture references are more subtle so they doesn't drive you nuts like in other of his films.There are no real flaws in Jackie Brown. Every single element was perfect. Nothing really bothered me that much. I found the foot fetish in his films quite annoying (I have some weird disgust of feet) but I can look past it, since it's hardly a deal breaker for me.Jackie Brown is one his most unappreciated films. Many people still insist masturbating on Pulp Fiction and they can have it. I liked Jackie Brown much more because it was more mature film and has much more appeal to me. I simply prefer great characters and story over fancy gimmicks and pulpy grindhouse style. I really recommend seeing Jackie Brown.

His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end, I did, not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up.The plot is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who is viewed live 24 hours a day, uncensored, as a soap opera to the real world through public broadcasting. The thing is, Truman Burbank is the only one who doesn't know this. Everything else around is all a set-up. And when I mean everything,...everything...is a set-up. Even the sun is fake! Nothing is real. All the people Burbank knows are all actors. People who go through the same routine every day.And that's partially what makes this film so great. Every piece of the set that Truman Burbank lives in is so believable. Along with this is Christof, acted by Ed Harris. Christof is the creator of Truman's world and he essentially plays God. Everything that Truman Burbank is as a person, was created under the supervision of Christof. The whole story itself, written by Andrew Niccol, brings up the controversial issue of nature vs nurture. Who should have control over whose life. Well I think that answer is obvious.Jim Carrey himself actually does have some comedic moments but it's not because he wants the movie to be a comedy. Carrey does what he does because it is the connection to how a human would react to such a situation that makes it funny. And along with those funny moments comes a real emotional performance. Sure Carrey can deliver laughs but also proves that he can portray human drama. That's a question a lot of people wanted to see if Carrey could pull off and he did it well.Adding to the emotion is composer Philip Glass' score. Yes, it did evoke the right emotions and I don't think it needed a theme either for this particular story. Usually I do, but it didn't seem necessary here. Unfortunately for me, I prefer to see Jim Carrey in his comedic skin. I didn't mind the different role that he took on here but it didn't feel like I was watching the movie I wanted to see. And I'll admit, I put too much thought into believing Jim Carrey would've made the film more comedy than drama, so basically I disappointed myself. So on that note, it could be disappointing to fans of Carrey for his comedic films as well.As the first drama film that comic gut buster Jim Carrey stars in, it is not that bad as some would expect it to be.

Consequently, he meets a bunch of wannabe quirky characters who all desperately want to adopt him and is being helped along the way by his guardian angel (Bruce Willis).I've never really been one to join in on a mob. Crowds generally make me nervous and I usually regard any gathering of any kind with a healthy dose of suspicion. So jumping on any bandwagon just isn't me. Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of North, the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record, his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could North be? Or more accurately put how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like?Well... North is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults, the philosophical narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with off-colour jokes and somewhat waspish clichés that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where North really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work, the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass (the Hawaiian episode springs to mind, in that respect).Of course, one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place (like any other Rob Reiner film) and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that North is never funny (which in itself is pure torture for a so-called comedy) but offensive and ultimately mean-spirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects, going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters, the main villain here chief suspect among these, deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life.I so wanted to like this film, if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone, which I admit is rather obnoxious of me.

Crowds generally make me nervous and I usually regard any gathering of any kind with a healthy dose of suspicion. So jumping on any bandwagon just isn't me. Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of North, the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record, his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could North be? Or more accurately put how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like?Well... North is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults, the philosophical narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with off-colour jokes and somewhat waspish clichés that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where North really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work, the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass (the Hawaiian episode springs to mind, in that respect).Of course, one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place (like any other Rob Reiner film) and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that North is never funny (which in itself is pure torture for a so-called comedy) but offensive and ultimately mean-spirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects, going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters, the main villain here chief suspect among these, deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life.I so wanted to like this film, if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone, which I admit is rather obnoxious of me.

Above all else, it's a study of one character, an obsessive surveillance expert named Harry Caul (Gene Hackman). He's been hired to spy on a young couple, Ann and Mark (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest) by a mysterious Director. He comes to believe that the young couple is in danger and decides to take a chance on becoming personally involved in the case. What motivates him is the guilt that he feels over a past case that had led to some deaths. The Conversation is a story of not only guilt, but personal responsibility and paranoia, and as such is one of the best films of Coppola's career. It takes a good look into the entire surveillance business, at the types of characters that inhabit it, the kinds of gadgets they use to ply their trade, and the lives they lead. It also features a scenario where things aren't as they appear. It doesn't really spend too much time on Harry's main dilemma but uses the premise to create lots of good individual moments. Hackman is excellent in the lead, delivering a low key, nuanced performance, and the supporting cast is full of talent. John Cazale is highly engaging as Harry's partner, as is Michael Higgins as another of his associates. Williams and Forrest are actually not in the movie that much but a certain amount of mystery surrounds them - what could make them so important? It's irresistible to see a young Harrison Ford as the Director's all-business assistant. Teri Garr is wonderful as Harry's briefly seen girlfriend, Allen Garfield has a juicy role as one of Harry's competitors, and Robert Duvall appears uncredited as the Director. The film is a great technical achievement as well, especially for sound re-recordist Walter Murch, and the score by David Shire is perfect; Hackman did his own saxophone playing as accompaniment. Overall it's a film very much of its time, perfectly capturing the distrust that people felt. The ending is particularly resonant as Harry is able to deal with the consequences of his actions and even find that despite his situation he's got a good handle on things for once. Even at an hour and 54 minutes, this never feels as long as it is, remaining a compelling experience through and through. 10 out of 10.

I'm just a bit too young to remember anything about the vicious Mods v Rockers pitched battles at Brighton or the Mod lifestyle (I'm not sure just how far north it made it up to Scotland, it always seemed to me principally a London-based movement).Nevertheless, the broader themes in the film of the generation gap between teenagers and their parents, the pain of rejection, youthful revolt against authority plus the less intellectual need for young kids to get drunk, drugged, violent and sexed up are universal and seemingly constant, which with the background of great 60's music, made for an engrossing and enjoyable if occasionally challenging watch.This is Phil Daniel's Jimmy Fenton's worm's eye-view of life in the mid-60's, working in a dead-end job, out of touch with his parents and although on the face of it, there doesn't appear to be much to rebel against, sure enough, he loses his way and his mind as he suffers rejection from his employer, said parents, would-be girlfriend Leslie Ash and after seeing his Mod Hero 'ace-face played by Sting, meekly conform to society mores carrying bags at a hotel, he gets pushed over the edge (literally). His only way out of the tormenting feelings he's experiencing for the first time sadly involve just a one-way ticket.The film adopts a realistic, warts and all approach, with no let-up in the levels of bad language used, scenes of drug use (although it is only pill-popping uppers or blues as they're called in the film) and of course the centre-piece of the film, the recreation of the infamous Mods and Rockers Battle Of Brighton of 1965. There's some earthy humour though to leaven things, particularly two Mods encounter in the dark with a bunch of sleeping rockers, although one or two stray elements of sentimentality (Jimmy's heart-to- heart with his long-suffering dad, his friendship with an old pal turned rocker) slightly jar. Fan as I am, I could have done too without the too obvious genuflecting to the film's producers The Who (Jimmy putting on the My Generation single at a party, then gazing in awe at the band on Ready Steady Go), I guess he who pays the piper and all that.Central to the movie is a superb performance by Daniels as Jimmy, his mood-swings oscillating violently as he takes or comes off his pills, wired to the moon as we say today. His energy and vividness set the tone for the whole film. Interestingly director Franc Roddam (later the creator of Auf Weidersehn Pet and, ...er Masterchef on TV), changes the ending and placement of songs from the album, but there's no denying the memorable climax to the piece.In the end I was transported not only back into the era depicted, but more importantly into the head of helpless dancer Jimmy and would state that the movie well complements the great album The Who originally released, a rarity in rock movies.
