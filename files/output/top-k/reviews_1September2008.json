Mr. Brando's rather short stint in the film was punctuated by terse, cynical and penetrating dialog, playing the enterprising villain who continually cuts to the chase with large doses of street-wise metaphors. George C., as usual, is a no-nonsense good cop who only wants to see justice prevail, regardless of who gets burnt. Yet inside him, demons from the past lurk and can't help but surface from time to time you can see it in the non-verbal communication that Mr. Scott so characteristically exudes.Thanks to TCM for showing these kinds of films that are usually omitted on other movie channels.

Even though I was a child of the nineties, I never saw FernGully and so look at the movie without the rose colored glasses of nostalgia. First off, I can forgive a movie for being made when it was, but this is definitely not a timeless piece, and should probably still be lost in the nineties with poundpuppies. What I don't understand is how I'm supposed to look at this on a serious level. Zak learns that he shouldn't cut down the rainforest because there are fairies around and trees can feel pain. The movie does not go into any detail about the plight of the non-fictional animals and doesn't even amp up the pathos with those huge-eyed creatures that were dancing in the one scene because they are never seen again. In fact, the forest was portrayed as a terrifying place with creatures that would quickly devour a person if they were small enough. I guess its supposed to be saying that the inhabitants of the forest will be harmed if their home is destroyed, but just the fact that fairies aren't even real kind of makes the story lose any power it had.Also, what exactly is the pollution goo supposed to be? I understand that he's some evil demon thing that feeds on pollutants and wants to destroy the forest, but I don't get how it can be looked at metaphorically if the pollution is in control of continuing itself, as it is during parts of the movie. Finally, if I had seen this movie as a young child, I probably would have had nightmares for weeks. Between Haxxus becoming a horrible skeleton poop monster and the comic relief Batty having terrifying bloodshot eyes and a raging case of rabies, this movie rivals Snow White for scariest children's movie ever.

Powers' starts to notice that he is having trouble in the womanizing area, and decides to follow Dr. Evil and get his mojo back. Powers hooks up with the American spygirl, CIA Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), and together they go on a hunt for Powers' mojo. Powers also has to stop Dr. Evil from destroying the planet with his Alan Parsons Project, a giant laser. Dr. Evil's clone, Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), is an exact replica of Evil, only 1\/8 of his size. Mini-Me soon replaces Evil's son, Scott Evil (Seth Green), to become the high-light of Evil's life. The pint sized Evil is a barrel of laughs. Added to this sequel is also Fat Bastard (suprise! also played by Myers). This name is very fitting to the grotesque character. If you enjoy disgusting body gestures, then Fat Bastard is a character you will like. Myers won the American Comedy Award in 2000 for funniest actor in a motion picture. This award was well deserved by Myers, because of his versatillity. This comedy, directed by Jay Roach is perfect for viewers who enjoy crude remarks, grotesque comedy, and too many references to phallicism. This color film has an awesome soundtrack. Dr. Evil singing Just the Two of Us to his new little buddy is hysterically funny! I rated this film a 3, because I am not a big fan of grotesque comedy. I feel that disgusting bodily habits should be left at home in private, and not displayed for the public.

That's the easiest thing to overlook and perhaps the most brilliant part about Philadelphia Never once do you feel an ounce of racial tension between their two characters in this film. It's as if to say that we've broken a social barrier like this before and we'll do it again.The film follows Hanks as Andrew Beckett, a young stud lawyer in a major Philadelphia firm who learns his HIV has become AIDS just as he is promoted. Before long, Beckett finds himself fired for incompetency, though he believes it is based on his disease. He seeks the help of Joe Miller, a civil attorney, who at first turns him away due to his own homophobia, but later accepts. The film sort of baits us on our interest in courtroom drama and challenge us with some reflective, personal, human moments. While the film is about this legal battle, Silence of the Lambs filmmaker Jonathan Demme makes sure to remind you that its really about a man and his family struggling with a terrible disease.The genius of the script is that it blatantly plays on American prejudices about homosexuality and AIDS, reminding us of our ignorance about the virus and its disease in the way that it is contracted most specifically. We are supposed to come at it from Joe's perspective, slowly coming to understand that our homophobia is unfounded. It's not flawless execution as some of the ignorance feels artistically forced, but most of it is very real. This is one of those movies that uses such a sharp societal lens that it will leave you with shaken head syndrome' where you can't help but shake your head based on how terrible and prejudiced some of the things said and done in this film are.Philadelphia definitely seems to be on the upward portion near the climax of the illustrious acting careers of both Hanks and Washington. While best actor awards tend to make people think of the most dramatic performances, it is the way Hanks shows the debilitating effects of the disease through the course of the film that makes him Oscar-worthy. Washington's performance is familiar, but what makes it stand out a bit is that transformation in perspective we see him undergo.This is a story driven by content and meant to play toward emotions. It is meant to be sad and uplifting, both of which it is. It is a landmark film in its willingness to address AIDS and homosexuality in the pre-RENT era of entertainment. While it is a courtroom drama and meant to handle a serious subject matter, its more simplistic and raw than profound and artistic.

But the manner of which these ideas and experiments are transpired relies quite heavily on an item of nature a fly. The Fly by David Cronenberg is a film about the fusion and transport of different matter &#150; ironic then how the film itself is a fusion of genres and is indeed a remake or 'updating' of an old film from the latter years of Hollywood's Classical era. Its themes and ideas of experimentation and one man's greed, in a way, to succeed over everyone else is an interesting point for study.The Fly does not hang around, opening at a large gala in which science recluse Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is out and about amongst many other people which is a rarity for the film and is perhaps a rarity for the character even before these events transpire. Seth is working on something big but he isn't ready to go public just yet as some of the more technical issues (such as seeing if it actually works) are not tried and tested, but they will be in all their cinematic glory.I think Cronenberg realises that the film is less so a piece of entertainment and more so a study of a decent into madness and depression through loneliness even though its individual is an actual fly for that period. But the film falls into the genres of horror and science-fiction; two genres that you would commonly associate with entertainment or escapism as film in these genres usually enter the realm of the uncanny or the fantastical. Not in The Fly and never does Cronenberg really come across as someone who wants to make a film about a guy who becomes a giant bug and cause damage, indeed his mindset and attitude is to stay at home and welcome the odd visit from female reporter who he met at the opening gala, Veronica Quaife (Davis).Then again just because the film does not go out and out to give you thrills and kicks, that's not to say it isn't entertaining anyway. The Fly is a fascinating little film but it never veers too far over into the pretentious or even further into the 'shock' realm. Yes, it's nasty and its special effects are pretty gruesome and the overall character mindset of Brundle once he becomes devoured by this fly's attributes and appearance are somewhat shocking but it is not a deliberate attempt to raise eyebrows in the sense The Evil Dead might've done with its high content of violence or Caligula with its high content of nudity.As a director shooting a piece, The Fly has several hallmarks of just genuinely good direction. The film can rack up the suspense; draw us into looking away from the screen even though there is nothing really there to be afraid of and yet every time Veronica pays a visit to Seth, we want her to make contact; talk for a short while and then leave whilst getting as far away as possible and that's because the film creates such an unnerving atmosphere as Seth descends more and more into his transformation. There is also the scene in which the transformation(s) are finally revealed, whatever they may be of, and the smoke that creeps out of the transporter ala mist over graveyards in horror films of old, thus delaying our seeing the results of the transformation and the tension is racked up.But Cronenberg isn't afraid of including the odd scene nearer the beginning to do with animal cruelty and nor is he afraid to have his lead character tear off his own flesh and pop his own fingernails. But these scenes exist not purely to gross the audience out but are included to inform the viewer of Seth's continuous decline into physical change. The smart thing here being that while Seth comes across as slightly eccentric and perhaps a bit of a loner in the opening scenes, his transformation from 'normal' to 'abnormal' is not necessarily a psychological one as a result of isolation and more so a physical one as a result of his own quest for personal glory to do with his work. It doesn't help that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time, either.But The Fly retains an atmosphere of horror throughout, aided by some nasty dream sequences in which Cronenberg himself gets to deliver a lava. The progression of Goldblum's physical change is the highlight here with any love interest or love triangle utilised to form the basis of the third act but there is no real problem with that here. The Fly will entertain and somewhat shock without ever truly feeling like that's what it set out to do in a guilty and unconstructive way initially. Ultimately, the film is a tragedy but it is one that takes down a sci-fi and horror infested route which isn't often the case in those respective genres.

Bryan Singer had opened the doors for major comic book adaptations two years prior with his adaptation of the X-Men, and he proved such movies could make major earnings in the box office. Well, along came a spider and proved just how true that was when Spider-Man grossed $403.7 million in the United States alone. The film introduces audiences to the origins of the hero, when Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered spider and is given extraordinary abilities (i.e. web-slinging, wall-crawling, his spider-sense). After the death of his uncle at the hands of a car-jacker, Peter becomes determined to prevent crime and evil forces from ruining the lives of others and his first real test arrives in the form of the Green Goblin.My favorite aspect of Sam Raimi's film is that it FELT like a true Spider-Man movie. While I did enjoy Singer's X-Men, it didn't have the same feel as the comics\/cartoons. It was the X-Men, but it was Bryan Singer's X-Men. Watching Raimi's film, it feels as if it's ripped straight from the pages of the comics. It faithfully depicted all of it's characters with a couple exceptions; some liberties had to be taken to fit 40 years of comic book history into a 2 hour movie.

Meeting up with Gavin Strict, (Nick Stahl) U.V., (Chad Donella) and their friend Rachel Wagner, (Katie Holmes) they inform him that the local jocks in town, Andy Effkin, (Tobias Mehler) Trent Whalen, (Derek Hamilton) and Robbie Stewart, (P.J. Prinsloo) are into something weird that causes them great concern. Realizing it has something to do with the joining a sacred Blue Ribbons fraternity, which has most of the students on campus as members. Believing something else is wrong, they stumble across a secret society that is implanting students with a special device to modify their behavior, and they race to stop them before his family and others fall to the change.The Good News This here wasn't that bad but ad some good parts. The best part is the film is quite creepy at places, mainly due to the fact that it keeps the mystery rightly unknown until the end. By keeping it that way, there's a good build as it throws piece after piece towards something that is a huge unknown works wonderfully in here, making the revelation feel special with all the attention towards it. That is a fantastic advantage, as the different actions which come about, from the different methods used to show how the change has taken place to the little bits of evidence that make it clear something has happened, and it gives a certain amount of atmosphere to the proceedings. This also manages a little more excitement once the film gets to the psychiatric hospital, which is really great. It's creepy, unsettling and really just plain perfect for a horror film, and is one of the best examples around. The film is really good once it gets there, and it remains a highlight. The last plus here is the film's ending. This is a really action-packed using several big brawls, a great car chase that has the great resolution to the big mystery which here also allows for the great conclusion, the visual of the car going off the side of the cliff with the others all along the sides and back of it. It's quite fun to be able to see it played out fully, and it's the best part of the film. Altogether, these are the best parts of the film.The Bad News This here didn't have much wrong with it, but they are big flaws. The biggest one here, which is that the tactics used to indicate the behavioral change aren't that scary. The fact that it's just not in the least bit scary or creepy is a huge factor here, since it's got a lot of these scenes in the beginning which are supposed to show that something is wrong, but all it does is just showcase one lame tactic after another about how lame it is. Nothing that happens, from the bullying beat-downs to the association with different cliques and such isn't all that scary, yet that's all the attempts made to try to build up to something, which here is a deadly dull since nothing really works all that well. The worst factor of all this is that it goes on for so long, since it's pretty much all the first hour of the film that it does this, so there's a lot of time to show off some really nice ideas and scenes to really drive them home, but it's got nothing to showcase at all, and to do it for so much of the film is really bad. The other big flaw here is that there's not a whole lot of blood and gore in this, since there's hardly any deaths at all in the film except for the ending. There really needed to be a few deaths scattered throughout to help the film along, and the ones we have are really uninspiring, making for another big disappointment.

This isn't Le Carre or Buchan or the great Geoffrey Household. Bond's role is as a simulacrum permitting us to rationalize anxieties bred by the commodity fetish in others and ourselves. The books, and much more the movies, show us how to worship at the altar of the good life and repress all our doubts and fears, as good citizens of any empire should. Bond allows us to hunger after the life of plenty, of good taste, and use it to build a psychological carapace over our dread and alienation at the ravages of the wages system in the most socially useful way possible we consume.007 consumes women, sunshine, very dry martinis, fine furnishings, splendid cars. He visits the very heavens of this world Alps, Dolomites, Aegean, Orient, Bahamas. His job, the thing that hands him upper class consumer culture on a silver platter, is simple enough. Each day he cocks a snook at his hopelessly serious boss; from time to time he deflects a steel-brimmed bowler hat or blows up a blimp. Licence to Kill (1989) was the last Cold War-era Bond movie. But it doesn't even pay lip service to Russia, Europe, or any of Bond's old hunting grounds. This movie looks forward to the villains ordained by the first Bush regime making war against drugs and Manuel Noriega. (The drug emperor Sanchez lives in a country called Isthmus,and runs it behind the scenes. When President Lopez confronts him about a reduced paycheck, Sanchez raises a Grinch-like eyebrow and tells him Remember, you're only president for life.) It also proposes a Cuban connection in the drug trade; a month after the film's release, the Cuban government executed General Arnoldo Ochoa for drug trafficking. The whole south Florida and Central American milieu of Licence to Kill is steeped in the double-dealing criminality opened by Washington's proxy counterrevolutionary war to topple the FSLN government in Nicaragua. The contra war was only the most recent imperialist pro-drug war; a previous one was called The Opium War; so may be the next one.Sanchez, played by the find actor Robert Davi, is not a maniacal Blofeld-style super villain. He does not want to irradiate Fort Knox or provoke World War Three or sink California into the Pacific. All he wants is market expansion into the Orient; he revenges himself against the DEA, Felix Leiter, and Leiter's new bride Della so as not to lose face with prospective partners.Licence to Kill has the usual yachts and scuba battles. But there are also characters like Professor Joe Butcher, played by the singer Wayne Newton. While he has only a few minutes of screen time, Newton turns Butcher into the acme of all seedy, hilariously crooked late-1980s televangelists. When Butcher is ripping off, or being ripped off, he says Bless your heart as though marveling at the glory of his own cruelness.We might call Licence to Kill James Bond vs. Scarface. At one point in the film Sanchez tells a business partner It's not personal, it's business. This echoes the mantra of both Scarface and The Untouchables.Production designer Peter Lamont gives Sanchez's drug factory (hidden beneath a Mexican pyramid) a high-industrial aluminum cleanliness; it looks more like a pharmaceutical or computer plant than a common or garden drug lab.This is the law of value at its most exotic. Sanchez hides his drugs for transport by dissolving them into the holiest of holies, gasoline. They are safely reconstituted at the other end of the pipeline provided his partners in other countries buy rights to the formula. Above all else, intellectual copyright must be upheld.Licence to Kill wraps contemporary headlines around the bourgeois fantasy of the revenge-filled killing spree. The glee with which Bond destroys a fortune in drugs being shipped in a mini-sub, and later throws two men out of an airplane he needs for escape, capture many viewers in their emotional back flow. Revenge is a normal category of activity in our ruling class, and between individual capitalists. We become intoxicated by its much-advertised charms, too. Righteous revenge features in the plots of most thriller novels and movies, which are the dominant genre today. Many dream of sticking it to their enemies and competitors. Movies permit us to train our imaginations that way. The problems we face require not collective action in our unions and mass organizations, but a decompression chamber or a stinger missile.This was not the last James Bond movie, but it certainly feels that way. Six years would pass before the release of Golden Eye in 1995. The measured tempo and four-square mies-en-scene of Licence to Kill are a pleasure, as are the performances. Dalton in particular achieves an almost constant agonized stillness, simply poised and waiting within his body. It is an impeccable turn by a versatile actor.Politically, Licence to Kill is another in a long series of anti-political non-political political films. A particular capitalist enterprise makes a movie depicting some specific crimes and misdemeanors of specific capitalists, companies, countries, or industries which demonstrably must be cleaned-up. Nothing systemic, you see. Criminal activity in the business world is abnormal, you see. Decisive individual action, not collective class action, rectifies all, you see.

Above all else, intellectual copyright must be upheld.Licence to Kill wraps contemporary headlines around the bourgeois fantasy of the revenge-filled killing spree. The glee with which Bond destroys a fortune in drugs being shipped in a mini-sub, and later throws two men out of an airplane he needs for escape, capture many viewers in their emotional back flow. Revenge is a normal category of activity in our ruling class, and between individual capitalists. We become intoxicated by its much-advertised charms, too. Righteous revenge features in the plots of most thriller novels and movies, which are the dominant genre today. Many dream of sticking it to their enemies and competitors. Movies permit us to train our imaginations that way. The problems we face require not collective action in our unions and mass organizations, but a decompression chamber or a stinger missile.This was not the last James Bond movie, but it certainly feels that way. Six years would pass before the release of Golden Eye in 1995. The measured tempo and four-square mies-en-scene of Licence to Kill are a pleasure, as are the performances. Dalton in particular achieves an almost constant agonized stillness, simply poised and waiting within his body. It is an impeccable turn by a versatile actor.Politically, Licence to Kill is another in a long series of anti-political non-political political films. A particular capitalist enterprise makes a movie depicting some specific crimes and misdemeanors of specific capitalists, companies, countries, or industries which demonstrably must be cleaned-up. Nothing systemic, you see. Criminal activity in the business world is abnormal, you see. Decisive individual action, not collective class action, rectifies all, you see. Thus are we safe and satisfied to remain at home, purchasing and consuming until the next sequel.

The first came in the late Seventies, immediately after the war itself, with films such as The Deerhunter, Coming Home and Apocalypse Now. Hollywood then seemed to lose interest in the subject for a few years, but returned to it in the late eighties when there were a number of major Vietnam War films such as Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, Casualties of War and Oliver Stone's trilogy of Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and Heaven and Earth.All those other films take a deeply serious look at the war, but Good Morning, Vietnam is often regarded as a comedy, albeit a dark, satirical one. It essentially does for Vietnam what M*A*S*H* did for Korea. The film is set in 1965, and is loosely based upon the experiences of Adrian Cronauer, a DJ with American Forces Radio, during the Vietnam War. (The title comes from his habit of beginning every broadcast with an exuberant shout of Gooood Moooorning, Vietnaaam!) The real Cronauer is a conservative Republican, but Robin Williams plays him here as a rebel against authority, although he is a rebel who, initially, has some support from the Army's top brass. It's the bottom brass who can't stand him. He is brought to Vietnam by a General who admired his broadcasts to American forces based in Crete. Cronauer, whose shows combine music with quickfire satirical comedy, proves immensely popular with the troops, but alienates his commanding officer, Lieutenant Hauk. Hauk dislikes his style of humour and the fact that he plays rock and roll instead of the likes of Mantovani, Perry Como and Andy Williams. Cronauer also makes an enemy of his immediate superior Sergeant Major Dickerson, who finds him insubordinate.As Roger Ebert has pointed out, the character of Cronauer undergoes considerable development in the course of the film as he begins to learn more about the war and about Vietnam itself. (That is, Vietnam the country as opposed to Vietnam the American foreign policy blunder). At first his irreverent humour is merely satire for satire's sake, but as time goes on it takes on a more questioning and more political tone. A key moment comes when Cronauer witnesses the bombing by the Vietcong of a Saigon bar which causes the death of a number of GIs. He wants to make reference to this incident in one of his broadcasts, but is prevented from doing so by Dickerson, who takes the view that if something is not official news it never happened. (Cronauer's situation is similar to that of Matthew Modine's Private Joker in Full Metal Jacket, another film from the same year. Joker is a journalist on a military newspaper who becomes frustrated with his job, which he sees as dishonest, slanted reporting for propaganda purposes).Despite earning the enmity of Hauk and Dickerson, Cronauer is for a time protected by his patron General Taylor, who regards his broadcasts as being good for the men's morale. Cronauer's downfall eventually comes when he befriends a young Vietnamese man named Tuan, who turns out to be a Vietcong supporter. Even the General can no longer protect him, and Cronauer is discharged from the armed forces.Robin Williams started his career as a stand-up comedian, so he was a natural for the role of Cronauer. I have always regarded Dead Poets' Society as Williams' best film, but Good Morning, Vietnam is a strong candidate for his next best, along with Mrs Doubtfire and One Hour Photo. It brought him a well-earned Oscar nomination, although he lost out to Michael Douglas in Wall Street. Williams also receives excellent support from Forest Whitaker as Cronauer's friend Edward Garlick, Tung Thanh Tran as Tuan and J.T. Walsh as the arrogant bully Dickerson.There are some very amusing scenes, such as Cronauer's spoof Richard Nixon interview, and the one where he is teaching a class of Vietnamese students how to swear in English. There are also some brilliant lines; most of these are given to Cronauer (No, we can't say dyke on the air, we can't even say lesbian anymore, it's women in comfortable shoes), but some of the other characters join in. ( I wouldn't buy an apple from the son of a bitch and I consider him a good, close, personal friend- General Taylor on Nixon). Even the normally humourless Dickerson gets to utter the memorable threat You better not even come within range of anything that happens or your ass is grass, and I'm a lawn mower.
