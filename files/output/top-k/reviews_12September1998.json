While this new one falls short of deserving such revere, I do believe all the negative reviews are uncalled for.  True, some of the casting left a lot to be desired (Pitillo and Broderick come to mind).  But this Godzilla movie does something that NONE of the classic one did.  It shows Godzilla as a creature, not a monster bent on creating havoc.  As with all creature-features it's only natural to root for the decline of humanity at the claws of nature's creation.  But here we're shown two creatures, humans and Godzilla, how are striving to survive.  Humans attack Godzilla because he's (or she's) destroying our homes and businesses.  Godzilla only attacks out of self defense, and later out of revenge over the death of its young. Aside from the National Geographic aspects, the special effects deserve an Oscar nomination, if not Oscar himself.  Godzilla looked and behaved in a believable manner.  Not since Jurassic Park has this occurred. One final note, for a 'pitiful, weak story' GODZILLA is in the top-five take of 1998's summer grosses.  Roland and Dean, if you do a sequel as planned, really reconsider casting.

He's as big as..., He's as tall as..., His tail stretches from here to here.... This is over-hype and draping office buildings and hotels in downtown L.A. with these ads simply adds to the embarrassment. As for the film, yeah it definitely wasn't their best. ID4 and Stargate were vastly superior. The acting was questionable and the  Jurassic Park kitchen scene in Madison Square Garden was... oh, never mind. Let's just say that the creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves for that. The movie has two major things going for it. Jean Reno and Godzilla himself. I really liked the new streamlined appearance of the big guy and considered it a major improvement over the rubber suit look. Not the worst movie I've ever seen but it sure could use some fine tuning.No sequels please!
