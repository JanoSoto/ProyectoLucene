It does have flaws the opening sequence in Iraq, although beautiful to look at, is ultimately superfluous (although it obviously inspires the similar setting at the beginning of 'The Omen',  which is used with much greater relevance); the pacing is very uneven and the young priest couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. It makes up for its shortcomings with a superb performance from Ellen Burstyn as the mother and an unparalleled performance from Linda Blair as the girl. The final scenes of the exorcism are some of the most powerful ever put onto film (and MUST BE VIEWED ON A BIG SCREEN to appreciate their full impact). The film is harrowing rather than scary, with repeated visits into the girl's bedroom becoming just as full of dread for the audience as for the characters. The demon-possessed Linda Blair is one of the most memorable icons in cinema history. Still banned on video in the UK (mainly because of how young Linda Blair is than for any other reason), this is the only example of censorship of a mainstream film that I support. See the film and, for goodness sake, watch it with your disbelief suspended (sorry if this is stating the obvious, but there were people around me in the cinema laughing at various scenes when there is NOTHING REMOTELY FUNNY about what goes on).

I see that a few people have said it is the worst movie ever. Two people even commented on the acting being bad. Let me ask this  WHAT MOVIE DID YOU PEOPLE WATCH?!? Natural Born Killers was one of the best- acted films of the 1990's, and Stone's direction was innovative, brilliant, and exciting. The satire was unending and obvious, just like the atmosphere of violence. And that was Stone's intention. That's what movies are SUPPOSED to do  make you react. I personally fell in love with Mickey and Mallory, not as people I'd like to be around, but rather as fantastic, fascinating characters. And that's another thing Stone does intentionally  he makes them characters, not realistic imitations of people. The cartoon superhero images didn't get there by accident. Perhaps what many disliked was that obviously Stone fell in love with them as well. Instead of allowing them to be made examples of for the purpose of his satire, he allowed them to become heroes, and they win in the end. But here we are again at what makes movies great.

Natural Born Killers was one of the best- acted films of the 1990's, and Stone's direction was innovative, brilliant, and exciting. The satire was unending and obvious, just like the atmosphere of violence. And that was Stone's intention. That's what movies are SUPPOSED to do  make you react.
