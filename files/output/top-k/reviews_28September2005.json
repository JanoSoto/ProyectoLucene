That is why we come here and write our reviews and read other peoples opinions of them. But to make a site like this possible we need to have the finished article on our screens, and these movies are presented in such a way that they seem effortless. Never once are we to imagine that the whole scene is just a set, and the characters on screen are merely paid actors.The Bad and the Beautiful breaks that mould. For once we are shown the true gritty realism of what goes on behind the cameras. The studio systems, the dodgy and sometimes sleazy wheeler dealing's and the heartbreak and high running passions that go into making a motion picture. In short it is a movie about movie making.When a Director, an Actress and a Writer are called into the office of movie Mogul Harry Pebbel (Walter Pigeon) they are told that movie producer Jonathan Sheilds has fallen on hard times. He plans to make a come back but requires their combined talents to pull it off.However all four of them have had extensive dealings with Sheilds in the past and have all vowed never to even talk to him again let alone work with him. Each have their own reasons as each have suffered at Sheilds' hands.The rest of the picture is told in three individual flashbacks as it is explained just how and why Sheilds deserves such animosity, with Pebbels also explaining just what they all went on to achieve because of him and in spite of him.The Director is Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) who started out as Sheilds' partner when they were a young Producer\/Director team finding it hard to land a job. They have a very close friendship and make very low budget 'B' pictures. When the two men finally land a job with Harry Pebbel's studio, their pictures start to acquire success and with that comes the ambition to produce bigger and better projects.The two decide to take on Amiel's dream project and translate a best selling novel to the screen. Amiel has written a solid screenplay and longs more than anything to direct it. Requiring a big budget and 'A' list stars, the two of them pull out all the stops to get the necessary backing from the studio.It pays off but in the negotiations Amiel is all but dropped from the project, instead opting for a better known and more experienced Director. Sheilds however rides his ambition and signs on for the project despite the railroading of his best friend, and with Sheilds' star on the rise, the two end their partnership and their friendship on a bitter and acrimonious note.The Actress is Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), the daughter of one of the early movie stars, who's tortured passed she hides behind a bottle. Despite her drunken exterior, Sheilds who now owns his own production company and studio, sees the potential for a star quality leading lady and signs her on for his next picture.During the preparation for the picture she falls in love with Sheilds. This coupled with the pressure of her first major role is too much for her, so once again she finds solace in drink which threatens to destroy the project.As a way of keeping Lorrison on track, Sheilds convinces her that he too is in love, and helps her develop as the actress she undoubtedly is. However when the film is released and Lorrison becomes the new Hollywood sensation, Sheilds drops her like a hot potato, an act made even more callous by the fact he is already with another woman and had probably been so all the time.The Writer is James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) a southern intellectual who's first book has just been published and Sheilds intends to adapt it for the screen. After flying Bartlow and his wife out to Hollywood, Sheilds convinces him to write the screenplay as well.Bartlow is a happily married man who's home-life has always come first, however Sheilds believes that his wife is interfering with his work, so he engages his dashing leading man 'Goucho' (played by Gilbert Roland) to turn on his Latin charm and seduce the lady away from her husband while the screenplay is finished.This has tragic results as Goucho and Mrs Bartlow are killed in a plane crash, while running away to Mexico together so she can get a quick divorce and marry her new found Latin lover.Unaware that it was Sheilds' scheming that resulted in the infidelity and ultimate death of his wife, he finds solace in Sheilds and the two finally become close friends until the truth is finally unearthed.Kirk Douglas gives what is in my opinion his greatest performance as the selfish and scheming Jonathan Sheilds, especially in the scenes with Lana Turner. His power and emotion was so much deserving of the 1952 Oscar which finally went to Gary Cooper in High Noon.Although selfish and egotistical, hes not necessarily a bad man. He had his moments of kindness, he genuinely was remorseful over the death of Bartlow's wife and in an earlier scene, he speaks of how he wanted to make a star out of someone Hollywood had thrown onto the Ash pile. A boy who made good, wanting to give something back.He would lie, cheat, sacrifice and tread on anybody's heels to get his pictures on the screen, but he is not evil through and through, like most cinematic baddies and indeed like some of the real Hollywood producers who were out there at that time.Yet with all, thanks to Douglas' perfect performance, Jonathan Sheilds is destined to remain one of cinemas most loathsome and despicable characters ","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 2005","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" We all love movies.

My Theory.At the beginning of the film, there is a dinner table scene in which Donnie's sister mentions Donnie's medication. This scene lets us know that he is mentally unstable in some way. This is later described as paranoid schizophrenia.The night the plane crashes into Donnie's house is the 2nd Oct 1988.That night, Donnie gets out of bed and takes a walk. This is where he meets Frank, the giant bunny rabbit.This Frank, the one we see in this scene is in fact a ghost of the Frank we later see shot by Donnie. This ghost has come back through time to give Donnie a choice. He shows Donnie the future, right up until the moment he is sitting at the top of the cliff, watching the tornado (or portal).Everything you see, from the point of Donnie meeting Frank on October 2nd, to the day after halloween (the cliff scene) is in fact a vision that the ghost of Frank is showing him.At one point in the future (in this vision) Donnie is speaking to his science teacher about 'God's channel' and how you can not change the future events, no matter what you do. Donnie realises on the night of 2nd October, whilst Frank is showing him this vision, that what he is seeing (and what we assumed actually happens during the rest of the movie) is 'God's channel'. The ghost of Frank shows him the plane crashing into his house, which in fact happens roughly 6 hours after Donnie has taken his stroll to meet Frank; Donnie meeting Gretchin, the school flooding, Donnie burning Jim Cunnigham's house down, the halloween party, Gretchin being run over and Donnie killing Frank in revenge. Donnie knows that he has 2 choices. He can go back to bed and prevent all the above from happening (as he knows that there is no way to change what the future holds, as it is a pre-decided event), or he can take the path shown to him by Frank (the ghostly apparition).Frank is the only character in this film who engages in any type of 'time travel'. What is shown in the movie, from the moment Donnie first meets Frank, to the cliff scene is something that actually happened in reality, however what we are seeing as the viewers is in fact the vision Donnie is seeing that night (2nd October).Frank has gone back in time to prevent his own death. He knows, that by going back in time (as a ghost) he can let Donnie know what will happen had he gone 'sleep golfing' that night (thus preventing him from being in the house the night of the crash - thus taking the path Frank is showing him).The scene at the end of the film, where Donnie is lying in bed is a replacement to where he goes 'sleep golfing', like an alternate ending.The night he dies in the film (at the end), the 2nd October, is in fact the very same night you see him meet Frank(at the beginning) There is no time travel involved to take Donnie back to that night. The film leads us to believe that Donnie in fact followed 'God's channel' and flooded the school, burnt the house down, etc etc.Let's say that this is what happened before the film we saw started, a kind of prologue.* Donnie meets Frank (the person, as the film leads you to believe) *Donnie floods school, burns house down, has a halloween party, Gretchin gets killed and Donnie shoots Frank. *Frank as a ghost goes back in time Lets say that all the above happened in a part of the movie we did not see.(the prologue - not included in the film) This is where we see the film starting *Frank (the ghost) lures Donnie to the place they first meet. He tells Donnie all about the things that have happened(as above). Donnie see's it as the future. These were the scenes we saw as actually happening. Donnie in fact, does not go sleep-golfing that night. He goes back to bed.The scene we see at the end of the film, with Donnie in bed, laughing and being killed by the plane is in fact, only 6 hours after we first see him meet Frank.This is what I think actually happened *Donnie goes sleep walking and meets Frank. Frank shows him the future (the flooding of the school, etc etc) *Donnie prevents this all from happening by going back to bed, thus preventing all the following events.(The following events being the 'vision that Frank's ghost showed him that night, right up until he's back in bed laughing) The whole movie was set in one day. The dates flashing up on the screen, lead us to believe that the movie was progressing in time.However, these dates were just a reference point given to Donnie by Frank, on the 2nd October.If any of this is unclear, please let me know and I will do my best to clarify.

He goes back to bed.The scene we see at the end of the film, with Donnie in bed, laughing and being killed by the plane is in fact, only 6 hours after we first see him meet Frank.This is what I think actually happened *Donnie goes sleep walking and meets Frank. Frank shows him the future (the flooding of the school, etc etc) *Donnie prevents this all from happening by going back to bed, thus preventing all the following events.(The following events being the 'vision that Frank's ghost showed him that night, right up until he's back in bed laughing) The whole movie was set in one day. The dates flashing up on the screen, lead us to believe that the movie was progressing in time.However, these dates were just a reference point given to Donnie by Frank, on the 2nd October.If any of this is unclear, please let me know and I will do my best to clarify. Sorry for how long winded this theory is, but it's a pretty hard movie to make sense of.Discuss.

But a dark cloud comes over this happy occasion Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a man Kane sent to prison, is getting out and will be arriving in town on the noon train. It is 1035 AM at the moment and the movie unfolds in an approximation of real time. Waiting at the train station are Miller's boys, they all have one objective kill Kane.At first, Kane and Amy are going to just leave, but Kane feels that he owes the town one last defense. This goes against the pacifistic beliefs of Amy, who simply wants to leave town. Back in the town of Hadleyville, the citizens are divided over what should be Kane's course of action some think Kane should just leave and there won't be any trouble. Others want to see Kane gunned down because he cleaned up the town and they all lost money from when Miller ran things. One of those who wants Kane to leave is his former deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges), although not for any altruistic reason. Pell wants the sheriff's job and feels that it will impress his woman, Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado). Helen has had romantic dealings with both Kane and Miller and, from the looks of things, is constantly comparing Pell to these two men. This leads to a big fight between Pell and Kane and further isolates Kane from the situation.Kane tries to get help from the townspeople, but feel that it isn't exactly their problem anymore since Kane has resigned. As the time runs down and no one will stand with him, Kane is shown to be more human as the film progresses. This is also shown in one of the best shots in cinema history as Kane is shown alone on the streets of the town. The climactic shootout is a real nail-biter and a departure from the conventional way gunfights had been shown in Westerns up until then. Despite being deserted by the townspeople, Kane receives some help from a very unlikely source, which I feel heightens the situation even more. The movie's final image is now iconic.One might wonder why John Wayne didn't play a part like this. He had been approached, but thought that HIGH NOON didn't properly portray the true spirit of the Old West. He would later lament that he wished he could get a part like Kane when he presented Cooper with his second Best Actor Oscar.

The cast is excellent and the acting is without fault - Peter Yates certainly made the right choices as each actor brings their character to life so wonderfully. The only downside is that I later learnt from the DVD commentary that Lysette Anthony (Lyssa) had her voice dubbed by an older actress as Yates felt she sounded too young (and probably too British for American audiences).

Other posters have elucidated upon and discussed the musicology of it, and the significance of Chopin. I'll take their word for it, and not go there. That's out of my league. And, as others have noted, the film is an exploration and study of character, which it certainly is. All that and more. I see the film as being in its own way a period piece unto itself, the period being films made in the late 60s and early 70s. It is quintessentially representative of what was an important movie circa 1970. Of course the storyline of an alienated young man (Jack Nicholson as Robert Dupea), walking away from all that is expected of him, and indeed walking away --if not running away-- from his prodigious gifts, and doing it all with a cocky attitude, no longer resonates quite the way it did in 1970. But, if you weren't around in 1970, trust me, it resonated well then. It was a theme that seemed important and meaningful at the time, even though the character's motivations for his actions are never really explained and remain something of a blank slate for the viewer to fill in. In 1970, when the concept of an identity crises was big, it worked to just suggest and imply that Dupea felt the need to Quixotically search out and determine for himself what was important for him. That dovetailed with another important component in many movies of that era --you never explain yourself, because if you explain things, you trivialize it all and ruin it. Or, as Jenny, Ali McGraw's character in Love Story (also a 1970 film) put it, Love means never having to say you're sorry. Meanwhile, unfolding alongside the Dupea character, was Karen Black's tour de force performance as the big-haired clingy-dependent waitress girlfriend, Rayette, and doing it to a medley of apropos Tammy Wynette tunes. Karen Black's performance perfectly captured and spot-on nailed an almost ubiquitous sort of woman prevalent in that era, when the social changes wrought by the women's movement had not yet taken fruit.As for the notorious diner scene, this one scene essentially dominates the whole movie. It is something that people who have seen the movie will bring up and talk about, even decades later. Yet the scene is in no way pivotal or important to the story. At most it once and for all permanently affixes in the viewers' minds that Dupea was an impulsively flippant and angry person, not one to meekly abide any of life's minor frustrations. But we were already getting that picture of him before this scene happens. And, courtesy of Dupea, the scene provides a snippet of gratuitous social commentary about inflexibility and the stupidity of mindless adherence to meaningless rules. Something for the viewers to cheer and say, I can relate to that! Those things aside, to me the real value of the scene was that it provided an entertaining contrast in a bleak drama, a needed change of pace. But regardless of whether it was a statement about Dupea's attitude, or a social comment about stupid rules, or a needed amusing interlude, no matter which of those it is, its lasting impression renders its importance out of proportion to the movie as a whole. Surely, as he made this film, director Bob Rafelson's never intended that 35 years later this particular scene be the main thing viewers took away and remembered about the film. In this sense, as entertaining as it is, the scene therefore must be viewed as being a bit of a story-telling flaw. In retrospect, it should have been toned down just a skosh. But, then, on the other hand, were it not for this scene, perhaps the film would hardly be remembered at all.

I rushed out and got the soundtrack, and wore out the tape in 2 months. I love the story, and the in-joke sight gags. I laugh every time I see Lock, Shock, and Barrel (wink!), they remind me of my mom saying, Don't make that face, you'll stick like that! I also noticed that Santa has an industrial complex, and the Halloweens have to make their stuff by hand. Christmas Town was bright and shiny, but it seemed...a bit too slick. Their houses were all the same, but Jack's people had interesting houses that sometimes looked like their owners. I think the songs were great, they helped move some of the plot forward and explain things, instead of just having Phil Collins puke on everything. ( possible spoiler alert!!)

At that price and with a cast that included Sarah Polley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Ian Holm I figured, why not experiment? Unlike most of my video experiments I fell immediately into the story and really enjoyed the film. It is easy to watch and while Polley and Holm have small parts, Leigh is one screen for almost the entire film. Which is probably why she elected to do this instead of Eyes Wide Shut. Her co-star is Jude Law in what I would rate his all-time best performance.Although I was very impressed I don't recommend eXistenZ for everyone. It could be described as an anti-Matrix. Not in an intentional sense since they were being made at the same time, but rather in their respective target audiences. So if you seek it out because you really liked The Matrix, you may be disappointed.It has a fairly narrow target audience and because of this it was not aggressively distributed in the U.S. and did much better in Europe. Generally those who really connected to The Matrix will find it insufficiently manipulative (requiring too much viewer self-analysis and participation) while those who hated The Matrix will hate it for being too manipulative. So if you found Matrix generally intriguing but did not go ga-gah over it, you should make it a point to check out eXistenZ.It is not really sci-fi or action adventure but a psychological thriller (just as The Hole is not a horror film but a psychological thriller). It places Kurt Vonnegut's theme you are what you pretend to be so be careful what you pretend to be into an allegorical tale of shifting reality. Do we ever actually exercise free will? Does escaping from reality contribute to reality getting worse, in actuality or in our perception? You are meant to internalize this theme and to ask yourself these questions.My only real complaint is that the final twist (unlike the earlier twists) does not click into place when you first see in or later as you work backwards to find clues and foreshadowing elements that support this element. Without these the twist is silly and unnecessary. While it does not ruin all that has gone before it does seem like just a lame attempt to prepare the way for a sequel.

I watched it a couple of weeks ago and I laughed so many times AT it (rather than with it) that I was still trying to catch my breath hours later. I mean, really, Mr. Laughlin and his collaborators have to be the worst screenwriters in the history of the world (along with director). To be fair, the acting isn't terrible for the most part, though it isn't Oscar-worthy, but even the decent performances are ruined by such dialog as Life's been one big s*** brick for me up to this point and (my personal favorite) DAMN YOUR PACIFISM! How anyone could say those lines with a straight face is beyond me.Quite frankly, this movie is a blatant piece of hippie propaganda, railing against The Man, guns, Nixon, anti-Communism, the Vietnam War, the police, whites, and the Establishment. This is painfully aggravating at times (particularly the town hall meeting), though it does make for a few laughs, albeit most of them unintentional. The Committee's comedy scenes (particularly the almost-certainly ad-libbed robbery scene with the Sheriff) are rather stupid, though some manage to be funny to an extent. The townspeople are sleazy, bigoted rednecks (with a few exceptions), and Billy Jack simply can't practice what he preaches. The movie is chock full of violence, most of it precipitated by the pacifists. Nothing like a bunch of hypocritical hippies to make your day, eh?The funniest bits are the establishing scenes at the Freedom School, particularly when an actor playing Jesus gives the Black Power symbol on the cross. That had me ROTLFMAO for the next five minutes.And poor Martin, the little Indian punching bag! Over the course of the movie, he's punched in the stomach, falls off a horse and breaks his leg, hit in the stomach with an iron bar, and shot four times in the head.

If anyone tells you that those were magical, mystical times, show them this movie. It's almost hard to believe that MST3K skipped this one (though maybe it was because of the political content that they did).

In fact, as I think about it, it rests only behind Evil Dead and American Beauty for me.Of course, who now isn't familiar with this story? The Roman Legion General Maximus, Russel Crowe, is the main figure. The film follows his journey from General to slave to gladiator. It is also the story of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and his usurping of the throne of Emperor, as well as his knowledge of the people of Rome (the mob), and his lack of knowledge of politics. It follows the side-story of the planning to de-throne Commodus and restore the Republic that once was Rome.

The film announces its intention from the very beginning - 'This is the end...', the opening line of 'The End' by The Doors. A film that begins with that kind of irony is going to be some work, and so it is.Though based on 'Heart of Darkness', I think that the war is so brilliantly embedded in the film that its debt to Conrad is small.

Instead this has become one of my favourite all-time movies.This movie has everything; humour, action, emotion, and most of it of the highest calibre. Anita Mui strikes an excellent rapport with Chan, eclipsing the rather amateurish comedy we have come to expect from a man who is far superior a martial artist. However, the action does not suffer and the fight scenes really have to been seen to be believed.The final battle is truly epic and must go down as one of the greatest on-screen fights ever created. It contains everything with spectacular moves, well placed humour, and even a superb twist as Chan's character Wong Fei-hung is saved by the power of alcohol. Amazingly, Jackie Chan makes the feat of improving through consuming alcohol seem not just credible, but almost realistic. The rage and suppression of pain certainly are traits synonymous with heavy drinking. The musical score in the final fight brilliantly supports the action.If I did have any complaints, they were minor. The storyline is a little weak, but in amongst the relentless action and humour there really isn't any way you could see that being improved. Sometimes the acting is very goofy but that's part of the nature of the film. Perhaps the main bad guy is not really introduced enough before the last fight so his combat abilities are not really as fearsome as they could be. Also the way the movie ended felt a little rushed to me.All in all, this was superb. My main issue is that I don't speak Chinese so sadly had to watch a dubbed version. I would have loved to have been able to understand this movie with it's original script and voices. Still that's no reason not to watch what is, in my books, one of the greatest action movies of all time. How did I miss this for 11 years?

It is fun to see how the writer takes the blank slate of the robot's mind and has it learn and connect concepts. Johnny Five is as hilarious as any alien ever was. His fresh wise cracks and sense of humor are great, but are secondary to the excellent humor offered by the character Ben. This foreign (?) U.S. native, with his (unintentional?) misuse of the English language with a straight face, is my favorite comedic character in the movie.

I particularly loved the scene where Gene Wilder in in the basement with the dead body (legs hanging out) and the cops think the legs are Gene's. I thought I was going to have a heart attack there and then, the tears were rolling down my cheeks. Its a great film with a couple of real scary moments too! Highly recommended (as with all Gene Wilder films). I only found out recently that Gilda Radner died shortly after filming this movie. She was Gene's wife in the movie and in real life.

For the first time I found myself falling asleep in the cinema. The story line was boring as hell and it looked so good in the previews as well but I suppose its expected to see all the best bits in the previews when the rest of the film makes you die a little inside. However, I'm gonna be a bit fair and say that it's not all bad, there were some pretty good visual effects, the CGI has been used to some great effect, and the direction from Spielberg was good (as is the norm.). Still I thought this film was terrible and I don't say that about many films. In the words of the ever wise Bart Simpson, I can't believe I've found something that both sucks and blows at the same time.
