I knew that going into Child's Play 2, I was thinking two things at the time; 1. I knew it wasn't going to be better than the first one and 2. I knew that I was still going to love it.The story is quite solid as it is a straight-forward, very disturbing take on, where Andy is taken away from his mother, put into a foster home with an absurd woman named Joanne, her husband who is a twit called Phil and then the most coolest, absurd like teenager, Kyle. From here on, the Good Guy Doll company decide to remake the doll to prove there was nothing wrong with it at all. But once he's remade, the soul of evil mass-voodoo murderer, Charles Lee Ray comes back to life and seems to find poor little Andy, where he starts the terror again, only this time toying and torturing poor little Andy.I think that it was an excellent sequel. Even though it doesn't have the impact of the original, it still kept me in watch mode.The music score which becomes quite chilling and circus like by Graeme Revell is well scored and structured, where it is all paced well. Alex Vincent is Andy is still quite convincing and he seems to to still be in his roll, only though this time, his character seems to become more frustrated when no one believes him about Chucky trying to get him. The other actors all did an excellent job at their roles, very dramatic I must say.Although everyone was good, the real credit goes to Brad Dourif who pulled the voice off well. He seems to bring a more surreal humor to the doll this time, which I think is a nice touch as in the first one, he becomes quite scary and creepy. I also like how they made him look a bit different, to keep up with the time span (being two years apart).I also think setting it in a foster home and later a factory, doesn't strand too far away. Not like what Bride or Seed did, where they took the action everywhere. I think in order for a Chucky film to work, it has to remain in one or two places.One little problem I have is that this film, like the next three Chucky films do NOT have the impact like the first film. For some reason, I just loved the first film and I seem to always find myself watching that one the most. These sequels although done well, I just don't find them as memorable. But it really doesn't matter with Child's Play 2, because even though it doesn't reach the potential like the original, it generally works very well, where the viewer can become distressed because of what Chucky does to poor Andy in this one.Overall, a great sequel that has it's dark and disturbing moments.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 May 2012","score":"","review":" Watching Tom Holland's creepy doll classic, Child's Play was quite an excellent film, and till today it still holds up very well.

Even though the this film was released less than a year after it's predecessor, I still think it holds up well, and I disagree with the creators of the franchise that it is the least best of the Chucky films. I personally thought this was a much better take on than Bride and See because it still stood the test at being scary. Even though, there are a slight few problems with this sequel, I still like it for what it is.This film is supposedly set several years after the first two Child's Play films and focuses on Andy Barclay (now being played by Justin Whalin), going to a military school which is full of meat heads and gives the ol' grueling drills. Andy definitely does not fit in straight away. On the other side of the story, the Good Guy Doll factory after being a dead site is revived where the melted Chucky from the last film is remade by the hot melting plastic. Chucky comes back to life again, in a new body and kills off the toy maker's owner Mr. Sullivian. He then finds the location of Andy, and mails himself to the military site, where instead of going after Andy, he goes after Tyler. Andy seems to know everything while the others have no knowledge about what's going happening.I believe Child's Play 3 is another excellent entry in the killer doll franchise, and it's very underrated for a killer doll film.Starting off with some positives, I like the entire concept where Andy doesn't only have to face his fears of Chucky again, but he also has to deal with the nasty military school peers who bully and give him a hard time during the process. At first, I also thought that the military site and later on the carnival rides was a bit too the extreme but now I think it is pulled off well.The music score (although varying and different in tone and style) I feel worked quite well.Justin Whalin surprinsgly does a good job as Andy, where I felt sympathy for him. He truly brought the character back to prime source. Sure, he's no Alex Vincent, but he did well with what he was given. The others actors such as Travis fine, perry Reeves and Andrew Robinson were good in their roles.Once again, the entire credit goes to Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky, where he brings a dark sense of humor to him. He gives him a stalkerish, creepy personality where the doll is more nastier, more brutllaer and definitely mean spirited at best. The look of Chucky once again gets a plus because I like how they kept up with the times, to see what Good Guy Dolls would look like several years later. Chucky is more scary looking in this one.The kills like the 2nd film were also done at an excellent pace.There were a few problems to put out, but there aren't too many as I do like this sequel.1 The actor playing Tyler was awful. Really the worse actor in the film. He was definitely not convincing as a scared little boy and all he did was yell, be happy or just be silly. I'm not really sure how I took this, he was just horrible in this film.2 Once again, this film can not reach the impact or tension of the original. Like the film before it, it just seems to be some slasher fun which is dark and nasty. That's all.That's really the only problems I had with this film.

Newcomers may feel a little cold before seeing the film, feeling that, as they don't know the Powerpuff Universe, they won't get what's going on.It manages to satisfy both groups. The majority of animated television movie adaptations don't work either because they fail to take advantage of the movie possibilities and just exist as a feature-length episode (Hey Arnold, for instance), or strive too hard to do something different and end up being unrecognizable. This film does both, and handles it with extreme care. Something about it being a prequel to the show, no doubt...The show's visual style, simplistic and heavily styled 2D animation, is faithfully replicated here, although it is more layered and a little more detailed (CGI in a few places, that blends in very well), making for an experience that, even on DVD, would never get confused with an episode of the television show.But enough about that. More about the movie. In The City Of Townsville, a crime-ridden place, Professor Utonium decides to make a perfect little girl from sugar, spice, and everything nice (he's a single adult, you see). But a little accident involving a powerful chemical happens, and he gets three girls instead the brave and brass Blossom, the bright and bubbly Bubbles, and the bold and brick-tough Buttercup. Their first day of school doesn't go so well when a game of Tag demolishes have the city, leading them to be branded as bug- eyed freaks (One of a few occasions that shows that, as already seen in the show, most of the Townsville citizens are beyond stupid). When they stumble upon Mojo Jojo, a mutated chimpanzee also affected by a recent accident, and he rallies them to help the town and make it a better place so that they will be accepted (at least, that's what he tells them), the movie truly takes off.Despite looking simple compared to the Disney animated films, the animation has a charm all of it's own. Filled with little details that are bound to make you chuckle, smile and even laugh on a few occasions, it exists in a unique animated film bubble, no other quite like it that way.The movie is a superhero origin movie, although it does some interesting things with the formula, making it not as easy to notice as some other superhero origin films. The characters remain engaging and unique. The girls themselves evoke Keane paintings in their designs, and they resemble real children very clearly. They're often hyper and sometimes dangerously impulsive, yet they do learn, and have good instincts. And their contrasting personalities make for some witty kid dialog, ensuring only an asleep viewer would get the three mixed up, even apart from some visual distinctions. Professor manages to express a worried father character, even though he is briefly shelved during the movie's middle. Following that old maximum that the villain is more interesting then the hero, Mojo Jojo easily stands high on the world's list of animated villains. Although he is mostly serious in the movie as opposed to the the mix of serious and comedic in the show, he still amuses with his funnily repetitive dialog. It was wise, therefore, to make him the movie's only villain (although Fuzzy Lumpkins and The Gangreen Gang do make cameos), for not even Him would upstage Mojo.I don't think I've quite captured how downright fun the movie is. It's a lot of fun. It's style (both visual and script) does a good chunk of it, although credit must go to the voice actors (top-notch, particularly Roger L. Jackson as Mojo), musical score (courtesy of James L. Venable, who also composed the series' score - criminally, no soundtrack for this movie was ever released), and, of course, Craig McCracken, Powerpuff creator, who directed.It juxtaposes both it's humor and drama well. The movie's climax is notably gripping, and a plethora of monkey-related jokes resulting from Mojo's evil plan are bound to have adults begging for more.Granted, the movie's not perfect. The game of Tag, while wildly imaginative, does go on a bit too long, as does a particularly touching almost-silent scene in space. Apart from the five main players, the show's other characters get rather minor roles (Mayor and Ms. Bellum only appears five times, and Ms. Keane four - not to mention a lot of the show's villains neglected), which might disappoint the fans a little. And although I found it fun, it's sense of humor and style isn't go to appeal to everyone.In the end, The Powerpuff Girls Movie makes for an incredibly entertaining 74 minutes. Not an animated masterpiece, no, but an incredibly entertaining movie - and in a non-clichéd way.

Not an animated masterpiece, no, but an incredibly entertaining movie - and in a non-clichéd way. ","genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure"},{"date":"17 May 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" So much could have gone so wrong with this - and so much ended up going so right.Fans of Powerpuff Girls (and there are still a good chunk today, even though the show stopped almost eight years ago) should know what to expect from this outing. Newcomers may feel a little cold before seeing the film, feeling that, as they don't know the Powerpuff Universe, they won't get what's going on.It manages to satisfy both groups. The majority of animated television movie adaptations don't work either because they fail to take advantage of the movie possibilities and just exist as a feature-length episode (Hey Arnold, for instance), or strive too hard to do something different and end up being unrecognizable. This film does both, and handles it with extreme care. Something about it being a prequel to the show, no doubt...The show's visual style, simplistic and heavily styled 2D animation, is faithfully replicated here, although it is more layered and a little more detailed (CGI in a few places, that blends in very well), making for an experience that, even on DVD, would never get confused with an episode of the television show.But enough about that. More about the movie. In The City Of Townsville, a crime-ridden place, Professor Utonium decides to make a perfect little girl from sugar, spice, and everything nice (he's a single adult, you see). But a little accident involving a powerful chemical happens, and he gets three girls instead the brave and brass Blossom, the bright and bubbly Bubbles, and the bold and brick-tough Buttercup. Their first day of school doesn't go so well when a game of Tag demolishes have the city, leading them to be branded as bug- eyed freaks (One of a few occasions that shows that, as already seen in the show, most of the Townsville citizens are beyond stupid). When they stumble upon Mojo Jojo, a mutated chimpanzee also affected by a recent accident, and he rallies them to help the town and make it a better place so that they will be accepted (at least, that's what he tells them), the movie truly takes off.Despite looking simple compared to the Disney animated films, the animation has a charm all of it's own. Filled with little details that are bound to make you chuckle, smile and even laugh on a few occasions, it exists in a unique animated film bubble, no other quite like it that way.The movie is a superhero origin movie, although it does some interesting things with the formula, making it not as easy to notice as some other superhero origin films. The characters remain engaging and unique. The girls themselves evoke Keane paintings in their designs, and they resemble real children very clearly. They're often hyper and sometimes dangerously impulsive, yet they do learn, and have good instincts. And their contrasting personalities make for some witty kid dialog, ensuring only an asleep viewer would get the three mixed up, even apart from some visual distinctions. Professor manages to express a worried father character, even though he is briefly shelved during the movie's middle. Following that old maximum that the villain is more interesting then the hero, Mojo Jojo easily stands high on the world's list of animated villains. Although he is mostly serious in the movie as opposed to the the mix of serious and comedic in the show, he still amuses with his funnily repetitive dialog. It was wise, therefore, to make him the movie's only villain (although Fuzzy Lumpkins and The Gangreen Gang do make cameos), for not even Him would upstage Mojo.I don't think I've quite captured how downright fun the movie is. It's a lot of fun. It's style (both visual and script) does a good chunk of it, although credit must go to the voice actors (top-notch, particularly Roger L.

You get one of the most enjoyable and entertaining films of the late 80's, Road House. The film follows James Dalton (Patrick Swayze) a cooler (bouncer) and the best in the business, as he takes employment with Frank Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) the owner of the Double Deuce in Jasper, Missouri. The bar is the roughest in town and he needs Dalton to clean it up. However corrupt business man and crime boss Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) stands in his way. After the classic chick flick Dirty Dancing, Patrick Swayze was Hollywood gold. Women loved him and men wanted to be him. The film was full of romance. Then along came Road House, a complete opposite to Dirty Dancing, a little romance and loads of action. The film has a great cast including Patrick Swayze, Kevin Tighe, Ben Gazzara, Kelly Lynch, Marshall R. Teague, Red West, Kathleen Wilhoite, John William Young, John Doe, Kurt James Stefka, Keith David & Terry Funk. The cast works well together and it is full of great performances. Naturally Patrick Swayze at the height of his career stands miles apart from the rest of the cast as Dalton. A character that can hurt you with his words just as much as his fists. Tragically, 20 years later Swayze had his life cut short by cancer. His death is still a major loss to the entertainment industry, but his legacy will live on in the great performances and memorable characters he played. The film also a features a great performance by the late great blues guitarist Jeff Healey as Cody. It's the music in the film that goes a long way to achieving the right feel for the film. Everything works well from the characters, the music to the setting. Set in a rural area the scenery is breath-taking and it is used to great effect. But it's the fight choreography that stands out from many other films. Great bar fights are pretty much a thing of the past, but here they are full of action and humour just like the classic westerns. The one on one fights are brutal, mainly for the realism they portray. The script is awesome and full of classic lines mainly from Dalton and although many are cheesy, when he says it, it feels right. The director surprisingly hasn't made many films but the ones I have seen of his I really like and I know I am in the minority. See my review of Gladiator (1992) for more by this director. This is truly a great film, although very underrated. It is also one of my personal all-time favourites. There are a couple of versions of this so ensure that you see the USA or UK version released after 2002 as these are the uncut editions.

With this one, I think that it followed the story of the first faithfully well, which is why I think that this will always be recommended to Harry Potter fans.Also, I can't analyze the book to the movie because since this was being directed by Chris Columbus, the guy who gave us Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire, this is a truly amazing film and a compelling start to a completed franchise.The cast is amazing. I liked how Professor Dumbledore was portrayed and his personality really shows. All of the other characters, including Hagrid, Professor McGonnagal, Professor Snape, Professor Quirell, Ron and Hermione were fantastic and were just exactly as I expected them to be from the books. The acting that made the characters so likable are charming and fun. Personally, I think that Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson steal the show because of their amazing interaction\/bond with each other.Everything else was fantastic. The visuals are amazing and I liked the look of Privet Drive, the Platform Nine and Three Quarters express, and Hogwarts and were exactly like I pictured them from the book. It also has some great special effects from the great Industrial Light & Magic company and some of them fitted well, especially the Quidditch scene.

Seeing Steve in the wheelchair while Michael takes extreme delight in wooing Glenne was a riot! Caine sporting a German accent (playing Dr. Shauffhausen) and whipping the crap out of poor Martin's legs with a switch had me in stitches! I honestly didn't know that Caine was so good with comedy. And his German (and later Australian) accents were perfect! Martin was great with the physical comedy (as always) but Caine really stole the show with his sophisticated and cunning demeanor.The film was also photographed beautifully by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus (who shot AIR FORCE ONE and a bunch of Scorcese films) and the French Riviera is just an extra added bonus. Especially for an avid Bond lover like myself. I just love that whole elegant vibe of the South of France. Casinos, warm weather, palm trees, beaches, expensive villas, luxury yachts. Great stuff! The twist ending totally took me by surprise. Definitely did not see it coming. I won't even talk about it. Brilliant twist!! I even listened to the Frank Oz commentary. I really appreciated that he basically made this film as an homage to those classic 50s\/60s caper films. You typically don't associate Steve Martin with those types of films.

This is the first movie that I ever saw Guy Pearce in, and I fell in love with his acting ability. Kim Basinger is great too, and her acting is ironically understated. I lived in L.A. for quite some number of years, but this is an L.A. that I'm not really used to; but definitely like. There is a really strong visual component to the movie. Very vivid.

He's likable, as is usual with John's characters, portraying zestful youth and who is basically a good guy.Joan plays his sister, which is a minor role but she still shines. The basic story is that Lloyd sits next to Ione Skye (who came up with these names?), a pretty Diane Court, who her father James, (John Mahoney, Martin Crane, Dad in Frasier) calls 'Prissy'.He's a bit old fashioned and understandably protective and wonders if Lloyd as Prissy's boyfriend would be any better than any of the others. There's some great chemistry between the leads, dating in cars and 'hanging out' together that reminds one of more youthful days (in my case!) and is all quietly uplifting. There's also that juicy complication used in modern rom-comes - Prissy is off to England, to study, adding dilemma and complications all round.That part works well. The sideline about James and his embezzling was a surprisingly effective one, that added meat to the bones and made the film more rounded and helped us to understand his protective nature. That it's Mahoney, a superb actor and making it look so easy, helped enormously.Cameron Crowe's film, apparently never made it into cinemas in the U.K. Heaven alone knows why not, considering the utter dross that does.Say Anything is probably considered a minor film and whilst it's not great and won't be remembered as much as some, it certainly was an enjoyable little movie. My advice is to catch it on TV, where I saw it, on Sky Movies and if you like it enough....

The action scenes could have been better, and I could do without Raindrops and I don't think the movie would suffer at all without it, but you could find a hundred films where music (or dialogue) that doesn't match the period or genre is used. A great example of this would be the final scene in Dirty Dancing. The filmmakers are asking you to suspend reality, go with it! This is just a great buddy movie. Newman and Redford being the ultimate buddies. It's a lot of fun, without the cheesy happy Hollywood ending that we would get if this were made today.Although today, somehow Butch and Sundance would have survived to make the sequel.
