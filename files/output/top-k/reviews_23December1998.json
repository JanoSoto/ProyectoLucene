Brenda Blethlyn is great -- incredibly funny in an absolutely awful character.  Michael Caine does as well as always, and Ewan McGregor is surprisingly good as a quiet chap.This movie does not shy away from uncomfortable moments, and has lots of scenes of people being as small and petty as they sometimes can be.

The movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the cinema experience.Call me crazy, but I have seen the film three times, and I intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed. I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that no-one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction.See it, and don't be put off because it is animated. You are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits! The bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the film, which is packed with laughs throughout.
