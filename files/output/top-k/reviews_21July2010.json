While the Vietnamese officials state that no prisoners of war are being held Colonel Braddock know's different, Braddock sneaks out of his hotel to question (well, more like threaten with a big knife actually) General Trau (James Hong) about prisoner of war whereabouts & gets all the answers he needs.

At one hour & forty minutes it's a little on the longish side & there's really not much plot here, the character's are paper thin with Braddock given no real reason as to why he wants to risk his own life trying to save some prisoners of war who might not even still be alive anyway rather than just get on with his own life back in the US. All the Vietnamese are seen as evil torturers & liars while the American character's are seen as heroic, patriotic & brave who are fighting some great evil. You know that sort of pro American 'we're right & everyone else is wrong' attitude I'm on about, don't you?Even the action is rather average & feels lazy, there are some cheap looking shoot-outs & rather wimpy explosions (just check that grenade going off when the Vietnamese truck hits the other one at the end & dislodges it) set nowhere in particular, it just looks like some random stretch of jungle. There's an OK car chase at a dock involving a lorry & Chuck does his Spider-Man impression by climbing up & down the front of a hotel. There's a bit of nudity but nothing lasting. This was actually shot at the same time as Missing in Action 2 The Beginning (1985) but Cannon decided that this was the better film & released it first which is why the sequel is actually a prequel (if you know what I mean).

The acting is average, Chuck Norris can't act & is pretty bad here.Missing in Action is an OK way to pass an hour & forty minutes but the lacklustre action scenes & a frighteningly wooden performance by Norris means it's nothing special & there are much better film that cover this subject like Rambo First Blood Part II.
