The sheer effort required to study every detail of every scene ensures that you just can't take your eyes away from the screen for a second in case you miss something. However...Without the reversal of the time line the movie is a low-key affair with some OK acting and artistic camera work Guy Pearce makes a passable hero and Joe Pantoliano obviously wishes his surname were Pesci instead.But after the final frame of the film I had that feeling of 'so what' which is the dread of every film fan - at least when you know a film is crap before you see it, you're never disappointed by it - occasionally you find that it's not as bad as you were told.But when a film is lauded as a landmark and voted into a top 10 placing as a result, you expect a little more. This film is a long way from crap though - the problem is that the concept IS the film and it can't quite carry the plot.

I also wanted to check out his son.I have watched and loved thriller, horror, mystery etc., etc. movies all of my life.  It's becoming increasingly rare that the newly-released ones have anything to offer to excite us old timers in the way of unique plots.  This movie was, however, one of those.  There are initially two seemingly different plots, each being investigated by two different detectives.  The first plot is a series of grisly, yet psychological murders of individuals from a bizarre university in the french alps.  The second involves a defacement of an old grave of a young girl, whose death and past are shrouded in mystery.  Gradually, the two loose ends are woven together resulting in a strange and fascinating story to be told.  Vincent Cassel is a natural and great actor.  Unlike so many other young, European leading men, he doesn't just exist in a movie to engage in macho posturing while appearing to be trying to hide a wounded past, affecting a tough exterior and turning on European female viewers (a characterization that went out in the U.S. in the 70's).  He didn't even smoke!  His character was realistic and not overly psychoanalyzed like so many movie cops.  He was just a normal guy trying to crack a case, not trying to resolve his own past traumas by solving the crime. Jean Reno was the same and also didn't overplay the role, but seemed tired in the movie, although, to his credit, he was playing an older and experienced detective who was sort-of a legend or something.  Cassel seemed energetic and vibrant, especially when busting the heads of a couple of jerks who refuse to give evidence.  His two men were comic relief without going over the top, just seeming to lighten the mood a little when needed.The only weird thing was that Cassel's character was a serious, hard-boiled, no-nonsense cop in the beginning, but then became a kind-of twittery, childlike, sycophant when getting together with Reno.  He is supposed to be in awe of Reno's character and his reputation.  It's cool, though, because the change is unexpected and welcome; it makes Cassel's character appear more multi-faceted.Another great thing about this movie is that the end\/solution is totally unexpected.  I can usually always solve a mystery before the end of the movie, but I was dead wrong on this one!  It had a great plot twist, but made sense and came together as well.  It's one I can watch several times.

It is one of those movies that really shocks you with its violence, and begs for multiple viewings.The plot revolves around a group of thieves who are employed by a crime overlord (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn).  The casting of the thieves is superb, Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen both standing out immensely.  Basically, everything goes wrong, and we spend the entire movie figuring out what went wrong.  My question now is this, what happened to you Quentin?  I haven't seen his name on a movie since Jackie Brown came out like 5 years ago.  Oh well, I'm looking forward to Kill Bill whenever that comes out.A warning though...there is a Chow-Yun Fat movie called 'City on Fire', and I hate to say it, but the last 30 minutes of that movie are almost identical to those of Reservoir Dogs (what happens in those 30 minutes, not how it happens).  Yes, it includes a mexican standoff and the betrayal of one of the gang after a heist gone wrong b\\c he is an undercover cop, and this movie came out I think at least 5 years before Dogs.  Check it out if you want, though, it does kind of lessen a person's respect for Tarantino as it did mine, I still think the guy is a great writer and a good director nonetheless.  I do know that John Woo and other Chinese filmmakers were influencial to him (check out the direction in both the scene where Tim Roth unloads on Mr. Blonde and when Mr. White does a double handgun routine on a pair of misfortunate cops.  Both of these scenes scream of John Woo inspiration).  Anyway, overall, this is a dark and gritty movie.  The violence is extreme along with the profanity, so this will not be everyone's favorite movie.  This movie is more of a character study than anything else...there really isn't much plot and absolutely no messages in it at all, just good old fashioned entertainment.  Despite the rip-off I mentioned above, this is still one cool movie and will be here to stay for some time now as one of the leading cult films ever.  8\/10 stars.   Recommended.

When I first heard about the movie and then saw the previews I couldn't wait to see the film.  Then it came out and I saw it.  I truly believe now that I was in a state of denial.  I realized that it had it's share of problems, but didn't realize the severity of the situation.  Now I must concede that this film really is a terrible film. Although, the overall, broad story is a good idea, just done VERY badly.I love the idea of an alien race coming to our planet and taking it over. I also love the idea that they are so far advanced that they could take over our planet in minutes and nearly wipe out the entire human race.  Good idea, good sci-fi.I'm not really sure who is to blame here, I'm sure the fault lies in a lot of people.  I would tend to blame the director, Roger Christian, but I haven't seen any of his other directorial efforts, so I have no frame of reference.  The editing is just god-awful in this film.  What moron decided to have that wiping transition every 10 seconds?  Seriously, fire that guy\/girl!!!  I also think that the screen-writers are major players in this film being so bad.  The dialogue was just horrible throughout the film. Why did they say man animals and rat-brain all the time.  If you are translating the Psychlo's language, you don't need to make up new phrases to help the viewer understand.  And what the hell is with that name Psychlo???  Good god, that is, hand-down, no contest, the STUPIDEST name I've ever heard for an alien race!!!  ...And of course, I'm sure that L. Ron Hubbard deserves a good part of the blame, although in his defense, I haven't read the book, so perhaps the book is better than the film and actually makes a little more sense.  Well, obviously there is a lot of people to blame for this film being so bad.A number of people have said that the special effects were terrible. Really?  Terrible?  Nah, they weren't bad at all, in fact sometimes they were out-right fantastic!  The ships flying through the air were excellent and the dog fights between the Alien ships and Human Fighter planes were awesome.  Also, there's the huge dome collapsing at the end of the film. Very cool!I didn't think the acting was all that bad in the film.  I thought the characters and the dialogue were terrible, but the acting was fine.  John Travolta did a pretty good job, as did Forest Whitaker as the antagonists in the film.  Although, I have to say that John Travolta's voice just didn't work, it wasn't menacing enough.  Barry Pepper, Kim Coates and Richard Tyson did decent jobs too, given the material.  So, I'm not going to put any of them at fault.  Kelly Preston also has a very tiny role in the film, very useless to the story, but she was somewhat interesting to see on the screen as a Psychlo.Also, I feel I should say something about the make-up effects.  Sometimes they were pretty impressive, and at others they were horrible.  The make-up on John Travolta and Forest Whitaker were both pretty good, a lot of the other Psychlos had some serious problems.  I was really impressed with how well they made the aliens look so much bigger than the humans.  I don't know how they did it, but I thought they did an excellent job in that respect.All in all, I would have a very hard time recommending this film to anyone. The only reason to see this is some cool special effects, make-up effects, and a few other miscellaneous neat things to look at.  Unless you're determined to see this film despite it's unbelievably low rating on this site, then I'd recommend you watch something else.

Thanks for reading,-Chris ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"8 December 2002","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*Well... I just finished watching this film on IFC a few minutes ago... and I can imagine it will stay with me for awhile.  To sum it up, this film is like a sucker punch to the gut.  It manages to bring to light issues like child abuse and its effects on a family, as well as the hardships of poverty.  Yes, this film is disgusting, but I don't mean that in a bad way.  It's just so real.... you usually don't see these issues being covered upon in movies.  Unfortunately, things like this happen all the time and those of us who haven't experienced such horror will feel lucky.  The things that poor little Bone had to go through would probably make war veterns shudder.  On the other hand, Anney is the kind of character that will anger most viewers... you find yourself thinking, how could she be so stupid, naive and selfish?  Unfortunately, there are many women like that... and as Raylene says to Bone near the end of the film, we'll never understand why some women have to even contemplate choosing between their baby and their lover.  This film touched me in a way no other film had since the first time I viewed Todd Solondz's Happiness.  There are some people out there who will not be able to stomach what is in this movie, but keep in mind this film is NOT exploitative; it is informative.  The most disturbing part of this film is that it's not graphic (not counting the couple of brutal violent scenes among adults)... for example, in one scene, Glen asks Bone to sit up front with him, and eventually he lifts her up to sit on his lap. At first, we aren't quite sure what's going on, but after a few seconds, it's obvious... it's all in their expressions.  There isn't much nudity in this film, and I'm glad; Anjelica Huston realized she could still make a film with a strong impact without having to be sexually explicit.  Of course a film like this needs strong performances to work... and thankfully, the actors were up to the task.  I knew Jena Malone had a promising career, but now that I've seen this, I won't be surprised if she wins an Oscar someday. I've never seen such a heartbreaking, intense and powerful performance by an actress who was so young at the time.  This role must have been extremely difficult for her, but she nailed it.  She made us care about her character; something few child actors are able to do.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is also excellent as Bone's loving, but extremely confused mother.  Anney is the type of character who just needs to have a man and it seems she's cursed in that way; Bone's father ran off on her, and then Lyle (whom Bone loved and seemed to be a great guy) was killed in a fatal accident.  Basically, Glen is the only man she can have, but he hates Bone; she realizes this, which is why she chose him over her own daughter.  Unfortunately, Anney doesn't realize that she doesn't need a man... all she needs is her family. Anyway, all I can say is that I highly reccomend this film.  It will move you, and disturb you... it'll be stuck in your head for days.10\/10 - HIGHLY reccomended!

I don't have a lot in common with him, but this one movie opened up lots of opportunities for other movies.Other than that, I love this movie for its unique point of view. We always get the movies like Saving Private Ryan or Pearl Harbor, which are very important stories in themselves (and good movies of course) but how often do we get a movie about people who were part of the war from the beginning. people that didn't necessarily have a direct threat, but were still greatly affected. The story of Peter and Thomas and Arvid are wonderfully done. Peter is the kind of person any girl would like. Thomas, the rich brat that speaks his mind too much, helps put internal conflict in the group. Arvid seems to be the voice of reason, seeing what the Nazis are doing and doesn't want to be a part of it.The acting is great, of course. Peter, played by Robert Sean Leonard, is portrayed as soft spoken, confused, and even a little bitter. Thomas, played by the beautiful Christian Bale, is the kind of people that drive me nuts - just go along with it. We can have it both ways. It is virtually impossible to have it both ways. The guy who plays Arvid is a lovely actor, obviously talented, and shows emotion so well you'd think he went through this himself. The history of the movie might be a little tweaked to make a few interesting scenes, but to see what the Nazis were doing to the youth of their country, brainwashing them and telling them to spy on people, is appalling. No wonder a few former Nazi soldiers still think they were right.The music is like a whole nother character. This movie is what really got me to enjoy listening to swing music. Even though I can do very few steps, I realize now the feeling they got when they heard it and I get the same feeling, just not quite as strong probably.All around, this movie is wonderful.

Secondly, ALL of the actors in this movie did a BRILLIANT job. I think Dennis portraid a brilliant character, a little insane, but a great character, I won't go into too much info about how great his acting was, because he admitted he gets a bit spooked when people say he was great in his movies(also mentioning this movie). Caroline Williams; Wow! A brilliant actress that brought courage, sexiness and humour to the film, and that's just talking about the character she played! Bill Moseley; What a hoot! Great guy. I've talked to him a few times, and he is great. Great humour and...a weird prescence he delivers. Jim Siedow, I have to say I prefer him in this movie compared to the first. 1) He has more dialouge, 2) His character has a name, 3) His character has a lot more meaning. And Bill Johnson, he delivered a great threatning role as Leatherface. Great job done. When I taped this film, they cut out all of the good scenes, you could even see where there were cut scenes, it missed out when Stretch was cornered by Leatherface and he pressed his chainsaw against her thigh, it missed where ChopTop, Leatherface and Drayton slaughtered a gang of yuppies in a parking lot, and where Leatherface slaughters Joe Bob Briggs. I've bought the movie on video casette for Xmas, so hopefully those scenes will appear. Great film, and I can't wait to see the remake of the first.

I actually love a few of them, such as Jackass, but this movie has to be one of the worst I have ever seen.  I didn't laugh at ONE JOKE!  This coming from someone who enjoys comedies.  Not one laugh.  Don't listen to these people who are praising this movie because they either a) set VERY VERY low standards or b) are mentally challenged.  Pass this one up.
