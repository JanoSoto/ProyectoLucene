Normally, my reviews consist of multiple paragraphs, summarizing the plot and my thoughts on the film. This time I want to give five reasons why Schindler's List was easily one of the most powerful and breathtaking motion pictures I've ever seen. It goes above and beyond anyone's expectation, and cements itself on the list of greatest films of all time. Here's why.1. Acting. No one could write about Schindler's List and not talk about Liam Neeson's Oscar worthy performance as Oskar Schindler, the business man from Czechoslovakia. He plays it with power and full force, grade A acting. Still shocked his leading performance didn't win him the Oscar in 1994.2. Storyline. Instead of focusing on one of the survivors, or a fictional story for that matter, Spielberg chooses to focus on Oskar Schindler, a rather unsung chapter and character of The Holocaust. Oskar Schindler worked for the Nazis, and is famous for using his great wealth to buy hundreds of Jews to make them work in his factory. It wasn't much, but it prevented death, and they would make bowls for the Nazis. Even though the film goes into a subject, some may not know, the storyline is definitely one of the strongest points.3. The end sequence. I don't want to ruin the final scenes in the film, but let's just say, it's one of the most effective and well done scenes in film history.4. The film's desire to show it all. When Holocaust movies are made, so try to water the film down by not showing the terrible treatment of innocent Jews. This one doesn't. Despite the event being gruesome, tasteless, and ignorant, no movie should subject itself to water down the scenes. Unless it's PG-13, and I doubt many Holocaust movies are. Schindler's List isn't all about the gas chambers and things most of us already know. We witness two of the worst things possible; (1) innocent people taken out to the yard and being shot in the head with absolutely no feeling on the guard's part and (2) we see the heart-wrenching scenes of peoples belonging getting tossed off balconies like garbage. That part I almost couldn't bear to watch.5. The complete carelessness for human life. Face it, the Jews and many other races were dehumanized come time of The Holocaust. Life didn't matter to anybody. You could tell a Nazi officer that you just killed sixty thousand Jews in one day and they wouldn't flinch, yell, smile, or object. They would say Good work. They wouldn't take into consideration you just killed sixty thousand mothers, father, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and worst of all, children of both sexes. One scene in the film, right before a woman is shot in the head, the camera zooms in on her to show her frightened reactions, her pale face, and her clearly nervous behavior. Spielberg most likely did that to remind viewers that the victims in this movie were people and they were innocent people with their own feelings in life. Dehumanization lived in The Holocaust.Schindler's List currently ranks number nine on the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of one hundred greatest American films ever made. I am a firm believer that if this wasn't in Spielberg's hands, it wouldn't touch that list. Thankfully, we get one down to Earth and very vibrant Holocaust movies that manages to accomplish what it should. Just an all around amazing film.Starring Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagall, and Embeth Davidtz. Directed by Steven Spielberg.

Wyman was always good and always INTERESTING. She held the camera. No doubt about that. Was she a great actress? Did she ever get a script that let her PROVE she was? It's arguable.But here I think she truly WAS. Line for line, this is fairly pedestrian material. (I let others make my decisions for me.) Each scene, like a string of pearls, is well-constructed. The plot too contains emotional conflicts and arcs that sustain the whole and reward us in the end.But the lines themselves? In lesser hands the entire enterprise would have laughably bombed.The supporting cast is top-notch. They ALL know their way around a line. Especially Agnes Moorehead and Jacqueline de Wit.Even the early Rock Hudson, another star not known for impressive acting chops, who later found his REAL niche in light comedies with Doris Day, in which he was terrific, shines here. What he's asked to do he does naturally, easily, sincerely and affectingly. His sexual heat, jaw-dropping good looks, that voice and, yes, manliness, were perhaps never before or afterward captured so effectively on screen.But All That Heaven Allows is Jane Wyman's picture all the way, and she's heavenly in all of it.Though everything she does looks unstudied and completely naturalistic, hers is a consummate technical display of film acting on the highest level.Listen to her vocal inflections alone. Completely naturalistic. Except dramatically varied and supported by heightened emotion that is anything but natural and is all art. (She could also sing, and sing well.) Watch her movements. Same thing. All in character, not an ounce of phoniness. But so precise, economical and scaled for the camera that, again, you're watching the art of a well-trained professional performing at a high level.Then, watch her amazing close-ups. You can read her every thought and emotion and reaction -- widely varying throughout the emotional plot arcs -- without her saying a word. Without an ounce of overplaying.Her seeming simplicity here, as an artist, an actress, is so focused yet subtle that she pulls you in and holds you completely every moment she's on screen.That, without being a natural or classic beauty like Lana Turner or Elizabeth Taylor, and without the aggressive showiness of actresses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford or Katharine Hepburn.The script doesn't offer Wyman the histrionic fireworks of more flamboyant roles given some other actresses.But the layered richness and honesty of Wyman's performance here is the central achievement that keeps you returning to All That Heaven Allows again and again.Yes, it's a great performance.

What compels repeated viewings, though, is Jane Wyman's amazing accomplishment here. Especially compared to Sirk's subsequent sudsy masterpiece featuring Lana Turner, Imitation of Life. Wyman was always good and always INTERESTING. She held the camera. No doubt about that. Was she a great actress? Did she ever get a script that let her PROVE she was? It's arguable.But here I think she truly WAS. Line for line, this is fairly pedestrian material. (I let others make my decisions for me.) Each scene, like a string of pearls, is well-constructed. The plot too contains emotional conflicts and arcs that sustain the whole and reward us in the end.But the lines themselves? In lesser hands the entire enterprise would have laughably bombed.The supporting cast is top-notch. They ALL know their way around a line.

The story is a fairly simple tale of time travel that ends with a sufficient number of twists and turns to make it interesting and to keep the audience guessing. The execution of that story on the other hand left me unsatisfied. There were certain aspects of the movie and specifically themes that I wish the director emphasized more. The idea that Cole could have been crazy and that everything was just in his head was barely touched upon and when it was it seemed like it was tacked on. I thought that one of the main ideas was that Cole could not change the past and that we would be forced to live the nightmare over and over again was not emphasized enough. Instead of making sure that the themes emerged it seems that Gilliam decided to focus on more visually inventive aspects of the movie. I did enjoy the design of the future, but it was too stylized for it to fit the rest of the story. The present wasn't overly stylized so it did not seem like the future fit into the same universe as the present.The acting was really good and I really enjoyed watching Brad Pitt play against type. Willis was good, but there was nothing special. Stowe on the other hand I thought was perfect. She was sympathetic all the while being strong willed.

Fincher really did do a fantastic job of putting together a well-paced and surprisingly thought provoking movie. Morgan Freeman is the constant in the movie that never allows the viewer to lose hope that the situation is not hopeless, while keeping the viewer cynical enough to make the city that they live in a land of misguided hopeless souls. Freeman has such brevity that is really just amazing to watch him. Pitt on the other hand does a very respectful job of being the young cop with ambitions of saving the world and has places well across from the jaded Freeman. Spacey of course played his character spot on and when he gives himself on is probably the creepiest thing in the movie because at this point you have no idea what he is up to, but you know that is is in total control of the situation. I love how Fincher choose to keep the city raining and lit most of the scenes to emphasize the dark. This matched the darkness nature of the film perfectly. The fact that the last scenes was in the bright day light just made it that more shocking. One can tell that a lot of care when into presenting the world to the viewer in a way that matched the themes perfectly.I think that car ride provided a great forum for us to get to know John Doe even though we only spend a few minutes we seems to know him so well.

One can tell that a lot of care when into presenting the world to the viewer in a way that matched the themes perfectly.I think that car ride provided a great forum for us to get to know John Doe even though we only spend a few minutes we seems to know him so well. One can see Mills going down hill and is losing his footing on the moral high ground. It is extremely well played and I love how Summerset comes off as being a match for him. In a way I see Summerset and Doe as being similar, with the main difference of Doe being crazy. I think this is an extremely well done and smart entry of crime dramas that really flips some of the conventions in a way that can be surprising. The fact that they do not catch the killer, but the killer turns himself in and that fact that the cops lose. They do not save anyone's lives and they fall into the trap that Doe set up for them. I very much enjoyed this film and it was paced and put together in a very effective way.

At first, the establishment of the main characters is clear and direct (if a bit one-dimensional) and the earthquakes at the beginning build quick suspense. But everything gets so muddled and there are some very major plot oversights... Namely WHAT volcano? That's probably what you'll be asking yourself the whole movie. Sure there's lava, ash, giant red hot rocks spewing up out of the earth, but it isn't exactly coming from a volcano. Early in the movie the geologists mention that volcanoes can spontaneously erupt out of fault lines or something, but it's such a passing statement that you have no idea if that's what's actually happening. Only at the end is it clarified with a zoomed-out photo of a brand new volcano in the middle of LA so I could only conclude that the volcano causing all this disaster is really the FORMATION of a volcano.This film does have its moments, and I was entertained throughout the movie and never bored. I thought the flow of lava was probably the best part of the movie - a red-hot stream that flows slow enough to run away from on foot, but devours everything in its path and can't be stopped. It definitely gave a sense of dread. In fact, most of the actual disaster parts of the film were pretty good. This movie falls apart with the characters. More and more minor characters are introduced as the film goes on, just to be killed off in dramatic fashion, culminating in a scene where two guys are trapped in a building about to be blown up, which I think was supposed to be touching, but all I could think was wait, who are these two people, and why do I care about them??. Then, there's the side plot with The Misjudged Black Guy and The Cop That Has It In For Him, which is nothing but distracting. And finally, we have the whole side plot with Tommy Lee Jones' character's daughter, which isn't really bad in itself, except that the character is so utterly helpless, stupid, whiny and useless for a 13-year-old. Though I guess those are the only traits that could possibly lead her character to end up in the path of an impending demolition because she had to chase after the small child she was supposed to be watching who ran off. The worst scene in the entire movie is when she emerges from the building right as the bomb is about to explode, and her dad is yelling at her to run away, but she just stands there like a deer in the headlights.

From McDowell's eerie iconic performance to the controversy over its supposedly pornographic violence to its satirical portrayal of governmental and civic abuse of liberty, this utterly genre-less work of sublimity remains one of those mystifying pinwheels of the cinema. Kubrick's painterly, insoluble kaleidoscope is most often explained as political satire, or dystopian sci-fi, or a crime drama, while its intersecting allure to the horror fan community is clearly pervasive. Though I don't pretend to entirely understand this film, I nevertheless find it profound and unique, especially in its loaded portrayal of the psychosomatic associations we make with music, or that music makes with us. A crucial musical instant in Kubrick's inspired carrying out of Anthony Burgess' inventive story comes when Alex bursts into song in the bath.He's just been beaten and almost killed by his former droogs who've been rehabilitated as policemen by manipulative judicial rule, looking to safeguard its society even if it has to confine them to do so.

While the nostalgic aspect of some of his historical flicks is completely absent, the sense of unrequited love, alienation, and tragic inefficacy of human communication are central themes.

The music is quite good.The main problem with Fallen Angels is that it is awfully difficult to feel a connection for the characters. The plot does not move forward with much intention and the disjointed mini vignettes were a detriment to getting the audience emotionally involved. The characters are very difficult to relate to The partner is a character that is drawn too sketchily and is not given enough dialog for the viewer to relate to deeply. The mute is meant to win us over with his innocent charm, but it is at times an overacted role which makes the character somewhat annoying. Blondie adds some comic relief (though also in an overacted manner) but is a bit easier to relate to and feel sorry for. Lastly, the killer is very apathetic about his life which does not endear the viewer to him. He is more cool than likable. Though that his inability to make decisions ultimately does not serve him well in life is a message that may resonate strongly with some viewers.

It was a unique experience inviting me to laugh, to contemplate, to meditate, while mirroring my own condition and carrying it, smoothly, quietly, unconsciously to a mysterious place that only I, could approach &#x85; and no one else. The Graduate became for me, the epitome of cinematic escapism forever graved in my memory ... hell, I even dreamed of it that very night! I know an academic analysis of The Graduate would cover many paragraphs relating the cultural impact of the film, its iconic status from the red Alfa Romeo to Mrs. Robinson 'seducing' legs, its politically incorrect tone that unsettled America's puritan morality on the breakthrough year of 1967, through the love affair between an awkward graduate and an alcoholic middle-aged cougar. So let's not spoil the extraordinary feeling with ordinary material. I was already aware about the film's status before, Wayne's World 2 and many episodes of The Simpsons 'spoiled' it for me &#x85; but it didn't ruin my experience nonetheless, because the enjoyment was elsewhere.The film is a timeless coming of age comedy with a dramatic approach denouncing in a light-hearted tone the emptiness of the bourgeois way of life, from the point of view of a young educated man, questioning his future, conscious of this superficiality. Ben was my hero. The contrast between the cheers and the congratulations of his parent's friends at his graduation's party and his uneasiness highlights this condition of a social pawn, only meant to reproduce his parent's shallow social model. Ben inspired me as the bourgeois version of the 'rebel without a cause'. At the time I watched the film, I was freshly graduated, I wanted something different too, and when my parents asked me 'why', I couldn't answer. This is Ben's trap and his affection for the fishes in his tanks underlines a sense of empathy, like when he's pushed to test his skin-diving outfit. Water would play a very symbolical role as the incarnation of this environment he can't escape from. 'Water' as the source of Ben's awkwardness and Mrs. Robinson his safety belt. Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft create the perfect contrast between two attitudes, lucidity and inexperience, providing an excellent mix of visual and verbal humor in the first act.The prologue breaks with the 'act' illustrated by the vision of Ben floating on his rubber raft, in the swimming pool. He's floating this time, dominating the allegoric water with Simon and Garfunkel's mesmerizing sound. His love affair became a routine as both help each other to fill the meaningless of their lives and during this long musical sequence, Ben aimlessly contemplates his life, unaware that he's still going nowhere ... like contaminated by the contemptuous idleness typical of the upper class. Finally, pushed by his parents, Ben is forced to date Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine, he slides off the raft and goes underwater again, trapped again. But the trap hides a revelation; Ben falls in love with Elaine making Mrs. Robinson an enemy on a symbolically rainy day and ultimately loses Elaine.But Ben found the true meaning of his life and will follow her till Berkley. A romantic stalking poetically conducted by the beautiful Scarborough Fair song and providing the second wave of jokes in the film after a dramatic part. In the beginning, the contrasts were between Ben's popularity and the perversity of his actions while in the last act, the comic of opposition, is driven by Ben getting more and more disrespected and hated only to fulfill a romantic dream ... but being loved by Elaine is worth being hated by the whole world, and he understands that even Elaine lives the same dilemma. She's not indifferent, she's almost convinced, she kisses Ben ... and even the mood of the songs changes. I still whistle the iconic rhythm of Mrs. Robinson whenever I'm in an enthusiastic mood and this song is the one I immediately associate with audacity, youth, and this mix of craziness that drive our lives like we drive an Alfa Romeo till the last drop of gas.One must wonder why it worked though, why she accepted to be 'kidnapped' from the church in the iconic climax ... in real life, if you screamed Elaaaaaaine while hitting a big glass, would you hear a strident Beeeeeen! crying for your help ? I don't know, but without this climax, the movie would have been guilty of seriousness. The Graduate is an escapism pushed to the extreme limit of a fantasy. This is probably why it gained more criticism by mature critics ... I even suspect Ebert of having been too influenced by Kael who disliked the manipulative aspect of the film as soon as Ben became a hero, and Mrs. Robinson a villain. I think this is precisely the dimension I was mentioning in the beginning. It's an escapist movie for people who identify with this youth who don't know what life is about, it's a hymn for immaturity, for this excitement that makes life enjoyable, freedom to make our own mistakes, believing that it's never 'too late'... that's the inspiring spirit of The Graduate!

A romantic stalking poetically conducted by the beautiful Scarborough Fair song and providing the second wave of jokes in the film after a dramatic part. In the beginning, the contrasts were between Ben's popularity and the perversity of his actions while in the last act, the comic of opposition, is driven by Ben getting more and more disrespected and hated only to fulfill a romantic dream ... but being loved by Elaine is worth being hated by the whole world, and he understands that even Elaine lives the same dilemma. She's not indifferent, she's almost convinced, she kisses Ben ... and even the mood of the songs changes. I still whistle the iconic rhythm of Mrs. Robinson whenever I'm in an enthusiastic mood and this song is the one I immediately associate with audacity, youth, and this mix of craziness that drive our lives like we drive an Alfa Romeo till the last drop of gas.One must wonder why it worked though, why she accepted to be 'kidnapped' from the church in the iconic climax ... in real life, if you screamed Elaaaaaaine while hitting a big glass, would you hear a strident Beeeeeen! crying for your help ? I don't know, but without this climax, the movie would have been guilty of seriousness. The Graduate is an escapism pushed to the extreme limit of a fantasy. This is probably why it gained more criticism by mature critics ... I even suspect Ebert of having been too influenced by Kael who disliked the manipulative aspect of the film as soon as Ben became a hero, and Mrs. Robinson a villain. I think this is precisely the dimension I was mentioning in the beginning. It's an escapist movie for people who identify with this youth who don't know what life is about, it's a hymn for immaturity, for this excitement that makes life enjoyable, freedom to make our own mistakes, believing that it's never 'too late'... that's the inspiring spirit of The Graduate! And this enigmatic smile at the end while they're together in the bus, says as much as Mona Lisa for the painting Art what are they thinking, are they happy, are they regretting ... I think they're just floating but not in a raft trapped in a swimming pool, in a bus that follows a direction ... which one? Who cares? At least it's going somewhere, so just let yourself transported ... within ... the sound ... of ... Simon ... ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"}]
