A swordsman who wins over 100 duels in his life, his first beginning at the age of 13, and by his twenties maintains the handicap of using a wooden blade. Yet the tale of Miyomoto Musashi is one that I have not seen put to film. The world is full of people who tell us what we can not know, yet whether or not they are as wise as they may believe themselves, I have yet to see anyone argue another's ignorance as convincingly or as wittily as Socrates (and with a crucial difference, by first asking what they know, and actually listening to how they think they know it) -- or for as noble a purpose. So when I found that a movie had been made about one of my heroes, I was very eager to see what it amounted to.I assume that either Matthew Broderick or his mother (or both) who wrote the screen play, must also have been a fan of Feynman. I wouldn't suppose to know everything about Feynman, but I have made an effort to learn everything that I could. I have read his books, looked through his Wikipedia and looked at just about everything I could track down that had anything to do with him.For me, as a physics student, the appeal of Feynman is mistranslated in the movie. He of course, was no ordinary genius, but how he accomplished what he did was as important (to the niche audience) as what he did, and the how seemed to be missing. Feynman developed his capacity for mental math during the Manhattan project via competition with Hans Bethe, and the development is key. The abacus scene was terrible for several reasons, some of them outlined in other reviews, chiefly for misrepresenting Feynman's personality. However the scene also sold out the accessibility of intelligence as something unique to certain individuals, that this was something 'natural' to Feynman. Feynman's IQ was measured at 125, which is supposed to be 15 points below the average PhD. Now, I'm not going to argue about the validity of IQ testing, one of the major personality traits the film wasn't able to touch on was of Feynman's insistence that people were incapable of measuring the aptitude of others' with tests. This low score however, was what is truly inspiring about Richard Feynman, that he never claimed to be more than a normal man. All his ability came from work driven by passion and love. Feynman wasn't a Japanese 4 year old who could speak 5 languages and solve Rubick's cubes blindfolded in 7 seconds. He was a lover of life and of learning, and it was his passion that motivated him to work hard, and his love that drove him to never give up and believe he could accomplish anything anyone else could. The real lesson of Feynman is that anyone can reach for greatness, and with drive and effort and luck attain it too. The Feynman story is one that allows us all to believe in ourselves, not one that should make us feel intimidated or insignificant. When Feynman can beat the abacus man at 18 with no background story of how his abilities came to be, it is far less inspiring.The performances were satisfying, but the story development seemed rushed, especially in the beginning. There was plenty of room for drama in the competition for Arlene with Feynman's old friend Howard without the need to throw in so many anecdotes that disrupt his life's true time line. I think that if you go through the books Feynman wrote only once, you miss how truly stressed Arlene's diminishing health made him. He was in many ways a subtle man, and private. When Feynman writes, I feel like he blindsides his readers from ever detecting how much he was hiding from them, with the sheer vulnerability he subjects himself to with his honesty. You can't see what hes not saying because he has already surprised you with the courage to say so much more than most people will admit to. To know how he was really feeling I think requires reading between the lines. When Feynman sees the dress, it is a total breakdown, it is overwhelming. In everything Feynman ever wrote, that was the only time he ever confessed it was too much. I can hardly think of the scene depicted in his books without coming to tears, even now. The story of he and Arlene really is, as another reviewer put it, one of the greatest real love stories I have ever heard of.I don't know much about movies, and I understand there are limitations. You can't fit everything into 90 minutes and the book is always better. I would be curious to hear Mr. Broderick explain why he went the way he did with certain aspects of the film. I certainly couldn't comment on whether writing, acting, and directing simultaneously would have been too much. If the film gets anyone to go and look up Richard Feynman, I think it will have served its purpose.

This film helped save talkie pictures and audible performances, and helped put Director Frank Capra, as well as stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert on the map. With that aside, I never really thought it was that funny.Don't get me wrong; it has its place in cinematic history, and it is an important step in the branching path in the evolution of cinema as an art form. But I never particularly found that much to be funny about this movie, and while it is subjective, the film is a Comedy, and humor is a key element of any given Comedy. There are a few scenes that worked though, particularly the hitchhiking scene. Essentially, Clark Gable was trying to hitch a ride for him and Claudette Colbert to this large group of cars driving by, and Gable tries everything in the book to signal them, and they all ignore them. And then when Colbert gives it a try to another passerby, she shows off her bare leg to him, and he stops and picks them up. There's more that follows later in that scene, but I don't want to spoil the rest because it is a pretty ridiculous series of events.Speaking of spoiling the movie, what is it about? Well, Claudette Colbert is a spoiled, rotten little rich girl named Ellie Andrews that runs away from a wedding to a rich aristocrat and goes out on a ram. Meanwhile, Clark Gable is second-rate reporter Peter Warne that found himself out of work due to the lack of news stories. The two cross paths as passengers on a bus, and he recognizes her because her escapade made headlines (a Frank Capra trademark; absurd news headlines). Unfortunately for her, Ellie loses all of her money and possessions, and is forced to stick with Peter. Seizing the opportunity, he makes a deal with her he gets to escort her cross country so that she makes a new life for herself, and he gets to chronicle her escapade in detail. To avoid life broke and on the streets, she agrees, and high jinks ensue.Now, let me be frank; while I do not consider this film to be that funny, I still enjoy this movie a great deal. There is a reason why this film works so well A blend of witty writing, direction that takes full advantage of the medium, and the excellent chemistry between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, audible or otherwise. In fact, back then, not only did this film set the record for most Oscars ever won, sweep or otherwise, but it was the first of only 3 films to have won The Oscar Grand Slam Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay (Adapted or Original), Best Actor, and Best Actress; and it shows.Now if there is one thing to gripe about this game, it is essentially what spawns all the common Romantic Comedy clichés, particularly the bad ones; they start off not getting along, they eventually start developing feelings for one another, a misunderstanding occurs, they go their separate ways hating each other, and then a friend convinces them to return to one another, and it usually ends at an airport (not this movie) where they fall in love again, get married, and live happily ever after.This film though did it much better than almost all of these other movies, because it was new at the time, and it was actually believable; some contrivances here and there, but mainly for comedic effect. They didn't hate each other when they first met; they simply teased each other. They develop a relationship with one another, but we can actually believe it. There's a misunderstanding involved, but they didn't hate each other for a while. Peter ran off to go publish his story in the city and to buy an engagement ring, while at the same time, the hotel owner recognized Ellie from the earlier headlines, and called the police while he was gone. For a while, neither of them were happy, but that was because they were missing each other's presence and not fully aware of it. They both had friends that convinced them to run off again, reunite together and, a recurring gag that bears symbolic relevance, take down the curtains.Overall, even though it introduced a dangerous number of bad RomCom clichés, I will not count it against this film as what followed is irrelevant to the qualities of this film. Besides, I think the positive legacies of this film easily outweigh the negative. Still, I wish this game was a little bit funnier, but I'll let it slide a bit.

It showed Remmy's decent in a sympathetic light and in Fudge we saw that entitlement thinking in the black mentality is just as harmful as it is in the white mentality. Ultimately the only difference I saw in the white supremacist group and in Fudge's group was their skin color. Black or white, they were ALL red- blooded, self-entitled, American idiots. I thought that point was brilliantly made in the movie.

We see him just enough to appreciate his menacing appearance and presence, but not enough to become bored.

Luckily the baby gets found by Tommy Doyle.This was the first Halloween movie of the 90's and by this point you can already see the quality has gone downhill, after the poor reception part 5 was met with, It seems that the film crew were running out of ideas and so they decided to add a pagen\/cult roots to this film with mixed results. This entry is also infamous as it had so many re-shoots and cut out scenes that there are so many different versions of this movie out there.

Another thing that intrigued me was the box art, which looked almost Aztec\/Steampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film, or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s.But getting to the point, what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably f*cking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film, made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all, this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it, I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG-13, and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then, any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants.Look, its not that I don't get it. I understand what they were going for here, its just that they f*cked up (In my opinion). To put it simply, an otherwise chilling, absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil, is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camera-work by the filmmakers. For instance, the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening, a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his, what I suppose you could call family, scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought, they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film, least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate.In the end the film had so much potential, and so much style to work with, but it was wasted in favor of the film's oh-so-quirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy, perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its @ss into the camera lens.

In this respect, the older movies still hold a certain cultural value. Sadly, I still hold the opinion that most of the stuff they put out nowadays in that field (e.g. African Cats) is a waste of time and nothing more than sanitised stories indoctrinating youngsters into the Disney worldview.But let's get to Saludos Amigos, something that I found surprisingly enjoyable. It runs for about 40 minutes and is really just a few cartoons linked by footage of Disney animators visiting Latin America. We get to see some local colour and lovely scenery and we also get cartoons with the following plot lines 1) Donald Duck visits Lake Titicaca, meets some local folk and gets in a right mess with a stubborn llama.2) Pedro, a small airplane, sets off on his first perilous journey to pick up mail and bring it home.3) Goofy is transported from his cowboy life to show what it is like to be a gaucho.4) Watercolor Of Brazil mixes wonderful music with great visuals as an animator paints a number of lovely, Latin American scenes and then lets Jose Carioca (a cool parrot) introduce Donald Duck to the fun and exuberance of the Samba.As usual with Disney features of this kind, a number of people took charge of the different sequences and stories. Thankfully, they all do a very good job. The weak spot may be Pedro but it's still bearable enough in a film with such a short runtime and the other cartoons and snippets of footage from the areas visited more than makes up for that one poor segment.I certainly wouldn't call it an essential viewing for Disney fans but it's very enjoyable, especially if you like Goofy and Donald Duck, and I'd recommend picking it up if you ever stumble across it at a bargain price.

I was five, and just starting to get interested in science fiction. When it was over, I wasn't impressed, but it wasn't bad. Now that I look back...it's still about the same. It's certainly on the low end of the series, but it has parts of it I enjoy.The easiest thing to do with a dud is blame the director, and William Shatner does deserve at least some blame, if not much of it. Shatner didn't have his focus on the script (he was away during part of the shoot, during which time producers and even co-stars Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley helped rewrite the script), and it shows throughout the film. And his idea for the key plot element (the Enterprise being used to find God) was even loathed by Gene Roddenberry! So this project seemed doomed from the start.Another element to consider are the effects. More than any genre, sci-fi films need great special effects to make audiences suspend their disbelief. The effects of ST5...fail to do that. The Enterprise of this film looks like a step back from the original films, the torpedoes don't look real, and even the opening fall scene doesn't look right. In short, it proves that ILM (which was removed from the project early on) is head and shoulders above the rest.Now, about the plot. Let's delve deeper into each plot point-The Enterprise, despite barely working and with a skeleton crew, is sent to the planet Nimbus III when a renegade Vulcan named Sybok kidnaps three ambassadors. Why would the Federation send a ship clearly not ready to fly into such a dangerous position? Simply because they want Jim Kirk on the case? Where do they send these other ships?-Before that, Kirk and crew relax at Yosemite National Park. It leads to Kirk, Spock, and McCoy attempting to sing...Row Row Row Your Boat. What, Mary Had a Little Lamb was too complex!? Just a silly pick for a song.-Once the mission get under way, Spock reveals the renegade Vulcan is his half-brother. This is admittedly nit-picky, but why now? Why not during the TV series? This is simply a matter of degree, so I won't dock them too hard for this.-We get a subplot of a Klingon who wants to become famous by defeating Kirk in battle. This is just a poor attempt to cover that there's no true villain in this picture, and is really unnecessary.-We find out, after crossing the Great Barrier, that it's really an evil God who simply wants to use the Enterprise for his own purposes. A bit of a letdown, but it does lead to my favorite line (uttered by Shatner) What does God need with a starship?.-The payoff of a threesome of Row Row Row Your Boat? Wow, glad you could end on a high note!The film does try to follow ST4's lead in injecting more humor into the series. But while 4 was able to make it work by not getting too slap sticky, 5 has moments (such as the Row Boat singing, Sulu and Chekov getting lost in Yosemite, and Scotty knocking himself out by running into a beam) that make you groan rather than laugh. It's almost like they thought it was a parody of a Star Trek movie!The best parts are the tender moments that are sprinkled in. When Kirk, Spock, and McCoy bear their true feelings (such as when Spock reveals Sybok's past, or when McCoy talks about his true feelings after the Row Boat singing), it shows why the series is so popular. The all-for-1 and 1-for-all feelings are truly nice to see.Overall, though, ST5 is, at best, a lightweight in the series. Those who want a basic Trek that doesn't have too much to think about, or those who want an easy intro to the original cast, should check it out. Otherwise, this is for serious Trekkers only.

Its always the same actors in different costumes playing different roles as if to say; what shall we do now?. The Royal Tenenbaums is the story of a family of five headed by Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman). The three children in the storm of their parents divorce all become child prodigies of sorts. Chas, played by Ben Still, is a money man making a killing on the housing market. Margot (who is adopted), played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is a playwright and Richie, played by Luke Wilson, is a world champion tennis player. Another character thrown into the midst is Eli Cash, played by Owen Wilson, who is Richie's best friend.The film begins by portraying the three as children all of whom seem to have massive potential, however, fast forward twenty-two years and the family is in rather a grave state. Chas's wife died in a plane crash and he has become extremely overprotective of his twin boys. Richie has had some sort of nervous breakdown and has been travelling on a boat, going around the globe, for several years. Margot, who has married Raleigh (played by Bill Murray) has not written a play for years and seems to have entered a state of uncertainty in her life. She is also having an affair with Eli, who has become a successful author. Meanwhile Royal, who hasn't seen his wife (they never officially divorced) for seven years and after falling on hard times is kicked out of his hotel.When Chas comes to stay at the house the three children grew up in, Richi and Margot become jealous and also want to stay. Meanwhile Royal, who supposedly has six weeks to live, also needs somewhere to stay. A strange family reunion is formed and the movie really kicks off from here, with Royal trying to salvage some sort of relationship with his children in his last remaining weeks and the children themselves trying to work out and resolve what exactly has gone wrong in their lives. As a kind of side story that seeps into the main one, Eli has developed a comically performed drug habit.Acting wise I loved this film. I love the choice of actors as aside from Jason Schwartzman this film seems to encompass all of the usuals. Characters who some people usually find annoying or of poor quality (although I like him, everyone seems to be annoyed by Owen Wilson) do a great job. I thought Ben Stiller, who I usually find very average \/ type cast, performed exceptionally well, especially on his comedic side. Gene Hackman was fantastic as Royal Tenenbaum, the lovable asshole and the rest of the usuals were good as ever, I especially love Kumar Pallana, who plays Pagoda.In terms of directing Wes Anderson is on point as usual. He has a real life doll house and whilst, annoyingly, he couldn't open it up to pan down the innards, the shots the scroll down the windows were wonderful. I also love the way he follows people, particularly in chase type scenes, because though showing you the action perfectly you also get to see everybody else's reactions whilst he simultaneously shows off the house \/ set that he's working in for all its weirdly wonderful characteristics. The soundtrack, as for all Anderson films, is really superb. Everything comes on and disappears at the right moment, and the music always matches the action.The writing is possibly the best bit. The story is very enticing, and within the film there are several different stories, secrets held by characters etc. that come together and manifest themselves in a perfect ending. The film is also very funny, there is a mixture of deadpan and just very silly humour that will make you laugh out loud and smile your way through this picture. Overall I think this may be Wes Anderson's best movie (apart from maybe Bottlerocket). Its very clever and you definitely won't have seen anything like it before. I would say that this would definitely have been Oscar worthy, its just that its probably not really serious enough for the expletives at the academy, though perhaps not for any acting (still, maybe Ben Stiller should have got best supporting?). Anyways this is a must watch, definitely go and see it!

Blood doesn't always have to be in bulk. You just need an engrossing plot, a good twist, pretty models and some sleaziness to go with it.The tone changes from scene to scene, but it is beautifully shot, with clever writing and great dialogue, along with the actors that makes this movie work on so many levels. The scenes with Laura having a vision of another murder are very repetitive. The same thing happens. She's doing whatever, freezes in place, eyes go wide, mouth drops, and we see a blurred killer's-eye-view of who is dying. It's all very funny, but startling, because we know what Mars must be going through to endure such an eerie thing. The whodunnit element really works well throughout, as I was completely surprised when the true killer was revealed, The body count is quite high as well which will keep all true slasher fans happy, it's full of giallo tendencies. The stalking scenes and close-ups of the ice pick are just enough to add a psycho's tough to this underrated piece.Okay it's not perfect there are a few minor bad points, like the storyline do slow down in parts, like after a murder and the ending is also lacking thrills, but other than those points it's still a thrilling ride.The performances is what truly makes this movie work, Faye Dunaway is excellent as the lead Laura Mars, along with Tommy Lee Jones in one of his early roles as the detective and love interest, they're chemistry with each other and watching they're relationship develop further as the movie progressed was a real highlight. Brad Douriff a familiar face who would go on to play the infamous (Chucky) as a early role as the down and out limo driver, whose creepy and unsettling at the same time really works. The late Raul Julia plays the sleazy husband really well but we don't see enough of him, and the flamboyant friend Donald Phelps (Rene Auberjonois) was brilliant in his role, he switches from funny to serious really well and the models Lulu (Darlanne Fluegel) and Michele (Lisa Taylor) were stunning and a lot of fun, and this movie makes you feel for these characters especially when it comes to they're demise.So all in all a fashionable thriller with excellent performances with a fun 70's disco soundtrack and great suspenseful scenes.

This film twists and plays with your mind to an extent where you end up in a roll of confusion, energy, fun and depression. I think this film is also one of the best in the modern genre of horror and it will be a classic one day. I'm saying this because it's surprisingly a film I would put in the category They just don't make films like this anymore. And it's true, many of the horror films we've been getting lately are remakes, sequels or prequels which are ever exciting or pointless. Frailty is an original idea which offers so much.The story sets on the Meiks family with twos sons called Adam and Fenton with their Daddy who live a normal life in a normal world and they enjoy it together. One night, on any other normal night, Dad Meiks wakes up the two boys and tells them he has had a vision from God and that there are demons amongst them and that they must serve the will in killing them. Adam seems to get pulled into it while as Fenton wants to escape the horror and live a normal life. Fenton all grown up confesses his tragic life story to an FBI agent who is on the look out for the God's Hand Killer.The script and direction this film was taken into was superbly and surprisingly done well. Bill Paxton who not only directs this film but also stars in it as the dad does a chilling job at his role as well as his excellent story telling. What he captures so well with the character of the dad is if he's really seeing angels and demons or if he's going plain crazy? I'm still not sure what it could be but I think it might be both. The two little boys also did a job at building up their persona's of their characters and the back up actors did good in what they had to do. But the most outstanding performance was Matthew McConaughey who played the adult 'Fenton'.I also like the overall tone. Very sad, gloomy, creepy, scary at times and dark. Every death scene was also done really well and it left us to the imagination of how the bodies were devoured and mutilated. It's smart when it comes to violence because it doesn't have to show any detail to creep out audiences.Overall, Frailty is definitely worth the see and maybe even the buy if you can get it cheap. It's one of the better modern horrors around.9\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"10 January 2012","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Frailty is a excellent example of a modern horror\/thriller film.

I'm saying this because it's surprisingly a film I would put in the category They just don't make films like this anymore. And it's true, many of the horror films we've been getting lately are remakes, sequels or prequels which are ever exciting or pointless. Frailty is an original idea which offers so much.The story sets on the Meiks family with twos sons called Adam and Fenton with their Daddy who live a normal life in a normal world and they enjoy it together. One night, on any other normal night, Dad Meiks wakes up the two boys and tells them he has had a vision from God and that there are demons amongst them and that they must serve the will in killing them. Adam seems to get pulled into it while as Fenton wants to escape the horror and live a normal life. Fenton all grown up confesses his tragic life story to an FBI agent who is on the look out for the God's Hand Killer.The script and direction this film was taken into was superbly and surprisingly done well. Bill Paxton who not only directs this film but also stars in it as the dad does a chilling job at his role as well as his excellent story telling. What he captures so well with the character of the dad is if he's really seeing angels and demons or if he's going plain crazy? I'm still not sure what it could be but I think it might be both. The two little boys also did a job at building up their persona's of their characters and the back up actors did good in what they had to do. But the most outstanding performance was Matthew McConaughey who played the adult 'Fenton'.I also like the overall tone. Very sad, gloomy, creepy, scary at times and dark. Every death scene was also done really well and it left us to the imagination of how the bodies were devoured and mutilated. It's smart when it comes to violence because it doesn't have to show any detail to creep out audiences.Overall, Frailty is definitely worth the see and maybe even the buy if you can get it cheap. It's one of the better modern horrors around.9\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"}]
