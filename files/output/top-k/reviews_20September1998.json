[{"date":"20 September 1998","score":"","review":"  I know that it's hard, but try to imagine the following an MTV movie ... with *brains*!  That is, try to envision a full-throttle sensory assault where rapid-fire cuts, quick changes of perspective and other assorted A-V tricks all serve a storytelling purpose rather than merely being employed to distract you from noticing that there IS no story.Can't do it, can you?Believe it or not, this seemingly impossible cinematic feat has been brilliantly pulled off by German new-wave wunderkind Tom Tykwer in his third feature, RUN LOLA RUN (Lola Rennt in German).  It was by far the most innovative of the six films that I recently saw at the Toronto Film Festival, and it also earned the loudest applause.The film starts with a phone call between a pair of young twentysomethings. On one end is Lola (Franka Potente) the obviously rebellious (she sports died-red hair and tattoos) daughter of a local banker; on the other is her brooding, small-time hoodlum boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu).  The situation is this due indirectly to Lola not meeting him earlier because her motorbike got stolen when she went for cigarettes, Manni has lost a bag with 100,000 deutsche marks that he was running on a courier mission for his boss.  The boss has been known to maim underlings who steal so much as a beer from him.  Manni has to deliver the money to the boss at noon sharp. It's 1140.Manni tells Lola that he has no choice but to rob a large supermarket near where he's calling from.  Lola emphatically urges him not to, telling him that she'll meet him by the store by noon with the money he needs.  She then goes tearing out of her apartment, down the stairs (in an animated sequence), and out of the building.So begins a dazzling cinematic consideration of cause and effect -- the major ripples that even the smallest spur-of-the-moment decisions can have and the domino effect of a minimally altered event.  Tykwer has ingeniously created a structure that permits you to see multiple ramifications of singular changed events.  One of his many effective video techniques is to freeze the picture after Lola bumps (or almost bumps) into someone, impose the words AND THEN... onto the screen, and switch to a rapid-fire series of still photographs detailing what subsequently happens to the person. Many of the divergences of fate caused by a slight variation in Lola's actions are hysterical (not to mention a bit unsettling!) in their extremity.You NEVER know what's going to happen next in this movie.  The pacing is frenetic (set to a great techno track, co-authored by the multi-talented Tykwer), and the surprises are never-ending.  While the idea of altered events is certainly not new to movies (Back to the Future, Groundhog Day), there has never been a treatment of the concept as bold or innovative as this one.  This is truly groundbreaking cinema ... look for a Hollywood studio to buy the remake rights and bastardize it post-haste.  (Committee chairman First, we've got to make the leads two wholesome kids who accidentally get in over their heads&#133;)But fortunately, there WILL be a chance to see the unspoiled original in the States.  It was announced at the Toronto showing that a deal has just been struck with Sony Classics.  The release date has yet to be decided, but when it does open, I suggest that you point yourself towards the theater showing it in your area and then superimpose your own name into the title.
