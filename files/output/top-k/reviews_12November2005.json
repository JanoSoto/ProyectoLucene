If you don't like one sci-fi film you're unlikely to like any as they're all the same. However, my dad took down PLANET OF THE APES from our video shelf. Unlike most sci-fi films it was made in a time that had to deal without CGI and relied completely on the break through movie make-up as well as providing what people have voted time and time again The Greatest Film Ending. PLANET OF THE APES has a memorable cast, simple plot and it keeps your attention even as the credits are rolling at the end. Based on Pierre Boulle's lesser novel (La Planète des singes AKA Monkey Planet) tells of an astronaut landing on a distant planet and discovering that man's role as the superior life form has been reversed with the apes. The film has many needed changes to it to make it more watch-able and tap into the true fears at the time the film was made. In 1968, everyone lived in fear of an atomic bomb attack and PLANET OF THE APES truly taps into that fear, for reasons I will not reveal but it is understandable why the story was so popular at the time and why it shocked everyone.PLANET OF THE APES tells the story of George Taylor (Charlton Heston), when he and his doomed astronaut friends find themselves stranded on a distant planet. It seems to be inhospitable with no life. However, after travelling throughout the place, which is famously referred to as The Forbidden Zone, discover plenty of life including ape like humans and human like apes. Taylor is shot in the neck rendering him unable to speak. Treated as a wounded animal he is taken to a human-ape study lab where he meets Zira (Kim Hunter), a sympathetic and friendly chimpanzee. She almost straight away notices that Taylor's intelligence goes far beyond that of any other human, and she encourages him to speak. However, orangutan leader Dr Zaius sneers on Zira's and her fiancé Cornelius' (Roddy McDowall) belief in any human intelligence, and won't listen to reason. Despite Cornelius' skeptical feelings towards Taylor, he agrees to help prove his intelligence which is proved once he finally says his famous line Take your stinking paws of me you damn dirty ape! Heston is anything other then a likable character. Unlike Ulysse Merou in the novel Taylor is slightly moody, but a likable character who values his friendship with Zira and Cornelius. He represents what humans truly are that is self-centered, violent and dangerous. Though on stage he is reportedly (according to Laurence Olivier) truly a talented actor, on screen and in PLANET OF THE APES, Heston basically turned up and played himself. Nonetheless the character of Taylor works as you either love him or you hate him. The rebel Taylor is no different from the other pushy characters Heston has played over the years. With his tough, physical god-like body you suppose that in a film where the apes are pushing us humans about because we're basically behaving like apes he is just what the doctor ordered.Of course we all know that it's the two lovable chimps Zira and Cornelius that we remember the most in the PLANET OF THE APES films for their charm and humor they bring to the story. Hunter's portrayal of Zira was a masterpiece on its own, giving one of the most powerful performances. It's fair to say that Zira is the strongest and most developed character in the film. Indeed she is the only ape that Taylor actually likes! With her wit and admirable sense of humor it's not surprising that most people asked who their favorite character is reply Zira. Hunter manages to make Zira what she was meant to be, more human then ape. In fact, she's more human than most of the beautiful female actresses of the 60's films. Despite the fact she looks as ugly as hell in her ape make-up the charm still shines through.Of course, if you don't love the intelligent and cool Zira, you always have intelligent and nerdy Cornelius. McDowell, next to Heston, is the most celebrated male actor in the films as he comes over as the nerd of the rebel gang that you just want to hug. In the film, Taylor seems to have a love-hate rivalry with Cornelius as they constantly challenge each other like full-blooded males do no matter how civilized. A good example of this is when Zira allows Taylor to kiss her on the lips as a goodbye and Cornelius makes his jealousy clear. However Taylor sticks up for him against Zaius, which shows not as much friendship as understanding. McDowell is an irreplaceable member of the cast who is near impossible to live up to.PLANET OF THE APES is a mark in cinema history, famous for these talented artists, gripping story and an amazing ending that shocks you, scares you, breaks you and brings you to tears with the realization that you'll never truly experience a film like this again. Anyone who is anyone owes it to himself or herself to watch this film and experience the feeling. Even people who dislike sci-fi are likely to enjoy this. A film that truly did break STAR WARS and challenged it like no other film ever could. PLANET OF THE APES will live on in all of us. It will go on forever, find its way to younger audiences and will win them over just it won over us.

Or adapt Raymond Chandler's The Little Sister to the theatrical stage. Instead, he had to make a movie, and so he turned out this overcooked crime thriller. That doesn't mean Heist is unwatchable or even bad. Indeed, there's plenty of enjoyment to be had here. It does mean that Mamet needs to consider throttling back on the high level of contrivance that has come to infest almost every thing he does these days. Or else he needs to consider collaborating with another writer with a slightly more naturalistic approach to this kind of material. Don't get me wrong, I found plenty to like about Heist. Yeah, real people don't talk like this, and you can sense the script twisting itself into knots to provide the characters opportunity to deliver Mamet's trademark noir lines (which would work fine in a novel but require real work to deliver believably in a film). But Mamet quips are great quips (Everyone needs money...that's why they call it money.) and they are worth the work. But there is just too damn much of all the stuff Mamet usually does in Heist, and as a result, the movie is almost a lampoon of itself and of caper films in general. The plot strains the viewers' patience with twist after twist and betrayal after betrayal until the viewer just wants to get to the END OF THE FILM and figure out who finally won. And Mamet the director doesn't always have good judgment. Ricky Jay and Rebecca Pigeon are badly used in several scenes, where their body language and mannerisms display all the subtlety of a train wreck. In several shots Jay's on-the-scene signals and tells to his conspirators are so wooden and broad that he might as well be waving semaphore flags and yelling through a bullhorn IT'S TIME TO DO THE THING!!!!. Meanwhile Pigeon often seems to be channeling Veronica Lake (who was an extraordinarily wooden actress, BTW ) by way of Sharon Stone, and she smokes cigarettes as if she were a marionette. These are both good actors (bad actors don't make it into Mamet films), and they are fine in many other scenes, so I have to blame Mamet for poor direction in these rough spots. So Heist is not a classic. It's not even classic Mamet. But Mamet fans may enjoy it (as I did, even with all its hermeneutically sealed, airless atmosphere) for Hackman and Lindo and for the occasional memorable line. But I don't think it will win Mamet any new fans...in fact I think he is risking boring the fans he already has.

The Acting is wonderful!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he has an extremely cocky and arrogant character, but he's extremely likable, due to his great charm and charisma, he had wonderful chemistry with Nicole Kidman, was fantastic in the acting department, had some cool lines, as always flashed that great smile of his, and was just a lot of fun to watch!.(Cruise Rules!!!!!!). Nicole Kidman is stunningly gorgeous, and is amazing as always, she is extremely likable, very caring had that great sexy accent, had wonderful chemistry with Cruise, and while she didn't really have all that much to do her presence was always very clearly felt! (Kidman Rules!!!!).Robert Duvall is wonderful as Cruise's Mentor, he seemed to be enjoying himself, had some great scenes with Cruise was intense, and was just perfect for this role!. Michael Rooker is fantastic as always and here is no different, he had that great look determination on his face as always, had an extremely cool character, and cracked me up a couple of times too i loved him! (Rooker Rules!). Randy Quaid played a role that was normal for once, and i bought it!, great job even though he didn't have much to do. Cary Elwes is OK here, as the main opponent, but we don't get to learn enough about his character really,as they just threw him in there halfway into the movie, he was OK i guess.

When creating a remake, one can never seem to find that perfect balance that was found in the original. The characters, the unique situations, and the overall charm seem to be thrown out the window in luau of big box office names, CGI, and overdrawn clichés. We all complain about them when we leave the theater and snicker when we see it. Well, I am here to say that finally, I have been proved wrong. The 1950s version of Father of the Bride was a far inferior version to the recent Steve Martin remake. Yes, you have heard it here first, but the Spencer Tracy\/Elizabeth Taylor version lacked the humor, wit, and realism of insanity that the remake had. Tracy seemed like a distant father, not caring much about his actual daughter, but more about the expense of the wedding. Joan Bennett was nothing more than an emotionless cardboard wife that seemed to be harboring a disturbing hatred towards her present life. Elizabeth Taylor was a rich snob that was used to draw in audiences by using the classic eye candy trick. The story, the characters, the actors, the dated sensation of this film only confused me further on how this version of Father of the Bride could ever be considered a classic.I do not want to use this forum to compare this version to the Steve Martin version, but there were obvious problems with this film from the beginning. The complete lack of excitement from either parent when Taylor announces that she is getting married (and did anyone find that scene entirely random?) shocked me. Even though we live in a completely different era, shouldn't there have been at least some reaction from Bennett and Tracy? Tracy tried hard to convey the idea that he was worried about loosing his little girl, but what I witnessed instead was an issue of money. You could read in Steve Martin's eyes that he loved his little girl, and his focus was making sure that she wasn't marrying the wrong man. This older version of Father of the Bride has a central theme that revolves around money. Everything that happens in this film eventually leads back to Tracy complaining about how much money they are spending. I was surprised because I wanted to see Tracy react to who Taylor was marrying, not how much he had to spend to make her happy. It seemed to debunk the entire film and place this negative image on the entire marriage\/event. The scene where Tracy asks Taylor to just run away and get married for $1200 was idiotic. This only solidified the randomness of the film and how Tracy had trouble grasping the true meaning of the picture.When the centralized theme is completely destroyed, one can only guess that a domino effect will occur which will hurt other avenues of this film. That is why the acting was so atrocious. Tracy showed no emotion about his daughter getting married. From the moment she informs the family of her decision until the final anti-climax climax when he shuffles around to find her, he never really opens himself up to her. That is what I needed to see between Tracy and Taylor, one of those father\/daughter-bonding moments. Director Minnelli tried with the late night snack scene later in the film, but by that point I had lost it with Tracy. The same can be said for Joan Bennett, who literally went through every scene without a smile or a hint of emotion. I felt as if Tracy and Bennett were the epitome of a waspy family whose main concern was money instead of emotion. Could we get some passion into anyone in this film? Hugging seemed to be the most valued way of demonstrating love, and while I realize that cinema was different then, did it have to be so unrealistic? I hated Tracy and Bennett's portrayal of husband and wife, which eventually turned me away from ever seeing them as an actual family, which only hurt this film further.Finally, I would like to say that there was one scene that I did enjoy and if the entire film would have had the same creativity then perhaps it could have redeemed itself. I loved the dream sequence that Tracy had about walking down the isle. I though that it was reminiscent of director Tim Burton's early work. The black and white stripes gobbling up Tracy was perhaps a bit of an excited moment for me because it was something I was hoping for. Some evil floor devouring this mismatched actor. Alas, it was only a dream, but can't we all dream? There was more scenes like this needed to really demonstrate the fears (outside of monetary issues) of loosing a daughter and the insanity of a marriage. There wasn't, which again, hurt this film further.Overall, I didn't enjoy this film as much as I was hoping. I had always heard that this was a better version than the remake with Steve Martin, but upon watching it I found out it was not. This was a very unemotional, unapologetic look at the financial side of getting married. Tracy cared more about the dollar amount that he was spending instead of the interest of his own daughter. It was pathetic. There were a total of two decent scenes in the entire film (Tracy getting eaten by the floor and when he gets plowed at the in-law's house), but outside of that it was nothing but shambles. It hurt to watch this film because you knew it could have been better. With physical comedy, better actors, and a stronger emphasis on the true themes of the film, Father of the Bride may have been a winner.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 2005","score":"5 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" I am not afraid to stand on my little soapbox and say that typically I find that originals are enormously better than any remake could ever dream to be.

The sets and costumes are good looking and the cinematography by Peter Pau and music by Dun Tan are splendid.The story didn't quite grabbed me and never really become interesting, tense or surprising. The at times absolutely horrible dialog also didn't do much good to the story and storytelling of the movie.

It was fake and odd looking most of the times and was simply too much over-the-top, even for a material arts movie.

Personally, I'll have to go with a mix of these; it's an attack on said corporation, and an obvious one at that, but it's also a popcorn flick... and that might be the core of the problem with it. It tries to combine mindless entertainment with an actual message and fails terribly in this attempt. The plot is mindless techno-babble(quite derivative, too... The Net, anyone?) that lost my attention less than half-way through. The pacing is incredibly poor... the first half hour tells us far more than the remaining hour and a half, leaving the majority of the film being awfully slow and event-less. The acting is nearly unforgivably bad(what happened, Robbins?), and the casting is dubious at best. Ryan Phillippe as a geek? Please. He doesn't look the part in the least. The rest of the geeks at least look like they spent some time in front of a screen, but he looks more like he just left Dawson's Creek. The film is packed with twists, each more ridiculous than the last. The writing is pitiful. The dialog is just bad. The editing is frantic and confused. There are several sequences of MTV-like editing, only good for giving the viewer a headache. The cinematography is sophomoric and daft. The whole film just doesn't really have anything to offer the viewer at all... apart from some fairly accurate computer-stuff(as far as I can tell), which shows decent research... but what does that matter, when the film itself is so poor? I recommend this only to pseudo-geeks and fans of popcorn flicks. Everyone else should avoid it. 5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"12 November 2005","score":"","review":" This is an absolutely amazing movie and i have never seen a better one. i have loved this movie ever since i saw it especially when all of the bodies are being found i think that that music is so suited the occasion and the plot is ginormously great the whole way through, every time i watch it i only ever avert my eyes is so that i can blink so my eyes don't dry up, i go blind and never get to watch it again. i watch it at the very least six times a year without fail. any one who has not seen it should see it soon. i would like to suggest that you do not have to type at least ten lines every time you want to write a review for a movie and i hope you consider this change, internet movie database people.

Because Spielberg puts us right in the midst of the war! We experience the unvarnished, direct, and all the nitty-gritty details that went on in battle. I can't think of any other film of the same genre which has done this. He does this by using shaky POV camera shots, showing us graphic images of soldiers getting blown up or getting shot, brutal sound effects, etc. We also get a solid storyline with an actual plot. Our heroes have a goal and a mission to complete (besides winning the war). After a grueling 20-minute opening that depicts the horrors that went on D-Day, Capt. Miller and his crew of soldiers are assigned to rescue private Ryan, a paratrooper lost behind enemy lines. His three brothers have just been killed in action and the Army wants to send him home. This leads Capt. Miller and his crew to undertake a dangerous task with an uncertain outcome.Tom Hanks and company are excellent. They all give convincing and rather low-key performances. Giovanni Ribisi and Matt Damon are particular standouts. Another thing I loved about the film was the pacing. The balance between the ghastly battle scenes and the quiet scenes which gives us time to get to know our heroes is perfect. You hardly notice that it's a 2 hr and 50 min film. The photography by Janusz Kaminski is incredibly distinctive. It has this washed-out look which makes it look like an old war newsreel. John Williams' musical score is also appropriately effective. It's not his most memorable nor as haunting like the one he did for Schindler's List but good enough to appreciate. Without a doubt, all this wouldn't have been achieved if it wasn't for Steven Spielberg's expertise. Once again, he shows us his versatility and mastery as a director to let audiences experience a story rather than just see it. I can live with the fact that the film didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture but it would have been an injustice if he hadn't won for Best Director. The best war film of all time and one of the best films of the 1990's!

Another has a guy climbing all around a very large apartment building in the city, on a very small ledge after he is told by a Rich Man who dares him, that if he makes it, all the way to his apartment, he gets the wife, money & all the Rich Man's belongings, but as he'll soon find out, the Rich Man has other plans if he does make it & the last story has the Cat finding a home with a little girl who is being taunted by a miniature sized ghoul that lives somewhere in her bedroom wall, but this kitty ain't going to stand for it! While the last (& in my opinion best) story has a few memorable & entertaining moments, the rest of film is somewhat slow & undisciplined with nothing much scary or suspenseful happening, there is a few edge of you're seat moments during the second story with the guy moving all around the building, but this is strictly for KING fans who will no doubt be satisfied with this film. But if you're not to big a King fan (& I admit I'm not that big a fan, though I do like some of his work) & were curious about seeing this, my advice be that you skip it & rent one of King's other films, since a lot of them were so much better than this one.** stars ","genre":null},{"date":"12 November 2005","score":"","review":" Based on the story by horror author STEPHEN KING, a Cat looking for his way back home guides us through three short suspense stories.

On the other hand saying you like it is not the coolest thing to say, especially for a twenty-something male, like myself. So here goes.The film's strengths are the scale of the film, the romance element and Kate Winslet. The sheer size of this film is breathtaking and the attention to detail, which could have so easily been overlooked, eases the path of the audience into the decadence of the era. Trapped in amongst the whirlwind is the story of two star crossed teenagers (tm) falling in love and one sacrificing himself for the love of his life. Kate Winslet is impressive a feisty, red-haired, buxom, rich girl who is trapped by a domineering boyfriend (Zane) but her leading actor, to me at least, fails to match up.Leonardo di Caprio is a good actor but looks like a little boy playing with grown ups and does not come across as a leading man, especially for a movie of this size. Billy Zane puts in a decent show as the caddish bad guy but lacks a foil of equal stature. After all Di Caprio is after his girl and to be quite honest it reminded me of the time I had a crush on a friend's older sister.Another fault in the film came from the dialogue. It's clunky, over the top and made most of the actors look uncomfortable. The salt of the earth steerage passengers looked hammed up and during the sinking it all got a bit 'wishy washy' all over.It does OK for something to watch with your love-interest but all the time you'll be left sitting there waiting for a)the boat to sink b)Di Caprio to die and c)the end credits.
