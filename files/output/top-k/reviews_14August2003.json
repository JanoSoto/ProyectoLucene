The question is whether it is any good. Sadly, though I am a big fan of Arnie's, I just cannot get into Conan the Barbarian. I think it's boring, dumb and odd. That's just me. I know many people like it, but it's just not my piece of cake.Arnie plays Conan, a fierce barbarian warrior who is bred a gladiator, and upon reaching ultimate manhood, runs amock to try and avenge the death of his father, mother, and tribes-people, who were all killed by James Earl Jones (not James Earl Ray!) when he was just a small boy.Through this he gains a trusty comic sidekick, a trusty, lusty babe, and so on and so forth. And a totally cool-looking shield and sword, making him the most fearless warrior of all time. This film was the ultimate in campiness, a small budget film with a leading man larger than most barbarians probably were back then. Arnold fits the part perfectly, but the film is just not fun to watch. The beginning tribe massacre is bloody and violent, but feels like one of those old 80s movies like The Blademaster, where there is lots of fighting and lots of violence for no reason but to entertain - and like films with explosions throughout (Rambo III), it gets old after a while. If you haven't seen The Blademaster, it is an even worse film than this. You always know when a film is really bad if the title has been changed. Cave Dwellers to The Blademaster, Angels Revenge to Angels' Brigade, Weekend at Kitty and Stud's to The Italian Stallion, etc. All terribly awful pictures lacking a certain something - maybe a plot, I don't know. Conan the Barbarian is ten times better than these films combined, but it is still much like them. Maybe there aren't as many continuity problems, or cheap filming techniques (in The Blademaster, they use the same fight scenes twice), but it still has that genuine repulsiveness, the dumbness.The script was co-written by pre-stardom Oliver Stone, whose other directorial and scriptwriting credits go to such films as Platoon and Wall Street. Stone uses a lot of campy dialogue here, and though it fits the film, somehow it just isn't as fun as it could have been. Take, for instance, the opening scene where Conan's father is teaching him about the earth gods and whatnot. Barely quality dialogue, yet almost too campy - it's like Star Trek geeks talking about the meaning of life.Arnold was in a film called Red Sonja a bit after Conan's sequel came out. It was a rip-off of Conan the Barbarian, even though it starred Arnold. I will be submitting a review of that film as part of the Arnold Film Memorial, but the point I want to make by bringing it up is that Red Sonja might as well be called Conan the Barbarian III, because everything about it is similar. Just wanted to point out that little-known film to the Conan fans out there.Anyway, Conan the Barbarian is just not one of my favorites. Skip this one.

I'd grab all of the comics, watch the cartoon on Saturdays, buy the toys..... heck, I even stuck through the clone mess, the reboot nightmare, and worst of all, Paul Jenkins's Peter Parker Spider-man #21(at least he got better at writing Spidey stories). But after the decision to cast Kirsten Dunst, an actress I detest with all my heart, as Mary Jane Watson, and seeing the stupid costume they designed for the Green Goblin(which, in the song Ode to A Superhero, Weird Al Yankovic named it the equivalent of a Power Rangers costume), I had my doubts.  A lot of doubts.  This didn't help when I saw the teaser(Let's go for the Ultimate Spin?  Kill me now).  But still, after the opening weekend, I reluctantly decided to see it, hoping that it would be good and I'd be wrong, since I did like the comic adaption(but then again, it was written by Stan Lee, a person who can actually WRITE).  And so, I went inside the movie theater.Sadly, my hopeful expectations were shot as fatally as poor Uncle Ben.The film, simply put, is HORRIBLE.  The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen in my life.  The opening scene at the science lab was so bad, I wanted to vomit.  By the time Peter is figuring out his powers, I actually couldn't take any more and tried to leave the movie theater, but one of my friends forced me to stay.  Spider-man's character is also downplayed.  We only have the serious wall-crawler from some of Stan Lee's more serious issues, but we never get to see the lighter side.  Spider-man doesn't even make one of his trademark wisecracks that we all know and love the entire film(something pivotal to the character.  Just read the story, The Best Medicine, in PPSM#20, and you'll see what I mean).  This humorless character pretty much just spends the entire time complaining.  Add to the fact that there is NO chemistry between Peter\/Spidey and MJ in the film, and you have another reason to hate this.SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPHRight after the wrestling scene, when the guy hands Peter his money, we see that Peter ISN'T wearing that shoddy face-mask from earlier.  So doesn't this guy know that he's Spider-man?  I mean, Peter shows up and beats up the wrestler with his SPIDER powers, and now some guy dressed in a red and blue costume calling himself Spider-man shows up?  This guy could find out who he is now, unless he's too stupid to make the obvious connection!  All he has to do is learn his name.... oh, but if Peter goes on and sells photos to the Daily Bugle, wouldn't it have a photos taken by Peter Parker, or something like that?  This plot hole just serves to show how little the writers were thinking when they created this nightmare.  Also, Aunt May's Superman, line is so awful it shows how low some script-writers can get when they try to inject some humor.END SPOILERSDanny Elfman once again creates a forgettable score, similar to Hulk,(this is the guy who once composed stuff for Simpsons, Batman, and Men In Black!?), which doesn't really affect the mood of the film.  And the CGI is just plain bad.  It is so obvious whenever you see a CGI Spider-man instead of Tobey Maguire.  Raimi really needs to work here if he wants to clean up this mess in time for the sequel.... but I doubt he will.BOTTOM LINE  The ultimate piece of trash.  Someone needs to boycott the sequel.

I'd grab all of the comics, watch the cartoon on Saturdays, buy the toys..... heck, I even stuck through the clone mess, the reboot nightmare, and worst of all, Paul Jenkins's Peter Parker Spider-man #21(at least he got better at writing Spidey stories). But after the decision to cast Kirsten Dunst, an actress I detest with all my heart, as Mary Jane Watson, and seeing the stupid costume they designed for the Green Goblin(which, in the song Ode to A Superhero, Weird Al Yankovic named it the equivalent of a Power Rangers costume), I had my doubts.  A lot of doubts.  This didn't help when I saw the teaser(Let's go for the Ultimate Spin?  Kill me now).  But still, after the opening weekend, I reluctantly decided to see it, hoping that it would be good and I'd be wrong, since I did like the comic adaption(but then again, it was written by Stan Lee, a person who can actually WRITE).  And so, I went inside the movie theater.Sadly, my hopeful expectations were shot as fatally as poor Uncle Ben.The film, simply put, is HORRIBLE.  The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen in my life.  The opening scene at the science lab was so bad, I wanted to vomit.  By the time Peter is figuring out his powers, I actually couldn't take any more and tried to leave the movie theater, but one of my friends forced me to stay.  Spider-man's character is also downplayed.  We only have the serious wall-crawler from some of Stan Lee's more serious issues, but we never get to see the lighter side.

EVERY ONE OF THEM.I was told that this movie was a classic, so I decided to give it a shot. What I wasn't told was that it is probably one of the stupidest movies ever made.  Yes, I am aware that stupidest is not a word, but after sitting through this garbage, I cannot be blamed for my newfound idiocy.  No, Gloria is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it sure holds the current title in the Bad Dialogue Contest.  Gloria runs through the city Charles Bronson style, and whenever confronted by mobsters she says such gems as, You punks!  You sissies!  You bunch of nothings!  You Bananas!!This also marks the first time I have ever watched a movie and prayed for NO nudity.  And believe me, there are plenty of close calls here, as when Gloria prances around in scantily clad lingerie showcasing her glorious middle aged body.  And when people are lacking in the Attractive Department, they sure as hell better have a good personality.  But Gloria sucks.  Are we supposed to like this lady?  I sure as hell don't.  Actually, I hate her. She makes bad decisions.  She treats the kid like sh**.  Why won't she just drop him off at the police station and walk away?  Why won't she buy the kid some clothes?  Her selfish ass changes clothes every scene, but won't let Phil get out of his Chico and the Man attire.The movie begins with a Hispanic woman having a very bad day.  Thank God they kill her off early, because I don't think I could take that horrible Rosie Perez accent for 2 hours.  Her good friend Gloria takes her son named Phil away from the mob who kill the rest of the family.  The story soon is all over the street, and Phil's face is in the papers.  Instead of being inconspicuous, Gloria goes all over town like a NYC tour guide in broad daylight.  So, why can't anybody find this pair?  True, I don't expect the cops to give a sh** about locating a poor Puerto Rican kid, but how about street witnesses?  How about the mob?  And speaking of the mob, this is the softest mob I have ever seen.  They repeatedly let Gloria have their way with them, with no question.  In her home, in restaurants, on the train, etc.  In one scene, Gloria even rescues Phil from a mobster's house, leaves pointing a gun, and then her taxi driver actually lets her in his cab with a gun and mobsters behind her.Personally, I believe the kid playing Phil was probably a 12 year old (or so) midget and not a little kid.  His body seems shrunken, and not far from puberty.  But whether he's a real kid or a midget, one thing's for sure...he is one horrendous actor.  The writers of this movie also forgot that the kid is supposed to be 6, not 16.  He is depressed and angry at the world, as if life has stressed him with burdens since birth.  Yes, the kid is from a tough background and was forced to grow up fast, but don't make him an adult for the convenience of the plot.  He is a young, frightened child in some scenes, and an experienced, mature man in others.  But he doesn't mature with the movie, his character shifts back and forth during the course of the film, wherever convenient.  Phil has some really oddball lines for a child to say.  Some of Phil's greatest hits include1.) A dame like you and a guy like me, they don't understand.2.) You're a cute girl Gloria, but you're not for me.3.) You're my mother, my father...you're even my friend.4.) If you don't know what the system is, how do you know you can't beat it?5.) We gotta keep trying, even if we get shot.

By the time the movie was over, I actually WANTED the mob to come and kill this duo.  I couldn't decide which character I wanted dead first.

Not being a born again Christian I wasn't coming to this movie as a believer and frankly I can't see it converting anyone.Good performances though from all the actors involved I thought. Just didn't really think the storyline made alot of sense. I hope that real Bible-thumpers don't really believe that this is the way God will act in the final days (whenever those are supposed to be). Personally I doubt there will ever be any final days.I realize that depicting the end of the world is hard enough but when you have a restricted budget it requires a lot more creativity. Some of these special effects work and some of them just don't. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse just didn't cut it for me. LOL. Too cheesy. Good idea to avoid actually showing the riders though. That helped alittle.  That way you don't have to purchase Halloween masks.Didn't really see why Rogers character would be so persuaded by the young boy prophet? I've seen lots of people just like him who spout Old Testament and Revelation quotes. I mean, I could do the same thing and it wouldn't mean I am a prophet. There have been wars and rumors of wars since the dawn of time. Just think how many wars there have been since this film came out?

The films look is no more than what you would expect from a one based on Jack the Ripper. Dark shadows loom over the characters as the satanic nature of The Ripper is emphasised. It's such an intriguing story and character that every time I watch a film based on this story I come away slightly disappointed. This time was no exception. While the acting was good (minus some quite unconvincing cockney accents - Heather Graham and Johnny Depp, I'm talking to you) and the direction assured, the script seemed a little reserved.

For a start, the direction was superb - the streets of London looked grimy, while the `unfortunates' (i.e., prostitutes) wandered around in squalor awaiting their fate.

The film wasn't completely terrible; it had it's good points. However, after OHMSS, my favorite of the Bond films, this film fails to live up to Majesty's high standards.Of course, one must keep in mind that at it's initial release, OHMSS was the second-lowest grossing Bond film, although not a box-office failure. Audiences didn't bother giving the film a chance, instead complaining of the absence of Sean Connery. The press didn't help, as they gave a false image of George Lazenby who, after bad advice from his agent and supervisor, backed out of the role of 007. Sean Connery was lured back into this film with his salary higher than the budget of Dr. No, but this couldn't have been a worse farewell performance for him. His age isn't as obvious as some have said; for the most part, he looks the same as in You Only Live Twice. But his performance isn't right. At the beginning of the film, he is hunting down Blofeld, beating up everyone who has a lead on him until he gets information. He finds his nemesis changing his appearance yet again and creating a double of himself through plastic surgery. Bond stops the procedure and supposedly kills his nemesis. But WHY is he hunting Blofeld? The logical answer is the murder of his wife in the last film; there are several indications. Bond is dead-set on finding Blofeld, M states that 007 has been focusing on nothing else, and when Moneypenny asks for a wedding ring, rather than smiling and immediately replying, Bond looks rather disturbed by the comment. But it is never stated why Bond is after Blofeld.After Bond kills Blofeld, he goes to Vegas to stop a diamond smuggling operation. The people who handle the diamonds are killed off by homosexual killers Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. I had no problems with them being homosexual as it is not the most obvious thing in the movie. But when Bond kills Peter Franks and Tiffany Case, the new Bond girl, thinks Franks is James Bond, why is she so surprised. Bond is a SECRET agent from BRITIAN! So far the only people who know Bond is a 00 agent are those who have secret links and friends in high places (the only ones like that are SPECTRE and Draco, Tracy's father.) I don't think Felix Lieter would leak information like that into the public of a country like America. And speaking of Felix, he is totally out of character in this film. Rather than being the understanding friend of James that he was in the other films, he now is too serious and business-like. Tiffany Case, and indeed, every other woman in this film, have no personality and are just appendages to the story line. After a woman like Tracy in OHMSS, you'd think they would come up with women at least a LITTLE like the closest Bond girl to Tracy, Pussy Galore (I say Pussy because Bond said he'd never find another girl like Tracy.)And finally, Blofeld. He had three doubles, and the opening of the film has Bond kill two. He kills the other, and the real one is left alive. This Blofeld is much more of a whiner and more talkative then the calm, ruthless Blofeld of YOLT, or the charming, tough Blofeld of OHMSS. His plan will be copied twice in future Bond films, with a minor difference. Blofeld's satellite, encrusted with diamonds, is a laser that he uses to hold the U.S. for ransom, at what price I don't remember. The film's plot is rather dull and lacks the same kind of excitement and lavish feel of previous Bond outings. The opening teaser should've been M, Q, and Moneypenny looking over 007's work since Tracy's death and finding a lead on Blofeld, and THEN they could mix in the diamond smuggling with Bond's search for Blofeld. Donald Pleasance or Telly Savalas should've played Blofeld, and George Lazenby should've played 007. Q's hair went too white from OHMSS and DAF, when not even a year seems to have passed. And at the end, before the action starts, Tiffany sounds like she'll propose marriage, and Bond is in no way looking glum, uncomfortable, or with a look that says no, and there should be one on his face.The film does have it's good points, however. I did enjoy Willard Whyte. He's a good comedic character. So is Plenty O' Toole, even if she is annoying. And Sean Connery doesn't play the part right for a man after the one who killed his wife, but the way he plays it is good.This film was supposed to mark a turning point in the OO7 films. Rather than the ruthless, dark agent of Connery, the Roger Moore era of a light-hearted, witty Bond was coming, and this film was supposed to launch it. Instead, it isolates itself from the series and turns out dull. They should've done it in the style of OHMSS, and THEN let Live and Let Die introduce Moore and his era.

The film wasn't completely terrible; it had it's good points. However, after OHMSS, my favorite of the Bond films, this film fails to live up to Majesty's high standards.Of course, one must keep in mind that at it's initial release, OHMSS was the second-lowest grossing Bond film, although not a box-office failure. Audiences didn't bother giving the film a chance, instead complaining of the absence of Sean Connery. The press didn't help, as they gave a false image of George Lazenby who, after bad advice from his agent and supervisor, backed out of the role of 007. Sean Connery was lured back into this film with his salary higher than the budget of Dr. No, but this couldn't have been a worse farewell performance for him. His age isn't as obvious as some have said; for the most part, he looks the same as in You Only Live Twice. But his performance isn't right. At the beginning of the film, he is hunting down Blofeld, beating up everyone who has a lead on him until he gets information. He finds his nemesis changing his appearance yet again and creating a double of himself through plastic surgery. Bond stops the procedure and supposedly kills his nemesis. But WHY is he hunting Blofeld? The logical answer is the murder of his wife in the last film; there are several indications. Bond is dead-set on finding Blofeld, M states that 007 has been focusing on nothing else, and when Moneypenny asks for a wedding ring, rather than smiling and immediately replying, Bond looks rather disturbed by the comment. But it is never stated why Bond is after Blofeld.After Bond kills Blofeld, he goes to Vegas to stop a diamond smuggling operation. The people who handle the diamonds are killed off by homosexual killers Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. I had no problems with them being homosexual as it is not the most obvious thing in the movie. But when Bond kills Peter Franks and Tiffany Case, the new Bond girl, thinks Franks is James Bond, why is she so surprised. Bond is a SECRET agent from BRITIAN! So far the only people who know Bond is a 00 agent are those who have secret links and friends in high places (the only ones like that are SPECTRE and Draco, Tracy's father.) I don't think Felix Lieter would leak information like that into the public of a country like America. And speaking of Felix, he is totally out of character in this film. Rather than being the understanding friend of James that he was in the other films, he now is too serious and business-like. Tiffany Case, and indeed, every other woman in this film, have no personality and are just appendages to the story line. After a woman like Tracy in OHMSS, you'd think they would come up with women at least a LITTLE like the closest Bond girl to Tracy, Pussy Galore (I say Pussy because Bond said he'd never find another girl like Tracy.)And finally, Blofeld. He had three doubles, and the opening of the film has Bond kill two. He kills the other, and the real one is left alive. This Blofeld is much more of a whiner and more talkative then the calm, ruthless Blofeld of YOLT, or the charming, tough Blofeld of OHMSS. His plan will be copied twice in future Bond films, with a minor difference. Blofeld's satellite, encrusted with diamonds, is a laser that he uses to hold the U.S. for ransom, at what price I don't remember. The film's plot is rather dull and lacks the same kind of excitement and lavish feel of previous Bond outings. The opening teaser should've been M, Q, and Moneypenny looking over 007's work since Tracy's death and finding a lead on Blofeld, and THEN they could mix in the diamond smuggling with Bond's search for Blofeld. Donald Pleasance or Telly Savalas should've played Blofeld, and George Lazenby should've played 007. Q's hair went too white from OHMSS and DAF, when not even a year seems to have passed. And at the end, before the action starts, Tiffany sounds like she'll propose marriage, and Bond is in no way looking glum, uncomfortable, or with a look that says no, and there should be one on his face.The film does have it's good points, however. I did enjoy Willard Whyte. He's a good comedic character. So is Plenty O' Toole, even if she is annoying. And Sean Connery doesn't play the part right for a man after the one who killed his wife, but the way he plays it is good.This film was supposed to mark a turning point in the OO7 films. Rather than the ruthless, dark agent of Connery, the Roger Moore era of a light-hearted, witty Bond was coming, and this film was supposed to launch it. Instead, it isolates itself from the series and turns out dull. They should've done it in the style of OHMSS, and THEN let Live and Let Die introduce Moore and his era.

I would definitely argue that the acting improved as the movie went on, and that's probably because the scenes got more dramatic and interesting.  At certain points, though, it was just bad. I'm thinking particularly of one of the early scenes between Brick and Maggie in their bedroom, right after Maggie is hit with ice cream by one of Mae's children (which, as I'm sure the film intended, were INCREDIBLY obnoxious, so kudos there).  Anyway, the acting in that particular scene is just poor...Elizabeth Taylor is shrill and over the top, and Paul Newman is too withdrawn and expressionless.  Maybe it's just the sheer contrast, but it was too much.  I should say though that later in the movie, given the more complex and subtle character interactions, both Taylor and Newman got much, much better and more interesting.Now I'm not sure how much sympathy the character of Brick is supposed to elicit from the audience.  Newman stays essentially true to the way Williams wrote the character particularly in the first half of the movie (after which the film script completely deviates from the play), and he comes across as self-involved, hateful, and just generally not a good person.  You really feel for Maggie, and while I'm sure that's the intention especially given the title of the play, I think that Newman (along with many others) should have given the character more subtlety, and a more complex relationship with Maggie than sheer revulsion.Now not to turn around and complain about the opposite problem, but for all of the improvements in character and acting in the latter half of the film, I feel that the director took some artistic liberties with the script that can't be forgiven.  While Brick's reconciliation with his father is heartfelt and indeed touching, the play script is much more subtle about it. Also, the ending was completely reworked by the director\/screenwriter to a much more Hollywood (i.e., neat, happy, etc.) ending.  Again, I have to say that the original play ending is much more interesting after fabricating the lie about being pregnant, rather than Brick coming to terms with himself and seemingly realizing his love for Maggie as evidenced by that last kiss in the movie(whatever happened to his latent homosexuality?), Maggie destroys all of his alcohol and tells him that after he sleeps with her and makes the lie a reality, they'll drink together.  Brick accepts this, and they enter into a sort of content partnership that itself is touching in an odd way.The film has its strong points, though.

For this performance the movie can be highly recommended. It reminded me of some of Rod Steiger's best acting feats. Dr. Jeffrey Wigand is mad, and his anger is somehow related to moral issues. In venting his anger publicly Wigand thinks he can reduce his inner pressure and cherish hopes that he may have a future life in peace with himself and with the world. The presentation of this character was very credible. It enables you to take Dr. Jeffrey Wigand at face value.A possibility to get release materializes for Wigand like a miracle in the form of Lowell Bergman, played by Al Pacino. Bergman is the producer of a TV show - the very instance of truth and honesty. Bergman is zapping through the real world. Today Beyruth, tomorrow the backwoods of Montana (the UNA-bomber, you know!), and in between Kentucky, where Wigand lives. Why is Wigand interesting for Bergman? Well, the guy worked for the tobacco industry and has to tell something! Tobacco related stuff promises the station high ratings. So the moral issue gets married with commerce.Pacino's character is one of those media-man sterotypes that annoy me since The Killing Fields. The mixture of arrogance, moral suprematism, pretentiousness and sham soul baring is really sickening. This feeling is augmentated by the all too smug suburban patchwork breakfast-cereal-commercial-family life as depicted in this movie. What's more, Pacino at all time looks as if he is just dying for a fag.After watching this movie you will know that smoking cigarettes can endanger your health. That's not really news, is it? Moreover, you will gain the impression that the big business tobacco industry is no better than a criminal organisation. Purportedly, the story of The Insider is based on actual facts.

The last 1\/2 hour of the movie had me bellowing out loud damn, sh*t and whoa. The twists and turns came out of nowhere, and were very plausible. This isn't some flick where there's a fantastic story that isn't believeable because of all the out-of-nowhere plot turns. This is solidly written, simple in it's way, but that simplicity is what makes for a truly good flick.So the plot was 10. The acting was quite good. Hell, they had quite a cast signed on for this.

It's a classic because it is so watchable time after time.If you watch The Creature From The Black Lagoon to critique the acting performances and the special effects, you are going to miss the beauty of this film.  It's all about mood and atmosphere.  It's all about the actors succeeding in their roles as corny scientists who buy into the silly notion of evolution in their intentionally confident wooden  performances.  It's about the music coming to a dramatic crescendo when the you see the webbed hand of the creature.  It's about the shadows and light in the photography. It's about the eyes of the Creature.  It's about going into the world of 1954 where these folks are on an expedition in hopes of making a scientific discovery and they end up in a creepy place but try to take it in stride.  In all of these areas this film succeeds brilliantly.  It uses visual images to spark the imagination and take us back in time to 1954 when these scientists considered themselves to be analytical and sensible.  Their world and time was different than ours.The Creature From The Black Lagoon is near the top of 1950's campy horror movies where the creature is a tragic character and the other actors play straight man to the creature's campy performance.  It's Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart's African Queen, science fiction style.  The interesting thing about the Creature From the Black Lagoon is that it doesn't let itself get bogged down by implausibilities because there are none in the minds of the characters.

This was at the time when I was first viewing Kurosawa's Rashomon and Ran and accidentally came across this gem.  Sure, the rest of the gang would be quoting along with Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange, but not one of them would dare sit down and watch this or 2001 A Space Odyssey.  Fools.Barry Lyndon is another sign of sheer genius on behalf of Kubrick.  Notice that in his career he is never concerned about making money, just creating an image and telling a story.  Imagine if Michael Bay did the same, he'd be out of the business in no time and having to sell his own movies at the Video Hut.  This movie is one of his better detailed (and yet mysteriously unsung) masterpieces that is so beautiful to look at that it almost becomes artistic pornography (in the sense of creating intense emotion).  This isn't to say that Barry Lyndon is vulgar.  By comparison to Eyes Wide Shut and The Shining, this is a kid's cartoon.Kubrick is once again a certified genius with his camera.  The elaborate and glamorous scenes ranging from duels to gardens and even just the opening prologue are beautifully rendered in a style reminiscent of Monet or other artists.  I found it interesting how Kubrick includes pigeons (doves?) in the final duel.  Perhaps John Woo gained some inspiration from this.The story is paper thin compared to 2001 and lacks much of the symbolism.  In fact, it is very hard to either sympathize with Ryan O'Neil as the title character because of his lack of portrayal.  As a whole, none of the characters gain either support or disapproval because of their fleeting presence.  The sets and costume designs themselves become more of a character than the actors.  Thankfully, the story is not as convoluted as I expected.  It flows nicely and never gets boring because of the variety of powerful elements infused into it.First off, kudos to both Ken Adam and Vernon Dixon for their brilliant production design.  I loved what Ken did with Dr. Strangelove (smart move for him to ditch the Bond series for that).  John Alcott is one of Kubrick's lesser cinematographers, but he is still very talented here.  I'm certain that, if he had lived longer, Kubrick would've kept using him.  He is not as concerned about symmetry, that or the topics aren't, as the rest of Kubrick's work.  The biggest irony about Barry Lyndon would have to be that everyone in the categories EXCEPT Kubrick won an Oscar for their work.  I think the Academy has something of a grudge against him because of his superior quality of work.Overall, a phenomenal quality of film that they just don't make anymore.
