I am glad that they didnt pick Jennifer Love Hewitt or Sarah Michelle Gellar for this role. Because Love Hewitt couldnt pull it off. Shes hot, but she cant act, lol. And Freddie Prinze Jr is ok. The acting in this film was good, it had the perfect cast. I like Laney's dad, i like her brother i like how all three of them were geeky!Another good thing was the story. a guy makes a bet he can turn any girl into prom queen, so his friends pick Laney Boggs, one of the nerdiest, and not smartest girl at school. She likes art and cant get into any art schools. The ending surprised me, i thought something different, but i like the ending because its not like most happy endings where the leading lady wins! hint hint. Rachael is fine!! even as a dork. She's All That is just like what high school is. You got the unpopular kids rushing around and just having fun being themselves, and u got the popular kids with no morals and just worry about how they look and what awards their winning and what girl their going to screw.One my favorite teen films, i hope they dont make a sequel or a remake because that will ruin it. I also like the title, the reason its called She's All That is because thats the name of the song a group of guys make up when Laney is elected prom queen, 4 stars! and 4 stars for the hottest actress RACHAEL LEIGH COOK! hope to see her in more movies.

It focuses on the efforts of four friends to get into a KISS concert after one of their moms destroys the tickets originally purchased. Most of the comedy in this one is of a physical nature, although there are a few lines that are pretty good.  Edward Furlong returns in this one to play Hawk, leader of the group of friends, as well as lead singer for their rock band Mystery.  He plays a burnout type character well, and is pretty funny during his efforts at striptease to win money for tickets.The rest of his friends are stereotypical with one exception Sam Huntington as Jeremiah Jam Bruce.  The band's drummer, he is shy and sensitive.  Although constantly badgered by his nagging mother (a wonderfully over the top Lin Shaye), he manages to be not only rebellious enough to be your typical teen, he exhibits a heart and feeling missing from most teen characters.Once again, Natasha Lyonne is woefully underused.  Her character of Christine (KISS fans will realize that the two main teen females are named for songs  Christine Sixteen, and the ubiuqitous Beth) is basically a disco loving tart, dressed in short skirts and acting as if she is better than you.  This, along with American Pie really could have utilized this talented young actress better.  Speaking of Beth, Melanie Lynskey plays that character.  She is hopelessly in love with Jam, and due to a disturbance from his mother on her last day at Robert F. Kennedy High may be unable to tell him how she feels......or will she?.............. Ms. Lynskey does an admirable enough job with her part, Beth is the girl next door, the one everyone just loves.  She comes across as both shy and vunerable.  Good job.  Now on to KISS themselves. (SPOILER ALERT!!) They appear only in the final scenes of the movie to play the title song, albeit an abbreviated version.  While they recreated a 70's era show, complete with set and costumes, that appears to be the only real effort put into this movie by them.  This movie is clearly focused on the fans and their loyalty to the band.  While it pains me to say this, as I count myself proudly among the ranks of the KISS Army, it didnt give enough of a thank you to the fans.Detroit Rock City is not meant to be taken seriously, nor is it Oscar material.

Ms. Lynskey does an admirable enough job with her part, Beth is the girl next door, the one everyone just loves.  She comes across as both shy and vunerable.  Good job.  Now on to KISS themselves. (SPOILER ALERT!!) They appear only in the final scenes of the movie to play the title song, albeit an abbreviated version.  While they recreated a 70's era show, complete with set and costumes, that appears to be the only real effort put into this movie by them.  This movie is clearly focused on the fans and their loyalty to the band.  While it pains me to say this, as I count myself proudly among the ranks of the KISS Army, it didnt give enough of a thank you to the fans.Detroit Rock City is not meant to be taken seriously, nor is it Oscar material.  Its about having a good time and following your dreams, no matter what others try to do.  KISS are the unequaled masters of that realm, although this one will rank with KISS Meets The Phantom of The Park in terms of cheesy.1 out of 5 ","genre":"Comedy, Music"},{"date":"11 January 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  You knew it had to happen.

The film, while trying to be interesting, falls flat for several reasons The characters, the script, the editing, the plot, and the theological inconsistencies. Aside from these problems, the film has some merit.The range of characters has not grown since Clerks.  While Jay and Silent Bob are funny, they soon become a standing joke that grows tiresome. Does every film require them?  I appreciate how Hitchcock always put himself in one scene in his movies, but Kevin Smith is beating this concept to death.  The other characters are interesting, but the film never develops them. Linda Fiorentino's character, the main character, is developed to two dimensions but it is difficult to sympathize or identify with her character. The peripheral characters have less development and appear as vehicles for monologues rather than possessing any depth.The script, which was written before Clerks, shows its age and its lack of development.  The cast is the best of any Smith film, but the script does not do justice to their talent. The central problem is that Smith has the tendency to write short monologues rather than dialogue.  Smith attempts to weave together monologues in the hope that he can make something develop. At times this has worked brilliantly, see Clerks, but in Dogma, it simply detracts from the film.  I suggest he study the screenplays of Elmore Leonard and David Mamet to gain a feel for how to pace and develop dialogues.  He needs to expand his writing capabilities to encompass narrative if he is ever hopes to write a successful drama.  If he continues to make films that never escape the script formula of Clerks, he will never grow as a writer.  Chasing Amy nearly escaped at some points, but it failed because Smith could not decide to write a drama or a comedy.Smith has an excellent grasp of the everyday life's banalities that often pass for depth, but his screen writing lets him down.  Will every Smith film treat us to Star Wars references or apparently glib monologues where a character deconstructs a well known icon with the assumption that they are saying something profound?  See Loki's first monologue. Characters seem to have suffered lobotomies because they cannot see through such superficial analysis. To continue to write such monologues and assume that it passes for dialogues is a waste of talent.Only two actors seem to escape the monologue trap Alan Rickman and Linda Fiorentino.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon try to escape and in that attempt they demonstrate their acting talent. However even they succumb.The editing breaks down from time to time. For example, the film jumps from an impending bar fight to corporate boardroom without sufficient transition.  While the boardroom scene was insightful, worshipping the golden calf, the scene dragged after that point. The scene does not add to our understanding of the film.  The final scenes also suffer from editing defects, but by that point who cares.The plot starts from a simple premise and quickly becomes needlessly confused as developments unfold with near randomness. The film does not have a strong narrative and that is a problem. Characters arrive to move the plot along by offering new monologues, but the plot does not gain any focus with the new characters. The hero and the nemesis theme works well, but the plot seems confused as to who is the real nemesis the Devil or the Angels? Another motif, the voyage, which is common in nearly all films, quickly bogs down into logical inconsistencies or simply into convenient monologue situations.  A film that demonstrates a superior use of the voyage motif is Deliverance.  Then again, Dogma does not have the narrative of Deliverance. The following are a few examples of the poor logic and the monologue enablers. If Alan Rickman's character can magically transport the characters, why have the voyage?  The monologue situation seems forced with the arrival of Rufus and the completely coincidental meeting of the main characters on the train?  The scene adds nothing to the overall plot because it reveals no new information or new motivations for any of the characters. A further logical inconsistencies is that Jay and Silent Bob, mere mortals, beat up two angels, but later are unable? Finally, why would two angels firstly talk to a devil and secondly why would they believe the devil? The devil is considered the master of all lies.On the theological points made in the film, they are not even wrong. Smith is confused about Catholicism.  Such a confusion is probably an indictment of his religious education as much as an indictment of his ability to do theological research. For example, when did the Muses appear in Catholic Doctrine?  Why does Smith seem intent on believing that God can be made to suit Man's image? Smith's material on Catholicism's foibles is simply rehashing familiar themes rather than developing anything interesting.  The jokes are already stale and the theological points he thinks he is making are dubious at best. Even the film's central theological premise is logically and theologically flawed. It can be argued that the film relies on religion in general and Catholicism in particular as a vehicle, but the material and its misinformed use detract from the film. By contrast, the film Seven, which had no theological pretensions, does a much better job using religion as general vehicle.  The Exorcist, which relies upon Catholicism in particular, proves to be superior in how it treats religion as plot vehicle.In the end, Smith appears unable to decide whether he wants to make a drama or a comedy.  It appears he possesses the ability to do comedy, but lacks the necessary script writing talent, the ability to develop a strong narrative, to create a drama.  A pity such acting and writing talent is wasted on a film that confuses irreverence for profundity and theology for drama.

The film, while trying to be interesting, falls flat for several reasons The characters, the script, the editing, the plot, and the theological inconsistencies. Aside from these problems, the film has some merit.The range of characters has not grown since Clerks.  While Jay and Silent Bob are funny, they soon become a standing joke that grows tiresome. Does every film require them?  I appreciate how Hitchcock always put himself in one scene in his movies, but Kevin Smith is beating this concept to death.  The other characters are interesting, but the film never develops them. Linda Fiorentino's character, the main character, is developed to two dimensions but it is difficult to sympathize or identify with her character. The peripheral characters have less development and appear as vehicles for monologues rather than possessing any depth.The script, which was written before Clerks, shows its age and its lack of development.  The cast is the best of any Smith film, but the script does not do justice to their talent. The central problem is that Smith has the tendency to write short monologues rather than dialogue.  Smith attempts to weave together monologues in the hope that he can make something develop. At times this has worked brilliantly, see Clerks, but in Dogma, it simply detracts from the film.  I suggest he study the screenplays of Elmore Leonard and David Mamet to gain a feel for how to pace and develop dialogues.  He needs to expand his writing capabilities to encompass narrative if he is ever hopes to write a successful drama.  If he continues to make films that never escape the script formula of Clerks, he will never grow as a writer.  Chasing Amy nearly escaped at some points, but it failed because Smith could not decide to write a drama or a comedy.Smith has an excellent grasp of the everyday life's banalities that often pass for depth, but his screen writing lets him down.  Will every Smith film treat us to Star Wars references or apparently glib monologues where a character deconstructs a well known icon with the assumption that they are saying something profound?  See Loki's first monologue. Characters seem to have suffered lobotomies because they cannot see through such superficial analysis. To continue to write such monologues and assume that it passes for dialogues is a waste of talent.Only two actors seem to escape the monologue trap Alan Rickman and Linda Fiorentino.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon try to escape and in that attempt they demonstrate their acting talent. However even they succumb.The editing breaks down from time to time. For example, the film jumps from an impending bar fight to corporate boardroom without sufficient transition.  While the boardroom scene was insightful, worshipping the golden calf, the scene dragged after that point. The scene does not add to our understanding of the film.  The final scenes also suffer from editing defects, but by that point who cares.The plot starts from a simple premise and quickly becomes needlessly confused as developments unfold with near randomness. The film does not have a strong narrative and that is a problem. Characters arrive to move the plot along by offering new monologues, but the plot does not gain any focus with the new characters. The hero and the nemesis theme works well, but the plot seems confused as to who is the real nemesis the Devil or the Angels? Another motif, the voyage, which is common in nearly all films, quickly bogs down into logical inconsistencies or simply into convenient monologue situations.  A film that demonstrates a superior use of the voyage motif is Deliverance.  Then again, Dogma does not have the narrative of Deliverance. The following are a few examples of the poor logic and the monologue enablers. If Alan Rickman's character can magically transport the characters, why have the voyage?  The monologue situation seems forced with the arrival of Rufus and the completely coincidental meeting of the main characters on the train?  The scene adds nothing to the overall plot because it reveals no new information or new motivations for any of the characters. A further logical inconsistencies is that Jay and Silent Bob, mere mortals, beat up two angels, but later are unable? Finally, why would two angels firstly talk to a devil and secondly why would they believe the devil? The devil is considered the master of all lies.On the theological points made in the film, they are not even wrong. Smith is confused about Catholicism.  Such a confusion is probably an indictment of his religious education as much as an indictment of his ability to do theological research. For example, when did the Muses appear in Catholic Doctrine?  Why does Smith seem intent on believing that God can be made to suit Man's image? Smith's material on Catholicism's foibles is simply rehashing familiar themes rather than developing anything interesting.  The jokes are already stale and the theological points he thinks he is making are dubious at best. Even the film's central theological premise is logically and theologically flawed. It can be argued that the film relies on religion in general and Catholicism in particular as a vehicle, but the material and its misinformed use detract from the film. By contrast, the film Seven, which had no theological pretensions, does a much better job using religion as general vehicle.  The Exorcist, which relies upon Catholicism in particular, proves to be superior in how it treats religion as plot vehicle.In the end, Smith appears unable to decide whether he wants to make a drama or a comedy.  It appears he possesses the ability to do comedy, but lacks the necessary script writing talent, the ability to develop a strong narrative, to create a drama.  A pity such acting and writing talent is wasted on a film that confuses irreverence for profundity and theology for drama.

This was the first time I had ever seen the Third Man and I can honestly say that I have many conflicting feelings about it.  For its cinematic accomplishments, I have to give it an 8\/10. Its beautifully haunting scenes of post-war Vienna still remain clear in my mind. It truly does not seem like a film from 1949 in this aspect.  However, it is considered to be the greatest suspense thriller of its kind, and it is this aspect that I highly disagree with.  I never felt a sense of suspense or impending danger throughout the movie, and as far as suspense is concerned, it is no match for any of the great Hitchcock gems, or say the Manchurian Candidate.  If you are expecting a suspensful thriller, I doubt you will find it here. In my humble opinion, a major reason for the lack of suspense, is the use of the ever present sounds of that damned zither. While it is an interesting choice of instruments to use, I don't feel that it is appropriate or effective. I found it to be hugely annoying and if there was a way to mute it I would have. It did not supplement the mood or action of the story in any way and constantly seemed to be out of place. A major disappointment here. Thank God they chose to leave it out during the final sewer chase, as it would have destroyed this wonderful scene. There are movies that I give 8-10\/10 that I absolutely loved and fully enjoyed, and then there are others that I have to give high marks because they are great films, but I did not wholly enjoy. This is the case with The Third Man.  Cinematically, it is perfect.  However, I don't feel that the whole package was so.  I would welcome any or all comments regarding this movie and would love to hear others feelings regarding the zither!!!

What Episode 1 could bring to the audience was the beginning of a saga started many years before, to open a new chapter in the life's of the Skywalkers and of the force. Written and directed by George Lucas like the original Episode 1 is brimming with exoctic locations and far off worlds populated by strange creatures. The special effects may have becomes more life like but the film has trully kept it's story telling ability. It would have been very easy for the film makers to have ignored the true story line and to have concentrated on the special effects using them to hold the film together. What they have created is a film which in the words of Harrison Ford is  Story telling with effects . Episode 1 was always going to have one major draw back, what ever they did in the film the audience still knew the future of many of the characters, and those which they do not know exactly they will use their star wars minds to calculate the future paths of them. There will not be a person in the cinema who will not know the fate of Anakin Skywalker, and if there is then what are you doing watching this film, for it is obvious that you are not a fan.The only major problem for me was the fact that the technology has increased to such a level that there are of course many more creatures featured in this film that in the original 3.  What is concerning me is the flow of the film when placed together when all finished to create the complete 9 part film. The technology and effects will be of todays high quality and standards for the first 3 films, then reduce slightly to the 1977 quality and standard for the next 3 and then jump back to the same quality as the first 3 if not even better. I feel that is may affect the cinematic flow of the film when watched all together. In some ways I feel it may have been better to have blended some of the old techniques used in the original film ie actually using model instead of the large use of computer graphics with todays technology and then used the advanced work for the final 3 films. There will be many people who will think I have lost my mind, but I can assure you I'm completly sane, I'm just looking at this film from a technical point of view, and also as a Star wars fan.This film is the first in 9 films, and so has to set the scene the same as A New Hope had 22 years ago, if these films follow the same film style as the previous films, then we are to expect a much darker instalment from the second of the Prequels and then a lighter more fun third instalment. The first film has the hardest job, by having to introduce all of the characters, and to set the scene for the rest of the 8 instalments to come in the future.Overall I liked the look and feel of Episode 1 apart from the few minor concerns as outlined above, and as a star wars film I felt it had the right feel to it.

Ewan McGreggor continues his bright future with yet another wonderfully portrayed character as the aspiring law student who befalls tragedy in a grotesque homicidal\/necropheliac serial killer's plot. Every other character in the movie was well portrayed with many great, however under-rated actors such as josh brolin, brad dourif (one of my favorite's in the movie) who plays a cynical doctor, and john c. reily who is recently known to tag along in most of paul thomas anderson's recent epic masterpieces which include boogie nights and magnolia.The actors aren't what makes the movie, but the surrealism and dark atmosphere that the director produces for the viewers. Most of the film was shot in horrifying solitude in the medical examiner's building and left one's imagination run wild to what heart-stopping event could arrive.This was a magnificent element that helped Nightwatch achieve it's superior 'scariness'.I had picked up this movie merely because it looked violent and while i was watching the credits roll in the intro to the movie, i was intrigued to why academy award winning producers would make a lame B-movie. However, not even into half the movie, it was shown to me that i was gravely mistaken. For those who love an extremely suspenseful thriller, you shall definitely enjoy this one.

A wonderful sensation permeates this story in which Death takes a body to wear (I would like to choose too...) to discover what its like to be a human being. Hopkins and Pitt act like they've never done anything else - they are brilliant. If you doubt my words, watch the first 15 minutes and tell me don't you get goose bumps when Hopkins hears Death whisper in his ear? I sure did. I hail this film as one of the best - ever.
