At all. His films were just not something that seemed to interest me back then. Now, I can't get enough of them! And I'm not talking about ANY of the stuff he's made in the last 20 years! I'm speaking strictly old school. As a matter of fact, some of his films would probably make my short list in certain categories of my favorite or even best films. For example, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER make my list of favorite Westerns. DIRTY HARRY definitely is near the top of favorite (and best) cop films. I even like all of the DIRTY HARRY sequels (except maybe THE DEAD POOL) and appreciate them the more I see them. Point is Mr. Eastwood knew how to entertain and make really good, solid films, whether he starred, directed, or did both. And this film, THE GAUNTLET, is among my favorites of his.The irony is that, I don't think that THE GAUNTLET was too well-received when it first came out. Probably thought of as some kind of DIRTY HARRY rip-off since Eastwood played a cop, named Ben Shockley. But in THE GAUNTLET, Shockley ain't no Dirty Harry! In fact, while Harry Callahan was a cop who ALWAYS got results, Ben Shockley seems to be rather a lazy cop on the brink of losing his job and who drinks too much. Also, Shockley doesn't have near the machismo, toughness, and confidence that Dirty Harry has. Even in the scenes where Shockley acts like a tough guy, it doesn't come off nearly as effective as when Harry does it. But that's not a knock against Eastwood's acting. I think it is purposeful to show that Shockley is a rather under-confident cop with seemingly nowhere to go. Harry was a high-ranking Inspector in a big city (San Francisco) where he witnessed and was exposed to all kinds and degrees of crime; Shockley is basically a desk cop in a not-as-much-of-a-big-city (Phoenix) where pretty much nothing happens and he is essentially living a boring existence. Harry acted tough as result of being jaded due to losing his wife at a young age and from years of being exposed to big-city crime and scum; plus, he was good at it!Shockley acts tough as an absolute last resort and has never had a prominent relationship to speak of and lives in a rather 'peaceful' town. And it is these anti-Harry characteristics that Shockley brings to the table that makes THE GAUNTLET a unique film all its own and not a DIRTY HARRY wannabe. Shockley wants to get this one job done to redeem himself and realize that he can do it. Shockley's mission is to transport a prisoner from Las Vegas back to Phoenix to testify in a big court trial. The prisoner is Augusta Gus Mally (played by super-sexy Sondra Locke, Eastwood's old flame from the 70s and early 80s). Locke has appeared in several Eastwood films, mostly as his female lead or protagonist and this is my favorite collaboration of theirs. It seems like in THE GAUNTLET, Eastwood brings out what was so desirable and sexy about Locke, while at the same time creating a refreshingly interesting character in Gus Malley. Gus is a prostitute who unwittingly overheard a conversation of some Phoenix big shot who is in collusion with the mob and she is needed to testify against him in the hopes that he will help bring the mob down.Gus actually has a lot of those characteristics that Shockley lacks. Gus is tough, streetwise, confident, cocky and has a take-no-prisoners attitude. She is the perfect compliment to make Shockley a complete cop. Locke exudes sexuality in the role of Gus, but it's not because she plays a hooker. Her sex appeal comes not just from her looks, but also from her attitude, confidence and smarts, not just street, but also book smarts (she has a college degree, which doesn't mean much now but definitely meant something back in 1977!).Gus doesn't want to go back to Phoenix to testify because she knows that the mob has put a hit out on her. At first, Shockley doesn't know that Gus is an important witness, he just thinks she is testifying in some low level trial. So their initial relationship is strained to say the least mutual hatred would be the best way to put it! Eventually, as the bullets and body counts multiply, Shockley becomes even more determined to get Gus to Phoenix to finish the job. He wants to prove to the big boys that he can do it.THE GAUNTLET is a very entertaining film and shows Eastwood's talents as a director. It is shot mostly outdoors in actual locations of Vegas, Phoenix, and the desert. The action scenes are crisp and confidently shot. Even the small roles are memorable and well-defined. You'll see a lot of old Eastwood collaborators playing small parts in this film that you recognize from his other earlier flicks. The main appeal of THE GAUNTLET though is of Mr. Eastwood. It shows how truly talented he is in his craft and that he could cut a damn good action flick!

It's the kind of film you have so much fun watching, you can't even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath.Top amateur tennis contender Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a singularly weird, louche stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages, Bruno knows all about Guy's problems with his no-good wife Miriam, and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father, who wants to put Bruno in an institution. Guy laughs it off, but Bruno ain't kidding, as Guy finds out to his peril.It's a great premise for a murder story, and Hitchcock gives Strangers On A Train a run for all its worth, with the help of Walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any Hitchcock film, including Anthony Perkins in Psycho. While Perkins makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain, Walker as Anthony is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement park.What drives Bruno? Many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty Guy. Yes, Bruno lights up the old gay-dar, but Guy seems happy enough on love's rebound with socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest for Guy could just as easily be envy, for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home, letting Mommy file his nails.Oh, I certainly admire people who do things, Bruno purrs, looking like a cat eyeing a mouse. You know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important.Later on, Bruno calls himself a bum, accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him, even as he wrecks Guy's life with his homicidal meddling. It's the ultimate perverse underdog's tale. There's a sense of integrity about Bruno, in his dogged dedication, which commands our respect and which Hitchcock plays to so brilliantly. When Bruno floats away from the scene of his big crime, am I the only sick person in this world who's actually happy for him? I think not, yet Hitchcock keeps the story on a right-enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen. We don't want Bruno to win, exactly, but we enjoy his élan as he tries.Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. Hitchcock always managed at least 2-3 good setpiece sequences per movie; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone. (20 Big Shows the neon side at the entrance says, and they aren't kidding.) Script, camera-work, a gripping tennis match, Ruth Roman's jaw-dropping figure, it's all too much greatness for one film to contain. Even Granger does his callow-youth thing here with more risible plausibility than Gregory Peck ever managed.You can call this a clinic in movie-making, but clinic sounds too dull. Strangers On A Train is good nasty fun, all the way through, leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along. Heck, I'll take that ride over again in a second!

Definitely for a children movie this movie is of course of very high class, with fabulous looking sets, a whole load of well known British actors and an highly experienced crew involved.The movie forms a nice first set up for the future series of Harry Potter movies. Still I'm glad the movies and its characters have matured a lot since this movie. Probably also has to do with the fact that this movie and the second were directed by Chris Columbus who is an experienced children movie director, while the other Harry Potter movies were directed by more 'serious' directors. Yes, it makes this movie a good children's movie to watch but also sort of makes this movie look and feel more outdated than any of the other Harry Potter movies, which also goes at the expense of its re-watchable value.Nevertheless, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone remains good quality- and fun film. It knows to create an entire new world of its own with lots of often strange characters in it.The movie is of course a set up and the first establishment of a long running series of movies. This means that the movie consists for a big part out of character introductions. Yes, this results in the fact that there are a bit too many characters in the movie, also since some of them don't even seem to serve a purpose at all for the story but this got resolved in the later movies, by simply leaving out some characters but by introducing many new ones as well. So its sort of problem solving with another problem. Also a bit of a shame that the movie is lacking a real central villain. Professor Snape is treated as a villain, even though we learn by the end of the movie that he's not such a bad guy after all. The real main villain if the movie is of course Voldemort but he gets mostly only mentioned by name and basically doesn't do an awful lot in the movie and only sort of shows up in the very end of the movie. Not the way to treat a villain in my opinion, even though its of course clear from this movie on that he is going to play a much bigger and more important role in the future Harry Potter movies. I however in a case like this feel that they should had putted in a new and different villain besides Voldemort, since this movie is definitely lacking a sense of danger, excitement and action, even though the movie never bores, despite its quite long running time (for a children's movie anyway.).The movie its quality is also surely being uplifted by its presence of well known and respected actors, such as Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman among many others. Each of them are giving fine performances but it are mostly Harris and Rickman that catch the eye with their performances. The child actors are also managing fine, although its definitely and luckily true that their acting improved throughout during the later movies.The movie is great looking and knows to create a magic new world, with its set, costumes and make-up.

Yes, this results in the fact that there are a bit too many characters in the movie, also since some of them don't even seem to serve a purpose at all for the story but this got resolved in the later movies, by simply leaving out some characters but by introducing many new ones as well. So its sort of problem solving with another problem. Also a bit of a shame that the movie is lacking a real central villain.

The real main villain if the movie is of course Voldemort but he gets mostly only mentioned by name and basically doesn't do an awful lot in the movie and only sort of shows up in the very end of the movie. Not the way to treat a villain in my opinion, even though its of course clear from this movie on that he is going to play a much bigger and more important role in the future Harry Potter movies. I however in a case like this feel that they should had putted in a new and different villain besides Voldemort, since this movie is definitely lacking a sense of danger, excitement and action, even though the movie never bores, despite its quite long running time (for a children's movie anyway.).The movie its quality is also surely being uplifted by its presence of well known and respected actors, such as Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman among many others.

Yes, Im one of these people that will walk into the supposedly haunted house alone whilst bricking myself, the kind of guy that will hang out the side of the roller-coaster in order to raise the scar factor just that little bit higher. I love horror because I love to be scared. Now, the funny thing is I very rarely find horror movies scary. But there is that one film floating around waiting to scare the bejeezus out of us. To date, there have only ever been two movies that have managed to do what they're supposed to and they are The Shining and The Exorcist. The Japanese film Audition came pretty close but it just failed to make the leap from being simply disturbing to being balls to the walls terrifying.Well congratulations Candyman, for you have succeeded where many others have failed and made me feel the most uncomfortable watching a movie since, well, the first time I saw The Exorcist and The Shining. Sure, you could say this is a slasher movie at heart, I mean, there's plenty of hacking and slashing and the main antagonist has a hook for a hand but in shifting the Gothic tale of pain and suffering from the haunted castle to the urban squalor of the projects in Chicago, the film creates a palpable sense of dread from the get go, personifying what makes urban legends so damn scary in the first place they take place in a neighbourhood just like your own. How many times have our friends claimed to have known someone who has been harassed by phone calls whilst babysitting only to have the caller be in the house with you (The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs)? I remember hearing these tales all through my college days and never really believing any of them because, well, they were stupid. But that didn't stop them being less creepy. And as the urban legend of the Candyman begins to manifest itself in the real world, you really begin to feel the characters dread.The Candyman himself deserves to be in the horror hall of fame with the likes of Hannibal Lector and Freddy Kruger. Not showing up until well passed the half way point, his entrance is one of the most unnerving things I've ever had to sit through. Tony Todd really portrays this guy with a great sense of menace, his movements conveying a slight air of pretension but, at the same time, being really imposing. Probably helps the Todd is 9 feet tall and 7 feet wide (well&#133;that's a lie, but he's pretty big). But it's not his stance that makes him so effective. This is a performance that's entirely vocal. In a stroke of genius, the film makers have amplified his voice, making it dominate the soundtrack every time he speaks. It becomes instantly distressing and I found both my brother and I shifting uncomfortably in our seats, looking at each other with big frowns of unease.Despite the high levels of blood and gore, the death scenes actually turn out to be pretty terrifying themselves, with one in particular taking place off screen, leaving the viewer with a barrage of horrific screams and gut wrenching sound effects that made it seem all the more worse, causing my brother and I, again, to shift nervously in our seats. The main plus points in the effectiveness of Candyman's killing spree ist hat his victims aren't horror archetypes these are innocent people. And the fact that the film is played so straight faced makes it somehow worse.Now let me address you quickly about something that bothers me about horror movies. Now if you think about it, the idea of a psychopathic killer running around murdering people is nasty. Sure the horror genre has taken a more tongue-in-cheek way of doing this as of late to, to the point where it eventually becomes fun to see who will die next and how. Now that's OK in a Final Destination kind of way but for me, the idea of someone in a mask stalking teenagers isn't really fun at all, it's really nasty. I mean c'mon, how are you gonna react when you have some sharp instrument thrust into your gullet? You're not gonna have the big breasted blond clasping her hands on her face and scream Hammer Horror style as if she's just had a spider crawl up her leg rather than been stabbed, in reality, it's gonna really bloody hurt. Now being that this film is totally straight face and deadly serious, that is EXACTLY how these victims react. I wont go into the gory details needless to say, it's disturbing. This is just a very effective horror movie. It managed to scare the hell out of me and that's bloody unprecedented. It was so tense in places that if anyone had walked in at that precise moment they would've been blasted through the roof on a stream of my own terrified p*ss. OK, that's an over exaggeration but to say it's pant-wettingly scary ain't far off. Obviously my gushing review will quite possibly hype it up to the stage that anyone curious enough to see it after this will wonder Luke, you charismatic stallion, what were you getting so worked up about? but you know what? Get lost you cynical nit pickers, it's a horror movie that does exactly what it says on the tin and with gusto too. Anyone who doesn't find this scary or at least disturbing on some level is lying to save face&#133;I feel very passionate about this.5\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 June 2008","score":"","review":" I love my horror, but what I love most about it is the feeling of being scared.

This is a great example of how filmmakers with virtually no money can produce a great horror classic. Or at least a great horror cult classic. The Man is really creepy. He's the one who's following Mary everywhere. There is this one scene in which Mary sees these different ghost or ghouls dancing around and the Man emerges from the center of the group and slowly stalks towards the camera (Mary's point of view) and it is by far the creepiest part. That and there's a scene... no, I won't say any more. You just need to see this film. Trust me just watch it alone late at night with the lights out. On second thought maybe I'm over hyping it. If you go in with high expectations you'll be disappointed. So after you read this, read reviews from people who didn't like it.

There is this one scene in which Mary sees these different ghost or ghouls dancing around and the Man emerges from the center of the group and slowly stalks towards the camera (Mary's point of view) and it is by far the creepiest part.

I didn't even know it was a remake. And it was OK. I know most people (a lot of them have posted comments and reviews on this site) didn't like it. A lot of them compared it to the original, where as I had nothing to compare it to. And I still stand by it and say it's a good movie. Anyway, it wasn't until later that I found out that the original even existed and even later when I watched it. I bought the movie in a four movie collection and it was the third movie in the set. The set in question was the AMC Monsterfest Collection Cult Classics- Collection 1. For those who have read my previous reviews I will not go into much detail about the collection. Needless to say I was not too impressed with the AMC set thus far. So one night my girlfriend at the time went to bed and I was up late watching movies. Around 2 or 3 in the morning I decided I need to finish this DVD collection. So I put in Carnival of Souls and turned out the lights. And it turned out to be one of the best, and eerie, movies I ever saw. It was just the perfect setting to watch this movie. The film has a surreal quality and has a great story.

A Nightmare On Elm Street is about the clever, scary Freddy. Not only is Freddy more clever than Jason Voorhees as a killer, but A Nightmare On Elm Street is done a whole lot smarter that any Friday the 13th film. However, A Nightmare On Elm Street was lacking the true suspense that Halloween gave. Nightmare DOES have quite a few good jump scenes. It is also very atmospheric, and never really stops being scary due to atmosphere. There are a few gore scenes, but none are gross. The gore content is high, though. Higher than Friday the 13th and MUCH higher than Halloween.A Nightmare On Elm Street is about a group of kids who are starting to have nightmares. These are however, not normal nightmares. All these dreams are about is this strange, burnt man who chases after this group of teens. These nightmares seem to be too real to be mere dreams, but that's all they could be... right?A Nightmare On Elm Street stars Robert England, Heather Langenkamp, Amanda Wyss, Jsu Garcia, and for the first time ever, we see Johny Depp on screen. Each actor did a good job with their performance, but I felt that there was something missing with the character chemistry. This may be due to acting problems or due to a poor script\/storyline. However, the viewer wouldn't be worried about the actors performances. The viewer would more likely be terrified, so the chemistry doesn't take away from the movie for first time viewing. However, re-watching can be a bummer.Now here we come with the other cons Wes Craven's directing. I'm going to be honest with you guys. I have never been a fan of any of Wes Craven's films (especially Scream.) He did an above average job on A Nightmare On Elm Street, but it's still nothing phenomenal. But then again, first time viewers wouldn't care about the directing. All they would care about is the constant scares.Another thing that disappoints me about this movie is the inability it has to impress people the 3rd or 4th time they view it. I have viewed A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 times now, and each time it louses some of its mystique. I have not watched it for several months now, and I do not intend on watching again for at least one more month. I want to forget about pieces of the movie, so I can be scared by it again. A Nightmare On Elm Street is a truly frightening movie, but once the viewer has all of the scares figured out... what's left? One more thing I would like to mention is about how terrible the sequels are. The sequels are all either silly or poorly done. Those are however, different reviews.

I can understand why some critics would, or people that just thought the first was okay, however, I enjoyed both the previous film before this and this film itself, thinking this film is really funny and enjoyable. It was great fun and total entertainment to watch, and I have watched it quite a few times.The comedy might have been a little too over-the-top and repitive at times, as it seemed like this one tried really hard to please the audience when the first one just went with the flow, but that is really how a lot of comedies are like, even more so now than then, so I do not see how this one is any different. Anna Faris pulls off Cindy Campbell's character wonderfully, again, and nobody could have done it better than her. All the other familiar characters, as well as the new ones, are excellently portrayed and likable, in a sense, and the movie has a high replay value, for me at least. This movie was not a disappoint to me either, because I thought it lived up to Scary Movie perfectly.There were a lot of funny parts in this film, such as the opening song, the Charlie's Angels spoof scene, the scene were buddy gives back Cindy's book, and the Cindy singing in the car scene. If you have seen the film, you know what I am talking about and hopefully enjoyed those scenes as well.

Full Metal Jacket isn't all that great to look at it, and doesn't have any great stylistic flare worth noting, and is the same old recycled and clichéd settings and scenes that we've seen over and over. Full Metal Jacket is a kind of disjointed film told through a boot camp setting in the first half and a war setting in second half. The basic training elements of the film have been done numerous times, but nothing like this. This is Full Metal Jacket' strongest element as we see some great film-making of things we've seen done numerous times before, but here; Kubrick brings us one of the most memorable characters in film history with Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). Ermey is fantastic and plays the part as if he's been through it all and seen it all before (That's because he has). The basic training is brutal and if you think the Marine Corps is brutal; Full Metal Jacket raises the bar and heightens reality to unprecedented levels. The first half of the film is done to near masterful levels. There were only two real issues The inconsistent acting from Vincent D'Onofrio who plays Gomer Pyle and the never ending shellacking that Hartman rains down on his young men. D'Onofrio is great in one scene and absolutely over-the-top in the next-- over-the-top in a campy sense. Private Pyle is a fat-body, and a screw up. He manages to screw everything up to the point were he hides a jelly donut in his footlocker. We see scene after scene of Pyle screwing up as D'Onofrio goes so far over-the-top that at times he puts this look on his face as if he's trying to imitate a person with Down Syndrome- it gets that bad. In most scenes his face works to eerie perfection. Hartman, then tells his men that they need to motive Pyle because he has failed, thus the corps failed him because they have not helped him motivate Pyle. So they beat him one night as he sleeps with bars of soap wrapped in towels and everything changes. Pyle starts talking to his gun. He becomes an excellent shot and a marksman and starts looking more and more like a soldier ready for combat except we get the not-so- subtle feeling that Pyle is going to go AWOL, and, of course, he does. None of the characters seem to know, but we sure do. This will bring us to the best scene in the entire film, which takes place half way through the film. Pyle becomes the second best character, only to Hartman, but once we leave the basic training scenes we're thrown into a war we've seen before and a war we've seen captured on film much better. Full Metal Jacket offers a lot of laughs in the first half of the film and actually goes for too many laughs with Hartman in the opening scene as Kubrick and company just go for the next joke about their sexual orientation. It's funny and Hartman has some great one-liners, but for a drill instructor it gets to the point where he becomes the comedian instead of the drill instructor. After so much it got the point where I was thinking, When is he going to get back to his speech and stop calling these guys fags and queers 15,000 different ways? Full Metal Jacket shows how dehumanizing war can be as we see born to kill written on the helmet of Joker (Mathew Modine) with a peace sign on his chest that represent the duality of man (as we're told). Basically this is questioning the idea that war will solve the world's issues- killing people will create peace. The problem with the film is that we get all of what Kubrick tries to sell us about the effects of war in the first half of the film, when, interesting enough, doesn't even take place during a war. Maybe that's why it made it so strong, but the final half is the same exact theme and message, but now we're actually in the war and it doesn't have as big an impact. The action sequences and the fight sequences are clichéd and stupid and look amateurish with the slow motion shots of blood spattering everywhere, and echoing cries of pain are heard from afar. This is supposed to strike a cord in you, that's why Kubrick elongates the pain. In Saving Private Ryan, a film done over ten years later, in a very similar situation, Spielberg doesn't use any camera tricks or slow motion shots to make us feel a certain way. He just shows it as it would happen Realistically. This creates a much stronger reaction than having a guy slowly fall and flop around as we're being told how to feel. It comes off as an unnatural and unrealistic force feeding because Kubrick is almost afraid his audience won't care for these guys, so he tries to make us care. Full Metal Jacket, ultimately doesn't have much direction or anything new to say on the subject. It's a film about the soldiers, but the soldiers are all clichés. They're all the same exact people who are represented as nothing but barbaric animals. I don't know if his intention was to glorify veterans and troops, but this film is insulting to the men and woman who protect and serve.
