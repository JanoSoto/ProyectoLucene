Then the credits roll and we cut to D.C., where we find out that the marine getting gagged and tied died that night. The two marines that were doing the gagging and tying are charged with murder and flown out to D.C.The task of lead counsel is assigned to Daniel Kaffee (Cruise), a lieutenant junior grade with a track record for plea bargaining and smooth talking. Lt. Cmdr. Jo Galloway (Moore) is assigned to be co-counsel, despite the fact that she tried to get in as lead counsel. They start the investigation down in Cuba where they meet Col. Nathan Jessup (Nicholson), the man who ordered the two men to give Private Santiago the Code Red, which accidentally led to his death. Of course, Jessup doesn't tell this to Danny or Jo. Why would he? He'd look pretty bad for it, right? So when they get back to D.C. and do some legal maneuvering with their clients and the prosecution, Danny manages to get a deal for a mere two years of prison time, where they are actually home in six months. And the two that are charged turn it down on principle, because they still believe they have done nothing wrong. Danny decides that he wants to get a different lawyer assigned to the case because he doesn't want to go down with them, but then has a change of heart after talking to a few people and thinking about it.So the trial starts, and that's when the movie really picks up speed.

Graham and Merrill go outside to scare the intruder off. They chase him around the house, but when they meet on the other side, the intruder is on the roof. How? Then more odd things happen. Graham finds someone, or something, walking around in his cornfield. Alien signals get picked up through baby monitors. Lights are floating in the sky all across the world.

In the cramped atmosphere, we feel just as trapped as the Hess family.

It made no sense to me, and it just seemed totally and utterly pointless. A complete waste of my time. But the more I thought about the movie and tried to analyze what it was really about, the more I thought I should give it another chance.So I gave it another view today. And I've decided that I really like this movie. It's insanely messed up, but so incredibly undeniably interesting.Donnie Darko (Gylenhall) is a boy in his late teens with some serious issues. He seems to be suffering from paranoia and schizophrenia, not to mention he is hallucinating. He keeps hearing from an imaginary friend of his, Frank. A giant rabbit with a hideously disfigured face. Frank is very creepy to look at, and looks like something you'd only see in a nightmare.Frank starts telling Donnie to do different things, and he does them. He breaks the water main at his school and floods it. He burns down the house of some motivational speaker that has been at his school. Frank keeps telling him to do other things of the nature, and Donnie listens to him.But the strangest thing that Frank tells Donnie is that the world is going to end in about a month. The whole movie builds to the climax when the world is supposed to end, and at that point some of the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, but there are still so many missing.One of the most interesting things that this movie brings up is the notion of predetermination. At one point in the movie, Donnie sees everybody walking along with a trail of what appears to be water leading from their chest out into the world. As they continue moving about their day, they catch up with this predetermined trail. The paradox that Donnie grapples with is, if we know what our path is and it is predetermined, is there anything we can do to change it, or should we even try?

If you like your movies to come to a certain and complete ending by the time the credits are rolling, then don't watch this movie, or you will spend hours beating your head against a wall screaming WHY???

It won best picture for a reason, along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was, The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump. How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.The movie opens with Forrest (Hanks) sitting at a bus stop, waiting to go see Jenny (Wright) after being apart from her for years. Who is Jenny, you ask? We'll get to that in a minute. Forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. Or, more accurately, he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. The movie plays out as a flashback, with Forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them.The flashback starts when Forrest is a little boy, about six years old or so, just at about the age where he should be starting school. We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (Field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately.Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school, and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion, Forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.As Forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a Vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times, he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.This is truly a great movie.

We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (Field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately.Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school, and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion, Forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.As Forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a Vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times, he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.This is truly a great movie.

Sure, it's amusing, but it gets less amusing as you get older. Fortunately my maturity level seldom increases dramatically, so I can unashamedly say that I do like this movie. It's just not great by any stretch.Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) is a low-key quiet banker who keeps to himself for the most part, watches cartoons, and is a doormat for the general public. Then one night Stanley thinks he sees a body floating in the water beside a bridge, only when he gets to it he finds that there is no actual body. He does, however, find an interesting mask. A green mask made of wood. So he takes it home, not thinking too much of it.Then when he's home, he goes to try the mask on, only to find that it's more than a piece of wood. It sucks onto his face, leeches onto his personality, and brings out the wild side of Stanley Ipkiss that nobody ever thought existed.

I still find this movie highly amusing. I just watched it again last night with someone who had never seen it, and I laughed just as hard as the first time I watched it. It's still very funny to me.Naval Captain Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a bit of a black sheep in the navy. He's the kind of guy who will play golf while on a sub, cracking a ball onto a golf course while they sail past it. He's the kind of guy who will get drunk, pass out, and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle.

The Admiralty decide to give him his own boat, but they don't give him a new nuclear sub. They give him a diesel sub, an ancient relic from World War II. His mission is to clean her up and take her out on the Atlantic for a war game.Dodge is obviously a little bit frustrated to have such a crappy boat given to him when he's worked so hard to get to the point that he's at, so he goes and talks to Admiral Winslow (Torn) about it. Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel subs are still being sold out there in the real world, to countries like Iran, Iraq, and Libya, to name a few. Winslow wants to know what would happen if some renegade captain in a diesel sub came to the States and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases. Would they make it? Dodge and most of the Admiralty don't think so, but Winslow wants to know for sure, hence why he has devised this war game. Dodge's mission is to take the Stingray out to sea, then try to evade the U.S. nuclear navy and blow up the American naval bases. In simulated battle, of course.So, that's about as deep as the plot gets. This is not a plot driven movie. It's a stupid movie that is just a big gag.

Unbeknownst to Carter, Li is still working on cases right now, so when they go to clubs or massage parlors or whatever, Li is on the job.

If he drove you batty in the first one, avoid this one like the plague.Anyway, at the beginning of the movie, the American Embassy in Hong Kong gets bombed and two Americans are killed. We all know that Uncle Sam doesn't stand for that kind of crap. Americans getting killed? Oh, somebody has to pay. So the investigation is underway right away, and the Hong Kong police get Li to jump on the case right away.Just like the first movie, the plot is really just a vehicle for Jackie Chan's flying fists of fury and Chris Tucker's big mouth. One of the more amusing and accurate lines of the movie, I found, was when one guy asks Li what he's doing hanging out with 7-11. 7-11? Because his mouth never closes.Overall, I didn't like this one as much as the first. Yeah, it's still amusing, but it's been done. It's nothing new, and it basically feels like all it's doing is revisiting familiar territory in an effort to make a few more dollars.

Because his mouth never closes.Overall, I didn't like this one as much as the first. Yeah, it's still amusing, but it's been done.

At least they picked a good movie to make a sequel of on this one.Rush Hour 2 picks up right where the first movie left off. Li (Chan) and Carter (Tucker) are out in Hong Kong having a good time, enjoying a little vacation. Unbeknownst to Carter, Li is still working on cases right now, so when they go to clubs or massage parlors or whatever, Li is on the job. And of course, Carter's big mouth keeps getting them into trouble. Just a note, yes, he is just as annoying in this movie as he was in the first one. If he drove you batty in the first one, avoid this one like the plague.Anyway, at the beginning of the movie, the American Embassy in Hong Kong gets bombed and two Americans are killed.

Really, cheesy eighties movies don't get any better than this in my opinion. And cheesy this one is. Amazingly so.So, basically, here's the story. Bill (Winter) and Ted (Reeves) are a couple of guys who have the combined intelligence of a jar of peanut butter. They aspire to start a band called Wyld Styllyns despite the fact that they don't even possess the knowledge of how to play their guitars. They talk like a couple of surfers from the late eighties, using intelligent words like heinous, bodacious, excellent, bogus, and so on. It can get a little bit annoying, but it's not like people didn't use to talk like that (scary, isn't it?).The tagline of the movie is History is about to be re-written by two guys who can't even spell. That hits the nail pretty much right on the head. Theoretically, in the future, the music that Bill and Ted make will bring about a time of galactic peace. It unites the planets and so on and so forth, blah blah blah. But the problem is, the band will never be started if they fail their history class. Because if they fail history, they fail high school, and Ted's dad will send him off to military school in Alaska.Obviously this can't happen, so a man from the future, Rufus (Carlin), is sent back in time to aid Bill and Ted with their final history project. If they get an A+ on that project, then they will pass the class, they pass high school, and the band will be started.So how are they going to pass this history assignment? Simple. Use a time traveling phone booth that Rufus brought with him, kidnap a ton of historical figures and put them all in a big presentation.So the airhead dudes travel through time and kidnap Billy the Kid, Socrates (pronounced so-crates&#133;), Sigmund Freud, Joan of Arc, Genghis Kahn, Abraham Lincoln, and Ludwig Von Beethoven (pronounced bee-thuv-en).It really is a weak plot, but it's so imaginative and original and ludicrous that it makes the movie worth watching. Plus the high energy horrible acting of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter make it truly hilarious. It's a great flick.The funny thing is, I think the only thing that's changed about Keanu from then to now is that he has shorter hair now.

Good flick.So anyway, the movie opens up in a serene and peaceful little village. Then we see that Star Fleet is essentially spying on them while wearing suits that make them invisible to all the villagers. Then Data (Spiner) goes berserk and starts running towards the village while being fired at by other Star Fleet officers. Bwa? So he gets the suit off and exposes the Star Fleet spy base to the villagers.Meanwhile, back on the Enterprise, Captain Picard (Stewart) and Commander Riker (Frakes) are busy welcoming a new race into the Federation family. But they also get news that Commander Data has gone berserk on his current mission. Somewhere in there we have a sloppy scene that inserts Worf (Dorn) into the movie. Picard comes out, sees Worf and says, Mr. Worf! What the hell are you doing here? He may as well have responded, Well, I heard they were making another Star Trek movie, so I thought I'd better show up. Sloppy, sloppy character insertion. Whatever, it needed to be done. I mean, a TNG movie with no Worf? What's the point? Anyway, the Enterprise heads off towards the planet where Data has been stationed and conducting research. They hope to offer their assistance in capturing him and\/or subduing him, which they do.When they go down to the surface of the planet to investigate and get the hostages back, they find that they really aren't being held against their will.

If anything, it adds. For the 80s, this is an exceptional movie. For any time period, this is an exceptional movie.It all takes place in the imaginary kingdom of Florin, ruled by the charismatic and devious Prince Humperdink (imagine what elementary school was like for THAT guy). Technically, he is not yet the king, but in the same way that Cardinal Richeleau ruled France in The Three Muskateers, so does Prince Humperdink rule Florin.The heart of the movie opens on a small farm, where Buttercup, allegedly the most beautiful girl in the kingdom, is living her life. She commands Westley, the farm boy, around for pleasure. Eventually she realizes that Westley loves her, sparks fly, and we are hit with one of the movie's most infamous lines Hold it, hold it! Grandpa, what is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports? (pause) Is this a kissing book? Westley has no money for marriage, so he sets out in seek of fame and fortune. In a matter of weeks, news comes back to Buttercup that Westley has been murdered by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Five years later the Prince decides that he is going to take Buttercup as his wife, and the movie sets into action.

Does that really matter? Of course not. First off, it's just entertainment. Second, the point of the movie is that true love conquers all.
