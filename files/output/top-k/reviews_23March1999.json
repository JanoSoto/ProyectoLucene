What I don't get is why we are supposed to care about such unsympathetic, flat characters.  And I also don't get how this movie could possibly have won best picture; it is boring, overdone, and pretentious, and nice scenery does not make up for a lack of substance.  I did not care what happened to either Ralph Fiennes or Kristin Scott Thomas; neither one gave me any reason to care.  I agree with the comments that there is no indication that there was any real love here.  It looked like a case of raging hormones to me.  Are we given any reason why we should not despise KST for cheating on her husband over a prolonged period of time? No.  Are we given any reason why we should not despise Fiennes for sleeping with his best friend's wife over a prolonged period of time? No.  Are we given any reason why we should believe their relationship is based on anything more than lust? That scene at the Christmas dinner or whatever it was is a good example of how completely unlikable these characters were.  I did like the character played by Binoche, and I did care what happened to her and Andrews' character, but this relationship was barely touched on in the movie, though I understand it is more important in the book.  These characters were not despicable and showed more depth, and as far as I am concerned, they are the only reasons that this movie wasn't intolerable and completely without merit- other than the wonderful scenery, of course, which we are shown again and again and again.I am not American (though I'm not sure if being Canadian is considered by many others to be more American-like or more European-like, or just different) and I am not male, and I don't see what these qualities have to do with anything anyway; a bad movie is a bad movie, and this was indeed a bad movie.  I don't need massive explosions or shoot-outs, nor do I need lots of sex (though this movie had plenty of that) in order to enjoy a movie.  I like a good story.  I prefer talking to action.  But none of this means anything if the characters are not likable.  Likewise, likable characters can make a bad movie passable.  In this case, Binoche's character keeps this movie from being downright horrible, instead bringing it up into the low end of mediocrity.

Now, we knew it was going to be sad from reading the back of the video box (we didn't get to make it to the theatre unfortunately...I WISH we'd seen this on the big screen!!!)...but we weren't quite expecting how absolutely beautiful this movie was going to be.  The colors in this movie were absolutely gorgeous!  Even the scenery reached out from the television screen and grabbed not only our attentions but our hearts as well.  They were symbolic to the core.I don't want to give away the plot, but let us suffice to say that Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra were beautifully cast in this movie about soul mates and how the Afterlife works.  I never thought I'd find my beliefs about reincarnation and the Afterlife portrayed in a movie, but this one managed to catch just about every single thing I believe in.  It confirmed my idea of soul mates and about love lasting beyond till death do you part.And was it emotional!  I said before that we knew it was going to be sad. But even the happy scenes made us reach for the box of tissues.  I cried when things were sad and I cried when things were happy.  That was because when things hit a happy moment, they weren't just happy...they were JOYOUS!  They were moments of complete exultation that I wanted to just leap through the screen and celebrate with the characters.  Those scenes of joy and happiness reached out from the television screen and grabbed my heart and squeezed so hard that I thought I would burst!  I never felt so happy from a movie in my life.  This was not a comedic happy either...although this movie did have its funny lines and moments.  It was a happiness from being aware of life and from knowing the joys of true love and soul bonding.

It doesn't subscribe to any particular belief system at all. You don't have to be of any specific religion to enjoy this film at all. In fact, if anything, it offers the peace and harmony to strive for despite all our outward differences.

Yet this movie was overlooked in the best picture category, not only at the Oscars, but also at the Golden Globes, which has TWO best picture categories.  Virtually every review I saw for this movie placed it ahead of The Thin Red Line (including the ratings here on the IMDB), yet it got nominated and Pleasantville got shelved.This movie was original, and NOT a carbon copy of the Truman Show, as some have suggested.  I found it a clever approach to exploring such issues as racism, and I found most of the characters to be rich and diverse.  It was funny and yet poignant at the same time- a combination of comedy and drama that I believe tends to make the best movies.  And I never thought someone saying Where's my dinner? could be so funny.  William H. Macy was also robbed of an Oscar, once again.  The rest of the cast was good, too.As far as the comment that Joan Allen turning into colour didn't make her radiant what movie were you watching? We were not supposed to view her as the next supermodel.  Attaining colour was not about physical attractiveness.  This movie was about discovering yourself, which is what she did, and as far as I am concerned, that was all that was supposed to make her radiant.  Her beauty laid inside her.  If this is not the message a person took away, I could understand them not liking the movie, just as I have not liked movies that I did not get the point of.  If you did not get the point, maybe it would be worthwhile to watch the movie again, because it really is excellent.I also found the notion of the people in Pleasantville only becoming real throughout the course of the movie intriguing.  It is interesting to think of an entire world being created right before your very eyes, to watch the townspeople evolve and develop and mature, a miniature version of our own world, plagued by the same problems and enriched with the same joys.  I've found it interesting to imagine what might happen if such a world were to be created- how quickly would that world become like our own, or would it become that way at all? I don't think the goal of this movie was to instill such thoughts in people, but it did so in me nonetheless, and that is one thing I enjoy in a movie, for it to be thought-provoking.  And Pleasantville, being the intelligent and complex-yet-simple film it is, accomplishes this nicely.  And this is why it deserved an Oscar nomination, aside for for best costume design.  I am not saying it should have won (I haven't seen Shakespeare in Love yet), but it certainly deserved the honour of a nomination.

And they did turn professional too!Films like Brassed Off, which seek to present a view of a sensitive issue, are often derided for not offering a solution which can be written on the back of a cereal box. Personally, I take that as a recommendation!The point of the film is this put people in situations that most of us will happily never face, and they react in extreme fashions. There was little or no 'political' argument, other than the fact that the Conservative Government of the time did destroy an entire industry. That same government them spent millions of pounds a year buying coal from Europe and South America. Angry? I would be.I saw characters portrayed in their entirety, which meant 'scabs' and 'sellouts' rubbed shoulders with the committed and poor. I saw unflattering portraits of basically decent people, prepared to risk friendships and relationships to keep alive an industry which was killing them but without which they could not live. It was a desperate time, and the fact that families have been split since the 1984 strike shows just how deep feelings can run on this issue.And I saw no skipping over the holes in the logic either. No mention of the 4-1 vote in favour of closing the mine? Half of the chuffing film was about that! What about the fate of Gloria's report? What about Phil, a striker from 1984, voting for closure? Did no-one notice that he was one of the major characters?I do think that there were some problems with the structure of the film (although it was dramatically more satisfying than the Full Monty). Gloria was unconvincing; the wives were underused, and the speech at the end, yes, I found it embarrassing too!But please, before you attack the veracity of such a rounded and honest film as Brassed Off, take the time and trouble to watch it properly first!

A film which did not seek to glamourise the effect of long term unemployment and the break up of communities. And a film which WAS based very closely on a true story. The band members you see actually playing the music? That's the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, winners of the national Battle of the Bands competition in the year that the colliery closed down. And they did turn professional too!Films like Brassed Off, which seek to present a view of a sensitive issue, are often derided for not offering a solution which can be written on the back of a cereal box. Personally, I take that as a recommendation!The point of the film is this put people in situations that most of us will happily never face, and they react in extreme fashions. There was little or no 'political' argument, other than the fact that the Conservative Government of the time did destroy an entire industry. That same government them spent millions of pounds a year buying coal from Europe and South America. Angry?

His repertoire includes  Glen or Glenda, his paean for understanding for transvestites; Bride of the Monster, a mad scientist attempts to creates a race of supermen to take over the world; and his magnum opus, Plan 9 From Outer Space, wherein effete grave robbers from space invade Earth. Ed Wood was the Eddie the Eagle of Hollywood--he loved making movies, but didn't have an ounce of talent in his body. Tim Burton directs this loving portrait of the ups (such as they were) and downs of the career of Ed Wood. I loved this movie. I'd loved every frame of this movie. Photographed in glorious black and white, the movie looks absolutely exquisite and gorgeous. (Do not let Ted Turner in the same room as this movie!) The cast is marvellous. Johnny Depp brings out Wood's eternal optimism without playing him for a moronic simpleton who likes wearing his wife's clothes (You think it's the worst film ever made? Well, my next one will be even better! -- Yes, I like sex with girls. Wearing their clothes just makes me feel closer to them.), and Martin Landau is spellbinding as the tragic Bela Lugosi, the nearly forgotten star who befriends Wood and acts (if one can use that word) in Wood's movies, while his drug abused body is quickly failing him. The supporting cast is stellar, too, particularly Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, Wood's friend and occasional co-star. It would have been very easy for Burton and company to play Wood as a no-talent idiot. Wood was not an idiot. Indeed, one gets the impression that Wood would have excelled at the deal-making aspect of Hollywood (just don't let him near the camera). Instead, Burton gives us a touching, hilarious romp through the weirdness of Hollywood film-making, delivering a loving homage to 50s B-movies, and an uplifting tribute to the human spirit. The final irony of all this is that the movie's moral is not to compromise your artistic vision, which, to his credit, is one thing Ed Wood did not do. He fought hard to bring to the screen what he thought were glorious masterpieces, and his vision, as faulty as it was, must have some enduring, and endearing, quality to it, because, here we are, forty years later, still discussing, dissecting, and, yes, even enjoying the films of Ed Wood.

It is certainly the funniest of the three films!Director\/screenwriter Douglas McGrath understands that it is character, not plot, that drives Jane Austen's work, and even the minor characters come to life with vibrance and wit. The cast is excellent. Toni Collete is delightful as Emma's innocently flaky protegee, Harriet. Sophie Thompson is noteworthy as the endlessly talkative Miss Bates, and Denys Hawthorne is a howl as Emma's hypochondriac father.Jeremy Northam has been criticized as being too young and handsome for Mr. Knightly, but in fact Northam was about thirty-five when the film was made, only a few years short of Mr. Knightly's seven and thirty years.  There is certainly enough of an age difference between him and Emma to make their mentor\/protegee relationship entirely convincing.  And just because he is older (and wiser) than Emma doesn't mean he should be portrayed as a venerable old geezer.  Indeed, his youthful attractiveness makes Emma's attraction to him all the more believable.Jane Austen once said that in writing Emma she meant to create a character that no one but she would like very much. She couldn't have been more wrong! In spite of (perhaps because of) her failings, Emma emerges as an eminently likeable character.  For all her foolishness and arrogance, she is basically good-hearted, and capable of change and growth.

Watching Dangerous Liaisons again after I saw Cruel Intentions helped fill in a lot of blanks.The ending was most disappointing, which I blame on the screenwriters.  It appeared as if they wanted to try to keep the audience guessing as to whose idea won out, when they would have been better off including a simple death scene with Valmont, like the original, in order to answer all the final questions.All in all, while deliciously wicked, the film lacked the finesse and clear storyline of Dangerous Liaisons apparently in order to cater to a generation to which the writers attributed more hormones than intelligence.

I mean, it had all the elements of a great moviegreat acting, original idea, humorous at times, and great special effects.  But I just thought it had way too many mistakes that could have easily been noticed by the filmmakers.  Here's a list of some of themhow did the people now what color was before they started seeing it?...How did the people know what rain was before they started seeing it?...Why did the earth around the people slowly change color with them?...How did David get back to his home without that old tv repairman?...Another thing that kind of made me think less of this film was the typical courtroom ending with the whole typical thing happening, which is, of course, that everyone stops hating the accused and they all cheer and stuff.  This is what made me hate Patch Adams so much...but still, I have to admit, a lot of stuff from this movie, especially the middle, was pretty good, it just turned out to be an unoriginal(and stupid) second half to an original and weird beginning.

I was five at the time, but the movie was something that held me tightly and would not let go. I guess it was Jim living on his own that fascinated me. I've never been on my own, but I always wondered what it was like, I was a child, my life revolved around kindergarten and episodes of Mister Rodgers Neighborhood. When Empire premiered on HBO a year later, I had my older brother record it for me. I watched it everyday and wore out the VCR. Ten years later I saw the film again, not as a little kid, but as a fifteen year old girl planning to be a movie director when I grew up. I catapulted into the story and relived many childhood memories as Jim ran around trying to find his parents,(that what I always thought it was about for ten years), I read the novel by J. G. Ballard and found all the symbolism Mr. Spielberg had put into it. It has always been my favourite film and has been since '87, as I watch the movie(at least once a week now) I see the five year old little girl that I once was. Steven Spielberg took us into to the life of a young British boy in a Japanese interment camp outside of Shanghai, China. Jim meets Frank and Basie after being lost in the crowd and becomes a pickpocket for Basie's constant errands. Four years later, as the war winds down, Jim questions a lot of things in his reality and can't remember what his parents look like. He doesn't want to leave the camp, but he wants to find his parents. This movie is my favourite film(I bet you're sick of hearing that!) and it should have won all six Oscars it was nominated for and more(including Best Picture). It's a cinematic achievement, one of Spielberg's best, and will live forever in movie history if people will watch it and admire it story and characters.
