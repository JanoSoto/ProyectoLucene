Starting as early as 1941 with John Huston's The Maltese Falcon.  Other greats include Orson Welles's Touch of Evil and Hitchcock's Notorious.  With such a great variety of so-called classic noires to see, why would one want to take the time and money to watch an independent film noir by a then unknown director\/writer.  Simple the director\/writer is John Dahl, and this is no ordinary film noir.  In fact, his movies (this was the first of them all) are so well received that critics credit him with starting a new genre called neo-noir.It starts out like any other noir.  Fay Forrester (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer), the femme fatal, and her boyfriend (Michael Madsen) are some small time criminals who rob the mod.  They steal a briefcase full of money and kill one of the mod members.  Then, Fay, who longs to escape country life and move to Las Vegas hits her husband on the head with a rock, takes all the money for herself, and runs to Vegas.  Once she gets to Vegas, she hires Jack Andrews (Val Kilmer) to make it look like she was murdered, offering him, $5000 up front and $5000 when I'm dead.   Jack,  reluctantly takes the job.  However, once the job is done, Fay skips out of town without paying Jack the final $5000, and to make matters worse, Fay's boyfriend is in town at Jack's office looking for Fay.  Now this is where it gets really interesting because everyone is looking to kill everyone else for revenge. It is just a question of who will succeed.  The last half of the movie is filled with plot twists and unexpected actions.  This, and especially the end, is where this film deviates from what is usually called film noir. This is not to say that the twists are unmotivated or out of character. They very much are.  It is just the types of twists and the number of them are uncommon for films preceding this time.  The ending is unexpected and pleasurable.  But I won't ruin it for you here.One thing that is particularly true for this movie is the consistency found in each of the main characters.  There is no scene that feels out of place within the context of the picture.  Also, I have to give a thumbs up to the under-appreciated performance by Michael Madsen.  He does one heck of a job as the psycho boyfriend.  Another thing that must be mentioned is the great choices for the camera angles by John Dahl.  This makes the movie better than it is or should be.  He places the camera in places so that you feel either closer or farther from the action, depending upon what sense he is trying to convey to the viewer.  He really makes the tension tenser, and the action faster.  The audience always gets enough, but never too much.  This is just an outstanding example of film directing.  The only other directors that have this uncanny ability are Welles, Hitchcock, Kubrick, Tarantino, and Scorsese.  In my opinion, this film (which is from 1989) is a major influence on Tarantino and his works.  You can clearly see the similarities between their choice of camera angles and what the audience gets to see; however, Tarantino is more graphic face.While this movie is far from perfect, it is quite good and deserves any true noir fan's time and attention.  If you like noires, and in particular, this film, then go check out Dahl's other two good neo-noires Redrock West and The Last Seduction. I give this film an 8\/10.

His inability to tell a clear, focused story - or to get anything out of his actors except over the top performances - or to stage action in anything but a perfunctory manner. . . have always made him suspect to me. I felt his promotion to the rank of director was unwarranted - that he should instead be making his living as one of Hollywood's most in demand cinematographers or production designers.Having seen Sleepy Hollow though, I'd definitely have to say that Burton has made considerable progress. His distinctive visual touch is still present, though he has reigned in some of his wilder extravagances in order not to overwhelm the story. His ability to stage action sequences is much improved, resulting in some truly hair-raising chases and fight scenes (you're left to wonder what his Batman films could have been with this new found talent). Furthermore, the relentless jokiness which usually undermines his movies has been replaced by a brooding and operatic tone which better fit the story. For example, the flashback sequences here provide some of the most haunting and poetic images Burton has ever created - and they feel sincere, as if they come from a very deep and genuine place inside the filmmaker, and are not just flung at us to dazzle and tickle us with his visual ingenuity.All of which is not to say that Burton is no longer any fun. It's just that he has put his humor into better perspective. There are many nice wry touches in Sleepy Hollow, none more so than in Johnny Depp's truly outstanding performance, which straddles the poles of absurd comedy and genuine heroism. Even as we come to feel for Ichabod Crane and to admire his steeliness and pluck, we are never far removed from laughter at the character's prissiness and squeamishness. Depp walks a real tightrope act here, and it will probably not be to everyone's taste. I thought it was one of the best performances of the year, and represented a perfect marriage between Burton's tendancy toward campy theatrics and his newfound maturity and grace.Some caveats Christina Ricci is not used particularly well here; her part is too blandly written to give her prickly screen persona much room to breathe. Too bad, as she would make an ideal Burton heroine (I hasten to add that every other single actor in the movie - including Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and yes, even Christopher Walken in a wordless cameo - is solid). And what's with this story anyway? It's a pointless bastardization of the original tale. While it's true that the original is pretty threadbare, it is certainly suggestive enough that a writer could spin out compelling backstories and elaborations without having to resort to coming up with a completely new murder mystery plot (which is kind of overplotted and confusing, anyway). But, taken on its own merits, the script certainly works well enough, and anyone not familiar with the original story won't notice anything amiss.Ok, now that I've said all that - the real reason to see this movie. . . those decapitations! The advertising slogan was Heads will roll but never in my wildest imagination could I have guessed with what frequency and in how many different kinds of ways. Burton eschews realism or gory details here, and instead goes for a stylization that is at once giddy, horrifying and strangely beautiful. The fact that each decapitation is played slightly differently - either in how it's shot or how it's perpetrated - keeps it from becoming routine and, indeed, every instance of it involves some new kind of twist or surprise. Some may say Burton is sick for focusing so much attention on this aspect of the story, but this is the Headless Horseman after all, and Burton's courage in not backing away from his grisly deeds gives the monster his full due. Although I wouldn't call the film frightening exactly (that is, to anyone but the most absolutely faint-hearted), it is suffused with a powerful sense of  creepiness and dread that prove extremely effective.All in all, a very enjoyable movie, and a signal of even better works yet to come from Tim Burton.

Boy, was I wrong!This is one sweet movie.  When I say sweet, I mean, Mayberry sweet.  And just as that American staple from the sixties was beloved and sincere, so is, Blast From The Past.Of course this film sits on an implausible premise.  The family squirreled away for decades in an underground bunker is certainly impossible.  It doesn't matter.  This is merely the prism used by the filmmaker to compare and contrast late nineties culture with early sixties values.The difference is compelling and jackhammer hard.  I'm not sure to credit the writer, Bill Kelly, or the director, Hugh Wilson with Blast's message.  Perhaps both and others.  The fact remains that at almost every intersection, where Hollywood would demand the old clinical satire, rubber stamped by the Politically Correct, Blast charts original territory and maintains the philosophy throughout.  This is real filmmaking, folks, where the makers shuck timely formula for principle.The non-cheesy, kind-heartedness of Adam will definitely come out after repeated viewings.  I dare you to not cry for joy, after you become familiar with this picture.  Eight out of Ten, perhaps I should have given it Nine.I want to make one thing clear.  This film does not epitomize empty propaganda purporting the superiority of the old days.  Nor does it make Hollywood's nauseous mistake of glorifying nineties moral superiority over America's supposed dumber days.  The compelling contrast is tastefully done, and hopefully, critical minds, learned in thought will see the balance.
