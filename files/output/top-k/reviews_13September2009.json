A good fresh spin on the slasher genre. Plus the writing is quite good. A great sense of humor. A nice job done on the score, which is eerie. Beautiful shooting location and photography.

I absolutely loved it and enjoyed it a great deal. I vividly recall the audience roaring with laughter at regular intervals. Well, I rewatched this movie after having not seen it for at least fifteen years and boy did it ever hold up. It's partly because of the witty and ingenious blending of a Lovecraftian the end of the world as beget by ancient and powerful phantasmagoric beings premise with a delightfully broad and playful sense of infectiously irreverent and anarchic humor, partly because the special effects are extremely impressive and accomplished even by today's more sophisticated standards (the gluttonous Slimer in particular is a splendidly disgusting wow!), partly because the movie breezes along at a brisk clip without any dreary lulls, and mainly because it's just so much incredibly off-the-wall absurdist fun.The cast is sheer perfection Bill Murray lands a plumb part as the lovably smarmy Dr. Peter Venkman, Dan Aykroyd is likewise excellent as the overzealous Dr. Raymond Stantz, Harold Ramis plays it suitably solemn and humorless as the deliciously dour Dr. Egon Spengler, Sigourney Weaver is simply ravishing as fetching musician and appealing love interest Dana Barret (and man is she smoking hot when she becomes possessed by the lascivious spirit of the evil, yet enticing Zuul), Rick Moranis exquisitely nerds it up as hopelessly dweeby accountant Louis Tully, Annie Potts adds considerable spark as sarcastic secretary Janine Melnitz, Ernie Hudson is quite engaging as the easygoing Winston Zeddmore, and William Atherton makes for a marvelously smug foil as obnoxious EPA jerk Walter Peck. Ivan Reitman's deft direction maintains an appropriately zany tone throughout while tossing in plenty of neat throwaway gags and culminating in one rousing doozy of a pull out all the stops crazy apocalyptic climax. Among the choice gut-busting moments are our protagonists attempting to nab a pesky ghost at a library, the Ghostbusters corny TV commercial, our boys' first assignment at a posh New York hotel, Stantz's erotic dream, and the first appearance of a giant deadly marshmallow man. Kudos are also in order for the first-rate rockin' soundtrack, with Mick Smiley's hypnotic Magic rating as an especially awesome tune. Elmer Bernstein supplies a fantastic spooky and spirited score. Laszlo Kovacs' glossy cinematography makes fine use of the widescreen format. Popping up in nifty bits are Jennifer Runyon, Michael Ensign, Playboy Playmate Kymberly Herrin, slinky Russian beauty Slavitza Jovan (as Gozer), Deborah Gibson, and even notorious porn star Ron Jeremy. But what really clinches this picture's status as an all-time classic 80's winner is its exceptionally inspired and energetic sense of blithely ridiculous merriment. A total treat.

I loved - and still love - the early work, and have mixed reactions to most of the stuff from Peter Pan through Oliver and Company with a few exceptions. The Little Mermaid seemed like a return to form - and a return to the fairy tales that the company always seemed to do best with, and I liked Beauty and the Beast even more. Aladdin was alas a major step down - still pretty solid in the animation department, but Robin Williams' shtick was for me completely out of place and irritating. It was of course their biggest hit to that point, and they took some of the lessons they'd learned - less romance, more slapstick and gross humor, celebrity voices - and applied them to The Lion King with even more spectacular results.For 15 years this film has ranked among my worst films of all time, and every time I mention that I get people reacting as if I told them I was the Antichrist. Seriously - I think more people will get bent out of shape if you tell them you hate The Lion King than if your feelings are negative about Citizen Kane, Casablanca, or 2001. It's always struck me as weird, because I know I'm not the only person to dislike it, and in fact none of the friends I saw it with when it came out liked it much - though none of them hated it like I did either.I think that the main problem for me in 1994 is that the elements that I disliked from Aladdin in particular seemed amped-up several degrees here. I hated Whoopi and Cheech, hated the music, hated above all what I saw at the time was an infantilist assault on intelligence and wit - the smartest and coolest character in the film, Scar, also is pure evil, and all of the good characters are white-bread, boring, stupid. Dumb and strong triumphs over smart and clever; the songs sucked; the animation was coarser and less interesting than in the previous couple of films. I suspect that there were a lot of personal issues that contributed to my overwhelming hatred of the film, too, but those are lost to me at the moment.I'm pleased to say on this re-watch that I don't HATE the film anymore. But I still don't like it. The issues with the treatment of Scar - not sure what I was thinking there, that was over-the-top on my part. Sure Jeremy Irons' voicing of him is in many ways a typical smart but venal character, a Godless intellectual I suppose - but it's not really that overstated or deliberate, it doesn't come off as anti-intellectual to me anymore. James Earl Jones' Mufasa may not be a genius, but he doesn't come off as a dumb noble-hearted brute either, and nobody can really beat Jones in that kind of role. The opening sequences are somewhat impressive, and the film is rarely boring. I actually sort of liked the shaman baboon character Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), and it's good that young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas\/Matthew Broderick) takes a fair amount of screen time to grow up.But...I still hate the music; Can You Feel the Love Tonight I actually found tolerable in relation to the other songs, but even it was so cloying and just banal that I had a hard time not fast-forwarding. This is purely a matter of taste, I make no bones about it - I like very little of Elton John's post-1970s work and so it's not surprising really. I still find the hyena characters irritating, unfunny, and way over-used. The female characters are essentially just there to move the action forward - no, the film ain't obviously racist like I guess I thought it was (though it's rather confusing in its racial and ethnic undertones) but it's definitely a boys' film. Timon and Pumbaa are gross and annoying and the film as a whole just has no sparkle, no wit to me. The animation doesn't have the zip or the beauty of the previous few films; the direction and pacing seem more inevitable than exciting, the spectacular scenes like the stampede that kills Mufasa just don't come off as all that spectacular as the digital help is too obvious and cheap-looking.In any case, it wasn't torture to watch anymore, and it's actually reawakened an interest in going back through the Disney feature canon, re-watching some of the ones I don't remember well and catching up with a few of the newer ones that I never bothered with after being disappointed by this and Pocahontas in succession.

The animation doesn't have the zip or the beauty of the previous few films; the direction and pacing seem more inevitable than exciting, the spectacular scenes like the stampede that kills Mufasa just don't come off as all that spectacular as the digital help is too obvious and cheap-looking.In any case, it wasn't torture to watch anymore, and it's actually reawakened an interest in going back through the Disney feature canon, re-watching some of the ones I don't remember well and catching up with a few of the newer ones that I never bothered with after being disappointed by this and Pocahontas in succession.

Variously scenic locations around the world. A saucy opening theme song. Some humor along the way (which through time varied in styles) and some spectacular slabs of exciting action set-pieces.

The UFO's and aliens are there for the guys, the relationships between the characters are there for the girls. The closest analogy I can think of to describe this movie is Independence Day meets Ordinary People, two films that you would never imagine being combined because their respective genres are about as polar opposites as they come. Even something like Field of Dreams meets King Kong seems more plausible. But Signs somehow works, probably because of the magic of director M. Night Shyamalan whose work is primarily in the SF\/Horror genres and yet focuses a lot on character, much like Steven Spielberg. As science fiction stories go, strange sentient beings coming to Earth via UFO's goes back to the days of HG Wells' War of the Worlds near the turn of the last century. Films in which the aliens may be either benevolent or malevolent include The Day the Earth Stood Still, Earth Versus the Flying Saucers, Invaders from Mars, The Invaders (TV show), Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Independence Day. The list goes on and on. So my point is that the central SF idea behind Signs is certainly nothing that hasn't been penned, shot, and edited, going as far back as the silent era. What is new in Signs is that the story focuses more on the characters and their inter-relationships with each other which comes out because of the events concerning malevolent extra-terrestrials. The closest film to it may be the 1953 SF classic Invaders from Mars in which a family is abducted by space aliens.Of course, this combining of SF and drama could turn off many hardcover science fiction fans who are more interested in long action sequences in which aliens and humans battle it out, like War of the Worlds or Independence Day. If you want lots of laser gun action and dog fight scenes in space, Signs will certainly leave you feeling like you were had. On the other hand, if you want a new angle on a familiar sub-genre of SF that relies less on action and more on character, you might give Signs a try. Signs could have been a really ridiculous movie if it wasn't for the fine acting of all four leads, particularly the child actors. I was absolutely stunned by the realism of the two youngsters, around the ages of 6 and 10. They are really the ones that make this movie work. Added to the mix is Mel Gibson as their father who conveys paternalistic emotions that is uncommon for him. The story is really about the father reconciling with his children because of a piece of back-story that becomes, in the end, far more important than the space aliens.

It's like somebody got an A-budget to make a B-movie, peed it away on just being a bad filmmaker, and the vaunted Academy gave it some awards because they figured Vietnam was lost and America needed a shot of B-12 in the balls.Ah, but the sainted subject matter &#x97; the irreverent, anachronistic, God-fearing general who nevertheless cursed liberally, disrespected the authority he damn well expected everyone to follow as long it was him, because he was that mesmerizing a presence &#x97; and yet, we don't hear one actual curse from this institutional rebel the entire movie or get any sense of how he did things differently other than disobey his orders to inflate his sense of his own nigh-psychotic narcissism, even as the filmmaker seems to pass this off as simply a symptom of greatness. This movie belongs in the category of The Green Berets, an archaic hunk of fecal matter that profanes difficult, textured subject matter of a three dimensional world by rendering it, badly, two-dimensionally, stupidly, with the purview of a so-called patriot, and yet diminishing patriotism by rendering it down something no more complex than blind religion. It all bespeaks the dogmatic limitations of the filmmakers, notably a glaring lack of talent or deliberation or capacity for lateral thought.My dad used to say how he agreed with Patton, that he should have kept on going after Germany straight to Moscow. It was an easy, cursory, dumb quip to deal with a nightmarish scenario, one so many of us lived under for far too many years. There was horrific danger in that kind of mentality, and it took a psychotic demagogue to breathe such words at all while wielding the potential martial power to actually do it &#x97; like a Gen. Jack D. Ripper fifteen years removed. That would have been an incredibly complex character for a filmmaker to show and a viewer try to understand, to weigh the retarded, dogmatic simplicity of his world-view with the bleak scape of a globe already in smoking ruin, genocide made into industry, with tens of millions already dead. Such a character study, of someone so fanatical, of such blue-eyed self-righteousness, as to presume himself a suitable master-race fuhrer for the master-race he had dispossessed, that would have been a profoundly mesmerizing premise for a movie, and something George C. Scott would have torn into like a rare steak.Instead we got this. Don't believe a word your Republican parents say. This was NEVER a good movie and it won't ever be.

Seeing as how I was going to be re-visiting The Outlaw Josey Wales for a film club though, now was as good a time as any for a re-watch.The plot couldn't be simpler, in many ways harking back to A Fistful of Dollars in its elegant, stripped storyline A stranger (Clint) rides into the town of Lago, quickly getting into a shootout that he didn't start and besting the three gunfighters that the town had hired to protect them. The townspeople are afraid of another trio who had once been on the payroll also, doing time in prison for a crime committed a year before that the town is complicit in, and due back to wreak vengeance. Seeing as how their protectors are dead, they agree to hire the stranger at any cost, and he proceeds to wreak havoc on the town in more ways than one before proceeding on his way after filling his bargain in apocalyptic fashion.If the plot's simple, the characters, style and symbolism of the piece are a little less so. The Stranger it seems is haunted by dreams - memories or visions, who can say for sure? of a man who seems to be him, the town's former marshall, whipped to death by those same three men riding back for their own vengeance. Lago means lake and the town sits on an unnamed body of water; the town seems brand-new, most of the buildings are still under construction and unpainted, though from what we learn it's been around for over a year; the townspeople are greedy and cowardly, and The Stranger is cold, merciless, in the end even demonic. Is he a figure of vengeance, a revenant or demon sent from the real Hell that he names the town after, and that the marshall is seen in one flashback as damning it to, as he orders it painted completely red before the killers arrive in town? Though nearly everybody in the town is unpleasant, a couple of more positive images do stand out - Verna Bloom in one of the two significant female roles is the hotel-keeper's wife, who seems at first to despise The Stranger but seemingly just because he's another brutal bastard - when she realizes that he's the only man in the town with guts she softens, and he beds her just before the showdown. A dwarf, Mordecai (Billy Curtis), is also treated more softly, with The Stranger proclaiming him sheriff and mayor, pumping him up to the point where he alone of all the townsmen shows any guts at the eventual gun battle. I suppose it could be said that Clint's vengeful figure is capable of some charity and feeling towards the only two positive and good characters in the film. Significantly enough the other female character, a single woman (perhaps a whore? it's never very clear) named Callie (Marianna Hill) who he rapes shortly after entering town, develops an ambiguous love-hate attitude towards him and it's left quite ambiguous as to how much has to do with the rape (which both The Stranger and other townspeople deny) or because he then ignores her for the most part, even after she betrays him at one point.A town that seemed promising and new, fresh and full of vitality at the beginning of the film, perched on a cool lake and apparently prosperous, at the end has been half-burnt and decimated through a supernatural wrath, a vengeance for the greed and cowardice that killed a marshall and cowers before his redeemer - this is old-Testament film-making of a pure kind that Eastwood never really returned to in such an obvious way. There are certainly obvious odes to his spaghetti years, in the dirt and violence and unpleasantness of the townspeople and their souls, in Dee Barton's wonderfully eclectic, eerie score and of course in Eastwood's character; I also think it shares some kinship with the Don Siegel-directed Civil War film The Beguiled from 1971, another film with more than a touch of the supernatural, and few redeeming characters. But Clint makes it his own through the economy and his refusal to make things any more flashy or outré than the screenplay calls for (which is plenty). The cast is terrific, mostly made up of names that were second-tier at best at the time and are largely forgotten now. Bloom and Curtis are especially good Perhaps not one of the very best 70s westerns, and I'd certainly still put it behind Josey Wales and Unforgiven in Eastwood's western-ography, but it's definitely one of the weirder and more fascinating examples of the genre from America during the period.

It ploughs through the rule book like a freight train slamming through a blockade made out of matchsticks. Pearl Harbor sees war and human misery as an excuse to get across the shock and awe of experiencing bombs dropping around you; gunshots going off mere feet away from you and death and destruction everywhere you turn; all in glorious, soft focus and drenched out cinematography. War films should primarily be war films that sometimes, or might not at all, contain a little bit of action &#x96; Pearl Harbor is an action film that sometimes, or might not even at all, contain a little bit of war.Pearl Harbor etches out just about everything the audience it is aimed at would want out of a film romance; action; gunfights; comedy; retribution; attractive leads, all in a runtime of about two and a half plus hours; all under the facade of historical non-fiction and real life tragedy. In historical terms, you won't learn anything from Pearl Harbor that you wouldn't be able to pick up off the back of a themed, kiddie orientated cereal box This semester Second World War Trivia! The latter third of Pearl Harbor reminded me of an old; 1945 made; Spanish produced and propagandist driven piece entitled 'The Last Ones of the Philippines', as this 99 minute piece of drivel about brave, Spanish soldiers defiantly holding up against all the odds in a symbolist-driven location (that being the local church) as various acts of heroism and 'upstanding-ness' are played out.The notion being that war works; war can be a good thing if it means being able to get across what makes a nation, or a nation's attitudes and\/or beliefs, 'great'. The catholic driven iconography of the church in said example echoes one such character's eventual demise much later on in Pearl Harbor as we realise he is killed trying to protect a friend whilst tied to a cross &#x96; a fitting iconographic intervention. Whereas the ideology of the poor, brave leads refusing to go down without a fight as they strike back with the Dolittle raids\/hold up in the said location suggests a sense of victory\/accomplishment even though the overall times for the nation are that of dark ones.I've read about it before, and I'm in agreement on the point that Bay doesn't want to end his film with the Pearl Harbor attack because it's a downer, when Bay's film-making ideology is all about anything but. Generic, Hollywood action films (Pearl Harbor is an action film, remember?), it seems, are supposed to have happy endings. Ending with the darkest hour in America's history (at least up to that point in 2001) is seen as not the way to go. But with hindsight, does United 93 go on for another hour after it ends; further documenting what America did in response to the events explored in that film? Of course not; it's an honourable and harrowing depiction of something that happened, not a glamorous; 'feel good'; action movie designed to excite.The film will eventually see Americans Rafe McCawley (Affleck) and Danny Walker (Hartnett) become pilots, but initially they mix and mingle with one another as young kids. They play on Danny's father's farm in a disused crop-duster, pretending to fly and shoot down enemy planes; essentially capturing Bay's overall attitudes to the war genre, one of which says it is just one big game in which gun fire and dogfights play a large part in 'having fun'. One day, they accidentally take up a real crop duster &#x96; much to father's displeasure, and he berates them in what is one, brief fleeting moment of realisation of how horrid war is; when he recounts what it was like in the trenches of World War One.From here, they follow up on their love of flying by becoming United States Army Air Corps First Lieutenants, all the time under the watchful eye of James Doolittle (Baldwin). This is in between getting involved with some of the nurses after they're all posted to Pearl Harbor, the nurses; of whom represent some of the loosest, dumbest, most flirtatious, most pouting ever seen on film. They are nothing but mere prizes, what with their bright red lipstick and on-screen vibrancy; they exist only to be 'won' by the male pilots and navy personnel - the one that causes the most trouble is Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale). Along for the ride is Red Winkle (Bremner); an annoying, stammering character whose deformity is nothing but the butt of most jokes; one of which occurs seconds before the Japanese actually attack Pearl Harbor as he blurts The Japs are here(!) in what is a monumentally mistimed gag on Bay's behalf.Then there is the attack itself; while technically brilliant, displaying a good awareness of where the planes and boats are in relation to one another, it exists to titillate; to excite it should be harrowing, but Bay turns it into the film's money shot &#x96; he turns it into the most exciting thing in the film when it ought to be saddest, with the item that is the saddest something else completely un-related to the Pearl Harbor attack. I think World War Two just started(!) spouts some idiot character as it all plays out. The film is a monumental misfire; a politically-driven load of clap-trap, with an ideology that reads something like 'You do not mess with America!', one that sees the Japanese given five seconds of backlog and President Roosevelt, circa 1941, actually stand up and walk. Too bad there was no last stand in a church.

Pearl Harbor, or 'Pearl Harbour' to the Brits or further still 'Pearl Harbore' to anyone with any common sense - regardless of nationality, is a film that blurs these boundaries to the point of blindness. It ploughs through the rule book like a freight train slamming through a blockade made out of matchsticks. Pearl Harbor sees war and human misery as an excuse to get across the shock and awe of experiencing bombs dropping around you; gunshots going off mere feet away from you and death and destruction everywhere you turn; all in glorious, soft focus and drenched out cinematography. War films should primarily be war films that sometimes, or might not at all, contain a little bit of action &#x96; Pearl Harbor is an action film that sometimes, or might not even at all, contain a little bit of war.Pearl Harbor etches out just about everything the audience it is aimed at would want out of a film romance; action; gunfights; comedy; retribution; attractive leads, all in a runtime of about two and a half plus hours; all under the facade of historical non-fiction and real life tragedy. In historical terms, you won't learn anything from Pearl Harbor that you wouldn't be able to pick up off the back of a themed, kiddie orientated cereal box This semester Second World War Trivia! The latter third of Pearl Harbor reminded me of an old; 1945 made; Spanish produced and propagandist driven piece entitled 'The Last Ones of the Philippines', as this 99 minute piece of drivel about brave, Spanish soldiers defiantly holding up against all the odds in a symbolist-driven location (that being the local church) as various acts of heroism and 'upstanding-ness' are played out.The notion being that war works; war can be a good thing if it means being able to get across what makes a nation, or a nation's attitudes and\/or beliefs, 'great'. The catholic driven iconography of the church in said example echoes one such character's eventual demise much later on in Pearl Harbor as we realise he is killed trying to protect a friend whilst tied to a cross &#x96; a fitting iconographic intervention. Whereas the ideology of the poor, brave leads refusing to go down without a fight as they strike back with the Dolittle raids\/hold up in the said location suggests a sense of victory\/accomplishment even though the overall times for the nation are that of dark ones.I've read about it before, and I'm in agreement on the point that Bay doesn't want to end his film with the Pearl Harbor attack because it's a downer, when Bay's film-making ideology is all about anything but. Generic, Hollywood action films (Pearl Harbor is an action film, remember?), it seems, are supposed to have happy endings. Ending with the darkest hour in America's history (at least up to that point in 2001) is seen as not the way to go.

Previously he managed to find material that suited him well and that he could import some of his style to. But this story really feels like Burton all the way through, from the wonderful casting of Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp and Vincent Price to the visual scheme of the movie and the whole theme of the misunderstood outsider, only temporarily redeemed by art.Edward Scissorhands (Depp) is the unfinished creation of a classic style mad doctor (Price). When the Avon Lady (Dianne Wiest) comes calling and finds the boy all alone, she takes him down to her house and tries to help him fit in with what passes for normal life in the suburbs. He falls for her preppy daughter (Ryder) and gets into a conflict with her jock boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall). While temporarily becoming a celebrity due to his unique hairstyles and lawn decorations, Edward's freakish nature and his innocent and underdeveloped emotions eventually cause the neighborhood to turn against him en masse like the villagers in Frankenstein. Under about 100 layers of makeup and prosthetics, Depp manages to turn in a very poignant performance as Edward mostly thanks to his ability to emote with his eyes like a silent actor. Ryder, who's been discarded by Hollywood in recent years, shows the kind of qualities that made her one of the few true teen stars of her time. The parents, played by Wiest and Alan Arkin, provide some of the film's most hilariously low-key moments of situational comedy. Arkin seems like the type of guy who doesn't really understand anything that's happening around him, but who has a graceful acceptance of the degree of chaos that his do-gooder wife brings to the family.There's a brazen sort of coloratura in the extreme contrast between the pastel burbs and the perpetually dark and stormy castle that seems to exist right in the heart of town (without anyone taking much notice of it). In a sense it's the uneasy marriage of the comfortable Gothic beauty of Batman with the crazy funhouse colors of Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. The film's success really depends on one's willingness to accept the romance between Ryder and Depp, which develops without much narrative or dramatic impetus. It can in a sense be seen as a deep flaw in the film, since it's hard to see Ryder's initial warming-up to Depp's character as anything other than pity. Accepted on its own terms however, the story is as tragic as anything Hollywood has turned out in the past few decades. Edward is this guy who absolutely cannot have any contact with human beings without accidentally scarring them. The premise of the movie would indeed fall apart if Burton and his writers had tried to force a happier conclusion.

She's Mira Sorvino --a tall, tasteless, shrill whore. Allen spends most of the rest of the movie trying to liberate her from her business agent, a skinhead with an earring, but after a while complications arise. Allan eventually tries her out, and his wife has a tentative encounter with their friend, Peter Weller, all of which is kind of familiar Allan territory.I'm beginning to find these plots a little tiresome because they're so repetitive. A knot of New York neurotics forms an unbalanced system of attractions, and the stuttering Allan is in the middle of it all.The stories now depend more on the jokes and one-liners and the particular quirks of the performers than they do on the plots. If there's anything innovative, this is where it's liable to be found.Actually this one has quite a bit of novelty slathered over it. There's no sex of course but Mira Sorvino gets off some surprisingly frank lines. And some of the expressions are as amusing as those we've come to expect from Woody Allan. He makes my stomach sick to my stomach. And this time around there's a Greek chorus that mixes epic poetry with Yiddishisms. The chorus does what the original Greek chorus did, commenting on the action, but sometimes the leader, F. Murray Abraham, emerges from the group and in garish makeup follows Allan around and scolds him. There are also multiple appearances by Cassandra. And Jack Warden makes a couple of delightful short appearances as Tiresias the Blind Prophet. After the chorus introduces him a couple of times using his long Homeric epithet Warden comes up with something like, Oh, cut the crap and just call me Tiresias. I don't know why the characters always eat Italian when they could be gorging themselves on plump Kalamata olives and taramasalata. And I suppose the title, Mighty Aphrodite, is meant to suggest that everything we value rests on loving it without too much questioning.The movie's good for a couple of laughs and a more or less constant smile. There's nothing dull about it. It's not a knockabout farce or anything though and, if there's a message at all, I suppose it's that we're not supposed to mess with McFate. Allan has a brilliant son and he ought to accept this gift of the gods without questioning it. I have an adopted son too and I have to beat him half senseless to get him to do his homework. Allan's lucky. But, come to think of it, maybe if I looked up my kid's birth mother, I'd find she was the Empress of Korea or something. Maybe there's a couple of bucks in it.

Allan eventually tries her out, and his wife has a tentative encounter with their friend, Peter Weller, all of which is kind of familiar Allan territory.I'm beginning to find these plots a little tiresome because they're so repetitive. A knot of New York neurotics forms an unbalanced system of attractions, and the stuttering Allan is in the middle of it all.The stories now depend more on the jokes and one-liners and the particular quirks of the performers than they do on the plots. If there's anything innovative, this is where it's liable to be found.Actually this one has quite a bit of novelty slathered over it. There's no sex of course but Mira Sorvino gets off some surprisingly frank lines. And some of the expressions are as amusing as those we've come to expect from Woody Allan. He makes my stomach sick to my stomach. And this time around there's a Greek chorus that mixes epic poetry with Yiddishisms. The chorus does what the original Greek chorus did, commenting on the action, but sometimes the leader, F. Murray Abraham, emerges from the group and in garish makeup follows Allan around and scolds him. There are also multiple appearances by Cassandra. And Jack Warden makes a couple of delightful short appearances as Tiresias the Blind Prophet. After the chorus introduces him a couple of times using his long Homeric epithet Warden comes up with something like, Oh, cut the crap and just call me Tiresias. I don't know why the characters always eat Italian when they could be gorging themselves on plump Kalamata olives and taramasalata. And I suppose the title, Mighty Aphrodite, is meant to suggest that everything we value rests on loving it without too much questioning.The movie's good for a couple of laughs and a more or less constant smile. There's nothing dull about it. It's not a knockabout farce or anything though and, if there's a message at all, I suppose it's that we're not supposed to mess with McFate. Allan has a brilliant son and he ought to accept this gift of the gods without questioning it. I have an adopted son too and I have to beat him half senseless to get him to do his homework. Allan's lucky. But, come to think of it, maybe if I looked up my kid's birth mother, I'd find she was the Empress of Korea or something. Maybe there's a couple of bucks in it.

They have an adopted son, Max, who is so bright that Allan is compelled to seek out his birth mother and see if she, too, is as awesomely brainy -- perhaps a math professor or some kind of Nobel Prize winner or a descendant of Kandinsky.After much effort, kept secret from his wife, Allan finally locates her. She's Mira Sorvino --a tall, tasteless, shrill whore.

The two stars, who must have commanded salaries great enough to entitle them to better material, are Mel Gibson as a happily paranoid New York cabbie, and Julia Roberts as the Justice Department agent who first scoffs, then believes, then loves.The plot is similar to that of Three Days of the Condor. Some nonentity who specializes in finding conspiracies everywhere finally stumbles upon one that counts and is haunted by the villains AND the faceless instruments of acronymic government agencies who believe that he's dangerous for one reason or another. If it weren't for Julia Roberts, Mel Gibson would be babbling exclusively to himself.I don't know about Gibson. As a man, there are things about him I find admirable -- getting caught while drunk and strung out on drugs, for instance -- but as an actor he seems bland, and I generally wind up feeling that this is the wealthy Hollywood celebrity, Mel Gibson, enacting a role. And what a role. Half the time he's breathless with speech pressure and the other half he's hallucinating because he's been injected by Patrick Stewart with some kind of mind-bending substance with a name like Hexachloropromazinalpsychobenzodiazapine.Julia Roberts is a little more convincing but her role is so familiar and so devoid of originality in its execution that it's almost painful to watch her, despite her appealingly fragile bone structure and wraparound smile. There's also that tiny vein running vertically down (or up) her forehead.It could have been a more engaging movie if there had been a strong supporting cast, but in fact there isn't.At the end -- get this -- at the end, Gibson is trying to hold the struggling Stewart two feet underwater with a mop. Patrick manages to draw his pistol, cock it, and shoot Gibson in the chest multiple times -- from underwater. Not to be outdone, Roberts blows Stewart away by shooting HIM through two feet of water.Well, that wasn't quite the end. Carrying his couple of ounces of lead, Gibson collapses to the floor. Roberts hysterically hugs him, screaming out for an ambulance. Fade. Roberts in dark glasses is standing over a grave in a lonely cemetery. The headstone reads Mel Gibson, Hollywood Actor, Beloved Madcap. Roberts dabs at a tear, murmurs, I'll miss your face, and trudges away.I'm thinking, Whoa! This movie has had all the intricacy of one of those connect-the-dot drawings in the Sunday paper. You're supposed to wind up with a pencil picture of a clown, and here we have the mask of Tragedy? However -- well, I won't give the last shot away, but we have nothing to worry about.
