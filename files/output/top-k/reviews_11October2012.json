[{"date":"11 October 2012","score":"","review":" Osmosis Jones is a pretty good movie, it's very disgusting at times but you just have to go with it. This is the story of a guy named Osmosis Jones, a white blood cell voiced by Chris Rock. He lives inside the body of Frank, a slobby zoo keeper who's body is likened to a city it has it's dump (guess where), power plant (heart), ghetto (liver), and even natural disasters (cramps and sicknesses.) So when Frank ingests a hard boiled egg that has been in the mouth of a monkey and on the ground, it's bad news. Especially when the egg hosts the Red Death virus named Thrax (my favorite character), voiced superbly by a evilly suave and utterly unrecognizable Laurence Fishburne. Thrax wants to kill Frank in record time (48 hours) by damaging his hypothermis gland and heating Frank up like A sidewalk on a summer day... Thrax snickers. To help Osmosis fight Thrax, enter the by-the-book and not particularly bright cherry-flavored cold pill Drix (David Hyde Peirce)who wants to prove his worth by curing Frank. my final thought The animated portions of the movie were entertaining and fun. The live action portions of the film were gross and not that funny. If it had been 95% animation, this would have been a lot better film.
