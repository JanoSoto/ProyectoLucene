Thankfully, Jar Jar Binks screen time is limited, though oddly enough his time on screen still managed to be so awkward and hackneyed that it made me wince.  By far, however, the biggest reason why AOTC cannot score higher than an 8 out 10 in this reviewer's mind is due to the idiotic dialogue between Amadala and Anakin during their love scenes.  The scripting in these parts is absolutely horrible to the point that my date and I were literally laughing out loud during the scenes.  In some movies if a scene doesn't go over right it can make you squirm or even feel a little embarrassed.  The dialogue and, consequently, the acting in these love scenes was so bad that all we could do was shake our heads and laugh.  From what we could tell, everyone else in the packed theater felt exactly the same way with several people giggling, shaking their heads, or simply resting their heads in their hands trying to hide their eyes.  Lucas is a genius at times when it comes to dreaming up these far away locales and the action scenes in this film are incredible and very impressive.  But he needs to face facts the guy does not have even a simple grasp of what a love scene should sound like or how two people in love should talk to each other.  Granted, we're talking about a distant galaxy where customs and speech patterns could realistically be quite different than ours, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is that it is just CHEESEY.  Regardless of anything else, you have to be able to appeal to the audience of today...and people today, for the most part, aren't going to take that kind of crap seriously.  When Anakin says to Amadala, I don't like sand...it's course...and it gets everywhere.  It's not like you...you're everything that is soft - and smooth it was all I could do to keep myself from literally rolling out of my seat.  My girlfriend and I, along with the rest of the theater sat there slack-jawed that the dialogue was that cheesey.  Believe me, there is a reason I have gone off on this one point for so long it dropped an otherwise almost perfect movie down a couple of big notches.  If Lucas had any humility and could recognize his weaknesses as a screen-writer he would have brought in some help to re-write those scenes and to try to form a real bond and romance between the two main characters.

Adapted from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it moves the story from 19th century imperialist Africa to Vietnam.  Capt.

Willard is to travel up river to find him.  Along the way, he comes across many encounters that make him realize the insanity and horror of Vietnam.  While it is mostly excellent, the ending is a little unfocused.Willard is a superbly developed character.  He begins in a paradox - he hates to be in the jungle and he hates to be on leave, trapped in the city. He is simply following orders.  Along the journey, reading about Col. Kurtz, he begins to identify with him.  Every character is acted perfectly, except for Kurtz.  It seems that Brando had little focus about what he wanted his character to be like, and it shows.  Robert Duvall particularly does an excellent job as Lt. Col. Kilgore, who is obsessed with surfing.The technical achievements of this movie are in its visuals and its atmosphere.  The atmosphere of going up the river, further into a strange, unknown land, is incredible.  As Willard travels into the jungle, he becomes more and more like Kurtz, the setting parallelling his descent into madness. Visually, this movie is one of the greatest of all time.  The entire helicopter raid sequence is perhaps the best fifteen or twenty minutes ever committed to film.  It is indescribable - rather, it must be viewed to appreciate.This film is rich and complex in its themes.  The insanity of war, and a man's descent into madness are in the forefront.  Willard originally sees the reason to kill Kurtz, but as he encounters the horrors of Vietnam, he begins to more and more understand Kurtz's actions, and almost become him. Obviously, there are also parallels to Heart of Darkness, viewing Vietnam as an imperialistic undertaking by America.Apocalypse Now is not a flawless movie.

It's no masterpiece, and other films of the American golden age are better in one respect or another. But few are quite as sad, and stick with one quite as indelibly, as Easy Rider. Keep in mind that the filmmakers were NOT hippies - they all came of age during the '50s, products of the Beat Generation and the James Dean era. Ducktails, not freaks. And in general, among '60s pop culture figures, the younger ones tended to be more goofily optimistic and pie-eyed; the slightly older ones, like Hopper, Fonda, and Terry Southern, seemed to have an in-grown pessimistic sense that all these good times and feelings of liberation couldn't last.

It takes a bitingly satirical look at what makes Hollywood work. However, beneath its surface it is more than just that. It's a uniquely strange look what happens to a prima donna who's fallen from her high horse.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a young, down on his luck Hollywood writer. He's just scraping by, trying to hide his car from repo men.  He winds up in the house of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an aging silent film star who is working on her comeback screenplay.  She gives Joe the job of fixing the screenplay, although her aim is basically to have him for company.The characters are well formed and incredibly well acted, specifically in Joe and Norma.  They are three dimensional - each has their own internal struggles and desires.  Joe, on one hand, relies on Norma to keep up his good life that it has, but on the other hand wants to go out and be with the girl that he loves.  Norma is stuck in the delusion, kept up by her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim), that she is still famous.Holden and Swanson perform their parts brilliantly.  Holden is the man trapped, with no way out.  Swanson overacts, intentionally, saying every line with such grandiosity that she perfectly captures the way Norma feels about herself and her perceived stardom.This movie is about a woman who was once great and has fallen.  She reacts to it not with acceptance, but an unconscious denial.  She, along with Max, has convinced herself that she is still a star with legions of fans.  Joe keeps up the charade because of everything that he is offering her.  The idea of the middle aged woman keeping the young man for company is genuinely strange, but it fits the picture that Norma is trapped in the past, and fails to move on, but rather deny it.Sunset Boulevard is a brilliant movie.  It works on two levels - as a satire about the hollowness of fame and Hollywood, and also as a look at what happens when one has fallen from grace.

Forget about analyzing the films for it's' morale, discount any such motives to extract meaning and afterthought. The reason you might ask is because there are none. If these simple rules are followed, then the viewer will have had a great time with this very funny film.      Eddie Griffin (Double Take, The New Guy) has graced our screens many times in the past; unfortunately, these roles have been secondary characters with little or no substance to them. In this instance, Griffin gets the due recognition he deserves. He portrays Anton Jackson, a slick, smooth talking, &#145;stuck in the 70's' kind of guy who just so happens to be the world's greatest spy. In terms of plot, you can derive your own conclusions about the wafer-thin plot that has many holes and causes for disequilibrium on more than one occasion.       Despite that detriment, the film is neatly tucked into three acts which at only 91 minutes in duration, causes for a sour second act that is quite tedious and unfunny. The film is basically linked from one scene to another as there are no correlations to previous scenes. Each scene builds upon the next resulting in a quick film that straggles only when attempting to build up a weak climactic battle. Yet, we know what we are in for when we screen a film of this capacity. We are simply in attendance for the laughs and that is what we get. A hilarious climax ensues pitting villainous Mr. Feather (the innocuous and misplaced Chris Kattan) against our soulful Undercover Brother in a serenading of Michael Jackson's &#145;Just Beat it' before the final showdown.       The script has an exaggerated yet interesting premise in which an unidentified figurehead attempts at ridding the world out of the African-American train of thought. Rap Music, funky bell bottoms and afro hair styles are all part of an evil scheme that uses the unfortunate case of racial bigotry at the foreground of this pleasant film.      Race does play a vital role in the jokes of the film as there is a no holds-barred attitude from both racial perspectives as mayonnaise, corduroy pants and even the television show &#145;Frasier' are at the core of some very funny jokes. That being said, the film is heavily flawed and one cannot help but draw comparisons to the &#145;Austin Powers' films. Is this film as witty and clever? Definitely not; but it is justified to say that &#145;Undercover Brother' can stand on its' own as an innocent and singular piece of film that is not ashamed of poking fun at the &#145;free-wheelin', good natured spirit of the 70's. And for that in itself, it must be condoned.       Director Malcolm D. Lee vehemently infuses some soulful zest into his film in the implementation of some great 70's tunes along with some funky sequences of the said adjective. Furthermore, what can be admired is the apparent attempt at spoofing the &#145;blax-ploitation' films of the past. While there were not many references to past iconic fads, when there was that one correlation &#150; it worked.       One such example is our hero's tormented obsession with the Bruce Lee film,' Enter the Dragon'. Seemingly enough, that film seemed to have influenced the direction and style of the many action\/adventure sequences presented in this film. From the in your face comedic martial arts sequences, to the wide shot car chase, to the slanted angle character shots, this whole film is an amalgamation of  past fads and ideologies bottled up in a harmless comedy.       This film is quite the gem in its' own little way, yet part of the film's chemistry is the cast. The underrated and unappreciated Dave Chappelle (Half-Baked) is absolutely terrific as the titled Conspiracy Brother. He is part of the team Undercover Brother works for and along for the ride are Chi McBride, Denise Richards and even Billy Dee Williams makes the cast. But the greatest surprise is the casting of Doogie Howser himself. Just as we thought he faded out of the limelight until another &#145;Starship Troopers' came along, Neil Patrick Harris plays Lance, the only original member of the all black secret team; the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. In case you are wondering what these initials stand for, do not bother. Not even the film makes an attempt at explaining it.      At this point in time, it is not an understatement to identify &#145;Austin Powers' as the comedic icon of the 60's, and as soon as &#145;Undercover Brother' hits DVD and develops a cult following, so will it replace an iconic figure and be the pedestal of the 70's. This film is the type of film to grow on people. Similar to when &#145;Austin Powers' was first released, the original film hardly made an unimpressive 33$ Million. It wasn't until it developed a following on video that the second was rushed and released and made more than 4 times the original amount.       Therefore, those searching for a developed, coherent and exuberantly produced film are encouraged to look elsewhere.

But the greatest surprise is the casting of Doogie Howser himself. Just as we thought he faded out of the limelight until another &#145;Starship Troopers' came along, Neil Patrick Harris plays Lance, the only original member of the all black secret team; the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. In case you are wondering what these initials stand for, do not bother. Not even the film makes an attempt at explaining it.      At this point in time, it is not an understatement to identify &#145;Austin Powers' as the comedic icon of the 60's, and as soon as &#145;Undercover Brother' hits DVD and develops a cult following, so will it replace an iconic figure and be the pedestal of the 70's. This film is the type of film to grow on people. Similar to when &#145;Austin Powers' was first released, the original film hardly made an unimpressive 33$ Million. It wasn't until it developed a following on video that the second was rushed and released and made more than 4 times the original amount.       Therefore, those searching for a developed, coherent and exuberantly produced film are encouraged to look elsewhere.  If it is simply a funny film with underdeveloped characters, reality defying sequences and a wafer thin script then you found it. This film will satiate your desire for a fanciful laugh and will have you walking away uttering contagious catch lines as &#145;Solid' and &#145;You've got Soul'. One aspect that is definitely solid in this film, despite the weak second act &#150; are the laughs.Giancarlo's Rating **1\/2  ","genre":"Action, Comedy"},{"date":"31 May 2002","score":"","review":"  After seeing this, I wished Lucas would stop using the name Star Wars and call these something else.The Star Wars movies (4-6)were brilliant for so many reasons.  Episode 1 and 2, miss the magic and danger entirely.Since the bad outweighs the good, I'll start with the good.  Special effects.  This is all about computer generated effects.  It has a good number of terrific sequences due to the effects.Ewan McGregor rocks again.  His portrayal of Obi Wan is a total compliment.Now, the bad.  Grab a drink and take off your shoes.CGI is either a movie's compliment or it's crutch.  In this case, it was a wheelchair and a respirator.  It kept the movie rolling and breathing. Some scenes felt to me like they were filler to get to the next special effects sequence.  Not to mention, a couple of the effects were quite fake looking. And come on, if I really want two hours of computer effects, can I just play a video game and get it over with before going to a movie, where I'm supposed to be told a story?  (I'm not bashing CGI entirely.  Shrek, Monsters Inc., and Fellowship of the Ring come to mind as recent brilliant CGI.)The acting was horrid.  The cast is filled with talented actors and actresses, but they were directed wrong.  Like Sam Jackson.  A great actor that is, well, boring in this.  And Hayden Christensen is a good actor, as proven in Life as a House.  I hope this train wreck of a performance doesn't hurt his career as a serious actor.The dialogue is another contributing factor to the flaw.  In the old days, it seems to me anyway, Star Wars dialogue was short, simple, and sweet. Here, it drags along.  Most of the conversations are presented in what felt like a neutral pitch.  After a while, I didn't care too much what they were saying.  Nothing ever seemed to come from it.There were also some ridiculous moments where a great special effects\/stunt show should've been avoided.  A time consuming scene involved characters on a dangerous assembly line.  Well, the thing that bugged me was, it was a conveyer belt.  Two steps to the left or right, and you're off the belt, avoiding all of the big, curiously evil-looking machines on the line.The timing was bad.  Some things, many things, went on too long.  Others, very few others, were too short.  SPOILER ALERT, GO TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID A SPOILER.  The scene where Anny grieves over his mother and goes crazy was way too short.  I really woke up here, then actually became mad when it cut away.  This is DARTH VADER we're talking about here.  He becomes a guy who kills more of his commanders than any rebel ever dreamed of, and we can't see him go bezerk on faceless characters who barely resemble humans?  Man, I wanted to see him frothing at the mouth, raving mad. Instead, I get to hear about it.  I quote Homer, D'OH!-------------------------------Finally, the super-hyped Yoda fight.  I actually guffawed when I saw computer Yoda acting like a gunslinger getting ready for a fight.  With a little bread, I could've made a big cheese sammitch.  Once again, there was a sequence where Yoda flipped about the room in a manner that made me ask, How're those moves helping him win the fight?  Oh wait, Lucas is showing off the CGI...(They showed a little clip of this on a TV commercial a little over a week after the movie was out.  The stinger was, they used Spider-Man font and said...If you only see one action hero this year..., then showed Yoda drawing his saber.  What's that say about faith in this film when STAR WARS has to be compared to another movie in an ad?)Okay, it's all off my chest.  I gave this movie a four, based almost solely on Ewan McGregor and the special effects.  If you have an extra two hours, and don't feel like watching paint dry, watch this.
