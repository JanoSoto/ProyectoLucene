[{"date":"10 May 2000","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Disney continues to establish themselves as the masters of wasted opportunities.  With years in development and an entire studio of technology built to make it, Dinosaur comes off as a flat, boring, standard-issue Disney animated film that just looks better than it's predecessors.  To call its plot standard-issue Disney is almost giving it too much credit.  All the basic elements are here but Dinosaur's script is so patch worked together from other Disney films that it has no personality of its own.  It's just a collection of repeated Disney themes.  Making things worse is the film's tendency to undermine what little drama there is.  Part of the film involves following a heard of dinosaurs across the newly scorched landscape to where water should be awaiting them.  They get there and find no water.  Our hero discovers that the water lies just under the surface, everyone rejoices and drinks.  The next day it rains.  The film continues on in this backwards manner.  There are two ill-tempered dinosaurs leading the pack and all for leaving behind the weaker ones to be picked off by following predators.  The film's persistent and somewhat annoying message of teamwork should have the most impact on these contrary attitudes.  Instead, enlightenment is granted to one of the two, quickly followed by his death which renders the whole gesture pointless.Is there anything worthwhile here?  The visuals are astounding, but in this day and age of constant one-upsmanship in the field of cinematic CGI, one can't help but feel a tad flippant about the whole thing.  James Newton Howard provides a score that is at times interesting, the dinos don't sing thank God, but too often proves derivative of The Lion King.  The voice work is unimpressive all around and adding ethnic undercurrents to each personality was a bad idea.  The whole idea of voicing these characters further proves the film's determination to undermine itself.  Create the most visually real dinosaur film you can possibly imagine, and then make the dinos talk and throw in modern references for good measure.  The Disney machine needs a serious overhaul, now.

What was the point of making this film?  An updating or remake of a 60 year old film which wasn't that great in the first place.I remember the original Fantasia has some decent animation and some standout imagery (i.e. The giant blue demon opening its wings, Mickey Mouse hacking the broom into pieces, the army of dinosaurs slowly dying...)  but Fantasia 2000 retains none of such qualities.  The animated sequences are short, unimaginitive, contrived, and (like the original) highly dull and incoherent.   The worst of which would be the Steadfast Tin Soldier which so one-sidedly points out the Jack-in-the-Box as the villain who justifyingly burns to death just because he was jealous the toy ballerina didn't return his love...  Do we really want our kids to see this crap? This belongs on late-night HBO or Jerry Springer.A lazy, fun-free film from Disney, who insist on pumping out movie after movie, each less interesting than the first.  Good thing this film is barely an hour long .

Although one or two of the cartoon segments within have appeared on the Disney television shows, the work itself entered a state of oblivion, not undeserved.   It is a live-action travelogue to South America, inserted into which are four cartoons  Goofy as a gaucho, Donald as a tourist, Pedro (a mail carrying junior plane) and Donald with Joe Carioca dancing the samba. Accompanying it is a 30 minute 16 mm travelogue of the tour (in reverse order), utilizing more local detail.   This work inexplicably garnered three Oscar noms Sound, Scoring and Song - all undeserved.   Probably it was honored due to its goodwill efforts in acknowledging our South American neighbors continued opposition to Naziism - so can be counted as propaganda. The Academy chose to nominate the forgettable title song, appearing only under the credits, and not the hit parade song (Tico, Tico) from the film - dumb Academy.   This is harmless for kids but a piece of boring fluff for adults - certainly not worth buying, but maybe a rental or two for the young set may be in order.  Newly released on video 5\/00.
