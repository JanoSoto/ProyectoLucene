The Character depth was only achived by the actors and alot of the time you could feel the tensions of the actors wanting to imporve on lines and scenes but of course this is a big no no when it comes to Mr.Lucas.The wardrobe was fantastic as well as the special effects. Al ot of the characters don't seem to fit very well in the movie. Particularly the original droids. they seem to be thrown in the movie for simple nostalga. There are parts (like the first star wars film) where you feel the minutes go by like a turtle. Unfortuantely the best part of the movie is pretty much the end. Dark Maul is an impressive villain unfortunatly he isn't given many lines which just adds to the disappointment of the movie. You want him to say something memorable like I will crush your Jedi bones or something villain like. To truly appreciate this film you have to look at it as a meal this is just a apertizer and you will get on to the main course dont rush your meal savor it. All in all this was a good film but not an awesome one. Still its star wars! keeping on with the legacy of this incredible triology. Unfortunately if Mr.Lucas could lower his incredible ego maybe this movie could have been better. A lot of characters are memroble and you can tell were the inspiration came from Jar Jar (a very annoying character i might add) race is Caribbean in root. The Jedies are just samuries and this is shown more with the music. Very cool i might add. The Senate is mostly Roman. The beginning of the film i think gives you a flash back to the old godzilla films (youll understand once you see). plus there is some christian beliefs touched in the film. Hopefully the next movie will be better i'm pretty sure of it, but when you watch this movie don't expect a mindblowing film, you'll get good movie with incredible special effects and fight scenes. Still like i said Its STAR WARS!!! what more can you ask?

He is not feeding off his last work; he is simply doing a variation on a favorite theme.  Which is to say that while Notting Hill shares many elements with Four Weddings and a Funeral, this in no way diminishes either movie, and both are quite good.In fact, of the two, I think I might prefer this one.  Julia Roberts's star power exceeds Andie MacDowell's, and Roberts is given more time to develop her character, so the romance works better here than in Four Weddings.The one rehash of the Four Weddings format that didn't work on any level was the attempt to find another rock and roll oldie to revamp for the soundtrack and turn into a big hit.  In the attempt to find what would be for Notting Hill what Wet Wet Wet's version of Love is All Around was for Four Weddings, we are taken through a tiresome and intrusive series of oldies and covers of oldies, the best of which (though that's not saying much) is Elvis Costello's far too faithful cover of She.

I got all excited and went to see the movie that night.  I expected for all of the magical character developement, relationship exploration and situational understanding that I witnessed in the book to be at least hinted at in the movie... I was wrong.In the book Anakin is adorable.  He is helpful to neighbors. Loving to his mother. Generous beyond belief.  Best of all he is a romantic. He is very sure of himself and a show off (in a little boy sort of way) but stops short of being snoty.  The fact that Anakin grows up to be Darth Vader completely leaves the mind. Most importantly he is loved by everyone around him (with exception to a few antagonists) and he is loved by the READER.In the film Anakin is arrogant and snotty.  His emotions are unexplored and Jake Loyd gives an impersonal performance (this may be the fault of George's lack of directing).  Crucial scenes and lines that would have given the audience a chance to know the boy for who he is inside (rather than what he can do) are left out.

Great casting.  Acting was fine (though they gave some unnatural lines to Jake Lloyd that I don't think anyone could have delivered convincingly).  Great effects, great environments, cool people in cool situations.What didn't measure up?  While it isn't too juvenile (unlike the Ewoks...& I would've much preferred the more subtle humor of R2D2, C3PO, and Chewie from the 1st 3 Eps. rather than Jar Jar), the story just didn't deliver the drama, the tension, the excitement, etc that Eps. IV-VI did.  I think it would probably be more exciting to go rent one of those tapes for my VCR than it would be to watch the movie a 2nd time in the theater (though the Jedi lightsaber action alone & the other cool visuals almost entirely justifies the admission -g-).Perhaps the experience was damaged for me by the hype & the pre-release info...though I intentionally tried not to learn anything that wasn't officially released by Lucas.  Perhaps it was still too much.  I was aware of one significant spoiler before going, which was bad, and a few minor details I could easily anticipate from other info I'd learned.  Or perhaps the story was too constrained by having to deliver on setup that we all knew was going to happen anyway?  But I don't think so. Eps. IV-VI were hardly high-concept stories, yet they had fun, interesting little surprises told in just the right manner to add up to so much.  I wish this film had accomplished the same.  And IV-VI both stood on their own AND fit together...I felt this Eps. was too much of a setup.  I plan on reading NOTHING about Eps. II to see if that helps.  I saw V & VI cold, and maybe I should've with Eps. I as well.Jar Jar is acceptable, just barely staying back from being over the top.  Actually, Boss Nass is less believable than Jar Jar...I can accept a bumbling bad apple from the Gungan race, but for their leader to be such a slovenly clown....  The digital characters are in the scenes very convincingly (though perhaps if I re-watch I won't feel the same, but nothing jarred the 1st time through).  I don't feel the movie is cold, or overwhelmed by its special effects...it just suffered from not enough of the right touch in the story, screen-writing, and directing.As for the climax... it wasn't built-up enough, it wasn't climactic enough.  I like the Amidala character very much, I thought she was a well-done, well-acted, strong presence, the film never really made me care about her fate very much.  The real people in the film were Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Anakin.  At that, the sometimes clumsy dialogue interfered with my being able to really get in tune with Anakin very much. A young actor, esp. when he doesn't have a huge number of lines, can't get us to slough off some bad lines the way a more experienced, charismatic actor can.Perhaps trying to get us into so many new characters at once was a bad idea in a 1st installment...we're supposed to care about Qui-Gon, get into Obi-Wan, see Anakin\/Vader in a fresh light, enjoy Jar Jar, get into the Queen, etc.  Perhaps that's too many people with too little focus on any one.  In Eps. IV (our 1st intro to a raft of new characters) we're clearly focused on Luke.  To a lesser degree are Leia & Han, important characters, and we grow to love wise old Kenobi.  And that's it.  Vader is a simple presence to comprehend, & we're not supposed to like him anyhow.  The droids & Chewie subtly start working their effects on our heart but we don't need to love them for the 1st movie to succeed.In Eps. I we're supposed to love Qui-Gon, focus on Obi-Wan, focus on Anakin, focus on the Queen...and as for Jar Jar vs droids\/Chewie...Jar Jar's presence is NOT subtle, unlike the minor lovables from Eps. IV.Anyway, I hope I like Eps. II more than I, or I'm going to start getting very disappointed.
