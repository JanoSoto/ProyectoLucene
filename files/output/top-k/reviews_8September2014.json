But I must admit that in grandeur and magnanimity, very few will match this film. Akira Kurosawa the master director made this magnum opus which I believe set a precedent in terms of various themes. Recruiting men for a purpose. A recruit romancing a local woman. A team taking up a task and accomplishing successfully with few sacrifices. These are just a few to name. This I believe is a film that has major influences from the far east to the far far west. Though made in Japan, there was a film called Magnificent Seven which was the remake of this film. That film was setup in the far far west where the Samurai were replaced by gunslingers. After watching this film, I can clearly understand what influences Kurosawa had on the likes of the film makers of later years from Steven Spielberg to Francis Ford Coppola to many Indian film makers.The themes in this film are subliminal to the extent of conflict. The conflict is even greater and is perhaps one of the earliest conflicts that spans for more than an hour. The whole fight between bandits and the villagers lasts for as many minutes as you can see. Yet, there are many things that happen in that and is almost made a war-like situation. I really doubt even in war movies, real war was shown for this long and with such intensity. The passion shown by Kurosawa is surely unmatched. In terms of set-design, casting of actors, choreography of the conflict, the cinematography with so many cameras and the finesse in editing that shows each frame beautifully. He is one of the few Asian directors who had that zeal and had that invested their whole lives in film making. Too much to learn from the first watching of this film and I am sure, I will revisit this film time and again to understand the composition of frames and many many things. From the beginning to the end this film is high on drama and has less comic content, except for the maverick Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo), but the high volume drama almost left me breathless and kept me engaged all the way.The writing is immaculate and the detailing is something that has inspired many film makers and will continue to do so.

I'd give in to the argument and come to terms with diplomacy and say both are great but personally, I love Martin more than Robert. Robert sure is a great actor but the way the whole film is handled by Martin is one thing that made a fine beginning for a man, who gave us very very significant films in his career.Lot goes on in creating an atmosphere that makes us delve into the film as audience and lot more goes into such writing and detailing. Right, from making the room like that of a reckless taxi driver to the setting up of a brothel room the environment is such dream like that it seems like to be a place we see at times in reality and at time in our dreams. Salutations to the Art Director, Cinematographer and the Director who have envisioned such ambiance and resented the same. The writing.. the screenplay is one that on the face is simple is simple, like Travis (Robert De Niro) preparing for a shoot meticulously and a few shots of holding gun and looking himself in mirror and all will make that. But the execution and enacting the writing is what makes this film special. It's not an easy thing to direct psychological films and that's the very reason I respect guys like Welles, Polanski, Hitchcock and Scorsese above many. The music score also helps a great deal and thanks to Bernard Hermann to have given such a score that is jazzy, psychedelic and at times creepy too. OK, now to Robert De NIro, he would have got all the best actor awards, had there not been a Network coz he carried the character Travis Bickle with such ease on his shoulders that I had felt the same pain as he did, when he is rejected by a girl. Thus, all through he made me empathise with him and took me into his mood, his reason of doing a certain thing. I just gave into Niro's character I must say. When the last time I saw in 2006 post my engineering days, I could not see any Indian actor but now I see Ranbir Kapoor can replicate a Taxi Driver as he has got in him everything. But I hope, this film is not remade ever and even if it does, it has to be someone like Anurag Kashyap directing Ranbir Kapoor.

Death can be such a relief in a painful world It's better to die than to go through monstrous pain that shall make us fall one day so much painfully Jack Nicholson as R P McMurphy gave us one the best anti authoritarian, anti establishment, recidivist, performances that we have rarely seen. Look at home, giving the commentary of baseball match, explaining in great detail each intricacy of the game, or the way he brings the patients on one platform by playing a basketball game. He does so many things from fishing to partying, to make those poor sick people happy but succumbs to the torture and is let free by The Chief (Will Sampson). Miss Ratched (Louise Fletcher) is the authoritarian nurse who feels that she is doing a world of good, by listening to the patients giving them medication and controlling them by her henchmen, she is not all evil but most of her certainly is evil. We don't like dictators for one reason, because we want to dictate our own terms, we want to free ourselves from the bondage set by anyone else and bind ourselves by our own will to something. Ratched was hated because she set the terms, irrespective of the amount of pain she was going to transpire within those poor souls.And thus, R P McMurphy, who was till then a sane man, got wild, weird and mad.Watch the movie for performances more than anything. The writing was good but I can't say great as it is mostly confined within the premises of the mental institution where patients stammer, mutter, scream, yell and even be silent. So how they act is more engrossing than what was written. The Chief's stoned emotions Cheswick's fight for cigarettes, Billy's plea not to tell his mother. All are acted out extremely well. For extracting such great acting from the cast, I give Milos Forman, the director complete credit and he has done an outstanding job indeed. He stood out as the watchman, the captain, watched each emotion and molded them wonderfully to make us see what this film stands today.The lighting, sound and cinematography are good. The music was great, it was not that creepy, or sad music, it was just as required for a scene. I'd rate this a great movie, as it brings alive the spirit of rebellion and I love to control my own life, even if I have to rebel for it.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"8 September 2014","score":"","review":" A stimulating and thought provoking film about relationships.This film can be considered as a pioneer in showing relationships up close and personal and how embarrassing, revelations can be. There is an emphasis of sex between husband and wife and how much sexual satisfaction means in a relationship. This is an offending film for few may be, but most for many aficionados who watch films for sheer pleasure above all else this film cater many needs of a viewer.I love the simplicity depicted and the audacity of the issue. It's for sure a highly important issue for a relationship even though it's not much discussed about with others. I suppose that if a husbands impotency if discussed, the society looks at the wife as a whore and the other way if a husband speaks of wife's inability, he is considered as a predator by women. Having said that, love making is a prime humane exercise that as humans we got to do and it's a kind of motivator for many many activities that we do. There is a scene in which Ann (Andie Mcdowell) confesses that she was never satisfied by her husband John (Peter Gallagher) while her husband watches the videotape. Such revelations are never thrown light and only a few films have such effrontery and this film is certainly is a pioneer in that direction. There are lot of infidelity films by the great Woody Allen where infidelity is made to be cynical and comical, but here it's liberating and that's a take way. When you tell all you have in your heart, you are liberated and that's a good thing to do.Steven Soderbergh made this as his first feature film and has since rose to prominence where he has made commercial films on a grand scale too. But this one seemed to be his most personal best and I love him for sticking to that, and making this film an approachable work by it's simplistic style with an intriguing title.

There is an emphasis of sex between husband and wife and how much sexual satisfaction means in a relationship. This is an offending film for few may be, but most for many aficionados who watch films for sheer pleasure above all else this film cater many needs of a viewer.I love the simplicity depicted and the audacity of the issue. It's for sure a highly important issue for a relationship even though it's not much discussed about with others. I suppose that if a husbands impotency if discussed, the society looks at the wife as a whore and the other way if a husband speaks of wife's inability, he is considered as a predator by women. Having said that, love making is a prime humane exercise that as humans we got to do and it's a kind of motivator for many many activities that we do. There is a scene in which Ann (Andie Mcdowell) confesses that she was never satisfied by her husband John (Peter Gallagher) while her husband watches the videotape. Such revelations are never thrown light and only a few films have such effrontery and this film is certainly is a pioneer in that direction. There are lot of infidelity films by the great Woody Allen where infidelity is made to be cynical and comical, but here it's liberating and that's a take way. When you tell all you have in your heart, you are liberated and that's a good thing to do.Steven Soderbergh made this as his first feature film and has since rose to prominence where he has made commercial films on a grand scale too. But this one seemed to be his most personal best and I love him for sticking to that, and making this film an approachable work by it's simplistic style with an intriguing title.

He meets Maude, a 79 year old woman at one of the funerals and his life changes significantly that he starts hating death. Till the final act Hal Ashby held this up well, and then just when I started liking Harold, he gave up on him and made Harold a simple human like most others. Maude, please don't go Ah, I disliked this part of Harold and thats where this movie fell apart for me. It's a disgusting depiction of death and yet it is very interesting, coz we have rarely seen such a boy who is so much obsessed with death and rarely we have seen a teenage boy falling for a 80 year old woman. Ah, this is a love story of a completely different kind. On one side, his mother is setting up dates with young women and on the other side, he is liking this old woman who lives life to the fullest and does not seem to be giving up on life. When he decides to get her into his life by marrying, she reveals that the time is up and says 80 is the perfect age to die and thus guy weeps as if he never was even acquainted and what it feels like dying. Hmm, I would have liked this transition to be more on the slow side rather than a rushed up thing. The writing is good and so is the direction and even acting. Ruth Gordon as Maude and Bud Cort as Harold brought something fresh to their characters, you can name that innocence or amateurishness, but it was refreshing. Hal Ashby the director who is now considered great did a good job in trying to portray two different attitudes of life and death and marry them in emotions by making the dead learn about life. It would have been a beautiful marriage of course, but what I did not like only is that our protagonist Harold changes what he thrived on his own life. Technically, I wish the production values, the cinematography were better than shown and all else seems to be right. I liked the sound design though specially for the death scenes. I am going with 3\/5 for a good film that makes two poles meet and engages them in a relationship.

Obviously take into consideration that this was one of the first movies on the Vietnam War. Apocalypse Now (1979) was a year away, Platoon (1986) & Full Metal Jacket (1987) would soon follow. That said, imagine how controversial this film must have been being released just 3 years after the end of the war.Another thing I gotta make a point about is that many of my peers have seen this movie and say it's boring and depressing. True I admit that first act is pretty lengthy, and depression is the core driving force of the whole movie anyway. War is S*^t, with a capital S. I find the movies subtle beauty quite remarkable, and a few hours after watching the film did the whole message really sink in and leave me exhausted. The movie is still widely regarded as one of American Cinemas greatest film achievements, right up there with The Godfather (1972). It had really left its mark on me at the time I saw it, and I once considered it in my all time top 5 favourite movies (Only to be replaced by Apocalypse Now 1979, which I saw a year later).Don't come looking for Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, this drama is about the consequences and after effects war has on the psyche. The physical and mental wounds given to these three friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage) take their toll, and all of them end up suffering their own kind of personal hell. The performances are incredible with Robert De Niro is in his prime, and as always keeps getting better with every movie at the time. Christopher Walken gives an Oscar winning performance, and I also really ended up caring for Meryl Streep's character which remains extremely grounded. It's surprisingly well done how all three actors work around this 3 way love triangle, which really aids this post traumatic stress between them all.The 3-act movie structure is pretty obvious here. From the small Pennsylvania town wedding, to the friends in conflict forced to play Russian roulette (These scenes are brutal, and have been hailed as a metaphor for the entire War). Finally the third act depicts the effects it has had on everyone, with an ending so downright cruel in some ways it becomes difficult to explain in print.Final Verdict Overall this felt less like a film and more of an experience, or at least a bloody well made reconstruction or biopic. It's one I think everyone should have to sit down and watch sometime in their life. After everything I have wrote and all the horror and wonder you'll experience, I still find this movie unexplainable. 10\/10.

The movie is still widely regarded as one of American Cinemas greatest film achievements, right up there with The Godfather (1972). It had really left its mark on me at the time I saw it, and I once considered it in my all time top 5 favourite movies (Only to be replaced by Apocalypse Now 1979, which I saw a year later).Don't come looking for Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, this drama is about the consequences and after effects war has on the psyche. The physical and mental wounds given to these three friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage) take their toll, and all of them end up suffering their own kind of personal hell. The performances are incredible with Robert De Niro is in his prime, and as always keeps getting better with every movie at the time. Christopher Walken gives an Oscar winning performance, and I also really ended up caring for Meryl Streep's character which remains extremely grounded. It's surprisingly well done how all three actors work around this 3 way love triangle, which really aids this post traumatic stress between them all.The 3-act movie structure is pretty obvious here. From the small Pennsylvania town wedding, to the friends in conflict forced to play Russian roulette (These scenes are brutal, and have been hailed as a metaphor for the entire War). Finally the third act depicts the effects it has had on everyone, with an ending so downright cruel in some ways it becomes difficult to explain in print.Final Verdict Overall this felt less like a film and more of an experience, or at least a bloody well made reconstruction or biopic. It's one I think everyone should have to sit down and watch sometime in their life. After everything I have wrote and all the horror and wonder you'll experience, I still find this movie unexplainable. 10\/10.

Obviously take into consideration that this was one of the first movies on the Vietnam War. Apocalypse Now (1979) was a year away, Platoon (1986) & Full Metal Jacket (1987) would soon follow. That said, imagine how controversial this film must have been being released just 3 years after the end of the war.Another thing I gotta make a point about is that many of my peers have seen this movie and say it's boring and depressing.

He is a man with vision and original ideas, but he lacks a purpose. While The Shining aims to be a horror movie, and by the way, fails in that miserably, in my eyes, it takes the worst and most typical horror movie route. That's not necessarily bad, but.There is always a mystery and the great unknown behind horror movies. This is what The Shining builds up in an impressive manner. The sole terminology and amount of mysteries and mystery elements leads the viewer to think all this build up will lead to an epic conclusion where the great reveal finally tells us what is going on, why is Jack getting insane, why does the boy see those things, who is Tony, what are these shining people and will the black man die first. Nope. Instead we are shown scenes where ghost sets Jack free from the stockroom because that's the only way for him to get out, okay? He needs to get out so he gets out. Of course that is never explained. And this leads to the biggest problem with the story. Nothing is ever explained. Too many answers will just ruin it. Yeah? I see this as nothing but a terrible excuse for a lousy storytelling and lack of brains since there was hardly anything to get beyond what was told.The loose ends, unanswered questions and all the other spooky stuff that was in the movie just to make it more spooky and mysterious are, in a one word; cheap. And with few more words; a waste of potential. I guess many of us have seen a meme picture of a dog sitting on an airplane, it looks like the dog is flying it and then there is a text I have no idea what I am doing. When I imagine Stanley Kubrick directing this film, I recall that picture. I see him behind the camera, the cast, the hotel, the stairs and a text I have no idea what I am doing and that's what we call The Shining. Not that the story was even the biggest problem, nor that the ending scene makes no sense due this not being a movie about Jack, but the characters and the sounds too. From this point on, I will act like there are no loose ends, and the story telling and plot is flawless, and I will get into why this movie is bad solely because of it other merits.In the beginning, I mentioned this failing miserably to be a horror film. The sounds will kill the theme quicker than Kubrick creates a loose end. (This is a joke, so I did not lie 2 sentences ago). I find it incredibly hard to get in the horror mood when the music can be described as wheezing. One thing they did miraculously well; they captured the feeling of tinnitus. Seriously, when you hear sounds like that, you go to the doctor and wish for the best. Then suddenly my bass is yelling, I hear the exact sound C-Class horror movies use when jump-scare scene is executed. What does this movie do with a sounds like that? They show us a black frame with a text Thursday in it. I ask myself, Do these guys take this movie as a joke? but I do not know the answer. I am not sure if these sounds are supposed to be spooky and scary, create atmosphere even, but one thing they do is remind you that you are sitting on your sofa and that you can always turn down the volume because it is just a ridiculously bad sound directing in a movie.Now, let's get to my favorite part. The cast. Jack Nicholson, what a bastard, I love him. But I see The Shining as his worst acting, not even acting, a role. He looks insane in every single picture that was ever taken of him. How is a man who looks insane a suitable person to be character in a movie where the character changes from your average fellow to a completely insane psycho? Well, he is not. He was a bad pick. I can only say that this is not the story it was supposed to be. There is good acting too. Shelley Duvann does an amazing job acting out a dull retard. Then a question. Who likes dull retard characters? This movie is her story, her family goes insane, she is in the middle of it all, she experience the horror. Then a second question. Why should we give a damn about what happens to a retard like her? This leads us to final and one of the biggest elements I am going to analyze. The kid. He is shining, he hears Tony, he can contact other shining, he is the reason why Jack does anything, he sees the horror, glimpses of past, future and future past, he is everything this movie is about. He drives the story towards the truth behind the hotel and towards everything this movie is. But what is he exactly? He is called a plot element. This is not a bad thing in my eyes, I think it is great. What is bad is what he wasn't. Imagine with me. He makes Jack shining, he makes Tony talk to Johnny, he resolves Jack's humanity, he is the one who experiences the horror while being the horror itself. After this the movie ends the same way, but now it has changed to a story about Jack who was inflicted by the horror of the kid and Tony. Instead we get an ending where Kubrick is basically saying, Since we don't know how to end this movie, let's insert bunch of stuff which makes it look deep. Cop-out.

Based on a true story, PHILADELPHIA is movie that is made well and made throughly engagingly and is completely empathizing the victim of discrimination and the victim of AIDS. Tom Hanks as Andrew Beckett gave a great performance, with all the nuances touching the notes of perfection, and making me empathize with him. It;s not sympathy, people like him need, it's empathy. They don't tear drops they need people who stand by them. Denzel Washington as Joe Miller, fought his case and fought it hard to win not just compensation for Beckett, but also glory fro him and he made history with this. Kudos to Jonathan Demme, to have made it with a poise that deeply moving and at the same time having a reality check completely in place so that it is not dramatized out of proportion. It's a case that's well fought with an ardor and decency that we see in good cases fought between good people. Andrew Beckett was good but he was Gay, his partner is Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez. Antonio gave a subdued and a good performance. Indeed everyone played their part well, be it the kids of Joe Miller too. I liked the acting of everyone, but it was a Tom Hanks movie. Yet, I loved Denzel Washington's poise more than anyone else, in the film. Now, coming to the production, firstly kudos to the studios Tristar to have accepted a subject which in 1993 was still considered a taboo and bring out a brave film. Thanks Tristar for trusting in Jonathan Demme, a master in his own way who had to struggle a lot to establish himself as director.Now, the dialogs are good. The case was terrific I must say, mostly convincing arguments, it just goes to a peak when Miller asks Beckett to open his shirt. Rest all was great in a very very important trial and a historical case. A great movie that has a relevance of taking up a social issue and fighting it to the core. This is a for sure 4\/5 from me.

Romance X, a serious art movie from 1999 directed by Catherine Breillat and staring Caroline Ducey. The film shows explicit sex.Let me first say that I am not against unsimulated sex, even penetration shots, in mainstream movies, in fact I welcome it. It is natural, beautiful, and of course arousing. So initially I therefore defied any criticism against Romance X for being pornographic.Romance X is about a young woman who has a great capacity for sexual pleasure and passion, something which is of course very positive in every respect. Her sexual encounters with different men however, her husband, an incidental lover, and a rapist, show that none of these particular men were able to satisfy her, nor even take some pleasure from being with her themselves, and then typically blame her for their own shortcomings. One thing I liked about the movie at this point was that it did not seem to be a feminist anti male film, only that the woman was unfortunate in her encounters with men. She then starts a relationship with a somewhat older headmaster at the school she is working. He satisfies her sexual desires in a very special way. This is shown in two sequences. These are graphically very exciting and appealing from a male point of view, and what adds to the subjective appeal in that respect is that the man in the sequences remains completely dressed. Towards the end of the film there is a sequence describing the female protagonist's sexual fantasy. There is a big circular room were naked women lie on benches with their heads and shoulders inside the perimeter wall and with the lower part of their bodies sticking through holes in the wall to the outside corridor where any wandering men can take pleasure in them. This fantasy concept was extremely arousing. Seeing the female parted legs sticking out of the walls was extremely erotic. Then Mrs. Breillat ruins everything by adding porno scenes with wanking men and cum shots, things that can only appeal to non-straight men. Why on earth couldn't she have had some decent fellows having vaginal intercourse with the ladies normally? That could have been with or without penetration shots. Something that would have given the said ladies satisfaction and orgasms in conformity with the protagonist's fantasy, as well as being appealing and arousing to watch for people of both sexes! I shall not reveal the last thing that happens in the film. It was after her husband had suddenly become able to satisfy her sexually (from how he behaved previously this was very unrealistic in my opinion), and after giving her a baby. I disapproved of the ending to say the least, and it then seemed that this was a feminist anti male film after all. But at this point I was so disappointed in the film I didn't care what happened in it anyway.To sum it up A good and exciting concept destroyed by it's execution.

Then Mrs. Breillat ruins everything by adding porno scenes with wanking men and cum shots, things that can only appeal to non-straight men. Why on earth couldn't she have had some decent fellows having vaginal intercourse with the ladies normally? That could have been with or without penetration shots. Something that would have given the said ladies satisfaction and orgasms in conformity with the protagonist's fantasy, as well as being appealing and arousing to watch for people of both sexes! I shall not reveal the last thing that happens in the film. It was after her husband had suddenly become able to satisfy her sexually (from how he behaved previously this was very unrealistic in my opinion), and after giving her a baby. I disapproved of the ending to say the least, and it then seemed that this was a feminist anti male film after all. But at this point I was so disappointed in the film I didn't care what happened in it anyway.To sum it up A good and exciting concept destroyed by it's execution. And with an ending that turned sympathy with the film into antipathy.

Yet, this one had only a line that was made into characters, they form scenes and these scenes of enormity give us a grand picture. This is about a man trapped in a hole, whose story is being manifested by a selfish, ambitious journalist Chuck Tatum played flawlessly by Kirk Douglas. This tiny story, surpasses many things and makes the little known place into a tourist spot. A fair is setup, sales are picked up at the store. And what more, the wife of that poor struck guy is enticing the macho journalist who has the knack of convincing people by his charm. I loved Kirk Douglas in Bad and the Beautiful and Paths of Glory my love for him grew with this film and the way he played Chuck Tatum, the enigmatic journalist who has a humane side, Alas! it came a bit too late in the film. Well, the variation of emotion or modulation of voice, he seems to be doing many things on screen all at once and that too without any effort. More than anything, he made Chuck to be a next door journalist and indeed an affable one. Yet, he is rigid on terms and work with his own mindset and his own ambition. Coming to other actors, they have ably supported Kirk in his endeavor to rescue that poor guy who was struck in the hole. All have done their job exceedingly well, be it the silent mother who prays or this big media tycoons who are willing to pay any money to Chuck to buy the story. As a story, it's utterly cynical of how media sensationalizes any petty issue and makes it headlines to attract readers. It's not news anymore, it's business. That's how we are governed now by media. I am more than happy to have seen such a satire, the other media satire I fondly remember is Peepli Live. The technical departments, for this movie have done their job well, and Billy at the helm has handled direction superbly. With each film, my love for Billy Wilder grows, and he is one of my favorite directors. With simple story lines, he made huge masterpieces that are etched in the memory forever.

Now, when I use the word masterpiece I don't mean to use it in the sense of his best movie, but rather the movie that he put most effort in. During the long production of Ran, Kurosawa's wife died, he was to make a documentary on modern Noh (which to this date remains unfinished) and many other things happened while Japan's most expensive movie at the time was being made.Ran is based on Shakespeare's King Lear (which made for some bad compromises because some elements of it had no relation with feudal Japan, such as the court jester). The title means something like revolt\/uprising\/confusion\/chaos\/downfall and the plot expands upon it by being severely nihilistic and showing a decline of a clan and those involved with it. Kurosawa's apparently favorite visual element, the weather, is put to good use in Ran because the weather conditions coincide with the theme of the clan's downfall. In the beginning of the film, the sun is shining brightly (the sun is also the symbol of Hidetora's clan). As the events unfold (and Hidetora's clan becomes more and more divided), the sun gets obscured by the clouds, only to completely make way to cloudy weather with sudden gusts of wind (surprisingly, rain doesn't appear to be present, which is odd because Kurosawa tended to use it a lot).The entire movie is basically filled with symbolism like that, most of which is related to colors, and the theme of color-coding appears a lot in Ran. It's a movie of inversions; the fool (who, might I add, is really annoying) proves himself to be more rational than his lord, whom he mocks by making him a crown out of flowers.So yes, Ran is fantastic on a visual scale, and is one of the most visually stunning movies ever made. However, it also has a lot of flaws. First off, the movie's overly pessimistic message is presented in a way too outlandish, in-your-face and caricatural manner. Second, a lot of characters are under-developed and some feel pointless. Third, and this is one of Kurosawa's running flaws, is that the runtime is way too long for the chain of events happening on-screen and the film tries to be an epic so bad that it loses its sting. All that extra runtime should be spent on character background, build-up, suspense, whatever else, but instead it appears like Kurosawa had no clue what to do with the story so he just had lord Hidetora frolic around the grass like a jackass with silly expressions on his face for half an hour. Fourth, the final battle is so incredibly disappointing that it's almost laughable.However, the movie does have a saving grace (aside from the visuals), and that is Mieko Harada as lady Kaede, whose performance is so passionate that the rest of the cast seems practically unneeded whenever she appears on screen. I especially like the scene with Kaede and the fox head, that was actually pretty humorous.Ran has a lot of flaws and feels very unpolished both concerning the pacing (which is all around the place), the message (which is too extreme and bland), the characters (most of whom are badly introduced and underdeveloped) and the action (really boring and monotone).

Although the film was produced in 1993, most of the film has been shown in black and white, which adds to the time period. This is a true masterpiece released by Steven Spielberg, and you can feel the emotion and fright from the actors involved. It must be horrifying beyond any recognition to live in such mortal danger as people did back in the second world war, but Spielberg exactly knows how to portray the story on the big screen, in a perfect manner. The film lasts longer than three hours and even looks like a live filmed documentary instead of a film, but it's truly magnificent and the story, especially the second half of the film, will really suck you into it so you never get the feeling it lasts too long.There's a deep message involved in the film, which Schindler makes clear towards his friend, war criminal Goeth. Power is not just control, it's to know when not to abuse your power. Or in a different definition, power is to know when to spare a life instead of taking one. That's what Schindler believes, and that's what makes him one of the most heroic Germans during the second world war. He was indeed a member of the Nazi party, but yet, he doesn't agree with the crimes that the German's commit against the Jews. During the film, your'e able to witness his growing envy of the holocaust and his fellow German Nazi participants. The first step he takes and when his true colors start to reveal themselves, is when he wants a Jewish accountant to run his company. The Jew, Isac Stern, tells him that Schindler might not be aware of the situation, since he's a Jew. We find out that Schindler couldn't care less, since he simply replies with the answer ''Yeah, and I'm a German''. While the company is able to expend, more Jews start to come over to Schindler's company and start to embrace him like he's a saint to them, because the Jews that are able to work for him, are saved from death. After a while, when his entire company has to dissolve and his workers have to leave for Auswitzch, he buys each and every single worker in his company, to save them from the concentration camp.That's truly heroic, in my opinion.

Schindler tells the German guards they will not shoot without permission, nor enter the work floor without authorized permission from him. Stern tells Schindler that the company isn't doing well and that the Granate Shells aren't good enough which will inevitably lead to bankruptcy. Schindler again shows his true colors by simply replying ''I would be very unhappy if my company would actually make decent grenades''. After the war is over, Schindler has to flee because he'll be seen as a criminal, although he certainly isn't in my mind, as well as in the minds of every single saved Jew from the 1100 he managed to save.

It must be horrifying beyond any recognition to live in such mortal danger as people did back in the second world war, but Spielberg exactly knows how to portray the story on the big screen, in a perfect manner. The film lasts longer than three hours and even looks like a live filmed documentary instead of a film, but it's truly magnificent and the story, especially the second half of the film, will really suck you into it so you never get the feeling it lasts too long.There's a deep message involved in the film, which Schindler makes clear towards his friend, war criminal Goeth. Power is not just control, it's to know when not to abuse your power. Or in a different definition, power is to know when to spare a life instead of taking one. That's what Schindler believes, and that's what makes him one of the most heroic Germans during the second world war. He was indeed a member of the Nazi party, but yet, he doesn't agree with the crimes that the German's commit against the Jews. During the film, your'e able to witness his growing envy of the holocaust and his fellow German Nazi participants. The first step he takes and when his true colors start to reveal themselves, is when he wants a Jewish accountant to run his company. The Jew, Isac Stern, tells him that Schindler might not be aware of the situation, since he's a Jew. We find out that Schindler couldn't care less, since he simply replies with the answer ''Yeah, and I'm a German''. While the company is able to expend, more Jews start to come over to Schindler's company and start to embrace him like he's a saint to them, because the Jews that are able to work for him, are saved from death. After a while, when his entire company has to dissolve and his workers have to leave for Auswitzch, he buys each and every single worker in his company, to save them from the concentration camp.That's truly heroic, in my opinion. There's isn't a damn thing he could've done more for his fellow humans. All of the people in the company, that are on Schindler's list, are being transported to Tjesch Slowak, but the woman end up in Auswitzch due to a mistake made during the train transport. He saves them by handing the guard a couple of diamonds, and the women are able to head for Tjesch Slowak. Schindler tells the German guards they will not shoot without permission, nor enter the work floor without authorized permission from him. Stern tells Schindler that the company isn't doing well and that the Granate Shells aren't good enough which will inevitably lead to bankruptcy. Schindler again shows his true colors by simply replying ''I would be very unhappy if my company would actually make decent grenades''. After the war is over, Schindler has to flee because he'll be seen as a criminal, although he certainly isn't in my mind, as well as in the minds of every single saved Jew from the 1100 he managed to save. Schindler falls down into tears, and despairs that he could've saved at least one more live. That's the moral to the story How much is a human worth to you? That's something to think about.

Truly this is my favorite Sci Fi, films with actors I respect and love, plus one beautiful babe, with some nice bouncing goodies. The story is great too. Three perfectly preserved bodies, where hiding within their forms are vampires, kept in glass coffins, are found in outer space by some astronauts, headed by the great Railsback, where admittedly this was the first film I saw this great, serious, and conscientious actor in. Suddenly their naked forms come to life and they all escape. What they do, is draw energy from an unwitting being, where that infected being instantly becomes a skeletal form, and within many hours, he or she it explodes where they just becomes one big pile of crumbling dirt. In this case, with her whopping features, the babe (Mathilda May) becomes great eye candy, and certainly has an affect on Railsback, in many ways. Things get better when enter the great Firth as an Agent trying to get to the bottom of problem ends up working with Railsback, totally smitten of course by that babe on the loose, as remember we've get this plague, which you'll never guess where it spreads from London. As though may'be, you're expecting more action and gore, though one shocking moment in a helicopter will paralyze and mesmerize you, that's what I felt too with this film, but for me, it's the story and those two great leads, that somehow made up for it. I'm talking too, especially Firth, such a friggin' versatile and underestimated acting talent, deserved of much more respect and notice. The effects are great and there's some humor too, where hey, there are bits that get bogged down with the business instead of the action, but here's a different sort of sci fi, which I must say, stands unique, to all it's others, and does have some style. And too, like I said, you've got two great leads, with performances that will, definitely hold your attention. Director Tobe 'chainsaw' Hooper has definitely pulled off something special and different here, in this '85 outing.

So barring the melodrama this is a good movie in parts and touches a few right chords, like Billy's emphatic exhibition of Ballet to get a school admission or his dad saying he is just 11 years old, lets give him a chance these made me feel nevertheless but yet those moments were just not enough yet. Jamie Bell at his age, gave a supreme performance and it's a real tough thing for a 12 year boy to learn and perform ballet. Perhaps thats one of the reasons more than anything that this movie got a wide recognition. The script is good and so is the cinematography yet, there is something that makes the movie fall, and it is the editing. Remove the dramatic pieces and cut it down by 15 minutes, this wold have been a great film. Yet, the way it is, it is just good. Also, the music could have been toned down a bit to make the whole thing realThis film can be termed as a good self help movie as it helps us understand that if we have passion in something, mostly things fall in place and help us to pursue the passion. At least, that's what happened with Billy Elliot. Also a mention of Julie Walters as Mrs. Wilkinson, she was good each time and great few times.Overall, a good film yet not a recommended one. A 3\/5 only for this.
