One is the story about a couple and their adopted child. It is a sad tale, probably not suitable for aspiring parents. The other component is the framing. This is the first film where the filmmaker tried more formal compositions in the service of the narrative. You can see the influence of Japanese master Ozu in this. To appreciate how Stevens' personal history is woven into this, consider the following timeline.By 1937, Ozu was already a talented Japanese filmmaker. I think of him as Doyle or Roeg, someone with a revolutionary eye, rooted in cinema. Dejected by the lack of popularity in his ideas, he was drafted into the Japanese Army where for two years he saw first hand the brutality of his people in China. Returning to film in 1939, he started recirculating prints. Stevens was interested in non-Hollywood cinematic techniques. He encountered Ozu &#x97; what we now call early Ozu &#x97; through a San Francisco connection by 1940. The Ozu camera was not dogmatically frozen by then, but the terms of narrative composition through katachi were. Wells was making Kane, with a relative of Stevens. Hitchcock had moved to Hollywood and circulating ideas about the importance of the emotional eye.Stevens made this film in direct homage to those ideas. He even went so far as to make the Dad a reporter sent to Japan! There, he experiences the Sanriku earthquake of 1933. Coming home to San Francisco pregnant, the couple lose the baby. Stevens had wanted to make a film based entirely on Japanese themes. The story here adopts the Hollywod conventions instead, with a simple preface in Japan.The on-screen couple adopt an American child.If you watch this for the framing, the composition and the camera placement, you will find it every bit as advanced visually as Wells and Hitchcock. That the story conventions ruin it matters little. Only his understanding of lighting is less experimental. All the walls here are Japanese walls. All the staging is in one plane with a separate background or foreground 3-d scene. Those who fawn over Fassbinder should take a look here at the craft of this.Ozu, incidentally would return from the horrors of war he had seen determined to matter. He did, though embarrassed by his nations' genocide, he became a drunk in making what are true masterpieces. Stevens would volunteer for war himself and become the main documentarian of the German holocaust. He also would return with a similar purpose. For me, this minor picture, this hanky-puller, is something of a touchstone where the cinematic worlds of Hollywood and Shochiku. Shortly after this film was released, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and a period of racist rejection of everything Japanese begun, and the San Francisco folks locked in concentration camps. The postwar connection would be through Kurosawa.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

How is that? Well, it makes me reason about life overall. Your goals, your position in society, opportunities overall, and how sometimes goals are difficult to reach and make you do extreme things.The performance by Al Pacino is simply amazing, literally amazing. It amazed me the fact that he shows desperation, loyalty, believes in his ideas, greed, believes in his fictional future, suffers because of the fact that his male lover is in pain, shows desperation when he still believes he can escape... And when everything is lost, through the lines don't shoot he demonstrates MANY emotions at the same time. Masterful performance.John Cazale deserved an Oscar nomination for his nerve tensing acting. He looked scared, depressed, but at the same time angry and decided to reach his goal at all costs. He was the FBI's target because he was a very dangerous man.Mr. Broderick also delivers a fine, underrated performance. His display as the tactic, intelligence FBI agent is great. The man has a strong temper and a cool behavior when negotiating. Charles Durning is also great as always. He plays cops like no other! Sidney Lumet is a wonderful director.

However, as the main character (boxer Jake LaMotta) is SO unpleasant and awful, the film is hard to stop watching--like some sort of train wreck that lasts 129 minutes! Now I am NOT saying the film isn't well made--it's very well crafted and there a lot of things to admire about it....but the characters (particularly Jake) are so awful that you just marvel at them.The film is the life story of Jake LaMotta and it covers from his early days as a professional boxer in 1941 through his early post-boxing years. However, there are many things that make it quite different from films like Somebody Up There Likes Me and Rocky--and not just the bubbling hostility of Jake outside the ring. In addition, those around him are incredibly harsh and unpleasant. It's funny, but the mobsters around him are NICER than the LaMottas (Jake and his almost as vicious brother, Joey) and you see them as the gentlemen in the film! Also, unlike these other boxer films, this one shows the brutality in the ring to a degree only approximated in one other film--Kirk Douglas' Champion--though Raging Bull manages to go a few steps further in the brutality department. A few of the boxing scenes, in particular, are amazingly graphic--with broken noses and squirting blood galore. Now I know I might sound crazy saying this, but this Martin Scorsese film is probably one of the best indictments AGAINST boxing because it IS so bloody and brutal. I'd place it among films like Requium For a Heavyweight and The Harder They Fall as the best in anti-boxing films! So let's talk about the technical aspects of the film. When it comes to the boxing sequences, this is an amazing film. As I said above, the brutality of the scenes is stomach-turning. And, instead of quickly filming the matches, the director chose to choreograph them so maximize the emotional impact--with loud thuds, great lighting and amazing effects to simulate the gallons of blood spilled in the fights. My only complaint about the fights is that the boxers simply threw too many punches. No boxing match (even the lightweight ones) has THAT much punching in rapid succession. If they did, they'd never go more than three rounds, as the fighters would collapse from exhaustion! But, this exaggeration did make the scenes more intense, so I saw it as a case of artistic license. As for making the film in black & white, I think this also worked well.The acting was pretty amazing. A lot has been said about Robert DiNero's commitment to the role--and how he deliberately ballooned up 60 pounds to play the retired LaMotta. In addition, the intense physical training he underwent to become the character was amazing. You have to admire his willingness to give his all for the part! When I looked for pictures of Jake, Joey and Mrs. LaMotta, I was also amazed that the actors (DiNero, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty) really did look a lot like the actual people they portrayed--a nice touch. Overall, an exceptional film in most every way, though it's NOT a film for everyone. The unpleasantness of the film make it something that many simply don't want to endure--and I can certainly understand this--it is bloody and vicious throughout.

Two shy characters who wouldn't say boo! to a goose. In the other camp - how do I put it? Well, if paint stripper could talk and sulphuric acid could walk, they would be Ray Say (Michael Caine) and Mari Hoff (Brenda Blethyn). Two contrasting camps and some very powerful performances.Brenda Blethyn is monstrously good in this. So much so, it's painful to watch. She is so nasty, my heart sank as I realised this over the top and brilliant performance was not going to spare me. The first scene was shocking as I took in the appearance and demeanour of her character. She is the true embodiment of vulgarity Fag Ash Lil meets Motor Mouth.As her character develops, you realise there are no spiteful depths that she will not plummet to belittle and berate her daughter who is far more talented, beautiful and gentle than she could ever hope to be. Little Voice's talent awakens the envious beast that's inside her mother. It's no wonder LV doesn't speak a word.Enter Ray Say, the small-time music manager who's chunky jewellery, flash car and underworld contacts can't hide the fact that he's one of life's losers. He never quite hit the big time. He's Delboy but without a sense of humour. And that's tragic. Like Mari, he tries to cover up his desperation but it seeps through the cracks like mud through broken concrete.When Ray realises the range of talent that Little Voice casually displays, he can't contain his excitement. He soon realises that he'll have to put up with her mother if he's going to groom the star that's living under the same roof as her. But Mari doesn't take kindly to being second best to her daughter and the open display of vitriol that she unleashes on LV is nothing short of the vilest verbal abuse.So that's it in a northern nutshell. Will Ray pluck LV out of obscurity? How will he do it? How much longer will he put up with Mari, the acid-tongued witch? A tongue with a life all of its own - when it's not lunging for Ray's throat, it's creating mayhem - two beasts, one woman. That in itself is a dilemma.Caine's performance is nothing short of stunning. He makes sleazy look so easy. What can't he do? He is 'Red Hot Ray' with his tacky clothes and car. His expletive-ridden karaoke at the end of the film is raw and powerful and the most memorable part of the film a goggle-eyed, seething, drunk desperado, the like I've never seen on film.Jane Horrocks is wonderful. She is clearly a fantastic mimic and is able to capture perfectly the voices of Shirley Bassey, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland. Jim Broadbent is also fantastic (no surprises there) as the nightclub host. Ewan McGregor is the sweet shy love interest and plays it well. With a line up like this, it's hard for Little Voice to be anything other than brilliant. But, there's no question about it, no amount of perfect mimicry can outshine Blethyn and Caine in this film. It belongs to them. The casting director deserves a place in heaven for this pairing.

The last film he made that I loved was Patch Adams. I may be somewhat behind the curve since I no longer follow current movies closely, and hardly watch TV at all. Mrs Doubtfire is sort of Tootsie 'light'...Dustin Hoffman's predicament was a tad more believable than that of Robin Williams. And, sad to say, I think Hoffman really had the last word when it comes to comedic farce such as this attempted to be. I found it to be quite boring, and the story line was exceptionally weak...and contradictory. Why should Sally Field break up the marriage because she came home form work and her son was having a birthday party? That's ridiculous...and I have to wonder what kind of Mom would respond in that way to her son's 12th birthday? So what if there was a petting zoo outside and a people zoo inside. It's the kid's birthday, for crying out loud. I just wasn't buying it. Then, for Robin Williams to take the 'Sir Galahad' stance he took when, as a voice over artist, one of the characters puffs away on a stogie...an implausible situation...I cannot think of an animated cartoon...old or current...where a character smokes anything--other than say a pipe for an older character, or a cigar for a gangland type. It may happen with cigarettes, but it certainly is the exception rather than the rule . And this position loses credibility at the end of the film when, at a dinner engagement, Doubtfire insists upon a smoking rather than non-smoking booth in which to dine. The humor is so forced--because the situations are beyond absurd and not likely to occur in the fashion presented--that the wind is taken out of the comedic sails of his passion, and it is so predictable that one can very easily become distracted or indifferent as I did when trying to watch this very difficult to watch film. The lackluster direction of Chris Columbus contributed, no doubt, to the boredom of this celluloid catastrophe. He has no pacing, no comic timing, and it seems that any an opportunity to make this film a true vehicle for the screwball comedy of Robin Williams is wasted because the director did not seize upon opportunities and situations. This Christopher Columbus needs to discover something different...he needs to discover comedy, in all of its variant forms. Williams and Fields are much heralded performers, but their skills and talents are wasted in this feeble attempt. I watched the film once, and I would not want to sit through it again.

I think it is not because it tells us anything special, or that the characters are particularly worthy.I believe it is because of the way the narrative is constructed. It has two arcs.One of these has the husband establishing the world. We follow only him, spending time understanding what he is about and how he adapts. Against this domestic environment, the wife has only one speech. This is in a café. She tells us ahead of time that it is a speech that she has prepared and practiced. This is purely within the real world. Since we are presented the man's world only, this insight-by-reactive-speech is unbalanced. We strive to understand.

The plot revolves around the coming-of-age of neophyte journalist Guy Hamilton (played by Mel Gibson before Hollywood stardom ruined his looks and bloated his ego to titanic proportions), recently arrived in Djakarta from Australia and looking to break big stories and make a name for himself - fast. Guy is befriended by ace photographer Billy Kwan (more on him later), a half-Chinese, half-Indonesian dwarf who has connections in very high places and believes in President Sukarno's benevolence. The political situation in the country is tense - mass protests block traffic in the streets while a Communist revolution brews behind the scenes and Sukarno's position grows more anxious by the day. Naive and self-centered, Guy sees his new world entirely through selfish eyes - as though all Indonesia existed only for his personal entertainment and enrichment. Guy is far from alone in this regard, as the racist and sexually-exploitative behavior of his fellow-journalists demonstrates (a scene in which one of Guy's colleagues takes his pick from literally a score of desperate girls all too eager to sell themselves for a few dollars is horrific). Despite the post-WW II setting, European colonialism in Asia seems alive and well, with Western diplomats and expatriates living lives of material abundance far removed from the miserable reality of Asia's slums. Thanks to Billy Kwan's connections and friendship, Guy not only gains access to leading political players - making his name via an exclusive interview with the head of the Indonesian Communist Party - but meets the beautiful Jill Bryant (played nicely by Sigourney Weaver, whose acting is better than her accent). Jill is an assistant at the British Embassy and as such, is privy to a great deal of classified information. The pair seem to be wildly in love, but is Jill more important to Guy than his career? Before the story ends, Guy Hamilton will see blood spilled, lose his best friend, learn that Asian politics isn't a spectator sport, and that his white skin is no guarantee of safety and security. Truthfully, TYLD is something of a misfire as a political thriller - somehow, the plot doesn't quite cohere, the period setting is less than convincing, and indeed, the political aspects of the piece ultimately take a backseat to what starts to become the real story of the film - Guy's loss of arrogance and innocence, the development of his relationship with Jill, and the self-destruction of Billy Kwan. Taken as a romance and as a character study, TYLD succeeds beyond its wildest expectations. Weir - always a master of that intangible yet essential quality called atmosphere - creates here what has to be one of the most sensuous films of all time. The heat of the equatorial air is palpable, the crowded slums visceral. As many other reviewers have noted, the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver in this film is breathtaking - the sequence where they get caught in a sudden downpour, take shelter in a car, and ALMOST kiss is to this reviewer one of the most erotic scenes in all cinema - and perhaps rarely have two attractive humans been photographed so superbly as they are here - so much so that one can overlook Miss Weaver's tenuous English accent, which comes and goes at intervals before finally vanishing altogether. Linda Hunt's Oscar-winning gender-crossing portrayal of the brilliant but doomed Billy Kwan is superlative - what, indeed, is to be done about such mass poverty and suffering? The Vangelis soundtrack is also brilliant - lush waves of synthesized chords wash over the viewer, making the perfect aural counterpart to the film's rich photography. The ending - in which Guy has to make a choice between his ego and his lover - is gripping and suspenseful. The film's slow, even languid, pace only adds to the hothouse and strangely self-contained atmosphere. This movie isn't just something you watch - it is a remarkable sensual experience all by itself and a reminder of the power and beauty that the screen can bring to the human face. This reviewer has loved this great film ever since watching it repeatedly on cable TV as a child in the 80s - there is nothing quite like this movie's atmosphere anywhere else.

So-Crates Johnson, Bob Genghis Khan, Dave Beeth-oven, Maxine of Arc, Herman the Kid, Dennis Fro-eud, and...Abraham Lincoln.Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is lighthearted good fun from the late 80s that despite the fashions and music, hasn't seemed to date itself too much to younger generations that weren't even alive in the 80s. A decade before Keanu Reeves stared in The Matrix, and before he was the FBI agent assigned to bank robbery in the early 90s flick Point Break, he did this film and this is the role I always associate him with, no matter how many more movies he does. The stars of the film are two seemingly brainless but well intentioned high school slackers, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (the aforementioned Keanu Reeves) that dream of making it big with their garage band Wyld Stallions. One day, they will open for Iron Maiden and perhaps even get Eddie Van Halen on guitars, perhaps one day. But they are in danger of being split up for good if they don't pass their history report. They study but just seem too moronic to hold much information in their heads.Help arrives from the 27th century from a guy named Rufus, a man who comes down in a telephone booth (Dr. Who reference?) and greats the two friends in front of a Circle K, providing yet another great quote, strange things are afoot at the Circle K. Rufus explains that the two must absolutely pass their history report and he gives the guys their own time traveling phone booth where they travel the ages and pick up various people of historical importance. Pay no attention to the accuracy of how these historical figures are represented, this film is not to be taken seriously and anyone who nitpicks how Abraham Lincoln or Ghenghis Khan was shown needs not be so wound up. Get a hobby. The fact that they went to the detail of having Socrates and Napolean not understand English was more then enough historical accuracy for me. The guys eventually meet themselves both at the start of the film and then later as the journey progresses. The fun really begins when they dump all the people they picked up in a late 80s shopping mall. I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I say that the guys do pass their report, it has to be seen exactly how they do this for it likely is the most original history report ever conceived. This is not a great film but it is fun. And yes I know my title quote was not spoken by either Bill or Ted, but rather by the jock giving his presentation to the class.

In order to reveal its application to The Paradine Case (1947), I have to disclose some key points of the story. Roughly speaking, it goes like that Mrs. Paradine is arrested for the suspect of having poisoned her husband. Soon, it becomes clear that only two persons could have done the crime she and the valet of the killed man. Hitchcock should never have accepted this lethal restriction given by the novel on which the movie is based, because from now on the movie spins around in trivialities. For example When the police comes to arrest her, Mrs. Paradine calls her family-attorney. When he arrives, he tells her not to loose words but to come to the core of the defense immediately, since it is clear to him that she did not kill her husband. For the audience, this means The valet did it. When the old attorney gives the case to a young specialist, this one follows of course the line of the other, but simply because he earns his money by being a defense attorney and not a state prosecutor. For him as well as for the audience it is clear again Since he must defend Mrs. Paradine, he must try to prove that the valet is the murderer. However, the audience asks itself Would this not be clear to Mrs. Paradine as well? She, most of all, knows that at the time of the killing only her and the valet have been in the house and are thus suspects for the crime. So, the audience does not understand that Mrs. Paradine, after having attended the first trial day, is shocked that her attorney tried to put the whole guilt on the valet. She makes him a gigantic scene, telling him, that his business is to defend herself, but not at the cost of accusing the valet. What a nonsense! Did Hitchcock really not see that there is not even a chance for a Deus Ex Machina in the form of a third, hitherto unknown person in the story? The deplorable rest of the story goes as follows When Mrs. Paradine sees that the valet gets more and more under suspect of being the killer, she starts slowly to make confessions, first in the form of suggestive remarks. Meanwhile, the court is informed that the valet, desperate under the burden of accusations, has committed suicide. When Mrs. Paradine hears that, she turns from hints to a full confession of having killed her husband because she was in love with the valet and wanted to start a new life with him. Unfortunately, the incredible nonsense of the plot line is not at the end, at that point. From a discussion in the private house between the judge and his wife we hear that he plans to hang Mrs. Paradine as soon as possible. But from a plea by the wife of her attorney we hear that he should do everything in order to safe her life. Well understood the life of the same Mrs. Paradine who has by herself ruined her case, delivered false information to her attorney and, most of all, told him in the court house that he is responsible for the suicide of the valet. I cannot even imagine that there is any movie on this world whose story is more inconsistent, paradoxical and unprofessional. Why Hitchcock filmed it unchanged, this must be considered a true mystery of film history.

I know a lot of people say this is rubbish compared to the dark knight but remember the dark knight was made quite recently. This movie was made in 1989, before modern movie techniques were made. Well after telling you about all that, let's talk about the plot. At the point in time it is set, batman is only a rumour in Gotham city. Few people believe in batman, and two of those very few people is reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Whul)and photojournalist Vici Vale (Kim Basinger).they try to uncover the mystery of Batman's identity. There are a few subplots, but I don't want to get into those now. If you're not familiar with batman, this may be a spoiler but if you not sure then just skip this bit. If you're still reading this bit then Batman's real identity is that of Millionaire Bruce Wayne played by Michael Keaton who plays Batman as well, as he tries to stop the evil menace of Gotham City the Joker played by Jack Nicholson. The movie just looks beautiful looking like it's the 1950s, but then again that's what director Tim Burton is best at with movies like Edward Scissorhands and Sweeny Todd which have that dark, fairytale look to it. Now there are problems with this movie. I think my biggest problem is that the Joker has more screen time than any other character in the movie. Now I'll say this a lot of people complain that Batman doesn't have a lot of screen time. The reason why that is because they are trying to create mystery to the character. Although I think Vici deserved more screen time than the Joker. About the performances the only ones I'll talk about are Batman, the Joker and Vici Vale. Keaton by far gives the best performance of the movie. The reason why that is because out of all the actors who have played Batman he is the least assuming out of all them which I think that's what Batman is supposed to be. Nicholsan always gives a great performance and is one of the best villain actors of all time. However because he gets so much screen time he is a little off putting from the rest of the characters and it feels likes this movie should have been called Joker rather than Batman because he gets so much screen time but overall he is a good joker. Basinger also gives a good performance as Vale. I don't really have a lot to say about her , but she is a interesting character and she's a bit like a James Bond girl. Overall this movie is entertaining, but you might have to see it a few times before you will appreciate for what it is. Now for the rating I give it 4 and a half out of 5. Check it out.

The current average at MRQE is 87\/100 (the highest of its ratings) while Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 7.8 average (similar to IMDb users).I highly suggest this film. If you watch it with patience and allow yourself to take in the lovely language, the protocols of the gun fight duels, the beautiful life of luxury of the rich, the tactics of the spy and the gambler, Mr. Lyndon, then you will likely find yourself a fan of the 18th Century and of the vividly visionary director Stanley Kubrick!I personally relished every moment of it once it got going. I didn't know what to think of it for the first 15 minutes, but then I started taking in the beautiful landscapes, the verbose dialog, and the existentialist interpretation by the director.I found myself mimicking the stately language of the characters. Even the lowest of criminals talks like a king or queen of England. Being robbed was never so devilishly polite!
