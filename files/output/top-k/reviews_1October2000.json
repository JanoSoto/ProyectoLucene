The reason for that is that most of the summers movies are made out of effects and nothing more. No script, no characters and so on. Others however do tend to have a good script but do not have the right length or pace to be truly great. We have had a share of both of these kinds of movies in this summer and the ones who obviously fit into the first category are Mission Impossible 2, The Perfect Storm, The Nutty Professor 2 The Klumps. Having neither seen The Perfect Storm not The Nutty Professor I can still give the reason all 3 became blockbusters. It is because of their explosiveness, their effects and their BIG stars. This does not mean they are not good. I mean MI 2 is good due to it's explosiveness, The Perfect Storm is good when you watch it on the big screen, for the effects are overwhelming, yet when you'd see it at home it would suck. As for The Nutty Professor 2, that is just a piece of trash. Of the latter category I have only seen one film so far, being Gladiator. Now that was a film which could have been great, if the director had approached it differently, but due to too much politics and a few slow parts in the film it was &#145;only' good and &#145;only' one of the summers best. This film though is not the same as any of the film's mentioned above, for it accomplishes something I have not seen for quite a while. It combines good characters and emotions with great special effects. I think the last time I saw anything like it was in 1997. Wondering what movie, well yes (I'm sorry) Titanic. I bet now you are wondering what makes X &#150; Men so great well here it comesFirst of all I really must credit the director, Bryan Singer, whom many of you know, I guess, from his BIG breakthrough movie The Usual Suspects. I must thank him, for he is the only director after Tim Burton to make a truly great motion picture out of a comic book character. This does not however mean that the two directors can be compared, for the theme of the movies and the nature of the characters are much too different. Still they can be compared to both having had a great vision on something already made and imagined. Bryan Singer did not only bring in great music, good camerawork and great special effects (something he had not done before), but he also brought to us a tight and fast paced story without loose ends in which not the effects had the upper hands, but the actors, who supplied the movie with emotions and jokes. This accomplishment is always due to the director and the writers (who let the actors play their vision), the people who cast the actors and last but very far from least the actors themselves, who I might add here are no BIG stars but still known, appreciated and capable actors.First of all there is Magneto (Ian McKellen), who is a &#145;villain' unlike many others, for he is neither wicked like Darth Vader or The Emperor from Star Wars nor a psycho like Norman Bates from Psycho or something like that. Instead he is a mutant who acts out his knowledge that people who are &#145;different' will be stereotyped, loathed, maybe even feared and as a result of that will be oppressed or even killed. He is a &#145;villain' with a motive and can therefore be understood and is not likely to be hated or despised by the viewer.Then there is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who is the latest mutant to join the X &#150; Men in the fight against Magneto. His addition to the group however is somehow &#145;overshadowed' by a rivalry between him and Cyclops in which Wolverine delivers some good laughs. Wolverine however also has a couple of nice moments with Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Rogue (Anna Paquin). Plus he is in some cool fighting scenes with Mystique (Rebecca Romijn &#150;Stamos) and Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and therefore is my favourite in this movie.The coolest &#145;fighting scene' however is the one in which Storm (Halle Berry) uses all her power to fight Toad (Ray Park), who I think has, in the last two years, played the coolest villains on screen (Darth Maul and The Headless Horseman). It really is a pity that we did not see more of his cool moves and fighting, but hey he was not the main villain in this film.Someone I really must not leave out of this ode is of course Anna Paquin, for she performs her character, Rogue, with class. This however is not the only reason I must mention this character, it is also because her character is the one that has the most depth and the one I could identify most with.Last but not least there are Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Dr. Jean Grey. Patrick Stewart delivers a good performance, playing a character he appears to have been born to play. Famke Janssen delivers a good performance too and is very likeable and believable as a doctor.Wrapping this up, I must say, I can not wait to hear the people behind it are to making a sequel. I feel that way, because I truly believe that with X &#150; Men, a comic series has been brought to the cinema, that does not only meet the expectations of the true fans, but that it also is a film which satisfies the &#145;normal' viewer.

Laced with subtle humor that seems somewhat contradictory to the serious subject matter, this is a film that is quite interesting without being too compelling.  After seven years in South America studying to be a monk, a young man returns to the States and the anonymity provided him by his work as a counselor at a Catholic rehab clinic.  Far from your normal, would-be cleric, however, Juvenal (Skeet Ulrich) has a unique gift  he can heal people by touching them, at which time he exhibits the stigmata.  It's something he cannot explain, and somehow manages to take in stride.  Inevitably, word leaks out about it, and scam artist Bill Hill (Christopher Walken) is right on it when it happens.  Currently an RV salesman, he is an ordained minister and former evangelist who once performed fake healings and had a huge, blue neon cross above his `church' that could be seen for miles from the interstate.  And he sees great things in Juvenal's future, and a lot of money for himself.  First, however, he must get close to the stigmatic, while sidestepping a friend of Juvenal's, one August Murray (Tom Arnold), a Catholic on a quest to revert the Mass to Latin and do away with guitar masses altogether.  For help, Hill turns to his assistant, Lynn (Bridget Fonda), who must try to gain access to the elusive Juvenal; together, they concoct a plan to get her into the clinic, where she can make contact and put him together with Hill.   \tTo tell the tale, Schrader put together an excellent cast and seemingly has all the ingredients for a successful project; somehow though, it all comes off as fairly lackluster, but interesting nonetheless.  Ulrich does a good turn as Juvenal, capturing the sincere ambiguity of the character's view of his own ability to perform miracles, and makes it convincing with his grounded approach and by underplaying rather than trying to make him into something more enigmatic than he really is.  He makes it a very real study of how someone would possibly react upon being visited with the wounds of Christ.

Hoffman is terrific s Dorothy.  The film has a terrific script great direction and good acting.  With all of that and the hilarious story, this falls as one of the greatest movies to come out of the eighties.\tMichael Dorsey is struggling with is acting career.  He seems to know a lot about acting and the way it's supposed to be done, in a realistic sense anyway.  While the movies credits are being shown in the beginning, there is a terrific montage of Michael talking to people about acting and trying to land roles as an actor.  It's kind of ironic because he is giving what looks to be his students advice and telling how things should be done but he can't even get a role himself.  Some good direction comes in, in the montage when Michael is trying out for parts. One of my favorite parts in the montage is when he is dressed up a little older and he is up on this stage and the director yells out, `stop', from the darkness of the audience seats and says something like no, no you're no good we need someone who looks a little older. In the next scene Michael is dressed as a kid a new director says no, no we need someone who looks younger. This is when he gets the truth that people just don't want him for any parts.  Then we go back to him telling what looks to be his students about acting.  He tells them that ninety five percent of actors are unemployed and that there is no reason for this.  Then we got another shot of him being rejected and them a scene with him working at a restaurant, which is also ironic.  Then we go to Michael and his roommate Jeff's (Bill Murray) apartment, where there is a surprise birthday for him.  Michael is going around asking for girls' numbers and etc.  He goes up to this one girl and asks if she is an actress, she says yes and then he goes on and on about how good she was.  We then go to a scene where Jeff is talking to people about how he hates it when people come up to him and say `hey you were that guy in that movie, you were great'.  So from that we can assume the director was probably trying to tell us something, it could mean many things, but I came to the conclusion that it probably was what the girl was thinking. So there is a lot of good scenes with good ides in them that I don't think were scripted, I think that were Pollack's directing. \tMichael then takes his friend Julie, who is played by Jessica Lange, who won an Oscar for her role, to try out for a part in a soap opera.  She just can't seem to be as good at the part as Michael can.  She doesn't get the part.  Michael is determined to become an actor and prove his agent wrong for saying that no wants to hire him.  Well in a sense his agent was right, no one really wants to hire Michael, they want Dorothy.  Dorothy is someone Michael makes up in order to get hired for the part in the soap opera.  Dorothy gets hired for the part in the soap opera.  Then Dorothy meets Sandy (Terri Garr) who is playing a nurse on the soap opera.  They become attached and soon bond.  Sandy wants Dorothy to meet her dad because he is lonely since his wife died.  This of course becomes hilarious because Dorothy is really Michael.  Meanwhile Michael is getting attached to Sandy, but can't express his feelings because he has to be Dorothy.  There is a funny montage at Sandy's farmhouse where her dad and Dorothy are staying for the weekend.  There is this sort of love music playing with shots of the dad falling for Dorothy and Dorothy falling for Sandy.  But, that doesn't really make since because in the whole movie everyone is on tight schedule and all of the sudden they just go away for a couple of days, but whatever.  I don't want to ruin anymore so I'll leave it at that. \tTootsie follows the same format as Some Like it Hot and Mrs. Doubtfire would follow.  A man desperately wants some thing, he wants it so bad he will do any thing, even if it requires dressing as a woman.  In Some Like it Hot the men are dressing as women to get to Florida.  In Tootsie the man wants to be an actor and get enough money to produce his friends script.  And in Mrs. Doubtfire a man wants his wife back so bad he dresses as a nanny and watches her kids.  So they all basically follow the same format and really its a very successful format, all of those movies have mad a lot of money and have gotten very good reviews and that can all be thanked to Billy Wilder.  I found some little interesting facts from Entertainment Weekly magazine.  It said that the title actually came form Hoffman, whose mother `used to throw me up in the air and say, How' my tootsie wootsie?'   And that Hoffman's four-pound silicone breasts cost one hundred and seventy five dollars each.\tOverall the film was pretty good.  I was expecting it to be pretty bad.  I had watched the first ten minutes of it like a year ago and turned it off.  I guess the reason I didn't like it then was because it was so acclaimed and that it really didn't look that good.  But after seeing it I still don't completely agree with the critics and I have to say I definitely don't agree with it being on the American Film Institutes top one hundred movies of all time.

No wonder this movie makes me feel like I skipped my adolescence, that I never got laid, that I never fell in love, that other people were falling in love all around me and somehow I was skipped; that my friends were never the cool kids and yet I spent years trying relentlessly to feel cool, allowing the slightest success to convince me I'd made it, even though it was inevitably followed by rejection, shame and loneliness; that I'd never looked at the world around me with that look, that sponge-eyed innocence that Cameron Crowe seems to nail in every one of his films, a look that is absolute adolescence.Every time I see a Cameron Crowe film I leave certaint that I've never felt the things his characters feel, that my life has not been lived to the fullest. That look, though, that Cameron Crowe look &#150; it's an achievement. It's why people see his films, why we all die for Say Anything because we all want to be sixteen, unabashedly in love, and not afraid to say so, out loud, to the person we're in love with. Crowe fills his films with exactly the people you'd want to be in love with - in this case Kate Hudson playing sexy, loose, flirtatious, wild, kind-hearted,16-yr-old Pennie Lane (just the girl any uncool smart kid would be a fool to, and would, fall for); Billy Crudup playing Russell Hammond, a sexy, passionate, Jim-Morrison-intellectual rock star (exactly the kind of guy that those same girls always ended up with); and Patrick Fugit playing William Miller (Crowe as a kid), a little awkward but confident of his abilities, wanting to be cool, never quite succeeding but always wanting to hang with the cool people (which would be me, only with less drive and lacking the aforementioned `look'). I was in love with each of them. Certainly Kate Hudson wins in the long run, but they're all utterly appealing one of them I want to be, one of them I want to befriend, one of them I want to be in love with.I think that covers the targets of every teen-aged obsession I ever had.Another teen-aged obsession, though (which, like the rest of them, continues to this day) is for music. Pleasantly, it's the journalist Miller's (and Crowe's) obsession with music, more so than coolness or even love, which makes this film move. There's a moment where the young Crowe discovers his older sister's collection of rock records. The camera captures the album covers reverently, one at a time the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends, Led Zeppelin III, Disraeli Gears, Electric Ladyland, The Who's Tommy. It's a beautiful moment &#150; the discovery of rock&roll. There's a note from Miller's sister in the gatefold copy of Tommy, saying that the record, heard cover-to-cover, would change his life. His act of putting the record on the turntable and hearing the music for the first time is captured beautifully, and again reverentially, like the young man is undergoing some sort of religious conversion &#150; it's a thrill. I was reminded of the first time I heard Black Sabbath, the song and the band, with the lights off on a dark night, the sound up loud, alone in my room the music kicked in, the slowest, simplest, and loudest music I'd ever heard, and I lay in bed squirming and kicking and smiling in ecstatic disbelief that such sounds were being made in the world. In the movie, the song the boy chooses, `Sparks' &#150; sort of a Tommy overture - is a perfect choice simple, weird and rocking, existing solely to introduce the listener to the world of rock that's to come.The reverence shown to rock music is a welcome one. Where other Cameron Crowe movies pummel the watcher relentlessly with the aforementioned teen-aged obsessions, Almost Famous brings a new obsession into the mix, an obsession we thirty-somethings can feel good about maintaining. Crowe's love of rock&roll is made clear by the subject matter of the film, by how well the 70's rock-band, groupie, rock-journalist lifestyle is recreated (Peter Frampton was a `technical advisor' on the film), and by Crowe's magnificent choices for the soundtrack (my eyes misted over when Led Zeppelin's `That's the Way' came on as the tour bus rolled through the California desert).One scene in the movie did assuage my lost-youth misery somewhat. Lester Bangs, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, talks the young journalist into feeling good about being uncool (`Call me anytime. Of course I'll be home &#150; I'm uncool') and smart. I would like to personally thank Crowe for adding this exchange not only did it let me feel a little better about never quite making it to `cool,' it convinced (who knows for how long) to turn my energies toward pursuits other than those which the rest of the movie made me feel were requirements for a fully realized adolescence. It's a pep talk for those who fail based more on foolish pursuits than on inadequacies.At any rate, though, I chose to write about this movie because&#133; well, because it gave me that feeling of misspent youth, and there weren't any therapists or whores in the lobby. I do feel better. And the next time a Cameron Crowe movie comes out, I'll attend &#150; but I'll be prepared.

I was in love with each of them.

A beautiful moment that is not discussed often is the bit before the exorcism where Father Merrin asks Chris what her daughter's middle name is, as an attempt to ease the tension. Outstanding!On the down side, I didn't care for the opening which shows us shots of Georgetown; the film works better originally by simply seeing the title of the film amidst that chilling soundtrack. People are asking why a scene is added where Karras listens to a tape of Regan's real voice? Well, to familiarize himself with the changes that have occurred. Don't forget that he's never heard her speak before she became posessed.For me, the only major problem I had with the New Version is the adding of CGI effects (the death of horror films these days) to cater to the MTV crowd of youths. I also didn't think we needed new music cues to accentuate the more quiet moments.As for the ending, I prefer the original one; but being a fan of EXORCIST III I must say that it perfectly sets up the relationship between the characters in that sequel with this restored conclusion.Now onto the jaded kids today I pity you.

You know, this is the man who made great fun stuff (TOTAL RECALL, BASIC INSTINCT)... but also unbearable stinkers (SHOWGIRLS, STARSHIP TROOPERS). So we should also have in mind that we couldn't expect a masterpiece or something that is Oscar worthy. But we should, at least, expect a fun and maybe even scary horror\/sci-fi movie. Well, I can almost say that it is. However, HOLLOW MAN is a victim of a stupid tendency in Hollywood nowadays solve all the troubles with much, much action and illogical and totally idiotic situations.The plot of HOLLOW MAN is not original, of course. The story of the invisible man who changes his personality with his new state was used lots of times before. But Paul Verhoeven gives a new and more violent treatment to the situation. The guy really enjoys his new situation and now that none can see him, he listens to conversations and comes to know that his career is almost over because of lack of ethics, and more the girl he loves, a colleague, is going out with another of his colleagues. So what he decides to do? F***, rape his neighbor, kill his boss, turn into a slasher murderer, why not? We can easily tolerate that, even with some huge plot holes, but why, why does this movie turn into an unbelievable mess in the last 20 minutes? Why?The first half of the movie is pretty interesting, with amazing special effects that make the gorilla and Sebastian disappear. I see an Oscar nomination for them next year. After the man becomes bad there are some scenes that only Verhoeven has courage to do. The one where he rapes the hot neighbor is sick, but oddly interesting. The same thing I say about the one where he kills his boss. However, when everyone starts to die in the laboratory... it becomes just a mess. Too violent and disgusting, and totally unbelievable! Have you ever realize that the hero (in this case the girl) always have a brilliant idea when she is just dying (in this case inside a refrigerator). Of course the other hero who has been severely hurt comes to help her. And the worst the villain survives at least four times, even to an electric shock- and goes after the heroes! Borrowing the worst parts of DEEP BLUE SEA and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE! Why the hell do we need that??????? A film that was much above the average has to accept so many idiotic and cliched situations- why?????? HOLLOW MAN has an intriguing directing by Paul Verhoeven and, despite the not-so-smart dialogues, the actors do a fine job. Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue do what they can to save even the terrible ending.Even with so many disappointments all over it, HOLLOW MAN is still much better than some Hollywood productions. It is pretentious without being tedious, silly without being brainless, shocking without being unwatchable. But I advise you to leave before the last 20 minutes. You know what will happen, so don't waste your patience. You will have seen a good movie. Even with the self-destructive ending, it's still worth a look.

So we should also have in mind that we couldn't expect a masterpiece or something that is Oscar worthy. But we should, at least, expect a fun and maybe even scary horror\/sci-fi movie. Well, I can almost say that it is. However, HOLLOW MAN is a victim of a stupid tendency in Hollywood nowadays solve all the troubles with much, much action and illogical and totally idiotic situations.The plot of HOLLOW MAN is not original, of course. The story of the invisible man who changes his personality with his new state was used lots of times before. But Paul Verhoeven gives a new and more violent treatment to the situation. The guy really enjoys his new situation and now that none can see him, he listens to conversations and comes to know that his career is almost over because of lack of ethics, and more the girl he loves, a colleague, is going out with another of his colleagues. So what he decides to do? F***, rape his neighbor, kill his boss, turn into a slasher murderer, why not? We can easily tolerate that, even with some huge plot holes, but why, why does this movie turn into an unbelievable mess in the last 20 minutes? Why?The first half of the movie is pretty interesting, with amazing special effects that make the gorilla and Sebastian disappear. I see an Oscar nomination for them next year. After the man becomes bad there are some scenes that only Verhoeven has courage to do. The one where he rapes the hot neighbor is sick, but oddly interesting. The same thing I say about the one where he kills his boss. However, when everyone starts to die in the laboratory... it becomes just a mess. Too violent and disgusting, and totally unbelievable! Have you ever realize that the hero (in this case the girl) always have a brilliant idea when she is just dying (in this case inside a refrigerator). Of course the other hero who has been severely hurt comes to help her. And the worst the villain survives at least four times, even to an electric shock- and goes after the heroes! Borrowing the worst parts of DEEP BLUE SEA and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE! Why the hell do we need that??????? A film that was much above the average has to accept so many idiotic and cliched situations- why?????? HOLLOW MAN has an intriguing directing by Paul Verhoeven and, despite the not-so-smart dialogues, the actors do a fine job. Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue do what they can to save even the terrible ending.Even with so many disappointments all over it, HOLLOW MAN is still much better than some Hollywood productions. It is pretentious without being tedious, silly without being brainless, shocking without being unwatchable. But I advise you to leave before the last 20 minutes. You know what will happen, so don't waste your patience. You will have seen a good movie. Even with the self-destructive ending, it's still worth a look.

Within the first fifteen minutes, my worries were laid to rest. Though seemingly unabashedly manipulative, Remember The Titans was, nonetheless enjoyable, as well as inspirational. Yes, race relations and integration in the '60's and '70's does seem to be a pet Hollywood theme, but in this case, it wasn't too heavy handedly done. If I had to rate this movie, I would give it a seven out of ten; not great, but entertaining, and thoroughly engrossing.Denzel Washington gives a commendable, totally believable and entertaining performance as coach Boone. Will Patton, in a departure from the type of role I'm used to seeing him in, actually made me like his Coach Yoast character. It was great seeing him play a good guy, for a change. But the one who absolutely stole the movie, in my opinion, was 11 year-old Hayden Panettiere, who played Cheryl Yoast, Coach Yoast's daughter. Her performance helped to breathe humanity, life and humor into the movie. Hayden's acting seemed so natural that I could actually believe her passions about the game, the team and her father were real. Her scene with Denzel Washington, where they watched post-game films in Coach Boone's home, was one of the best of the movie. Watch Hayden Panettiere; this girl is going places.EditorialIf I had to give a criticism about the movie at all, it would have to fall squarely on the shoulders of the Coach Boone character. Don't get me wrong, as I said, I liked Denzel Washington in this movie. I've seen him in (I think) every movie he's done, and I'll probably see every movie he'll do in the future. It would probably have been somewhat less effective had another actor taken the role, as it does seem as though the part of Coach Boone was written specifically for him. ...And that's the problem. Denzel Washington is slowly becoming, if not a caricature of himself, then definitely range-limited. More often than not, his characters have a Denzel Washingtonesque moral rectitude, and most exhibit an engaging condescension that gives the character a father like stature. For all I know, these are traits that may very well be desired in the Roles Mr. Washington tends to take. It would just be nice to see him spread his wings a little and play, dare I say it, a bad guy?

Then I found this movie focused on almost every single character's relationship with each other, all of them being stereotypes. And that's also what I love about this movie.

Colonel of the United States Marine Corps who beats his son and doesn't care about the dimwitted wife (well, he does a little...not much), and last but not least there's Lester Burnham.

It's certainly not the comedy I was expecting, though it stars Jim Carrey and does contain some comedic moments.  Upon viewing, I found it to be intensely dramatic, and quite moving when all was said and done.  The film can speak on a very literal level, aptly skewering our society's obsession with voyeurism and the media's rapacious appetite for conent,  or on a spiritual level, with the gigantic set upon which Truman's life takes place becoming an allegorical Eden.  While it makes some remarks about what could be considered rather dark characteristics of the modern media's role in society, the film itself is far from dark, and in fact contains a very uplifting message in the end. Jim Carrey turns in an excellent dramatic performance as his character slowly comes to realize that the things happening in his life are sometimes quite odd and surreal.  Ed Harris is good as well as the producer who watches the events in the manufactured town from on high (another obvious spiritual metaphor).  All of the main characters, in fact, do a very good job of switching between Truman's acquaintances and actors simply moving on and off of a set, turning off and on their apparent feelings for the main character.  My favorite scenes were the ones in which Truman appears at his most human, doing something outside of the producer's tightly scripted goings on around the small town. Even if you ignore all of the messages and just take the film as a simple narrative of the events in a man's life, it is paced and filmed well enough that it will probably entertain most people.  And while I've read a few reviews that speak poorly of the ending, I thought it was perfect considering the central theme of the movie.  I highly recommend it.

All three of these movies are set in Los Angeles.Magnolia is a good movie, however I do have a few arguments about it. Whether the writer\/director intended to or not, he portrays Anglo-Americans in his movie as being the only Americans who have serious morality issues to resolve.  The life experience of Black-Americans living in Los Angeles in this movie is clearly dismissed.This is symbolized in the movie when the writer\/director reduces the Black experience in America to that of a little black kid in the movie Magnolia singing an incoherent rap song as the only way the kid can communicate to a white Los Angeles policeman about a crime the little kid may know about.  Naturally, the white cop ignores the little kid.  Later, the same policeman does not pay much attention to a suspicious looking guy in a brown jacket running through heavy rain in the kid's neighborhood.If the black kid in this movie has anything to say, it is not as critical to the white experience of life being represented in this movie. Everyone should be well aware by now that Hollywood has always relied on stereotypes to belittle the Black experience in America.  Why else would the writer\/director of Magnolia have the little kid sing a rap song to the white cop in an obvious reference to the days of Black vaudeville?Also, two of the African-Americans in this movie, of which there are only three (in Los Angeles?), are portrayed as disturbed or insignificant characters whose only refuge from a hard life in LA is crime.  Witness the same little black kid later in the movie when he takes a load of cash from the purse of an Anglo woman (Julianne Moore) he finds passed out inside of her top-of-the-line Mercedes parked in the pouring rain.  The other African-American character portrayed is a poor and obese woman who has a dead body in her closet and the other a dispassionate African-American female newscaster who is interviewing the character played by Tom Cruise.Of course, when the main characters in this movie, who are upper-class whites, have some major frustrations to express, it's okay for them to contort their faces and blow a gasket, curse at family and strangers in public and private, or steal money from their employer (with conscience intact), or preach misogyny (without a conscience) to angry white men, as three of the main characters in this movie will do.If anything is being said in this movie, it is that some people who reside in Southern California are amoral and tend to lead grossly immoral lives and like to wallow in their guilt.  I hope that the writer\/director of Magnolia does not feel this way about all of American society.

Later, the same policeman does not pay much attention to a suspicious looking guy in a brown jacket running through heavy rain in the kid's neighborhood.If the black kid in this movie has anything to say, it is not as critical to the white experience of life being represented in this movie. Everyone should be well aware by now that Hollywood has always relied on stereotypes to belittle the Black experience in America.  Why else would the writer\/director of Magnolia have the little kid sing a rap song to the white cop in an obvious reference to the days of Black vaudeville?Also, two of the African-Americans in this movie, of which there are only three (in Los Angeles?), are portrayed as disturbed or insignificant characters whose only refuge from a hard life in LA is crime.  Witness the same little black kid later in the movie when he takes a load of cash from the purse of an Anglo woman (Julianne Moore) he finds passed out inside of her top-of-the-line Mercedes parked in the pouring rain.  The other African-American character portrayed is a poor and obese woman who has a dead body in her closet and the other a dispassionate African-American female newscaster who is interviewing the character played by Tom Cruise.Of course, when the main characters in this movie, who are upper-class whites, have some major frustrations to express, it's okay for them to contort their faces and blow a gasket, curse at family and strangers in public and private, or steal money from their employer (with conscience intact), or preach misogyny (without a conscience) to angry white men, as three of the main characters in this movie will do.If anything is being said in this movie, it is that some people who reside in Southern California are amoral and tend to lead grossly immoral lives and like to wallow in their guilt.  I hope that the writer\/director of Magnolia does not feel this way about all of American society.

All this materialistic riches and he still ain't happy yet. He doesn't really want to go on with this life-style, but what else is there? What's a chap to do? His doctor reacts indifferent to Norton's self-pity and tells him that, if he wants to see people who are really sick, he should visit support groups for men with testicular cancer. He actually does visit one of these groups, even pretends to suffer from the disease as well, and, color me amazed, all the weeping and sobbing have a calming effect on him. The result even baby's don't sleep this good. But than a suicidal dark-haired woman starts invading the meetings, and, call it a hunch, he just knows she's faking it, too. Hence, he can't 'enjoy' the group anymore, hence, he can't sleep anymore. On a business-trip, he meets cool, but strangely dressed Tyler Durden, who says things Norton really digs and who is actually everything Norton wanted to be, but couldn't. Durden is unhappy with society and a lot of things he has to say about it hit bull's eye, but some of the things he says fall right of the mark, and are horribly shallow, easy quick fix answers. Durden likes to talk a lot, he likes to hear himself talk (something I can relate to) but to a certain extent, he's past the phase of talking and it's time to walk the walk as well. Support groups for people with sometimes terminal diseases? Been there. Done that. Durden thinks it's time to let his fists talk. So he does. And Norton is calmed by it, sleeping like a baby again. And, apparently, a lot of other people are appealed by this way of therapy, too. Fight Club is born.When Norton walks through his apartment, which has become a 3-dimensional IKEA-catalogue, complete with the 'witty names' and prices super-imposed over the furniture, I was reminded of Dutch entertainer Youp van 't Hek, well-known for his critical view of modern society; taking a swipe at IKEA is something this guy does often as well. I liked Fight Club so far, but then Durden asks Norton Hit me. And from this moment on, I started having problems with this movie. Matter becomes of greater importance than substance. SPOILER ALERT Norton turns out to be the same person as Durden. Norton was a schizo all along. But wait a minute, we saw these two guys interacting and talking in front of other people! Norton isn't a Norman Bates talking with mommy dearest in the basement and hiding his alter ego from the outside world. But it doesn't matter here, because by the time we find out this secret, everything has become larger than life, even more so. The cinematic equivalent of Youp van 't Hek suddenly deciding that the words themselves are suddenly not strong enough anymore. We need loud music. And a light-show. So what if we can't hear what Youp is saying anymore? So what if we are distracted by the visual off-showing? Matter over substance. The point if well made in the first half of the movie, but by then, we have another seventy minutes to sit through. I found myself becoming impatient. In the first half I enjoyed the acting, the nice visual touches (like film-operator Durden inserting a frame of a penis between two reels of a family film), but when things got louder and louder and grander and grander and the film ended with a frame insert of a penis (not merely a subliminal, single frame insert -- I guess because Fincher wanted to be sure the audience couldn't miss it, couldn't miss how witty and great his ideas are), I was tired. Possibly, no, HOPEFULLY the gradual 'larger than life' look and content of this film are meant to reflect the fact that the Fight Club is going too far, is going crazy, has become unrealistic about it goals and the means to achieve them. If not, I really DID see a shallow film full of errors and psychological mistakes about bare-breasted, bare knuckled men having found a so-called philosophical, intellectual excuse (supported by the necessary sarcastic humor) to beat the crap out of each other. Either way, I found myself rapidly growing tired of this film.For some people this is a subversive film, a cry for things to change, but I like to believe that this is actually a film about tolerance. Be free, do what you want to do, believe who or what you want, but don't shove your opinion through other people's throats. If many people are happy with a certain way of life, if people are happy with not much more than dead end jobs and watching television all night long, let them. They are not ready for something else at the moment -- maybe they'll never be in this life. Force them to live life to the max, to change their lives and you have...sheep once again (just like the members of Fight Club gradually become again). You have the choice not to go on with a dead-end job, not to eat at MacDonalds, not to shop at IKEA, not to drink coffee at Starbucks. Hey, I don't either (drinking at Starbucks would be hard, by the way, because there aren't any branches in Holland), but I'm not judging people who do. Like Michael Jackson once said Start with the man in the mirror. That may be a corny phrase, but it's really the most important thing you can do. And, in a lot of cases, the ONLY thing you can do. Don't feel superior to other people (like a lot of pro-Fight Club reviewers on these pages do). Feeling superior, having the urge to change things fast and use a 'quick fix' to 'open other people's eyes' can make things get out of hand pretty fast, as shown in this film and by its surrealistic, chaotic visual style. Definitely not a masterpiece, but not a complete failure either with great acting and cool music to boost.*** out of ****  ","genre":null},{"date":"1 October 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Norton has a nice, steady job, a wonderful apartment and a bad case of insomnia.
