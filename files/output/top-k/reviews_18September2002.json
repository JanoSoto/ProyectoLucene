In Florence she has created a young woman richly endowed with natural gifts, none of which she values, or strives to tie together into an actual personality -- a life -- and who thus must be a dark opposite to the highly skilled actress portraying her. No doubt Miss Parker has encountered many real-life Florences, as have I, and when reaching for their center, found nothing.Florence has radiant natural beauty, which she either ignores or tries to hide with makeup and blank gazes. She has natural intelligence which has never been challenged or developed. She has human warmth and feminine sensitivity, which she hastens to suppress every time they surface unbidden. She might even have musical talent, but I suspect that drumming, like stripping, is something she can do with her emotions on idle and her brain in neutral. Peter Sarsgaard's Richard is in even worse shape as a human being. He is a one-trick pony, a software engineer burned out after a year of work that netted him over $1 million, mainly through the entrepreneurial and stock-trading efforts of others. But neither the money nor the work is real to him, and by the time shown in the movie he is essentially ignoring both. Money and job are just forces of nature from which he passively draws sustenance, like the atmosphere and the internet. Not only does Richard not know what he wants, he (like Florence) does not know how to want. He imagines he wants to be in love with Florence, but he has not the slightest curiosity about who she is. He enjoys the immediate gratification of looking at her and holding her (one would have to be dead not to), but flagrantly misses every opportunity the script presents to ask her what she wants or hopes or dreams -- or even if she has achieved orgasm. Each time she reaches out to him, beyond the terms of their 'contract,' he fails to reciprocate in any meaningful way, reminding her of why she wrote it in the first place. Strong women sometimes choose intelligent, handsome, but centerless men like Richard as their first husbands because they seem malleable, easily turned into profitable providers and fathers of healthy children. But too often they turn out merely to be Silly Putty, like Richard, unable to hold any shape at all.  Looking ahead, I could see Florence some day putting the pieces of herself together into a real life, or a reasonable facsimile thereof. But Richard? Never. This is an intelligent and thought-provoking movie. Is it entertaining? Not really. It cuts awfully close to the bone for a lot of folks, including me. Is it erotic eye-candy, as the promoters would have us believe? Again, not really -- except that looking at Molly Parker without makeup (either with or without clothing) is worth a lot more than the price of admission. 7\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"18 September 2002","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" * Possible Spoilers Ahead *There is a lot more to this sad story than its publicists seem to have realized, and I think much of the credit for this must go to the two lead players, especially to the beautiful and audacious Molly Parker.

It tries real hard, but gets confused and lost.I've read that Kubrick originally worked on this project before Spielburg picked it up.  I don't know to what extent each actually worked on filming, but it sure does feel like two different directors worked on this movie - which is problem # 1.Both have a unique style that do not mix well.  Kubrick is a master at disciplined contemplation of a moral issue while Spielburg is a master at spinning a wonderfully entertaining yarn.  This film tries to do both and it just doesn't work.The first act of the film, which to me feels entirely Kubrickian, is great. We are immediately immersed in a moral conundrum.  The pit is deep, dark, poignantly adorned with characters against a somber stage that compels us to engage the material.  It also is very much in the style of Kubrick sets, lots of master shots, slow moving and ponderous photography in motion. The ambience is there to serve the story in every detail.  If this was Spielburg's homage to Kubrick, well done.  If this was Kubrick's work, wel l, it was right on target.  (I really miss his work.)The characters are drawn clearly if not archetypically and draw us unabashedly into the ring of moral discourse which we achingly yet eagerly embrace.Then, the story that is being constructed is completely abandoned in the second act as the main character (boy robot) is taken completely out of the setting that's been developed to this point and we embark on an odyssey of sorts.  I spent most of the second act wondering what was going to happen in the plot that was being developed in the first act.  We never find out.From this point on, the movie is all Spielburg.  Fanciful staging, lots of effects, the obligatory allusion to the holocaust and gut-wrenching turmoil for our little hero and his friend.  This is a huge contrast to the beginning of the story and is so different that it really feels like a whole different movie.  Following the sublime Chardonnay of Kubrick with the super-charged Frappucino of Spielburg is unsettling and frustrating.  For example, the staging in the first act is dominated by polished wood floors, furniture that is both kitsch and futuristic and smoky corporate offices. The second act is pretty much Back to the Future meets Thunderdome.  The two have their place - but not in the same movie!Where the first act compels us to consider the matter, the second act throws us against the wall, puts a gun to our head and screams, listen to me!By the third act, I had really lost interest.  I never quite got over the abandonment of the original story and didn't really feel like getting involved in the second one - both because it wasn't as interesting and because I didn't want to be cheated twice in two hours.The end of the third act is really where the movie should have stopped. It was sad, pitiful and left us with the core moral issue of how we tend to implement an idea without thinking of the consequences.But, no, here comes the fourth act - and the other major problem with this movie.  Epilog, coda, call it what you want, the ending was tacked on and was just horrible.  More face time for the FX folks and some really trite, contrived and irrelevant dialog from robots about the space-time continuum. Really, who cares?  It's just an awkward plot device and you roll your eyes and ask Wha--? all at the same time.  The second ending, as I like to call it, attempts to fulfill the demand for emotional conclusion that the odyssey portion of the film has built up yet fails to do so.  Whatever comes to mind.  I bet this was done in response to test screening.Still, I'm glad I saw this movie.  It has some great moments, compelling subject matter and Osment puts in a truly great performance.

David Hyde Pierce (KelseyGrammer's TV brother on Frasier) is fantastic, neurotic andhuman and sensitive and smart -- a sympathetic character.  MaryMcCormack is sweet as Catherine Keener's aimless sister.It's a head-scratcher, though; two viewings are recommended. FFis definitely a messy and often hard-to-follow film, but this reviewerbelieves it will be critically re-evaluated (and praised?) in the nearfuture.  The talent involved should be proud of their participation inthis challenging project.  It's a lively addition to Soderbergh'soeuvre -- people, this is one of our generation's auteurs!  Payattention, pay attention. ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"18 September 2002","score":"","review":"  Yup. This one definitely worked for me. Found myself squeezing the handles white-knuckled most of the time. The idea is not that original (the TV-series V), but I don't recall anyone using the signs-in-the-cornfields- idea before. Also directing and screenplay are brilliant- it's amazing how, in a production the size of this, little they invested in the aliens. And regarding, how such a tense atmosphere they managed to create. Let's see all they needed was ONE guy in an alien suit for footage of about 4 minutes, and some grady, low-quality news-footage - of lights in the sky! Of course, in horror flicks often more is less, since what you CAN'T see is scarier than what you DO see and goes for this, too, for the last reel... but for horror-fans, here is a perfect example of minimazing the income and maximazing the outcome- The Signs is truly the work of an undeniable genius!P.S. Did anyone of you whiners think that it might of not been just the H2O that kills these aliens? Maybe it's the dissolved ions in it that are present on Earth (that is, in the 1)tap water of 2)Earth), or the pH... or the amoebas?
