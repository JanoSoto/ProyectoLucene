They probably titled this to get people into the theater.After seeing the third installment, Revenge of the Sith I see how this movie fits into the story Arc. It is a very very important piece of the puzzle.But the story itself is not very entertaining. It is rather boring. The ending is far from the ending, I hoped for. Although I found it interesting that the entire diabolic situation in the galaxy that has transpired is explained to Obi Wan at one point in the movie, and he apparently does not believe it.
