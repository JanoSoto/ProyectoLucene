And the President is himself betrayed by a bodyguard!! Ludicrous. Those secret service agents would be the most fanatically loyal, die hard spooks you could ever imagine!!Petersen must have done it for the exposure, the money or both. It's the usual storyline that makes non-Americans cringe The 1 'cowboy' takes on ALL the bad, dirty 'injuns' and wins. As always, he just happens to be a former Vietnam helicopter pilot. Oh, and he's also got a loving wife and daughter that adore him. Bill Clinton must have laughed even more than me when he saw this movie. The acting overall is so cliched and melodramatic (someone mentioned Glenn Close) it was as if they were ORDERED to behave like jingoistic morons by the producers. Good to see that a lot of American viewers also found it extremely distasteful and insulting.To cap it all off, (spoiler ahead)....when AF1 crashes into the sea at the end, the special effects almost made me laugh out loud. It looked like something from early 80s science fiction TV!!Also, the wonderful U-boat captain played by Jurgen Prochnow in 'Das Boot' is relegated to a minor role playing an ultra nationalist General. What a shame. Instead the major roles are taken by wooden actors who should know better, namely Close and Ford. I thought the best performance was given by Oldman, who's venom as the zealous terrorist is credible. The reviewer before me pointed out the major flaws and I'd agree with him\/her, especially the part when the staff parachute blindly into the sky over E.Europe. The secretary has the most idiotic smile on her face as she drifts down towards probable death\/capture\/torture\/drowning\/etc. This film is practically another Delta Force or Rambo with better special effects and marginally better acting but overall it is still a pitiful effort. Passenger 57 and Die Hard 2 are much better 'aircraft related action movies'.

We start with the death that sets the entire story in motion and then we flash forward six years later. The guilty party responsible have all grown up and are ready to attend their senoir prom. Then the tension starts building. The escape mental patient. The creepy phone calls. Morbid notes. This happens through the first hour as we get to know the characters and climaxes in one big blood bath at the Prom.  One thing I loved about the movie is how it plays off Halloween. At first we're expecting the story to take the Michael Myers route, but later we're given something completely different. The twist at the end was both surprising and logical. Not to mention heart wrenching.  Pacing-wise, everything moves at a perfect pace. I never got bored with this movie and nothing was ever rushed. I have only two complaints. One is that there's a subplot ripped straight out of CARRIE. The other is that damn disco sequence. I was going to give this flick a perfect score before I had to endure THAT. I like seeing a young Jamie Lee Curtis throwing her body around as much as the next guy but the MUSIC....oh, it's horrid. ACTING-Leslie Nelson is always a pleasure to watch and it was funny to see him acting serious after seeing in all those damn NAKED GUN movies. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as usual. We also get the impression that her character isn't virginal in this one...I dug that. Casey Stevens does a good job of conveying the guilt that his character felt and comes across as a guy you would want to hang with....only if he got rid of that damn afro. Anne Marie Martin plays the bitch well and gives a bit of depth to her character, but has her moments of bad acting. Michael Tough is likeable as Curtis' brother and Pita Oliver won be over as the virgin whose having problems losing her virginity. Obviously no one is oscar worthy, but for a slasher film we get more than adequate performances. The killer is a bad  DIRECTING Paul Lynch takes a few pages from John Carpenter's book and does well for himself. Some atmosphere. Some suspense. Some great camera angles. Just like John Carpenter's and Sean Cunningham's talents were very responsible for the quality of HALLOWEEN and F13, Lynch made PROM NIGHT as good as it was. This is how slasher movies SHOULD be made.MUSIC The score wasn't anything special and disco is always terrible.BG+P-The violence is mostly offscreen (save for one kick ass decapitation) and the nudity is mostly non-frontal (save for one quick tit shot.) PROM NIGHT isn't spectular, but it wasn't trying to be. It was a little horror film with a lot of quality. This is where the inferior I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER got it's plot.
