Like Bruce Willis' character in Unbreakable, she is just beginning to realize that she might really have powers, and believe she can do something with it. Her fortune telling for donations is mainly an innocent way to pick up pocket money, but she does begin to have what are real premonitions.

In this film she discovers who she really is, and in the process solves a murder, and the story ends with her finally achieving personal peace along with her three sons at her dead husband's grave.While there are a few scary moments, they become mainly formulaic. Each scare is accompanied by some loud and surprising sound. After a while you expect dripping water to turn to dripping blood, and it does. The film is significant for a few break-out performances. Keanu Reeves as a genuine bad guy, a real b**tard. For Katie Holmes to do some above the waist nude shots. For Hillary Swank to find an interesting role after Boys Don't Cry.We enjoyed the film, it kept our interest, most of the performances are very good. But it still reminds me of a singer who can't quite sing on key, and thus leaves little lasting impression.

CONTAINS SPOILERS The film is divided in 2 parts. I thought the first half of the Pianist was terrific. We meet Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and get introduced to her world. She is single, struggling to find her space against an over-protective and borderline tyrannic mother. We understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical+emotional chemistry she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, releases her sexual tensions in sex-shops, as a voyeur, or in sadistic self-mutilations ... This first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable.Then comes Walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (played superbly by Benoit Magimel). Though he gets to feel Erika's coldness in the beginning, he seduces her and slowly wreaks Erika's fortress. He loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires. Then when she is about to fall for him, he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that Erika is unable to love or feel at all (especially since Walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love). This is the second half of the film, very touching as we see Erika's inability\/inexperience to love lead her to self-destruction. This second half seemed less mastered by Haneke, and sometimes had non-credible (ie. too shocking) scenes which paradoxically lessened the drama.Of course, this is a crude film at least in the French version you see porn sequences from the sex shop, daring mutilation and sex scenes. The much talked-about fellatio scene between Magimel and Huppert was quite good I thought, and is central to understand Erika's sick relation to love. As to the actors, Huppert is marvelous all through the film, Magimel gets better and better up to perfection, and Girardot (the mother) is excellent.

Nevertheless, they are essential to this story and the story's imaginary robotics industry. The laws are burned into every robot in hopes of eliminating humans' innate fear of being replaced by superior (mental or physical) technology. If they don't allay peoples' fears, there would be no robotics industry.When the robot, Andrew, obeys the order to jump out of the second story window, this was a pivotal point.  The fall causes internal as well as external damage which subverts the three laws in him. This was better exhibited later when he disobeys a direct order to come closer to a window on the 37th floor. The subversion of the three laws gives Andrew free will, self-expression and the desire to be just like his owner. Sir, Andrew's owner, sees the self-expression and decides to develop it. A robotics executive recognizes that the three laws are no longer fully functional in Andrew. That makes the executive frightened and anxious to eliminate Andrew and all other robots with the same programming.(note The rest of this review contains spoilers.)

What a crock. I guess many are easily impressed by a novel film-editing technique. Reminds me of the early hoopla over The Blair Witch Project. Having said that, the film certainly is engrossing and entertaining, and I applaud the writer\/director\/editor for trying something so new.  I rate Memento 8 of 10, but you have to see it on DVD with the extras to understand it. Leonard (Guy Pearce) is what the director terms an unreliable narrator, because he cannot form new memories after his injury during his wife's attack. So, what we see during the film is what Leonard believes is reality.  In truth, Leonard has escaped from the mental hospital to find and kill Jimmy G. We learn that he has killed one man he thought was his wife's murderer, wears his clothes, drives his car, all the while reasoning that these were his all along. At one point he is asked, Where do you think you got that car? And those clothes? Is that what you used to wear to work? Leonard answered, Sure, we get paid a good salary, I must have bought those.So, with new clothes, car, and residence in a motel (so the movie doesn't end prematurely with his capture at home), and polaroid pictures of each so he can remember the next hour, he forgets about the dead man and resumes his hunt for the killer, which he does and is depicted in the opening scene.  The rest of the movie is the backwards unfolding of what happened between the two killings. Who knows how many could have come before, and how many after. Memento just is a snapshot in the life of this crazy man, and we are never given a time reference, whether the story covered days, weeks, or months.It is important to realize the story is told unreliably from Leonard's point of view. Thus, it doesn't matter what the Joe P. and Carrie-Ann Moss characters really were. It doesn't even matter whether there was one or two attackers of his wife, or even if she really was killed by attackers, or by Leonard giving her too many insulin shots. The movie was simply a study of a person's thought process and decision-making with the handicap he had at that point in his life.Ultimately the writer\/director does not want his audience to take all this too seriously. He calls it a film noir. It is an exercise in interesting film-making. He even sprinkles in humor throughout.

Which is what we have all already experienced with Episodes IV, V and VI.

Afterall, Rock Star offered me everything the Musketeer didn't; entertainment. Mark Wahlberg's follow up to Planet of the Apes comes in the form of Rock Star, a story of self discovery set in the 80's world of drugs, sex and rock & roll. Wahlberg plays Chris Cole, the front man for a band dedicated to covering his favorite band Steel Dragon.  Cole repeatedly refers to his band as a tribute band, and spends all of his time matching the looks and sounds of Steel Dragon.  Eventually all of his work pays off, as the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves the group, and they are suddenly in need of a new front man.  That is where Chris Cole comes in.  Renamed Izzy, Cole steps in as the new lead for the real Steel Dragon. The movie goes on, and Cole is forced to choose between making his own music or making Steel Dragon music. He's also faced with the decision to be with a woman who loves him (Jennifer Aniston), or having a new girl in his hotel every night.  In the end I don't need to tell you which choices he makes. While Rock Star is a fairly predictable movie, it is also very enjoyable.  There were moments that felt like Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous, but you are never drawn deep enough into these characters to achieve the excellence of that movie.  I also could have done without the nudity.  I suppose it served it's purpose, but it somehow seemed out of place in a movie with this much heart.  That being said, I laughed, and when the scene was set, I got a little emotional. Mark Wahlberg shows us all of the heart and feeling that he held back in Planet of the Apes.  He is a subtle actor, but he is very effective in this, as we see his battle to become his own man. Jennifer Aniston has star quality written all over her.  If only she would let someone else choose the movies that she gets involved in.  This is the first movie I can remember her in, that didn't suck.  She's the One and Picture Perfect were not exactly star vehicles.  In this movie we see the gifts that she has.  She's like Julia Roberts in that when she starts to cry, you can't help but get welled up.  Guys, you know what I'm talking about!!!  She's beautiful, and you can't help but cheer for her to be treated right. Finally, I'm looking forward to picking up the soundtrack to this movie. For any youth of the 80's, there will be instant flashbacks to bands like Motley Crue, Poison and Warrant.  Oh, those were good days.  You haven't heard music until you've heard it from 5 guys with long hair and eyeliner. Steel Dragon had some strong tunes, I just wish that they had been a real band when I was growing up.  The final song done by Chris Cole is also fantastic and worth the price of admission. This was a really enjoyable movie, just don't expect to carry it with you like Almost Famous.

All of these are credit to Kubrick himself apparently.  His cinematography is in my opinion greater than his successor's in The Killing (1956).  Here is also the use of constant music in the background that can't really be distinguished from the source music.  Together with the awkward cuts, dream sequences, city scenery and almost experimental lighting that creates a very charming mood.This movie should indeed not be longer, because the story is too simple and not really entertaining, although it fits right in with most other fifties film-noir flicks.

As a movie, however, the thing is soft and toothless. Of course, I have no idea for sure if the original screenplay had more bite than what ended up on the screen--but what's up there is what counts (although you can tell that a couple of profanities were redubbed to get that soft pg-13 rating, AND it also seemed that one major character was obviously a pothead before some major editing around the subject).Since you're reading this after having checked out IMDB's GQ page, you already know the plot--aliens from space confuse the cast of a cancelled Star Trek type show with the real thing and ask them to go on a mission in space for real. What possibilities!Unfortunately, instead of a fun satire, we really only get a rather ordinary big-budget mainstream flick from a TV director (and if there are 2 groups of directors who should be having MUCH more trouble getting big screen deals, it is TV directors and their evil twin, music video directors).Tim Allen plays the Captain Kirk type role, and he is pretty good. He's still just a competent TV sitcom comedian, but the guy is funny (and could be much funnier if not saddled with the burden of having to please his legions of TV sitcom whitebread fans).

Unfortunately, the same goes for the rest of the All-Star and Semi-Star cast.It all seems so...ordinary.Despite the good cast of notable actors (including the fabtabulous Sigorney Weaver), a change direction in the casting is what could have pushed Galaxy Quest over the top.Imagine the added comedic, and even dramatic, dimensions which would have been added if William Shatner had been hired to play Galaxy Quest's captain!

BUT I don't think Paramount would allow that kind of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein type self-Parody of the Star Trek franchise just yet (probably because they're idiots without vision).BUT, having said all that, I suggest you rent GQ and imagine what it would have been like to see William Shatner in Tim Allen's role--then tell me that Galaxy Quest wouldn't have grossed over the $2 million mark if the filmmakers had only made it so.

I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin.  My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart.  The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.
