I didn't really understand what was going on, and a lot of secondary characters were hard to identify with. But starting with the scene in the office of Dr. Zimmer, where Pluto and Dina both saw 'after' pictures showing what they could look like, I was really beginning to enjoy it. And then came the wild adventure. A little too wild, but quite funny at times.I thought Eddie Murphy did an okay job as Pluto but he was even better when he appeared as Pluto's clone. The visual effects where Pluto and his clone were together were amazing--it really looked like both characters were there, without one appearing to be up against a blue screen.I really liked Bruno. I don't know how his voice ended up being so metallic, but I assume it was Randy Quaid's performance that made this character work. He was really funny. I especially liked the scene with robot Babette, who was stuck in an 'oops' program.And I liked Tony Francis as a singer. In this sci-fi world, so much of the music sounded so futuristic, though not that different from today. Tony's schmaltzy Vegas-style performance was a breath of fresh air. And I liked his orchestra, though I wasn't quite clear on whether that box in front of the conductor was the whole thing.Let's not forget John Cleese as the talking car, whose 'face' appeared on a small screen complete with a chauffeur's uniform. Excellent job; I wish he had been on more.I've seen better adventure movies and better sci-fi stories, to be sure, but this ended up being pretty good.

A decent storyline with great, chilling music and superb acting make Halloween a must see. One night, Michael Myers escapes the hospital he was staying at and decides to return home to wreak havoc and issue fatal consequences for anyone who gets in his way. Firstly the atmosphere is spot on here. The mood is perfectly set from the start of the film and it works well right until the end. From the first scene there is intrigue, suspense and murder. The producers do a wonderful job of making sure that this film has the perfect scary movie feel to it. Most of the scenes are set in the hours of darkness, which goes perfectly with the dark, chilling storyline. The producers do a wonderful job of using this to the films advantage &#150; the use of shadows and reflections in the darkness work wonders to add to the scare factor.The way that Michael Myers is built up to be an unstoppable, completely scary psychopathic killer is superb. The thing that I found really scary about the Michael Myers character was throughout the film you never knew where he was or could be &#150; he could be in one place one minute, and another place the next. It gave the feeling that nobody in the film was safe.I firmly believe that one of the most convincing reasons for this film being so successful was that Donald Pleasance gave the performance of a lifetime. His acting was spot on &#150; he is so convincing in his efforts to try and convince people that Myers is pure evil. He lived and breathed this role, and really brought to life the characters of both Dr Loomis and Michael Myers. Not one actor could have done a better job in the role of Dr Loomis, and I for one will always remember Donald Pleasance for what he did for the Halloween series. The acting as a whole was good in the film, and Jamie Lee Curtis also does a good job of playing the helpless, un-deserving victim.Another reason for the success of this film I would have to say has to be the music. The music in this film is very chilling, and does a cracking job of building up the tension and anxiety in the now infamous chase scenes the occur during the film. There are so many factors that can be credited for the success of this film. These range from the great performances, the fantastic atmosphere created in the film, the use of shadows and lighting to the great music score.I would strongly suggest to anyone to watch this film, as it is one of the best horror films ever. It is a subtle, yet very scary masterpiece.They don't make films like this anymore!

Excellent performances laced with a splendid editing job that makes the film all the more alive and exciting. Plus the musical score is truly unique.Russell Crowe, in his first Oscar-nominated role gives a very low key performance reminiscent of his work in L.A. Confidential. Not that those two movies were anywhere near similar, but Crowe has a way of understatement in both films that is rare for an actor today. To compare, look at Al Pacino's performance. He has the flashy role of the TV-producer and boy, does he ever take advantage of it. The only times when he shows near restraint is in his scenes with Crowe. The scenes they share also has some touching moments and Pacino has never been more likable. The one thing that Pacino totally nails is the opening scene where he interviews the Arab (I forget what he is). You believe that he really is a news producer in the way the scene is set up and the way Pacino plays it.There are many more familiar faces throughout, but the one who truly made an impression is Bruce McGill in the rather small role of Wigand's attorney. The way he comes off as a good IL' boy when interviewing Wigand and the way he turns it around is pure gold. There are other small roles throughout by good actors like Debi Mazar, Stephen Tobolowsky and even a cameo by one of the real live persons who was involved in the case. Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace does a good job but somehow he comes off as a bit of an oath. We never see why he was such a good host on 60 minutes.One thing I think was a bit disappointing was the way the focus shifted from Wigand to Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman. By the end I had enough of Pacino's turn as the wronged producer who turns it all around in his favor. In one scene we see Wigand at a job interview for a teacher position but we don't see why the principal, who had doubts hiring him, changed her mind. We also are denied a closing scene of how Wigand reacted when the piece of his interview finally aired in it's full form. Those are minor quibbles though, as I think that Mann keeps the integrity of the story on a high level through most of the film and it was a shame that it was so snubbed by the Academy but a little thing called American Beauty was apparently more attractive at that time.

Thirdly is the characters very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the sorry actors.

What sets the movie apart from others in recent memory, though, is the heart with which it is done. The accuracy in the conversations and the way the people deal with the issues that always arise during that time in a person's life is fantastic and, as a result, gives the movie-viewer a powerful sense of nostalgia for those days when the struggles of life seemed impossible, but were so fun at the same time.Who will like this movie? People who are young at heart, people who are wasted, and people who want to be transported back to a great period in their lives.

Wow! The Broadway musical is one of America's great contributions to the performing arts, and the Band Wagon delightfully turns its clichés on their heads, with the story of a plucky group of troopers who put all their heart and talent into...a turkey.Great dancing includes one of Fred Astaire's classic ballet duos, Dancing in the Dark, with Cyd Charise. She does this spin ending in a semi-kneel, with the mid-calf hem of her dress landing mid-thigh, in order to display one of those spectacular gams of hers...'tis a wonder to behold! Also, there's a number with Astaire and Jack Buchanan, one of the great British variety stars. It's a delight to see this all-too-short exhibition of contrasting dance styles by two master hoofers.And there's the added treat of Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant (Levant being one those, like Robert Benchley, who entertains by playing himself) standing in for Comden and Green, who happened to write The Band Wagon (as well as Singin' in the Rain and Bells are Ringing). What I like about Comden and Green is, that while most all American musicals come out of New York, the sound of Comden and Green IS New York. They once said, New York is the ongoing background of our lives - Brooklyn girl, Bronx boy - and whether we have been conscious of it or not, it is the background...Yes, there's the music - five numbers, part of the great repertory of American Standards That's Entertainment, By Myself, You and the Night and the Music, Something to Remember You By, and of course Dancing in the Dark. My favorite dance number after DITD is Shine on My Shoes, surely an under-appreciated classic. All in all, a pretty good score (no pun intended), wouldn't you say? The story is classified as a backstage musical, and certainly it is. But there's a scene in Band Wagon with a truly documentary feel. After the show's premier, there's a dress-down cast party. The underpaid company singers and dancers really are in it for the love, and when they want to wind down, they go somewhere cozy, get their drinks and sing a lovely, subdued song, Something To Remember You By. (Of course, after Astaire joins them, the volume goes up, and it's a miracle they aren't evicted. I guess New Haven is used to it by now.) When I was a kid I was a gofer for the Metropolitan Opera when it hit my town on its spring tours, and it's why this scene in The Band Wagon rings so true as a fly on the wall, I saw the Met company unwinding just this way.One more element of realism (or life imitating art imitating life) according to the trivia, Buchanan had to have triple root canal work and was in pain for most of the production, and Fabray gashed her knee in Louisiana Hayride, then had to dance on her knees for the Triplets number. Ouch! Talk about plucky troopers! This was smart and sophisticated musical comedy of the 50s, an era when New York adults still set pop trends and before American culture became corrupted and dumbed down by television. It's not just nostalgia to say they don't make them like they used to.

Wow! The Broadway musical is one of America's great contributions to the performing arts, and the Band Wagon delightfully turns its clichés on their heads, with the story of a plucky group of troopers who put all their heart and talent into...a turkey.Great dancing includes one of Fred Astaire's classic ballet duos, Dancing in the Dark, with Cyd Charise. She does this spin ending in a semi-kneel, with the mid-calf hem of her dress landing mid-thigh, in order to display one of those spectacular gams of hers...'tis a wonder to behold! Also, there's a number with Astaire and Jack Buchanan, one of the great British variety stars. It's a delight to see this all-too-short exhibition of contrasting dance styles by two master hoofers.And there's the added treat of Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant (Levant being one those, like Robert Benchley, who entertains by playing himself) standing in for Comden and Green, who happened to write The Band Wagon (as well as Singin' in the Rain and Bells are Ringing). What I like about Comden and Green is, that while most all American musicals come out of New York, the sound of Comden and Green IS New York.

I disliked it for two main reasons Firstly for the premise\/plot of the film, and secondly, for Dalton's performance.The idea that Bond would completely abandon Her Majesty's Secret Service to pursue his own ends goes completely against everything that James Bond stands for. He does not let his feelings (although he has them) get in the way of the mission. He goes absent without leave, and once tracked down resigns his 'licence to kill'. What were they thinking? How can you make a spy thriller if there are no spies, just an angry man who wants revenge? Timothy Dalton was the worst Bond to date. The 'vulnerability' which he brought to the character was more like wussiness. Upon finding the tragedy that sparks off his revenge mission he makes a sound which can only be described as a girly scream. This is not something you want from any spy, least of all hard-boiled Bond.Also sadly absent were the multitude of factors that make a Bond film what it is. Dalton has no good one-liners, there is no decent Bond car (does Bond use public transport? I think not), and the Bond gadgets (namely a gun\/camera) are unoriginal and boring. This film also went against the traditional vein of Bond films in that it was rated a '15'in Britain. This was because of the strong violence (exploding heads...)which may be fine in most thrillers, but is not what you would expect to find in a Bond film, which can usually be enjoyed by all the family. Worst of all, the Bond girls also lacked any class - the American one carries a shotgun, and what sort of Bond girl uses swear words? This film was a blot on the Bond franchise, which was thankfully covered over by the excellent Pierce Brosnan and Goldeneye.

It has a very interesting structure, and I love the way the main theme of masks is cleverly woven from the first frame onward through the characters and all plot points (the public facade and the reality underneath). It's a very thematically padded and interesting film, as well as being a great modern era ode to German Expressionist film-making in its ability to communicate ideas visually.As far as saying it's Burton and not Batman, that's utter rubbish. It's Burton's take on Batman, and that's no more or less valid than anybody else's as there is no definitive version of the character but only personal interpretation. If this was not the case, we would not have all these varying versions throughout the history of the character. I think Burton noted this himself when talking about adapting the material -- that comic book continuity was unsound and was constantly reinventing itself as far as the character. That seems to bother many purists (who, oddly, miss the point that the character has no single version to point to), but the freedom allowed Burton on this project is what makes it so special -- basically an artist given free reign, which I think should be applauded.Like it or hate it, it's a rare commercial blockbuster that is clearly and deeply personal, and that seems to really rankle many -- i.e. it's not a typical, safe comic book movie as far as template but is instead something more artistic and bizarre therefore it's *beep* I truly think the film gets a bad rep just for being a Batman movie in various circles even though it's a superior work by Mr. Burton.It's a great movie in my view and a great interpretation of Batman that in its runtime examines the character and makes definitive statements about him within its narrative outline, specifically in its final confrontations when considered with the rest of the film (both Batman\/Penguin and Batman\/Catwoman have personal duels at the end which give us payoff in regards to the psychology of the titular character). And as far as there not being enough Batman, he's in the film a lot after the first thirty five minutes or so which are clearly dedicated to building up the other characters with this being important to the structuring of the film inherently and to the examination of the Batman\/Wayne character under that structure. After the first half hour, it's very Bats heavy in its content and intent.I think depression, though not delved into, was a part of it, if not the psychosis, as shown through their choice of origins for the character and the impetus for his nightly work. Obviously it was not delved into much at all beyond cause and effect, but it's easy to read that into it even within that surface context. As far as definitive interpretation? There is none, even when just considering Kane\/Finger's era, which about says it all.For my tastes, I like the depressed, psychotic Batman Burton gave us and think it's a logical idea. Not definitive, but certainly as valid as any other. And Burton certainly did play up the original grim vigilante theme, right down to the killing, that Kane\/Finger started with themselves -- on a purely aesthetic basis such as that (and considering the rather blank nature of the character in regards to psychology at this point, mood, overall action and look are about the only important things to translate from those earliest of stories which I think Burton did rather masterfully), it was more based on Batman's early beginnings than most other stuff when looking at its overall noir presentation as far as both mood and character.The Kane\/Finger Batman, in simplest terms, was a lone vigilante that was soon revealed to be driven by the death of his parents --all of this can be said for Burton's Batman as well, with the main difference being that he was most interested in the psychology behind the actions of the main character (including the killing that is notably present in the two versions) rather than just the actions themselves as far as point a to point b narrative resolution.I think it's largely forgotten in many comic story lines that the underlying basis for Batman's nightly jaunts is psychological imbalance -- both as far as the depression and the heavily weird\/illogical\/psycho way he chooses to deal with that, by dressing up as a bat of all things. If you portray this on film and want it to be taken seriously at all, I think the point has to be made that this is not a psychologically healthy character at all, otherwise you get camp. If you don't deal with the central idea being a character that acts out in the manner he does because of lacking mental health in much the same way as the villains he encounters -- it's obvious, but sometimes forgotten, that the basis of so many of these characters stems from their psychological traumas, and that Batman's the same when you contrast underlying motivations.If Spider-Man's a soap, then Batman's a psycho-drama.

No one can deny Donnie Darko's unerring popularity, especially among teenagers; the impact of many of its images; the valiant effort of a first time writer director attempting to do something a bit different. These are noble aspirations for a new auteur, attempting to be original; and many newbies fail even to reach these giddy heights. But these, alone, are not enough to render this movie a classic. Indeed, Donnie Darko fails to come together on any satisfactory level.In discussing this movie, I will try not to spoil, for fear of incurring the wrath of the Mods, so those of you who have seen the film can work out which bits I am talking about.First, the story. Donnie Darko is a modern filmwork par excellence. It is all impact and without lasting aesthetic merit. Think to the power of the opening images DD with the axe; the Rabbit; the Greene quote; the Old Woman looking for the letter. This cacophony of high impact visual bites are blasted at us one after the other. But they are simply not examined not rigorously taken apart - in an aesthetic sense. Those film works which endure are those which go for quality over quantity, enable us to see things in a new light by recreating the familiar anew; by deconstructing a few visual ideas not machine gunning us with poster images.The Master of the Best Way, ironically, is one Robert Rodriguez. At 23, he begins a shootout with a Police dude throwing a bag of food at his colleague and switching on the TV. At 27 he's beginning a story about a dead whore in a hotel room with a Dad trying to comb his son's uncombable hair. You want enduring aesthetic brilliance? Look no further. You see, Rodriguez works because he understands that the story is a conveyance for the images. Donnie Darko neglects this essentially important fact. Its images stand alone, pulled together only by their own strength, not by the action reflecting the image, as if it were a prism. By the end of Donnie Darko, I was waiting for the payoff that would pull together all these vaguely interesting but increasingly tiresome little vignettes. And it never came. The ending, I have to say, was pretty lame.I could go on, but I can't be bothered. That's one facet of the movie. It's an amateurish work - but then it was made by a newbie. FOR A NEWBIE, it's very good. Excellent. FOR A TEEN MOVIE, it's very good. Excellent.

No one can deny Donnie Darko's unerring popularity, especially among teenagers; the impact of many of its images; the valiant effort of a first time writer director attempting to do something a bit different. These are noble aspirations for a new auteur, attempting to be original; and many newbies fail even to reach these giddy heights. But these, alone, are not enough to render this movie a classic. Indeed, Donnie Darko fails to come together on any satisfactory level.In discussing this movie, I will try not to spoil, for fear of incurring the wrath of the Mods, so those of you who have seen the film can work out which bits I am talking about.First, the story. Donnie Darko is a modern filmwork par excellence. It is all impact and without lasting aesthetic merit. Think to the power of the opening images DD with the axe; the Rabbit; the Greene quote; the Old Woman looking for the letter. This cacophony of high impact visual bites are blasted at us one after the other. But they are simply not examined not rigorously taken apart - in an aesthetic sense. Those film works which endure are those which go for quality over quantity, enable us to see things in a new light by recreating the familiar anew; by deconstructing a few visual ideas not machine gunning us with poster images.The Master of the Best Way, ironically, is one Robert Rodriguez. At 23, he begins a shootout with a Police dude throwing a bag of food at his colleague and switching on the TV. At 27 he's beginning a story about a dead whore in a hotel room with a Dad trying to comb his son's uncombable hair. You want enduring aesthetic brilliance? Look no further. You see, Rodriguez works because he understands that the story is a conveyance for the images. Donnie Darko neglects this essentially important fact. Its images stand alone, pulled together only by their own strength, not by the action reflecting the image, as if it were a prism. By the end of Donnie Darko, I was waiting for the payoff that would pull together all these vaguely interesting but increasingly tiresome little vignettes. And it never came. The ending, I have to say, was pretty lame.I could go on, but I can't be bothered. That's one facet of the movie. It's an amateurish work - but then it was made by a newbie. FOR A NEWBIE, it's very good. Excellent. FOR A TEEN MOVIE, it's very good. Excellent.

Well acted and only slightly over-dramatized, it gives you the sense of how the ruling culture was blind to its own injustices. Those who oppose the main character from within his own family make some valid points, and that makes it all the more chilling.As someone who lived in South Africa until shortly before the year this movie is set in (and was forced to leave because I opposed apartheid), I can't fault the authenticity of this movie but I want to caution viewers not to form all your opinions of white South Africans from this type of film. There is a good side to every culture, but it is harder to portray and doesn't always make great box office.If this movie leaves you hating anyone, you are taking away the wrong message. If it leaves you realizing this could happen anywhere, and ordinary good people can easily find themselves on the wrong side in situations like this, that is the right message to take away.
