From the get-go, the moviemakers warn the audience that this isn't a familiar look at the lovable messiah, but a glimpse into a soul tortured by the ultimate responsibility.  The aspect of a mortal Christ is one familiar to Christians - he was both man and God at once.  And yet, through the Bible, church sermons, and even other movies he rarely shows doubt, never gives temptation a second thought, and gladly offers his life.  To compare his life to our own is almost blasphemy, but if he was a human, then he experienced what we all do - lust, depression, confusion, regret, and all of the emotions and temptations that come with life.William Dafoe plays a conflicted Jesus, one struggling with what he is and what God wants with him.  Never is the message fully revealed to him - at first he fights with what he is, then he preaches the power of love, then he speaks of baptism the world with fire.  Only at the end does he realize his Father's plan for him to be the sacrifice, but even then he is tempted - the last temptation itself is incredible in it's simplicity.  Dafoe wouldn't suit the archetypical messiah by any means, but that isn't what this movie is about.  Harvey Keitel is one of my favorite actors, and he shines as the apostle Judas.  As a member of the Zealots, Judas wishes to destroy the Romans and waits for the messiah to lead the Jews in military victory over their enemies.  Where Jesus preached love, Judas thought him an idealistic fool.  But he followed him nonetheless, and he is a tremendous counterbalance to Jesus - always sure in his convictions, no matter what they are.One of the most controversial aspects of the film in my opinion is Judas being shown in such a kind light, but opponents of the film focused more on the sections dealing with Jesus's temptations, especially some including Mary Magdaline.  This didn't bother me - if Jesus was a man, then he would have had feelings that all men have.  He would have wanted love, a family, the chance to lead a normal life; of course, leading a normal life was the only thing denied him.This movie was made to raise eyebrows, and apparently succeeded.  I find myself a fairly liberal guy, but even I was surprised at what Scorcese dared to do in his treatment of the Son of God.  It is a humble epic (created at a cost of only seven millions dollars total) with quite a heavy subject.  It certainly is not for everyone.  But one of the apostles (I forget which) and Paul both say something similar within the movie - even if words aren't true, they are important if people believe them.  That's how I feel about Christianity.  What is more compelling; a knowing Lord who comes to us and dies without troubles, or a man from among us who is tortured from within and without and still makes the right decision?So feel free to hate this movie.  Enjoy it.  Tolerate it.  But before you denounce it, see it.  Watch the whole thing without comment, then make your decision at the end.  I liked it, but you certainly don't have to, not when it deals with such a sensitive subject.  Just remember that Jesus was decried by the religious groups of his time, too.  Two thousand years later, we're talking about him, not the Pharisee.

You can tell that due to the success of the previous three films, a lot more attention was given to the action, story, characters, cast, props, and just about everything.These days the idea of a criminal-super-power holding the world ransom with atomic weapons is not a very original idea, although back in the 1960's, when this was made, this was probably a rather unique and original idea.  I thought the story was very good and quite entertaining.Sean Connery returns to his role of James Bond, pulling off another fantastic job.  Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell also return to their roles, pulling off excellent performances as well.  The real gems in the movie are the very attractive Claudine Auger (as Domino), and the quite villainous Adolfo Celi (as Emilio Largo\/Number 2).  Rik Van Nutter comes in to fill the shoes of Felix Leiter, I'm not sure he's the best candidate for the role, but he did just fine.  The rest of the supporting cast was quite good as well.The only complaint I have about the film is the length.  While not being a terribly long film overall, there are a number of scenes that could easily have been left out or shortened.  The first 30 minutes or so of the film are really great, but from then on it seems to drag a little bit.All in all, I thought this was a very good fourth installment to the series.  I'm not sure it's necessary, but I would probably recommend seeing the previous three films before checking this one out.  Although, it's not absolutely necessary.  In any case, I hope that you enjoy the film as I did.

I feel that visual media (movies, film, pictures) are essentially a different creature than printed media (books, literature). They both stand or fall on their own merits. I don't know of many books out there, if any, that can successfully be translated into visual media without losing much of what the literature experience is all about.As a film, I think BAT is a very good film, a nice film, superbly photographed, well acted, rich with poignant, vintage scenes of late-fifties New York City (I love (among many others) the scene in the five and dime store where they shop-lift the Halloween masks...). I won't say it's worse than the novella, only different - much different, in my opinion. The movie follows the same general plot as the book, but the tone of the book is decidedly more raw and cutting edge, perhaps even bordering on what the more prudish out there would consider sordid and depraved. The novella takes place during the middle of World War Two, but in the film, there is no real reference to the war, so I suspect it was moved forward about 15 years, to the late fifties. And the ending of the novella, though not exactly an unhappy ending, is not the more upbeat 'Hollywood' happy ending of the film.It's funny to read here how some have commented on the horrid stereotyping of a Japanese person (Mr. Yunioshi, played by Mickey Rooney). But once you read the novella, you will see just how tame this is, in comparison to Capote's no-holds-barred depictions uttered by various members of the protagonist's immediate society (the term dyke for example is freely used in Capote's novella).Also, you don't get a real sense of the clawing, conniving, gold-digger edginess of which the character Holly Golightly is easily capable. Here, Audrey Hepburn is too sanitized, too squeaky clean, to portray the upwardly mobile, young (and streaked blonde), high-priced call girl Holly Golightly of the novella.In summation, the film is well worth watching, it does stand on its own merits, and should be a visual feast for those who like spectacular color photography (filmed back in the day before all that faky soft focus stuff that so regularly permeates the big screen nowadays). But do yourself a favor and get a copy of the novella by Truman Capote and give it a read. I still rate it as one of the best short pieces of distinctly American literature around. It's not terribly long, scarcely more than a hundred pages, but it is quite masterfully written you will appreciate the vivid descriptions, and the lilting, poetic prose of Capote as he takes you on a trip down memory lane, recounting his days spent with Holly Golightly.

First, it is based on a scenario where, during the 80's, Ronald Reagan either does not become President of the US, and\/or the Reagan doctrine is not applied. The Reagan doctrine was the policy of challenging Soviet expansionism by the funding of guerrillas whose aim it was to topple Soviet-backed states (the most notable application of this policy was in Nicaragua where the US sponsored the Contras) and sponsoring states that were challenged by Communist guerrillas. In any case, the West continues the 70's policy of detente and shrinks back from conflict with the Soviets and MacNamara's Domino Theory becomes reality in Central America with all those states (even Mexico) becoming Communist.If you accept that as a possibility, than you must accept premise #2 -- the Soviets and their allies are able to quickly invade and take over roughly a third of U.S. territory without tipping their hand and revealing their plans to U.S. forces prior to the invasion. Moreover, the U.S. nuclear deterrent is not unleashed as both sides know it would be the end of life on earth.Finally, the U.S. stands alone against the Communists -- Europe has turned pacifist. They are seemingly content to sit out and watch WWIII from the sidelines.So if you suspend disbelief and accept all of these premises, you can then proceed to evaluate the film on its relative merits. Here are some highlights1. The film shows how ordinary citizens (high school) students become transformed into guerrilla fighters. During the transformation, each character suffers loss, shows bitterness, anger, resolve, weakness, exhilaration, and exhaustion. The group has to resolve external and internal conflicts.2. The film both alternately glorifies and disparages war. Victories for the Wolverines come easily and some come bloodlessly for their side. However, the Wolverines do suffer losses (although not as high as history would suggest is appropriate for guerrillas as some reviewers have correctly pointed out - for instance, the Vietcong and Majahadeen suffered appalling losses against their Superpower foes). There is a Lord of the Flies undercurrent as to the evil that lurks within people as some of the characters become hardened fighters.3. The plot is generally weak. There is no lead-in to movement in plot lines. For example, when the downed pilot is taken back to the front lines so that he can cross the lines and return to free America, there is no lead-in to this. It is not explored why he is going back (why did he stay with the Wolverines so long in the first place?) or what effect this may have on the group. When the Wolverines go into town (on a couple occasions) it is preceded by a short discussion of We are out of food, OK, let's go into town.4. The action is exciting. Yes, the military tactics aren't the most realistic -- for instance, how could a group of 8 or 9 guerrillas attack a heavily armed reeducation camp and free all the detainees? Why would the Soviet fighter planes try to take off? Where does the group get the RPGs and all the explosives from? And yet, it is thrilling to see the patriotic US kids take on the enemy. We all wish we would have their determination and resolve against such poor odds.5. Some dialogue of the communists is over-the-top. For instance, at one point, the communists talk as if they have never fought against guerrilla insurgents in the past in any of their previous conquests. This seems unlikely. This suggests Americans have a unique brand of patriotism (doubtful) and\/or is a result of Americans having greater access to guns (certainly true). The film implies both are true.6. The acting is ok. To me it seems neither fantastic nor terrible either. There isn't a whole lot of character development. When I first saw the move in the 80's, it wasn't exactly clear to me which characters were which. Before all the young actors went on to various fame\/fortune, they seemed somewhat of a relatively interchangeable bunch (Patrick Swayze, as Jed - the leader of the group - is one of the few to stand out). Seeing this film again in recent years (after not having watched it since the 80's), I know who all the actors are and it makes their characters stand out more.7. There are some very memorable scenes. For example - Americans in reeducation camps. American civilians shot by firing squad. The Wolverines on the run from the Helicopters. The execution of one of their own group members for being a traitor. The tank battle near the front lines. The scenes in the mountains in the snow all feel very cold. The desolation and isolation the group feels shines through.This film represents a snapshot in time of the 80's to some degree also. At that time, Reagan's saber-rattling (for example, when he called the Soviet Union an Evil Empire) and standing up to the Soviets by reinforcing the Contras (and guerrillas elsewhere), and deploying intermediate range nuclear missiles in Europe, just to list a couple examples, had many foes. There were fears that nuclear armageddon was near (hence, why Reagan simultaneously pursued the SDI anti-missile defense system or Star Wars to help allay such fears). There were widespread pacifist protesters in Europe who did not support US policies. The Soviets did exploit US history by pointing out the poor treatment of Native Americans - they typically did this whenever the US criticized them on their human rights record.During the 80's, Americans were more worried about a Communist takeover since anytime since the 50's. The communists were on a march around the world -- they had imposed martial law in Poland to defeat the Solidarity trade union strike and had invaded Afghanistan. Mikhail Gorbachev had not yet come to power in Moscow. As silly and far-fetched as these fears may seem now, they were real at the time and did exist. The miniseries Amerika - shown on broadcast TV in 1987 represents the swan song of such fears implemented in film.Communism was and is an evil system. This film is criticized by some because it shows some of the devices that the Soviets actually used (reeducation camps, brutality toward and repression of civilians). Such criticism is surprising to see. The communists system was and is a totalitarian system based on force and fear. It is difficult today to see how anyone could defend it (if you disagree with this, please read up on the history of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, or the Chinese during the Cultural Revolution). Yes, capitalism has its flaws and the US government sometimes demonstrates hypocrisy in its policies worldwide, but we and other western democracies clearly have the best form of government on the planet today.Taken together the movie is not great, but very memorable and worth watching. Like some other reviewers, I though of this movie after September 11th if only because of the rise of American patriotism and the shock of the attack on American soil. If you can suspend your disbelief on a number of key points, this is a feel-good film where ordinary Americans rise up to defeat their foes against unseeming odds. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2003","score":"6 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":"  OK, so this is not the most realistic war film ever (lots of ***SPOILERS***)... First, it is based on a scenario where, during the 80's, Ronald Reagan either does not become President of the US, and\/or the Reagan doctrine is not applied. The Reagan doctrine was the policy of challenging Soviet expansionism by the funding of guerrillas whose aim it was to topple Soviet-backed states (the most notable application of this policy was in Nicaragua where the US sponsored the Contras) and sponsoring states that were challenged by Communist guerrillas. In any case, the West continues the 70's policy of detente and shrinks back from conflict with the Soviets and MacNamara's Domino Theory becomes reality in Central America with all those states (even Mexico) becoming Communist.If you accept that as a possibility, than you must accept premise #2 -- the Soviets and their allies are able to quickly invade and take over roughly a third of U.S. territory without tipping their hand and revealing their plans to U.S. forces prior to the invasion. Moreover, the U.S. nuclear deterrent is not unleashed as both sides know it would be the end of life on earth.Finally, the U.S. stands alone against the Communists -- Europe has turned pacifist. They are seemingly content to sit out and watch WWIII from the sidelines.So if you suspend disbelief and accept all of these premises, you can then proceed to evaluate the film on its relative merits. Here are some highlights1. The film shows how ordinary citizens (high school) students become transformed into guerrilla fighters. During the transformation, each character suffers loss, shows bitterness, anger, resolve, weakness, exhilaration, and exhaustion. The group has to resolve external and internal conflicts.2. The film both alternately glorifies and disparages war. Victories for the Wolverines come easily and some come bloodlessly for their side. However, the Wolverines do suffer losses (although not as high as history would suggest is appropriate for guerrillas as some reviewers have correctly pointed out - for instance, the Vietcong and Majahadeen suffered appalling losses against their Superpower foes). There is a Lord of the Flies undercurrent as to the evil that lurks within people as some of the characters become hardened fighters.3. The plot is generally weak. There is no lead-in to movement in plot lines. For example, when the downed pilot is taken back to the front lines so that he can cross the lines and return to free America, there is no lead-in to this. It is not explored why he is going back (why did he stay with the Wolverines so long in the first place?) or what effect this may have on the group. When the Wolverines go into town (on a couple occasions) it is preceded by a short discussion of We are out of food, OK, let's go into town.4. The action is exciting.

","genre":"Action, Drama"},{"date":"15 February 2003","score":"","review":"  Spoiler Alert! I watched American Beauty for the first time last night, and I had mixed feelings about it. I was disgusted with the movie, but at the same time deeply moved. I hated the movie, but also liked it at the same time. It's very hard to describe how I really feel about the movie. One thing about American Beauty is sure. It is thought-provoking and disturbing. Sam Mendes was bold to create a movie that defied the moralistic messages and happy endings usually found in the best movies such as the Shawshank Redemption.In my opinion, I believe American Beauty is a satirical movie that depicts the personal problems that can wreck an American family in our society. The thing that baffles me the most is how so many people on this site have said that the characters in American Beauty are all characters we can identify with. Are you kidding me? Sam Mendes never meant for these characters to act as the most ridiculous, base people that can exist in our society. We SHOULD NOT be able to identify ourselves with these pathetic characters.Look at Lester for example (Kevin Spacey). He represents a father who has absolutely no responsibility or direction in his life. He is a father who lives a life of debauchery and pleasure (shown by sexual passion toward Angela). He is a father who shouldn't even be called a father since he dosen't care a tad bit about his wife or daughter. Next, we have Karolyn (Annete Benning).Karolyn represents those people who have no stability in their lives. These are the people who are too systematic, materialistic (shown by the Don't spill you beer on this $4000 couch incident), and shallow at the same time. She is too obsessed with success and the American Dream, that anything less will surely depress her.Let's analyze Angela (Mena Suvari) next shall we? Angela, a prideful cheerleader, represents those people who are excessively obsessed with self-image, self-worth, and significance. She's only friends with Jane because she can feel good about herself (since she's supposedly prettier and more sexualy active than Jane is). She rants on about her potential to be a model and even lies about her active sexuality in order to build herself up.Haha, finally comes the Kernel (or Rikki's dad, played by Chris Cooper). The Kernel represents those people who are unreasonably stubborn and act as CONTROL FREAKS. These people like Rikki's dad only see things their own way and they dictate other people's lives. In fact, the Kernel is so freakin oppresive that he shows no love to his wife, and later, we find out that he's gay (not surprising why).Like I said, I do not know how people on this site say that they can identify themselves with Kevin Spacey's character, Lester, or Mena Suvari's shallow chracter, Angela. For Heaven's sake, you're not supposed to be! Man, if you can relate to them, I'm kind of concerned about you. These are farcical characters that we're supposed to laugh at while we watch the movie.Keep in mind, that I haven't talked about all the characters. There are two characters (Thora Birch's role, Jane....and Wes Bently's role, Rikki) whom I respect very much. I respect Jane because she grows up so much in this movie. In the beginning of the movie, she also cares too much about self-image and always depends on her shallow friend, Angela for advise, but as the movie progresses, she learns that self-worth cannot be found by what society tells us that it can be found in (sex, popularity, drugs, money). I feel sorry for Jane since she has horrible, pathetic parents and she has every right to criticize them, because they don't give a d*mn about her. Fortunately, Jane does meet someone she whom she can relate to (Wes Bentley) and we hope they can live happy lives.The most significant character in my opinion is Wes Bentley as Rikki, a son of a repressive father. Rikki is not a perfect character (he lies, does and sell drugs) but he has true emotions and sees beauty in things that most people don't. He fully appreciate's God's creation while everyone else is ignorant to it. He finds beauty in simple things, a dead bird, a floating plastic bag, and even Jane (whom most people do not find beautiful). I believe Jane and Rikki are the two real and focal characters in this movie.While everyone else is mentally breaking down, these two chracters have self-worth and composure. They have something to hope about. I think too many people take this movie to far and misinterpret it. This is not a movie shwoing us the truth and realities of American families (if it did, we would be feeling insulted). Instead, it's a satirical movie that pokes fun at people who we would hope not to be like (I sure do hope you people think the same too!).What a weird and disturbing movie, but at the same time, a beautiful movie....   man, this one is a fun movie to talk about.A good, but not brilliant movie (movies like Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and the Green Mile surpass this one).

I respect the presence Vin Diesel generates (most notably in Pitch Black, the only other film I'd seen him in besides Saving Private Ryan).  The previews of this film made me believe it was another dumb, illogical car chase movie.  I've always had a spot in my heart for the heat of street racing, having a 67 Camaro as my first car and muscling it whenever I could.  It looked like another dumb, overproduced action film.I was wrong.While Diesel and Walker definitely jelled nicely and played off each other very well, credit to this must go to Rob Cohen and his team of photographers and soundmen.  What's impressive is the feeling of speed this flick generates, and I saw it on HBO.  I regret not seeing it on the screen with a major digital sound system.The plot is so-so and rather predictable, but the real stars are the cars and the races, as well as an adrenaline pumping chase sequence during an attempted hijacking of a big rig.  This has the best driving sequences since The Road Warrior.  The attention to detail, from the design of the cars to the chirping of car alarms as drivers scatter from a police raid is inspired and humorous.If you were skeptical of this film, give it a chance.  It's not The Hours and doesn't aspire to be.  It's 90 minutes of well paced entertainment I couldn't shut off when it started.Rob Cohen is one of our most talented action directors.  He's one to watch. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I didn't expect too much from this film.

I didn't like 'Spider-Man' at first. I felt there wasn't enough good action and ariel battle scenes. And the Green Goblin's costume was just terrible. But at second glance, the acting was great. Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker, and had great chemestry with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). And Willem Dafoe was also good. The beginning of the movie was very well done. Real faithful to the comic. But the scenes with MJ take away Spidey\/Gobby action time. A bitter sweet trade I admit. Although these scenes had great emotion and depth and really defined the characters, I think they should have put equal amount of time and effort towards the action. Some of the action is laughable. The CG was pretty good though. But over all its a pretty good comic movie. But it could have been better. For an example of a perfect comic adaptation, look towards 'Daredevil'.RATING*** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2003","score":"","review":"  And by flaws I don't mean Organic Web-shooters.
