This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long.

If that anecdote is true, then we could say that Burroughs was a visionary man. But I don't know at which point his vision would have met the one that Disney Studios used to realize their own version of the man raised by the gorillas.Tarzan is among the most spectacular adventures ever made by Disney. Not only the animation is astonishingly innovative and breathtaking, but the story, the characters and the wonderful songs from pop superstar Phil Collins will undoubtedly satisfy the youngsters and the grown-ups.Tarzan's story has been adapted to screen a rather incalculable amount of times in the history of cinema, most notably in the middle of the 20th century with Olympic athlete Johnny Weissmuller in the title role, but this Tarzan is the very first feature-length animated movie about the man-ape, and it takes advantage from every benefit that animation could bring in its presentation, but especially into the characters' development.The relationship which Tarzan keeps up with the gorillas, which he considers his family, are never really convincing in live action. And the attempts made to give some personality to the jungle creatures had never really allowed the viewers to express any sympathy towards them. We just have to look at the movie adaptation of George of the Jungle to be convinced.But here, the jungle animals are really likable and their depth allows to give to the story a much stronger foundation than everything that was done before. The relationship between Tarzan and his gorilla mother Kala (voiced by Glenn Close) is incredibly touching. Tarzan is also surrounded by funny and entertaining sidekicks, such as tomboyish gorilla Terk (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell) and coward elephant Tantor (voiced by Wayne Knight). Even Kong-like Kerchak (voiced by Lance Henriksen) is rather well developed beyond his monstrous stature, and his attitude towards strangers kinda recalls Shere Khan in The Jungle Book.And talking about The Jungle Book, Tarzan inevitably sparks comparisons with the 1967 Disney classic, since both movies own many resemblances. Both of them talk about a human kid whose parents have died and who is raised by the jungle beasts. And when comes the moment of choosing their true place, between the animals and the humans, both Mowgli and Tarzan are confronted with heartbreaking dilemmas. So which one of the two movies is the best? Well, there again, it depends of your preferences. The Jungle Book benefits from a gallery of characters that is larger, more diversified and more elaborate than in Tarzan. And that's probably on the weaknesses of the latter movie. Besides the gorillas, the elephants, a few baboons and one leopard, Tarzan's jungle seems to be rather huge, but also rather empty. And the musical numbers are way livelier in The Jungle Book, and they are incorporated better into the story. The Phil Collins songs in Tarzan, as good as they might be, sometimes give the impression that the images we see are merely a pretext for music videos which we could find on the MTV channel.The greatest advantage of Tarzan on The Jungle Book is the quality of its animation. Beside Tarzan's jungle, Mowgli's habitat looks like a botanical garden. In order to give more dimension to the African wild environment in which the characters live, the animators at Disney have created a new animation process called deep canvas. This process gives more dimension to the jungle, giving the realist impression that the characters are moving themselves into a three-dimensional universe. The results are astounding. The illusion is pitch perfect. Thus we could bill Tarzan as a 2.5D animated movie.This process allows animators to conceive astonishing sequences where Tarzan moves from one vine to the other with the movements and the style of a skateboarder and also to create action and chase scenes which turn a trek among the branches and the vines into an authentic roller coaster ride. The images are often dizzying. Some of them might even be too much dizzying to my taste and I would have had no objection to slowing some scenes so I could appreciate them better.That kind of new technological development clearly shows that Disney is still the number 1 animated house in the world. It also demonstrates that, in spite of the constant rise of computer-animated features, movies made in traditional animation still own their place inside our film universe. I don't want to take off anything from computer-animated movies, but I have always preferred movies made in traditional animation. I have always felt that emotions and feelings were stronger and more authentic in that format instead of in 3D animation. There are some truly touching moments in Tarzan and I don't have the impression that those scenes would have had the same impact had this movie been realized in 3D animation.With the exception of Tarzan himself, there are only a few human characters in the movie and they are not among the most memorable ones. Jane maintains an interesting, but rather ambiguous relationship with Tarzan. Her father is your typical British scientist, while Clayton the hunter is not one of the most threatening nor interesting villains we have in the Disney filmography.Beside a few glitches, Tarzan still is an exceptional animated movie and a must-see for Disney fans. There is no better introduction to the world of Tarzan than this movie. Of course, beyond it, there are the Weissmuller movies, but if you consider their relative absence in today's shop shelves, Disney's movies is a more-than-perfect alternative. There is no doubt that it belongs among Disney classics, along with Aladdin and The Lion King.

There have been equally as brutal murders the world over, but these are different because not having anyone to finger, we can finger anyone. And that is exactly what writers, playwrights and movie-makers have done ever since. Actually, 'Jack the Ripper' was as much an invention of the then nascent tabloid Press as anything else. The name is supposedly derived from a letter the murderer is said to have sent to the Press, but the received wisdom is that it was, in fact, dreamed up by some sub-editor with one eye on a good headline to a cracking story. (One of the first and most useful pieces of advice I and more or less every young reporter is given when starting out on our careers of discovering and unearthing the truth wherever it might lurk is 'Don't let a couple of facts stand in the way of a good story.' I am pleased to report that I haven't, ever.) There is even very credible doubt that there even was a Jack the Ripper. Around the time his alleged victims were butchered, another six or seven other working girls in the neighbourhood were also murdered.

It does not seem that they actually are in love despite claiming to be. Maverick just meets her in a bar, she turns out to be his instructor, she is really interested in his knowledge of MIGs, but somehow they develop a relationship because of all this. Odd love story and one that seemed very lame.I really like the flying sequences and they show a lot of good footage of jets taking off. There also is a lot of technical air force terms used and this is good and makes it seem real, however there was a lot of stuff that I did not comprehend as easily and was confusing. But it seemed like a real group of guys involved in flying jets.It seemed that at times this film dragged and there is a lot of odd parts. Like a lot of singing. Also there are a lot of parts that seemed a little homosexual to me. If you have seen this film, you know what parts I am talking about.The music is awesome though.

Excellent lines, barbed, insulting; great scene, accentuating the fact that despite his background, Bond is a timeless, transcendent character. Most of the rest of the film doesn't live up to the sentiments, the edge, the focus and quality of it, sadly. It's almost like an intrusion from another, better, more creatively realised movie (The Third Man, for instance, from which it cribs some of its' plot). This, along with the haunting night-time meeting in a graveyard for monuments of Soviet Russian icons (a smartly allegorical instance) are perhaps the only truly inspired facets of this film.There is a sort of fragmented schizophrenic quality about GE that relates to tone, content and pacing. From the outset, with the breathtaking bungee jump off the dam, a real stunt by a real guy that manages to be both visually exciting and believable, my first impression was &#x96; if they're going to stick with this sort of approach; we're in for something special.Next, we meet the new James Bond, complete with floppy bouffant hair, hanging upside down in a toilet stall whilst a Russian guard has a bowel action. Sorry, forgot to knock, quips Bond - before cold cocking the defecating Soviet. What? Sorry, forgot to knock? How lame is that? What an awful, misplaced, miscalculated line. It's void and meaningless, ineffectual and completely lacking any sort of wit or contextual relevance. Now suddenly we're in sub-par Roger Moore territory. Even something like Just dropped in, would have at least referenced how Bond got there in the first place. Radio Station Bond suddenly tuned out here, signal lost.Then, for a while, we're back on track with Bond meeting up with 006 and the planting of the bombs, Trevelyan's convincing execution by Orumov and Bond's escape. Great &#x96; a return to action- thriller mode once more.Only, instead of Bond making it to the plane on the motorbike at the last instant, wrestling for control as it slips over the edge of the cliff and flying triumphantly away, what happens? Bond has to fall over the cliff after the plane has fallen before him, skydive to catch it up &#x96; defying the laws of physics &#x96; and then fly away. What for, exactly, and why did they do this? It ruined what could have been a perfectly good conclusion to the PCS. It's as if they just had to add that bit of complete stupidity, as though driven by some irresistible instinct, unable to help themselves. Additionally, has anyone ever noticed that the Russian chemical facility is at the base of a dam and that both are supposed to be situated on a very high mountain where it's possibly a trifle unusual to find a massive dam? And when you see the mountain base from above, where's the dam suddenly gone? Any ideas?As for Brosnan, a prize cheese if ever, he cosmetically smarmed and smirked through the movie with the clumsy over-confidence of an actor who thinks he's extending his range, when he's really showing off his limitations against the backdrop of a more skilled supporting cast who unfortunately looked like they were outshining him even when underplaying. He should always be steered clear of real actors - for his own sake. And was it just my imagination, but didn't I see his right eyebrow strain to rise in an instinctive Moore homage a few times? I'm pretty sure about this.The scene on the beach is jarring, horribly manufactured. The Broz doesn't do emoting in any way convincingly and should never be encouraged to try. Robert Mitchum's advice for non-actors of Just walk around and try not to bump into the furniture is the level he's pitched and stranded at. All that staring off into the middle distance whilst the breeze tickles the bouffant is truly embarrassing. Campbell's attempts at injecting real drama into this sometimes ill-rendered hack-cartoon reality fails to gel, adding to the episodic feel of the film and further to a lack of singular vision.The pacing in GE feels all wrong - it speeds up, slows down, speeds up, like a Ford Cortina with the clutch burning out. And although some of the set-pieces are impressive, it doesn't seem to be able to sustain optimum thrust for long, as others seem painfully dragged out. Not helping in the least is the score which, it has to be said, is a truly dreadful thing of epic proportions. The worst and most offensive example takes place when Bond has a car race with Onatop. What were they thinking? Was it purposely intended for use in screenings only for the deaf? Those notes meant to signify car horns are crushingly ugly and horribly grating. A musical travesty capable of inducing suicidal inclinations in hyenas and hypomanics.What never ceases to puzzle and amuse on a personal level is when this film is rated highly by Bond fans. Ultimately, it provides little more than a flashy, over-hyped, vapid, MTV-influenced pot-pourri of greatest hits moments which don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's like one of those mediocre compilation albums where you simply flick through to the songs you like, enjoying the few good bits, and arbitrarily disregarding the rest.

It's almost like an intrusion from another, better, more creatively realised movie (The Third Man, for instance, from which it cribs some of its' plot). This, along with the haunting night-time meeting in a graveyard for monuments of Soviet Russian icons (a smartly allegorical instance) are perhaps the only truly inspired facets of this film.There is a sort of fragmented schizophrenic quality about GE that relates to tone, content and pacing. From the outset, with the breathtaking bungee jump off the dam, a real stunt by a real guy that manages to be both visually exciting and believable, my first impression was &#x96; if they're going to stick with this sort of approach; we're in for something special.Next, we meet the new James Bond, complete with floppy bouffant hair, hanging upside down in a toilet stall whilst a Russian guard has a bowel action. Sorry, forgot to knock, quips Bond - before cold cocking the defecating Soviet. What? Sorry, forgot to knock? How lame is that? What an awful, misplaced, miscalculated line. It's void and meaningless, ineffectual and completely lacking any sort of wit or contextual relevance. Now suddenly we're in sub-par Roger Moore territory. Even something like Just dropped in, would have at least referenced how Bond got there in the first place. Radio Station Bond suddenly tuned out here, signal lost.Then, for a while, we're back on track with Bond meeting up with 006 and the planting of the bombs, Trevelyan's convincing execution by Orumov and Bond's escape. Great &#x96; a return to action- thriller mode once more.Only, instead of Bond making it to the plane on the motorbike at the last instant, wrestling for control as it slips over the edge of the cliff and flying triumphantly away, what happens? Bond has to fall over the cliff after the plane has fallen before him, skydive to catch it up &#x96; defying the laws of physics &#x96; and then fly away. What for, exactly, and why did they do this? It ruined what could have been a perfectly good conclusion to the PCS. It's as if they just had to add that bit of complete stupidity, as though driven by some irresistible instinct, unable to help themselves. Additionally, has anyone ever noticed that the Russian chemical facility is at the base of a dam and that both are supposed to be situated on a very high mountain where it's possibly a trifle unusual to find a massive dam? And when you see the mountain base from above, where's the dam suddenly gone? Any ideas?As for Brosnan, a prize cheese if ever, he cosmetically smarmed and smirked through the movie with the clumsy over-confidence of an actor who thinks he's extending his range, when he's really showing off his limitations against the backdrop of a more skilled supporting cast who unfortunately looked like they were outshining him even when underplaying. He should always be steered clear of real actors - for his own sake. And was it just my imagination, but didn't I see his right eyebrow strain to rise in an instinctive Moore homage a few times? I'm pretty sure about this.The scene on the beach is jarring, horribly manufactured. The Broz doesn't do emoting in any way convincingly and should never be encouraged to try. Robert Mitchum's advice for non-actors of Just walk around and try not to bump into the furniture is the level he's pitched and stranded at. All that staring off into the middle distance whilst the breeze tickles the bouffant is truly embarrassing. Campbell's attempts at injecting real drama into this sometimes ill-rendered hack-cartoon reality fails to gel, adding to the episodic feel of the film and further to a lack of singular vision.The pacing in GE feels all wrong - it speeds up, slows down, speeds up, like a Ford Cortina with the clutch burning out. And although some of the set-pieces are impressive, it doesn't seem to be able to sustain optimum thrust for long, as others seem painfully dragged out. Not helping in the least is the score which, it has to be said, is a truly dreadful thing of epic proportions. The worst and most offensive example takes place when Bond has a car race with Onatop. What were they thinking? Was it purposely intended for use in screenings only for the deaf? Those notes meant to signify car horns are crushingly ugly and horribly grating. A musical travesty capable of inducing suicidal inclinations in hyenas and hypomanics.What never ceases to puzzle and amuse on a personal level is when this film is rated highly by Bond fans. Ultimately, it provides little more than a flashy, over-hyped, vapid, MTV-influenced pot-pourri of greatest hits moments which don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's like one of those mediocre compilation albums where you simply flick through to the songs you like, enjoying the few good bits, and arbitrarily disregarding the rest. Fleeting surface flash and gloss with no real heart or soul. A hollow Bond movie garnering hollow praise.

Joshua (Tom Noonan) runs a spider farm t which he keeps & breeds various types of spider, he also collects crickets for the spiders to eat near the pond where the toxic waste barrel fell. Somehow the crickets have become contaminated with the toxic waste which in turn gets into the spiders when they eat them, soon Joshua notices that spiders are growing at an alarming rate. Soon the assortment of spiders break out of their tanks & head into the nearby abandoned mines where all the toxic waste was being dumped, soon the spiders are huge & the population of Posperity have to fight for their lives as these spiders get hungry, it's up to Sheriff Parker (Kari Wuhrer) & former resident Chris McCormick (David Arquette) to stop the rampaging spiders...This Australian American co-production was co-written & directed by Ellory Elkayem & according to the IMDb (never the most reliable source of information to be fair...) was written & shot under the title Arac Attack until David Arquette ad-libbed the 'eight legged freaks' line & that was chosen as the new title although it was released in certain European countries as Arac Attack & the Japanese title apparently translates as Spider Panic! which is a crap title whichever way you look at it. Anyway, under whatever title this is a fun little comedy horror flick that pays homage & takes inspiration from the giant bug films of the 50's & 60's only Eight Legged Freaks had the sort of budget most of those films could only dream of. The script never takes itself too seriously even if it does tend to go a bit too far on occasion with the jokey scenes (the scene with the cat is just dumb while the disappearing ostrich scene is quite funny), the pace is good at less than 100 minutes, there's plenty going on, there's lots of fun references & it's a great film overall with some superb set-pieces but the character's are really lacking here with maybe the blandest bunch of B-Movie character's seen in a long time from the annoying comedy relief DJ & Deputy to an old lady to the greedy businessman to the local Sheriff to a highly irritating kid with glasses who seems to know everything about spiders & if they had put him in charge no-one would have been killed. I just couldn't get behind anyone & I wanted the spiders to win & actually felt more sorry for the killer spiders than the humans. Eight Legged Freaks is a fun popcorn flick to sit back with, take it easy & just enjoy the ride but I doubt I would want to see it again in a hurry & some of those character's are awful.The one thing I will say about Eight Legged Freaks is that the CGI computer effects are very impressive with some terrific scenes of all sorts of giant spiders attacking people including some jumping spiders terrorising kids on motorbikes & a giant tarantula attacking a mobile home. Anyone with a dislike of spiders, there's plenty of them about, might get creeped out while watching Eight Legged Freaks as the effects really are that good. The one aspect of Eight Legged Freaks that really annoyed me more than anything else was the constant roaring & squeaking noises made the spiders, in reality spiders don't make any noise & I personally thought it just sounded weird & something in my brain kept telling me it was wrong. The film tries to strike a balance between funny & scary & for the most part it works although I did think the comedy elements were a little bit too in your face at times & even worse not that funny.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 Eight Legged Freaks didn't set the box-office alight, actually shot in Arizona the production values are very good & it's well made with a definite affection by the makers to the giant bug flicks that inspired it. Maybe one reason for Eight Legged Freaks not doing so well at the box-office is because there are no real star names in it, you have David Arquette & that's about it which says it all.Eight Legged Freaks is a great homage to those giant bug flicks of the 50's & 60's & most of the quirky sci-fi horror loving crowd should enjoy it.

Luckily, it did not linger on this for long.

Very touching at first, but the scene dragged on and on and on, and I finally got really bored of the whole You-can't-separate-us moment. Here is perhaps the reason I disliked the first half-hour of the film the black people are portrayed in a far-from flattering way. The women are treated as commodities (when asking Celie's father permission to marry Nettie, Mister's request is denied, but he is offered Celie instead. He admits he hasn't noticed how she looks like, and so, Celie parades herself in front of him. They get married.). They are also brutally abused for minor things. But after that initial half-hour, we begin to see into these male characters and their motivations Mister has a father he's afraid to say No to; he wants to please him desperately, etc. But here is the film's ultimate flaw the women are all portrayed as free-spirited, overcoming all the difficulties the world throws at them eventually. But the men are shown as pushovers, weaklings, or to put it bluntly, losers. And another thing I refuse to believe that black characters who read Oliver Twist would use phrases such as I is. It just doesn't work.As for the music&#x97; dear LORD. Quincy Jones' music is awful. When Celie reads her sister's letters, it should be HER moment.

This movie's plot had plenty of promise by now was it going to degenerate into a miserable lesbian romance film, when I was most interested in Celie's relationship with her abusive husband, Mister? Luckily, it did not linger on this for long. Spielberg admitted in an interview he regretted toning down the lesbian romance from the original novel, but I think this was a good choice after wasting enough time, we get back to what we're really interested in, and that's the central conflict between Celie and Mister.(By the way, the author of the novel, Alice Walker, initially was displeased at the adaptation. After an enthusiastic audience reaction at premiere, however, she changed her mind and loved it. Curious, don't you think?)Whoever knew that Whoopi Goldberg, whom I've known mainly for her comedy roles, is such a great serious actress? This marks her film debut, and certainly remains among the finest debuts in film history. I'm not a fan of Oprah Winfrey, either, but here, she does quite a fantastic job as Sofia, a rather hefty woman full of confidence. (The two characters are powerfully contrasted&#x97;Celie overcomes her abusive husband and the way the world has treated her; Sofia is arrested for an altercation with the Mayor, and after brutal beatings in jail, she emerges with her spirit completely crushed, ending up as a maid to the woman whose job offer led to the arrest in the first place.) Danny Glover proves to be a great villain in this film.However, for all its charms, The Color Purple is a deeply flawed film. After refusing Mister's sexual advances, Nettie is thrown off his land. She and Celie, however, hold onto each other, refusing to let go. Very touching at first, but the scene dragged on and on and on, and I finally got really bored of the whole You-can't-separate-us moment. Here is perhaps the reason I disliked the first half-hour of the film the black people are portrayed in a far-from flattering way. The women are treated as commodities (when asking Celie's father permission to marry Nettie, Mister's request is denied, but he is offered Celie instead. He admits he hasn't noticed how she looks like, and so, Celie parades herself in front of him. They get married.). They are also brutally abused for minor things. But after that initial half-hour, we begin to see into these male characters and their motivations Mister has a father he's afraid to say No to; he wants to please him desperately, etc. But here is the film's ultimate flaw the women are all portrayed as free-spirited, overcoming all the difficulties the world throws at them eventually. But the men are shown as pushovers, weaklings, or to put it bluntly, losers. And another thing I refuse to believe that black characters who read Oliver Twist would use phrases such as I is. It just doesn't work.As for the music&#x97; dear LORD. Quincy Jones' music is awful. When Celie reads her sister's letters, it should be HER moment. But Jones' music just ruins the entire effect of the scene. (The one exception is the spirited, lively gospel song near the end of the film.)But Steven Spielberg proves more than ever his directing capabilities. His masterful intercutting makes the boring task of reading letters into a true cinematic experience. Celie sneaks a letter into her Missal and reads it during the church service. The congregation fades away&#x97;except for Celie, who remains, quietly reading. Cut to the front of the church, which is suddenly ploughed through by a bulldozer, which is exactly what was going on in the letter, set in Africa. It's that kind of cutting that makes the movie so much more exciting. This technique culminates in one of the later scenes, as Celie is about to cut Mister's throat while shaving him. Spielberg cuts from her preparing to kill him to Shug running to stop her to an African sacrificial ritual. The resulting tension is overwhelming. And of course, what other director but Spielberg could make a mailbox into a character with mere camera movement?Overall, The Color Purple is very entertaining. It was quite publicly snubbed at the '86 Oscars, grabbing 11 nominations, and winning zero. I give it a thumbs up&#x97;good? Yes. But far from a masterpiece.

The movie is about a misunderstood doctor, played by horror great Boris Karloff, who is trying to cure the local town of a crippling disease but is using animals in his experiments and the townfolk don't like his methods. The Ape comes into the story after it escapes from a local circus, causes a fire and then is hiding somewhere in the town. While the authorities are hunting for him it is noticed that he spends a lot of time around the doctor's place but no-one knows why. When the doctor first encounters the creature he stabs it, but it's not apparent that he killed the beast. The ape still continues showing up killing others, but escaping from the authorities. A subplot revolves around a crippled woman that the doctor is slowly healing thru spinal fluid from victims of the ape and wherever else he gets it. It appears to be working but he needs more fluid. This is where the filmmakers lost me because they don't link these two pieces together very well. You can probably figure out what's going on, but I'll let you watch the movie and see if you felt the same way I did about the quick ending.

Loosley based on the real life Leopold and Loeb case, Farley Granger and John Dall play close buddies who are convinced that their superior intellect and high social standards will allow them to get away with the perfect murder. They do away with a friend of theirs, hide him in a trunk in the living room and proceed to throw a party for the dead man's family and friends while serving a buffet dinner on the very trunk that now houses his dead body. All seems well for Granger and Dall until their old schoolmaster, played by Jimmy Stewart, arrives at the party. From there, Stewart begins to suspect something is not right and then the fun really begins.I really like this film. Yes, it is extremely dialog heavy and maybe slow in spots and there is very little action in the course of it's 81 minutes but that doesn't hamper the viewing experience for me. From the outstanding performances to the sparse studio set, the film slowly builds it's suspense to a satisfying pay-off in the final 20 minutes. There is so much for the eye to follow and the ears to listen to that the film is a totally involving experience. Cutting only to replace the camera's with new film after every 10 minutes, Hitchcock films the movie basically in real time. As a result, the camera and main microphones may be focused on a conversation between Stewart and Dall but you have to listen closely because a conversation between Granger and another character is taking place and there are interesting tid-bits to pick up. An amazing feature of the film is the New York skyline outside the apartment's spacious picture windows. To keep with the real time feel, the skyline changes cloud formations, turns to dusk and then neon lit nighttime. It's an excellent touch. I really can't say enough about the film, almost perfect Hitchcock IMHO.

Some people approached Nightmare 2 in development as just another movie. Others put a lot of work into it, and if you're looking, you can tell. And some others, I doubt the public will ever know what was going on inside their heads. For all the claims this sequel's subtext is strongly rooted in homoeroticism, which there is an equally strong argument in support of it, there's only one person who can substantiate these rumors - writer, David Chaskin. But no one seems to knows anything about him. This nearly gives Freddy's Revenge a whole other brand of cult status now- interpreting the meaning of the supposedly gay themes. I would personally love to pick the writer's brain about it as well. But with all the negative energy toward the film, it makes sense that we're never told what this film really means.Some say the film failed because it didn't have a female lead. At best, these claims are only an aesthetic preference. Fans couldn't have been disappointed by lack of a female lead. Kim Myers becomes the heroine in the last half hour. Even as a 'side-kick', she's in more scenes than Johnny Depp had in the original. The film does cast a male lead. A 20-year old baby-faced cutie (Mark Patton, who I certainly approve of, spending a few solid minutes of the movie in nothing more than tight white briefs). He's not your typical movie teenager, since he's only lacking the proper Cure \/ Flock of Seagulls \/ Echo & the Bunnymen goth '80s make up, dyed hair, and dark black clothing before turning into the average punk concert attendee. He has perpetual dark circles under his eyes, an intense look of introversion plastered on his face, and constant nervous mannerisms. But his isolation is what allows Freddy to exist, an ambitious re-working of the original's back story.I believe the homoerotic elements of the film are intended to take his incredible loner quality (which I always relate to) down an unknown path, somewhere unfamiliar to mainstream audiences. To lead him astray from his natural life patterns (this 'sort' of thing also happened in 1986's Labyrinth, only to a daydreaming girl) so that he would be vulnerable to Freddy taking him over. This of course was revisited three years later in 1988's The Dream Master, when Freddy used a spiritual connection of one character's dreams to catch teens for his victims. Here, he just uses the character's body. And we can never quite tell if he's in a dream or not. This leads to all sorts of fascinating set-ups which people just assumed meant Jesse was living out gay fantasies he was repressing. The first one has Jesse going to a leather or s&m bar. Though, a good 40% of the patrons aren't even wearing leather and few of whom are anyone in actual drag.The second has his Phys. Ed. coach blackmailing Jesse into entertaining him (I assume so he won't call Jesse's parents and tell them Jesse was hanging out in a gay \/ bisexual bar) in the gymnasium, then getting 'revenge' by whipping the coach naked with towels in the shower room while he's tied up. What stops this from being a fantasy of any kind, though, are several things. One- Freddy murders the coach, two- the coach fears for his life as inanimate objects take on a life of their own (a movie cliché I was obsessed with as a kid), three- Jesse could never be attracted to the coach anyway. He's played by Marshall Bell, king of the creepy 80's sleazeballs (remember him in 1988's Twins?). And even if the coach were played as more of a muscular, sexy, suave, mature older man and not such a creep - the movie sets him up as a classic pedophile.The third 'fantasy' is a lot more interesting. Jesse runs to his best guy friend, Ron (Robert Rusler, who you can also see shirtless in 1986's Vamp) sneaking into Ron's bedroom in the middle of the night to confess something and begs to sleep with him. Though just in the same room. Unfortunately they never share a bed together. What's great about this is that Jesse gets some guts and starts ordering another guy around, rather than letting someone like the coach walk all over him. And that he finally finds a healthy target for whatever affections he buries inside. Ron is a non-judgmental, open-minded, fun and funny guy who's never too serious (if anything, Jesse's the ultra-serious and uptight one) but is completely supportive in comforting his friend. Even if they never became intimate, Ron would take care of Jesse and help him get to a better place emotionally.Most people think of movies from the '80s as a technical step above the '70s (though now it looks a lot more dated by comparison). Not completely true in the scene at the old power plant. It's hampered by some horribly plastic creature effects (why'd they even bother with those 'demon dogs' anyway?). But the scene's lighting, camera-work, editing, and ensuing meltdown of Freddy's flesh (through stellar goo and dripping-gore effects), are outstanding. And Kim Myers' first-rate performance. The film is definitely underrated by some. Taken as a low budget film, it has a lot of great effective build-up scenes. An incredible camera pan up from the basement, up the stairs on 2 floors of the house, down hallways and all the way up to a bedroom in 1 shot - now, that's impressive! And other cool assorted imagery - Jesse's sister jumping rope in the middle of the night to the Freddy tune, the quirky Fu Man Fingers moment, and I thought this was really cool; a bolt of lightning striking inside the house while Jesse stands right in front of the window (a little Poltergeist inspiration?).

Ed. coach blackmailing Jesse into entertaining him (I assume so he won't call Jesse's parents and tell them Jesse was hanging out in a gay \/ bisexual bar) in the gymnasium, then getting 'revenge' by whipping the coach naked with towels in the shower room while he's tied up. What stops this from being a fantasy of any kind, though, are several things. One- Freddy murders the coach, two- the coach fears for his life as inanimate objects take on a life of their own (a movie cliché I was obsessed with as a kid), three- Jesse could never be attracted to the coach anyway. He's played by Marshall Bell, king of the creepy 80's sleazeballs (remember him in 1988's Twins?). And even if the coach were played as more of a muscular, sexy, suave, mature older man and not such a creep - the movie sets him up as a classic pedophile.The third 'fantasy' is a lot more interesting. Jesse runs to his best guy friend, Ron (Robert Rusler, who you can also see shirtless in 1986's Vamp) sneaking into Ron's bedroom in the middle of the night to confess something and begs to sleep with him. Though just in the same room. Unfortunately they never share a bed together. What's great about this is that Jesse gets some guts and starts ordering another guy around, rather than letting someone like the coach walk all over him. And that he finally finds a healthy target for whatever affections he buries inside. Ron is a non-judgmental, open-minded, fun and funny guy who's never too serious (if anything, Jesse's the ultra-serious and uptight one) but is completely supportive in comforting his friend. Even if they never became intimate, Ron would take care of Jesse and help him get to a better place emotionally.Most people think of movies from the '80s as a technical step above the '70s (though now it looks a lot more dated by comparison). Not completely true in the scene at the old power plant. It's hampered by some horribly plastic creature effects (why'd they even bother with those 'demon dogs' anyway?). But the scene's lighting, camera-work, editing, and ensuing meltdown of Freddy's flesh (through stellar goo and dripping-gore effects), are outstanding. And Kim Myers' first-rate performance. The film is definitely underrated by some. Taken as a low budget film, it has a lot of great effective build-up scenes. An incredible camera pan up from the basement, up the stairs on 2 floors of the house, down hallways and all the way up to a bedroom in 1 shot - now, that's impressive! And other cool assorted imagery - Jesse's sister jumping rope in the middle of the night to the Freddy tune, the quirky Fu Man Fingers moment, and I thought this was really cool; a bolt of lightning striking inside the house while Jesse stands right in front of the window (a little Poltergeist inspiration?).

In Rosemary's Baby he preys on these fears by showcasing the mind of an uneasy young pregnant woman who has just moved into a new apartment full of kooky strangers. Everything around Rosemary appears okay on the surface, but gradually little clues begin to indicate that something more sinister may actually be taking place behind closed doors. Or perhaps it isn't. The scary thing is that Rosemary doesn't really know, and perhaps she can't even trust her own mind.I have heard allusions to Rosemary's Baby for years, so I had some idea of what it was about, but I wasn't really prepared for this film. Most of the terror in this movie lies in what is not seen but only suspected. Rosemary's fears seem justified, but are they? The tension builds as we realize that Rosemary is completely alone and doomed in her struggle against something which is possibly unspeakably evil.I wonder if religious and nonreligious people view this film differently. Well, as a Christian, I could accept the premise as possible and truly revolting. Days after seeing this film, certain scenes still come to mind which make me shudder.As a movie devoid of gore but nevertheless successful in creating an atmosphere of dread, Rosemary's Baby is the most elegant horror film I have ever seen and one of the very best.

If it was supposed to be a thriller, it was the dreariest thriller I've ever seen. Truthfully, I had to make an effort to stay awake during the thing so I could see how it ended. Maybe I should have seen the ending coming like a lot of other people, but I didn't. I think the reason is that it didn't make sense. I'm about to ruin the ending for you if you haven't seen the movie yet, but I know you've already seen it. So this kid who is terrified of dead people, even though you'd think he'd be used to be them by now, deals with his fear by spending all his time with a supposedly brilliant dead psychologist who goes for a year without knowing he's dead even though this troubled child is the only person he communicates with. That's the whole plot.Besides the inconsistencies in the plot, there was nothing about the movie that was the least bit scary. Yes, I get that the kid could see dead people. But that's all. They weren't trying to drown him or eat him. They were just there. One's ability to be scared by this hinges on their belief that death is in and of itself scary. But if you're not really afraid of death, which I'm not because it's inevitable, then the only thing that will sicken you will be the unrealistic, mind-numbingly dull dialogue that has become a trademark of all Shyamalan films.
