The same can be said of Diesel who, for once, doesn't appear to be out of sync or awkward in the delivery of his lines.

One is I'm 40 years old and it reminds me of my youth, the days before all the super crazy CGI and all the rip offs of this film and can remember a time when there was really nothing great out then as far as Sci-Fi was concerned (just look at Logan's Run today). The other is I'm 20 years old and have no conception of the history of film making and have to give SW a one star rating because the effects are old or I'm just jealous that my generation does not have a film event like this and probably never will. Younger people need to realize that in 1977 there were no computers, video stores, big screen TV's, DVD's or bluray. Heck there was barely video games (were talking Pong) or VCR's and cable TV was in it's infancy. This is why kids went to see it multiple times because in 1977 movies were the big thing and we had few other ways of feeding our need for cool stuff like SW. That and the fact that the film created a new very believable world that was a great escape from the bad taste of Watergate and Vietnam, both of which were still very much in the news.I happen to fall in the 1st category I spoke of having been 10 when SW came out. I have never been a super huge fan of anything like SW or ST although I can appreciate them a lot and have seen them all but I won't be going to conventions any time soon.That said, this still has to be one of the most entertaining films ever made, it has everything you would want in a Saturday matin√©e cliffhanger which was what it was based on. Iconic characters, great music and action and for it's time some of the best special effects ever made.

It's hard to do so now but if you clear the needless remake out of your mind and the various plot twists that would follow in all the sequels, this film remains incredibly true to form and hasn't lost one bit of its power. The story is pretty simple as Michael Myers returns to his hometown fifteen years after killing his sister and begins to stalk three babysitters. Such a simple plot line yet this film is the perfect example of not needing money to make some terrific and in the end this film remains one of the greatest horror films ever made. I've always loved the bit from Roger Ebert's review where he quotes Hitchcock as saying he loves to play an audience like playing a piano. That's pretty much what Carpenter does here as we haven't an idea why The Shape is stalking these girls or even what he is exactly. This entire mysterious form would be lost due to various elements of sequels but, again, it's best to put those elements out of your mind if you can. Carpenter's mastery behind the camera can be seen early on with the brilliant opening sequence that takes us from outside the house, to the murder upstairs and then back outside. This is a now classic sequence and it still holds up well today. The middle sequence of the film is perfectly written for us to get to know the characters but I love how Carpenter also uses it to build up the atmosphere of it being Halloween. The various pumpkins, the horror movies on television and even something as simple as the leaves falling perfectly puts us in the mood for everything that's going to follow. Then there's the final fifteen-minutes, which are just downright brilliantly executed and I'd say some of the best moments the genre has to offer. There's enough suspense in this sequence for two films but the same Carpenter builds everything up when The Shape is walking across the street with Jamie Lee Curtis' character pounding on the door is remarkably done. The performances by the entire cast are top-notch as everyone from Curtis to Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles fit their roles wonderfully well. Then there's Donald Pleasence turning in a now legendary performance in the role that he will always be remembered for (which is saying a lot when you look at how many wonderful films he was in). I love the way you can read his eyes to feel everything that he's feeling and the way he delivers the lines are top-notch. Then we have the terrific music score by Carpenter, which is scary enough on its own without anything we then see in the movie.

It tries to play it a bit lighter than what you would expect, given the mechanics of the story. What you end up with is a fun and campy film, that sometimes lessens it's darker edge by trying too hard for a bit of humor.Based from the comic series from DC Comics, the tale is about a scientist, Dr. Alec Holland (played by Ray Wise), who is transformed into a marsh-layered creature of immense power, after his experiment to create a way to make a more abundant food supply, causes him to run afoul of a man bent to use it for his own ends... a man named Arcane (played by Louis Jourdan).I've noted before I am a big time comic reader, so I'm quite well versed with the history of the title character. Wes Craven, who both wrote and directed this film, takes quite a few liberties with the characters and their source material, but still manages to keep it true enough, so that they are easy to relate to and familiar. I liked Ray Wise's approach to the character, as he brought a great deal of altruistic idealism to him, which rang true to the character from the comics. Also well cast is Louis Jourdan as Arcane, as he gave him just the right amount of arrogant egotism and flamboyant self-aggrandizement, like the typical madman who thinks they know how to rule the world would have. Of course, Adrienne Barbeau is the real standout here, not just for the obvious physical attributes (which were obviously one of the reasons she was cast in the role of Holland's\/Swamp Thing's love interest), but she manages to elevate herself from being more than just the usual damsel in distress, as watching her fight off attackers and shoot a gun, shows she's no weak-willed school girl. But it was her ability to make you believe that the chemistry she shared with Holland, was strong enough for her to accept him after his change into the Swamp Thing (which was played wonderfully by Dick Durock), that really cinched her performance with me. And let's face it, she don't look bad in soaking wet clothes, either. In fact, almost all of the cast do very good jobs with material that, at times, comes off a bit overly cheesy.If there were any negatives to the film, I'd have to say that it was in the pacing and dialog. Granted, this isn't Shakespere, but the script sometimes seems to just strive too hard to stay closer to humor than horror. It results in some scenes losing some of the dramatic punch they might have had, if they would have allowed things to go just a touch darker. The pacing of the film is quite quick, though a bit too quick, in some cases. We never really got to see Holland actually transform into Swamp Thing, nor did we get much time spent on him trying to adjust to his new situation. I would have liked to see more of a struggle for him in dealing with what he had become and his loss of his physical humanity, as he just seems to accept it too quickly. The special effects aren't very special here, although the Swamp Thing outfit does pretty closely resemble the character in the comics, so long as you don't focus on the close-ups, when the rubbery look is very obvious. Of course, this is just a limitation of the times and can't really be counted as detriment to the film.Swamp Thing is like a film that bridges the gap between the old 50's-60's horror films, with their poor special effects and unintentional cheesiness, and the more modern horror films that were to come. It does feel a bit like a throwback in a lot of ways, but the film has got a lot of heart and I think its charm ultimately won me over. It's not a very scary horror film, but it is an enjoyably fun film, nonetheless.

The special effects aren't very special here, although the Swamp Thing outfit does pretty closely resemble the character in the comics, so long as you don't focus on the close-ups, when the rubbery look is very obvious. Of course, this is just a limitation of the times and can't really be counted as detriment to the film.Swamp Thing is like a film that bridges the gap between the old 50's-60's horror films, with their poor special effects and unintentional cheesiness, and the more modern horror films that were to come. It does feel a bit like a throwback in a lot of ways, but the film has got a lot of heart and I think its charm ultimately won me over. It's not a very scary horror film, but it is an enjoyably fun film, nonetheless.

It tries to play it a bit lighter than what you would expect, given the mechanics of the story. What you end up with is a fun and campy film, that sometimes lessens it's darker edge by trying too hard for a bit of humor.Based from the comic series from DC Comics, the tale is about a scientist, Dr. Alec Holland (played by Ray Wise), who is transformed into a marsh-layered creature of immense power, after his experiment to create a way to make a more abundant food supply, causes him to run afoul of a man bent to use it for his own ends... a man named Arcane (played by Louis Jourdan).I've noted before I am a big time comic reader, so I'm quite well versed with the history of the title character. Wes Craven, who both wrote and directed this film, takes quite a few liberties with the characters and their source material, but still manages to keep it true enough, so that they are easy to relate to and familiar. I liked Ray Wise's approach to the character, as he brought a great deal of altruistic idealism to him, which rang true to the character from the comics. Also well cast is Louis Jourdan as Arcane, as he gave him just the right amount of arrogant egotism and flamboyant self-aggrandizement, like the typical madman who thinks they know how to rule the world would have. Of course, Adrienne Barbeau is the real standout here, not just for the obvious physical attributes (which were obviously one of the reasons she was cast in the role of Holland's\/Swamp Thing's love interest), but she manages to elevate herself from being more than just the usual damsel in distress, as watching her fight off attackers and shoot a gun, shows she's no weak-willed school girl. But it was her ability to make you believe that the chemistry she shared with Holland, was strong enough for her to accept him after his change into the Swamp Thing (which was played wonderfully by Dick Durock), that really cinched her performance with me. And let's face it, she don't look bad in soaking wet clothes, either. In fact, almost all of the cast do very good jobs with material that, at times, comes off a bit overly cheesy.If there were any negatives to the film, I'd have to say that it was in the pacing and dialog. Granted, this isn't Shakespere, but the script sometimes seems to just strive too hard to stay closer to humor than horror. It results in some scenes losing some of the dramatic punch they might have had, if they would have allowed things to go just a touch darker. The pacing of the film is quite quick, though a bit too quick, in some cases. We never really got to see Holland actually transform into Swamp Thing, nor did we get much time spent on him trying to adjust to his new situation. I would have liked to see more of a struggle for him in dealing with what he had become and his loss of his physical humanity, as he just seems to accept it too quickly.

Nearly shot-for-shot,with dialog not touched much at all,the story is kept in tact and,as such,that's why this has ANYTHING going for it. You may know the story of Marion Crane,a late-twenty-something investment firm secretary whose affair with married Sam Loomis drives her to abscond with $400,000 of investor's money,ends up stopping at an out-of-the-way rural California motel due to fatigue and heavy rain,and then goes missing. She's tracked by her sister Lila and boyfriend Sam,as well as business-hired PI Milton Arbogast. The trail takes them to the motel of shy,seemingly pleasant motel keeper Norman Bates,whose bizarre behavior and loyalty to his mother covers much more sinister and violent behavior. This story is so ingrained in the public consciousness,and the compelling and tragic behavior of the principals involved is something that stands for itself.What fails this movie,to me,can be broken down in three waysfirst off,I know it's been said before but casting is pretty shaky,not so much the minor characters(Philip Baker Hall as a local sheriff,William H. Macy as Arbogast or the actors playing the car salesman or dogged state trooper trailing Marion)but the major characters either seem misplaced(Anne Heche is far more grating as and seems unsure of how to play Marion;Vince Vaughn's Norman doesn't seem sure whether he wants to be the charming,nervous Oh that CAN'T be him! Norman or as a straight-up,chilling and creepy sociopath;Julianne Moore's Lila seems to be affecting a little TOO much aggressiveness;and Viggo Mortensen's playing Sam as some sort of sexually ambiguous southern-fried player just feels wrong somehow). Secondly,the movie choosing to go shot-for-shot,with few if any script alteration,chooses to make it clear that this film is set in present day 1998,yet the making of that movie,and indeed the character qualities and conflicts are SERIOUSLY couched in 1960,thus creating an odd conflict of trying to make a movie that truly feels forty years old in terms of male\/female relations,social mores and even in some of the devices or machines(I could swear that Marion's cars look more like those wide steering wheels and flat interiors of late fifties automobiles!)and yet pretends to be casually in the now;thirdly,given the amount of reverence the original commands(and I would be among those who would share it),a shot-for-shot remake with different actors playing the characters is almost inherently set to be a comparative study and as such will probably reflect badly upon the actors in the new movie. In short,it's a situation for the actors that is almost inevitably set to fail.This movie might,MIGHT have worked if it were done for a smaller medium--cable TV would be my posit--since it would suggest tribute yet wouldn't be so hubris in its thinking it could ever have a relationship to the original that would merit it being played on the big screen like its original copy. However,the desire to ape the original,without any creative attempt(aside from small touches from Van Zandt,which then come off as merely tacky or pretentious)by the new filmmakers seems like little more than an overstuffed homage to Hitchcock.

With very believable depiction, legendary film-making and performances, The Untouchables gave you the best crime epic about 1930s.One of the best efforts pulled off by the movie, as mentioned, lies within its believability. The depictions of either Ness or Capone could have been totally cartoonish or on the other extreme, being like robots. However, Kevin Costner and Robert De Niro were so good in their characters that Johnny Depp and Christian Bale should have taken notes. Ness was never an action hero or someone really so untouchable in the movie. On the contrast, he is weak, regularly depressed and could fail at all. As the core character of the story, he is legendary not only in his achievement in taking down Capone, but also in his character's development from a dedicated white knight to a somewhat bad-ass crime fighter. Costner's performance totally made Ness more convincing and emotional, charged by Brian De Palma's best casting ever. The movie is convincing also because it's multi-dimensional, that a 20-year-old and a 40-year-old will both enjoy but got different things from it. The storyline flowed so naturally and realistically that as an audience one felt the pain, the fear and the price of fighting crime and criminals. Yes, this is a movie where the heroes can get hurt, killed, but still they pulled off a legendary fight with the most vicious criminal. Unlike Public Enemies' self-indulgent storyline, The Untouchables is a lesson about character study in a streamlined story-telling. The reason Sean Connery deserved his Oscar is also justified here.The visuals, along with other aspects of the movie, are nearly perfected by director De Palma. The gunfights may not be so stylish and kinetic as in recent films like Public Enemies, but definitely had their edge.

Sometimes, old school is good school.If you notice, The Untouchables already had everything that Public Enemies wanted to talk about, and in a better way and shorter time.

It's a bloody lie. De Palma's movies are very precise and fully witted imitations of Alfred Hitchcock's.Whatever Hitchcock did, Brian De Palma does more of it and does it more expansively.Carrie (Spacek) is a high school senior who is an ugly duckling, kept ignorant by her mother (Laurie) who is a religious fanatic, and ridiculed by her classmates, especially the vicious and vengeful Chris Hargenson (Allen), a juicy and sluttish blond. Kids can be so cruel, you know? Spacek is too freaky to have friends in school but Amy Irving comes closest, and the gym teacher, Miss Collins (Buckley) isn't far behind. Amy Irving goes so far as to persuade her hunky jock\/poet inamorato William Katt to take Spacek the Doomed to the all-important senior prom. It's meant as a kindly gesture.There, a terrible trick has been planned for Spacek by Allen and her boyfriend (Travolta). They've take a bucket full of pig's blood, perched it on a beam above the stage mark for the prom queen, arrange it so that Spacek wins, then dump the blood all over her in front of a gym full of classmates and teachers. Katt is knocked out by the falling pail. Everyone begins laughing at Carrie, who is standing wide-eyed with humiliation and fear on the stage, splattered all over with blood.That laughter is a big mistake. Spacek has hidden psychic powers. She distracts everyone from her discredited state by having fire hoses squirt water all over everybody, then electrocuting them and having falling structural beams crush them like cockroaches, and then burning the whole joint down.It's a very carefully done movie, paying at least as much attention to detail as Hitchcock would have, and usually more. Pino Donaggio has contributed a fulsomely orchestrated operatic score. He lifts the screaming violins bodily from Psycho. The cinematography is by Mario Tosi and is equally well done. The performances are fully blown, as is appropriate to an Italian opera. Eyeballs bulge, voices shriek, knives fly through the air, gestures are florid enough to be seen from the balcony.Well, actually, it's not entirely true that this is a precise imitation of Hitchcock. Hitchcock would never have used so many looming close ups. And, like Beethoven, Hitchcock might have adumbrated a big theme into which he was about to launch with a couple of teasers, but he would never have drawn out the tension before a climactic act the way De Palma does.The bucket-of-pig-blood gag seems to go on forever -- and mostly in slow motion, which Hitchcock never used. Have you ever seen a movie in which people clap their hands in slow motion? It's a little like watching a machine gun being fired in slow motion, the twirling cartridges being ejected, the bolt languidly sliding back and forth. It's all very informative but dramatically the impact is more silly than tense.It's different from Hitchcock in other ways too. Hitchcock always made movies about the world he was familiar with. His early movies were about the British working class from which he was sprung. Later we got to see much more of fancy restaurants and Cary Grant in tailored suits. When Hitchcock moved too far from those chummy settings, he tended to stumble, as in Under Capricorn (Australia in an early period). In the end, his social world had narrowed to such an extent that he lost touch with taxi cabs. In his last movie, Bruce Dern is a taxi driver who wears a military-style yellow-cab cap with a bill.I don't mean to go on about Hitchcock this much but any reasonable assessment of Carrie compels me. Hitchcock wouldn't have DREAMED of making a movie about teen-age jealousies and the senior prom. He wouldn't have had sex and nudity in anything he did. He might have allowed the kind of discontinuity in character so blatantly on display here, though.Take Miss Collins, the gym teacher.

De Palma's movies are very precise and fully witted imitations of Alfred Hitchcock's.Whatever Hitchcock did, Brian De Palma does more of it and does it more expansively.Carrie (Spacek) is a high school senior who is an ugly duckling, kept ignorant by her mother (Laurie) who is a religious fanatic, and ridiculed by her classmates, especially the vicious and vengeful Chris Hargenson (Allen), a juicy and sluttish blond. Kids can be so cruel, you know? Spacek is too freaky to have friends in school but Amy Irving comes closest, and the gym teacher, Miss Collins (Buckley) isn't far behind. Amy Irving goes so far as to persuade her hunky jock\/poet inamorato William Katt to take Spacek the Doomed to the all-important senior prom. It's meant as a kindly gesture.There, a terrible trick has been planned for Spacek by Allen and her boyfriend (Travolta). They've take a bucket full of pig's blood, perched it on a beam above the stage mark for the prom queen, arrange it so that Spacek wins, then dump the blood all over her in front of a gym full of classmates and teachers. Katt is knocked out by the falling pail. Everyone begins laughing at Carrie, who is standing wide-eyed with humiliation and fear on the stage, splattered all over with blood.That laughter is a big mistake. Spacek has hidden psychic powers. She distracts everyone from her discredited state by having fire hoses squirt water all over everybody, then electrocuting them and having falling structural beams crush them like cockroaches, and then burning the whole joint down.It's a very carefully done movie, paying at least as much attention to detail as Hitchcock would have, and usually more. Pino Donaggio has contributed a fulsomely orchestrated operatic score. He lifts the screaming violins bodily from Psycho. The cinematography is by Mario Tosi and is equally well done. The performances are fully blown, as is appropriate to an Italian opera. Eyeballs bulge, voices shriek, knives fly through the air, gestures are florid enough to be seen from the balcony.Well, actually, it's not entirely true that this is a precise imitation of Hitchcock. Hitchcock would never have used so many looming close ups. And, like Beethoven, Hitchcock might have adumbrated a big theme into which he was about to launch with a couple of teasers, but he would never have drawn out the tension before a climactic act the way De Palma does.The bucket-of-pig-blood gag seems to go on forever -- and mostly in slow motion, which Hitchcock never used. Have you ever seen a movie in which people clap their hands in slow motion? It's a little like watching a machine gun being fired in slow motion, the twirling cartridges being ejected, the bolt languidly sliding back and forth. It's all very informative but dramatically the impact is more silly than tense.It's different from Hitchcock in other ways too. Hitchcock always made movies about the world he was familiar with. His early movies were about the British working class from which he was sprung. Later we got to see much more of fancy restaurants and Cary Grant in tailored suits. When Hitchcock moved too far from those chummy settings, he tended to stumble, as in Under Capricorn (Australia in an early period). In the end, his social world had narrowed to such an extent that he lost touch with taxi cabs. In his last movie, Bruce Dern is a taxi driver who wears a military-style yellow-cab cap with a bill.I don't mean to go on about Hitchcock this much but any reasonable assessment of Carrie compels me. Hitchcock wouldn't have DREAMED of making a movie about teen-age jealousies and the senior prom. He wouldn't have had sex and nudity in anything he did.

Murnau. In the film, Murnau thinks he has found the perfect actor to play the lead role but soon he begins to think that Max Shreck (Willem Dafoe) is a real vampire. I've heard about this movie ever since it came out but only now got to it. I must say that while watching the thing I couldn't help but feel it was slightly overrated but at the same time the movie is certainly unlike any other docu-drama out there. Unlike ED WOOD and GODS AND MONSTERS, this film here deals with nothing but fiction so I was curious as to what the whole point was of the movie. You'd think that it was just a spoof but that's not true because a lot of the film plays the subject matter rather straight, although I have to think that somewhere this was just meant to be a fun picture. There are many impressive things here including the overall look of the film, which manages to really get your into the making of the original film with some incredible looking sets and costumes. Another major plus is that scenes from the original film are perfectly blended in with the new footage and it's rather uncanny how great they mix together and I'm sure many people won't be able to tell the different between the two. It was rather fun seeing Murnau directing various famous scenes of the movie even though everything being said probably didn't happen. As far as the performances go, they are for the most part very impressive. Malkovich is pretty laid back in the role of Murnau but he doesn't manage to shine in the scenes where he's begging his actor not to kill members of the film. The entire film clearly belongs to Dafoe who does a wonderful job and certainly deserved his Oscar nomination. What I loved most is that Dafoe captured the silent acting during the scenes outside the making of the original film. Just watch the sequence on the ship when he kills a man and it's pretty haunting at how close Dafoe captures the acting that would have been done back in the 20s. Cary Elwes, Eddie Izzard and Udo Kier round out the cast. Again, I'm really not sure what the point of this movie was but for the most part it's entertaining.

A remake of John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1951 classic The Thing from Another World, Carpenter's re- imagining is another brilliant execution of quiet suspense that gets quickly into your head and hooks into your brain.Kurt Russell, Carpenter's star from Escape from New York, takes the driver's seat again as one of a team of scientists living in Antarctica when a helicopter with two Norwegian scientists arrives at their facility trying to shoot down a husky. The Norwegians are killed and the husky lives, only the husky is actually an alien from another planet that survives by taking the identical appearance of the organisms it kills. Having had the dog in their possession for 48 hours, the men realize that any one of them could be a thing, causing a huge build-up of distrust and tension.The key part that makes The Thing stand above most other alien\/creature\/monster kills off a group of people one-by-one movies is that last bit about distrust. In other films, the creature is identifiable -- a shark, an alien, etc., but in The Thing, it could be any of the characters -- now that's both terrifying and awesome. Instead of a thriller where we're just curious about the gruesome way in which the creature will kill the next random dude, we get the simultaneous thrill of wondering which person the creature is. It's like rolling a mystery into a sci-fi horror film.The nice part about that dual entertainment is they feed off each other. While we're busy wondering who isn't human, Carpenter can fully utilize shock and awe when the thing actually does attack and boy, does he ever. The amount of prosthetics and mechanical devices used to create the constantly moving spool of guts mixed with slimy Venus fly traps that is the thing and the people its imitating are incredible. More than 25 years later you almost wish more films stopped pushing computer-generated images so hard and stayed devoted to developing better and better prosthetics. But can shear paranoia and suspense along with the fulfilled promise of excellent visual effects drive a science-fiction story? Apparently so. Russell is the only known actor and there's not a whole lot to the characters other than the way they deal with their fear and paranoia. Another less obvious reason The Thing works so well is the parameters the story sets up for itself. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster establish a very specific set of rules for what the thing is and isn't capable of, even going so far as to show us the science of how cells from the thing devour other living cells. We know that the thing only reveals itself when its alone with its victim and that it is driven primarily by a survival instinct. These rules lend legitimacy to the story and make it much more interesting for the viewer trying to stay a step ahead of the plot.When it comes down to it, The Thing is just smart formula film-making, even though the formula arguably came after this film. It has a director with impressive horror and suspense credentials in Carpenter, who directed Halloween, one of the greatest film composers ever in Ennio Morricone to do the suspenseful, haunting score and a creature with more than meets the eye who wreaks psychological havoc on the characters and consequently, us. ~Steven C Visit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"31 October 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" If 1979's Alien was the original hypothesis that the best science-fiction thrillers are psychological, then John Carpenter's The Thing is the study that proves it true.

Lugosi invests Ygor with more menace and more sympathy this time, showing his character to be sweetly dependent on the comradeship of the mute monster while nursing an insane grudge against the community that has hounded him.Lugosi was actually in more Frankenstein than Dracula movies, though he played Dracula in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein.

Ankers and Ralph Bellamy as her suitor seem to have wandered in from a romance filming on an adjacent set. Atwill is at least menacing in a minor role, though his jealous doctor is not well integrated into the rest of the story.I don't agree with the negative comments about Lon Chaney Jr. as the Monster. He had a major challenge filling Karloff's part, and was all wrong physically for the cadaverous creature, but he still manages a serviceable performance, and rises to something more when opposite Janet Ann Gallow's little Cloestine. Unlike many child actors of this period, she manages to do more than look cute as the apple of the Monster's heart, and Chaney does a lot here with his silent stares.

It was not only my first encounter (aside of Easy Rider) with a Dennis Hopper film but also my first encounter (aside of Fast Times at Ridgemont High) with a film from the 80s with Sean Penn in it. And I must say Penn is truly remarkable here as Officer Danny McGavin (aka Pac-man). I also must say that aside of few elements I liked Hopper's fourth directorial effort, it's good enough for a Saturday night. Set in Los Angeles the film show us the gangs, there's certainly Low Rider and revenges and killings. There are certainly some important plot points dealing with the gangs but this is the cops' show, this is the show of Robert Duvall and Sean Penn. We see them doing their daily work activities, the film takes the typical formula of having a veteran cop (certainly played by Robert Duvall) dealing with a rookie that acts as wild as he once acted and is mostly about Sean Penn's character and how it changes. The ending (with Pac-man taking the role of the experimented cop of Robert Duvall's character Bob Hodges) is the expected and the only possible one since we have a generic main story line. And certainly it may sound as a bad thing the word generic but pretty much while the film has a formula it still delivers interesting things and exciting moments. It also works because both Duvall and Penn are nothing less than great; it's really good and entertaining to see these couple of cops. But not all the acting is good. For instance, Maria Conchita Alonso is pretty bad as the love interest of Pac-man; her character, Louisa Gomez, is from the gang world and of course the fact that she is dating a cop will bring the typical plot points of having Pac-man being rejected because he is affecting Louisa's familiars by doing his job. It may not work the love part of the film but some other parts work perfectly like for instance the whole thing when Pac-man finally changes it may not be a total surprise of a plot point but having a character like Pac-man (for a reason I must say Penn was perfectly cast here) acting finally a bit more reasonable and still getting the blame (that in this world means being in dire straits) was a really good part for me. Sure you will find lots of crap music (boy, those chase scenes were almost all ruined by the crappy soundtrack) and some other bad elements but hell also Penn and Duvall... it's a good and entertaining Hopper film.

While so-so and certainly not a bad film, today it feels like one of any number of sci-fi '50s flicks that came along after it. THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD remains one of the most incredibly overrated movies in history for me. Although the on screen directorial credit is given to Christian Nyby, it's been long believed that Howard Hawks (who produced) had a hand in it. I firmly believe that it's because of Hawks' involvement that this thing enjoys such bizarre praise, despite that it's so undeserving. Maybe some of its acclaim also has to do with figuring in that this was the first real flying saucer\/space monster sci-fi film to come out of the 1950s.There's very little going on when we're not presented with a lot of talking heads and overly-analytical dialogue. The movie thinks it's intelligent, but it's hard to keep a straight face while watching learned scientists and soldiers seriously discuss a vegetable creature that's like a living and thinking carrot but resembles Yul Brynner, yet don't wonder how it managed to wear shirts, pants and shoes. This monster can behave brutally at times (its attack on the dogs is one merciful high point), but he's also pretty pedestrian looking for a living carrot man. None of the characters are particularly interesting or likable, from Ken Tobey's perfunctory captain, to the wise-cracking commentator, and the over-protective doctor. There's also a girlfriend thrown in for good measure, but she leaves no impression despite a lightweight bondage scene that was restored for the DVD but serves no purpose and was better off missing to keep the movie shorter. If there was ever a remake that surpassed its original while remaining closer to its source, it was John Carpenter's 1982 version, which was a truer adaptation of John Campbells' 1938 novella entitled Who Goes There? and was superior to this film in every way. ** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"31 October 2009","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I took another shot at this so-called classic that must have come off stronger in its heyday.

Partners need to respect each other for who they are and not use them for money, steal and sell important family heirlooms behind their back without permission, or take out their problems out on them. Looking for an easy way out of a problem is not a solution. If their partner is struggling through an issue, then both partners need to be there for each other to solve the problem before the problem takes a toll for the worst scenario.Hitchcock is able to work this theme out well in this suspenseful, mystery film. Hitchcock use of low contrast lighting and reflective shadows on the walls of the homes were used well. Hitchcock's use of the dolly shot in the dancing scene, long shots of the actors in the field, the close up flipping of the magazine, back lighting on Lina as she enters the room to see Johnny and his friend, were shot extremely well. All of the actors have performed their roles well.Hitchcock works in the foreshadowing and plot twists to the story extremely well with photos,merchandise,books,words, and the character's actions that keep the viewers glued to the film and make them guess what's going to happen to the characters at the end of the film.I would recommend this movie to anybody that's interested in watching suspenseful films.

Somehow or other this classic had passed me by down the years and given that it was in my top 10 films to see before I die, I wasn't going to waste the opportunity this time.Well, you can tell from my mark and summary above that I wasn't disappointed. It has everything you want from a Boys' Own Adventure and successfully crosses winning elements from The Scarlet Pimpernel and Robin Hood - with the hero, a mild-mannered fop in everyday life who transforms into the dynamic swashbuckling avenger taking up arms against a comically-tyrannic overlord (a highly amusing J Edward Bromberg) and his nasty ace-swordsman lieutenant, (the peerless Basil Rathbone), who has a series of hair-raising adventures before naturally getting captured only to escape death in the final reel, get the beautiful girl and restore order within his family and for all of his countrymen to boot.The action sequences are terrific and include a great escape when Zorro jumps his horse off a bridge into a stream below and a wonderfully exciting climactic sword-fight between Power & Rathbone ending with Rathbone's very realistic death.Tyrone Power goes easily from fey to fearless and is a match for Flynn in almost every respect while Linda Darnell, while lacking the winsome allure of Olivia De Havilland nevertheless provides a suitably attractive reward for the hero's efforts. Special mention to Eugene Palette for his scene-stealing role as the gruff-voiced priest who Friar Tuck-style bashes villainous heads even as he admonishes himself in the act.There's plenty of humour on board and the musical score is suitably uplifting, especially Zorro's theme whenever he enters the scene.All in all, just one of the best, most exhilarating and enjoyable films I've yet seen, effortlessly directed by old master Rouben Mamoullian who obviously knows a thing or two about lighting sets as well as condensing this rollicking tale into ninety blink-and-they're-gone minutes. Wish they'd made it in colour though, like Curtiz's The Adventures of Robin Hood!

For Burt Reynolds its that prison yard that he's in for the next 18 months. Reynolds isn't one of the noblest athletes ever to grace the National Football League. He was a quarterback who was thrown out of the game in a point shaving scandal. Now he's doing time for stealing his mistress's Maserati and causing a lot of havoc and mayhem when she called the cops on him.The Longest Yard starts to look a little like From Here To Eternity where Monty Clift's company captain Philip Ober wants him to box for the post championship. Reynolds really isn't interested in playing football any more or helping warden Eddie Albert out with his semi-pro team of prison guards. But he's got less redress than Clift did in the army and Reynolds is not a person to make too fine a point of resistance.What Reynolds suggests is a tune-up game with a squad of the inmates to play the guards to keep them in a fighting edge. Sounds real good to Albert who has a mean streak in him that Reynolds is slow to realize. There's a lot of possibilities to inflict some legal pain and for him to reassert his authority.The Longest Yard is first and foremost about what Reynolds will do when the crisis comes. His track record doesn't suggest any heroics, but some people do surprise you.The antagonists Reynolds and Albert are given good support by director Robert Aldrich's picked cast. Foremost among them are Ed Lauter as the chief guard, James Hampton as the team manager, and Charles Tyner in a particularly loathsome role as a prison stoolie. He will really make your skin crawl.Bernadette Peters is also in The Longest Yard as Albert's secretary with the delightful name of Miss Toot who takes advantage of her position with a little sexual harassment of the prisoners. I do love that Dickensian name that was given her for this film. The only other female of note is Anitra Ford who is Reynolds mistress and whose Maserati he appropriates. When Burt says he earned that Maserati you can well believe it.The Longest Yard is in a class by itself, a sports\/prison movie. A film that created it's own genre. That has to count for something.
