I saw this at the cinema with my volunteer\/social worker and we both enjoyed it. The part where Princess Fiona kicked Robin Hood and his Merry Men out of the way was the one that made me laugh the most during my first viewing. The animation style is realistic for a Dreamworks film, particularly the human character designs and the backgrounds. The dialogue is funny and memorable if heartbreaking in places (particularly Fiona revealing to Donkey that she turns into an ogre at sunset) and while the film may not contain original side-characters due to them already existing in other stories, the story is original for a fairytale-themed film due to Shrek rescuing Fiona instead of a prince. While the most memorable piece of incidental music is the one being played while Fiona sings to a bird and makes it explode (it sounds like the Dreamworks logo music), the soundtrack consisting of rock and pop songs was more memorable. My favourite songs on the soundtrack were the opening song 'All Star' by Smash Mouth, Donkey's brief sing-song of Willie Nelson's 'On The Road Again,' the piña colada song played when Lord Farquaad chooses Fiona in the style of a 'Blind Date' spoof, John Cale's version of 'Hallelujah (I mistakenly thought this was Rufus Wainwright's version), Joan Jett's 'Bad Reputation,' the amusing ditty sung by the Duloc puppets, 'I'm On My Way' by the Proclaimers and Smash Mouth's version of 'I'm A Believer' at the end. Shrek is selfish yet endearing and Myers gives him a pretty decent Scottish accent, Murphy is hyper yet comical as Donkey, Diaz is recognisable and heartfelt as Fiona and Lithgow, while not the most well-known of the main cast, is menacing as Farquaad.Overall this is a hilarious, feel-good start to my favourite Dreamworks animated film franchise and is my second favourite in the 'Shrek' quadrilogy with the second one being the best. 10\/10.

While it fortunately has a fan base, it's also a film that many people loves to hate with a passion. After all, many consider it as the picture that ended the Disney Renaissance that began so promisingly with The Little Mermaid and the films that followed Pocahontas grossed less (with the exception of Tarzan). While Pocahontas wasn't a box office failure, it made less money than it's predecessors. Most animation fans know that Pocahontas was originally going to be the ambitious project and The Lion King was seen as the inferior picture. However, the tables turned and Pocahontas suffered the fate of being the inferior follow-up to The Lion King. Despite that Pocahontas have always been a favorite of mine, it's easy to see why the film has failed to connect with many. Despite being deeply steeped in the Disney formula, it does comes across as a departure from the earlier Renaissance films, as being more serious and somber at times. The film had also many things against it, as being the first film based on historical events (though the story of Pocahontas is surrounded by myths), the PC-message about tolerance, the depiction of Native Americans and the portrayal of Pocahontas herself as a Native American version of Barbie. The former issues are enough to hamper the movie and along with The Lion King and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Pocahontas was a part of the new Disney trend of making more serious, epic pictures, but the ambition seemed more to hurt the film than to help it. So therefore Pocahontas will probably never seen as the same league as the earlier films from the Renaissance.Besides the obvious flaws, the strengths of this movie excels. First of all; The visuals are amazing. With grand, spectacular views of the Virginian Forrest and bright, pastel colors, the film is a feast for the eyes. The color scheme are quite noteworthy, with adding some deep colors that bathes the entire scene and it's characters. The vertical design of the Forrest is also successful, as are the characters designs, more angular than you usually expect from Disney. In terms of character animation, Pocahontas is superior to it's predecessors, bringing the character acting to new heights, by letting tiny, subtle expressions on the humans faces be obvious. The music is wonderful, simply being Menken's best work. While the music for his former films were great, Pocahontas blows them out of the water. Stephen Schwartz lyrics are also quite successful, from the depiction of Native American phrases and philosophy from Steady As The Beating Drum\/Colors of the Wind and surprisingly hard-hitting and spiteful rhymes in Savages (though Schwartz would outdo himself even further with his lyrics for Hellfire in Hunchback).Pocahontas have been criticized for it's weak and bland characterizations, but I have to disagree. The characters may not light up the screen, but they are certainly not entirely detestable. Although a few of them can be grating at times (Percy, Flit and Nakoma), the rest of the characters are acceptable. Pocahontas herself has been criticized for being bland and boring and while she comes across as reserved, she still possesses a dignity and strength that makes her appealing. She's as headstrong and adventurous Ariel and Belle, but she's definitively a more complex and mature character than both of them. Irene Bedard and Judy Kuhn beautiful voices compliments her character. Although Smith is a charming main lead, he comes across as a inferior character, thanks to Mel Gibson's weak performance. Ratcliffe may come across as a weak villain, but he does possess some personality now and then. Russell Means brings dignity and power to Chief Powhatan, while Christian Bale delivers a likable Thomas. Billy Connolly and Joe Baker delivers some fun to Ben and Lon and David Ogden Stiers delivers some spark to Wiggins (as he also did with Ratcliffe). The most successful character is indeed Grandmother Willow, beautifully conveyed by Linda Hunt. Secondary comes Meeko, stealing every scene that he's in.Where Pocahontas falls flat is on it's ambition. The movie does comes across as trying too hard at times. Besides the interactions between the animals and a few one liners, the film doesn't really rely on humor. While other Disney films excels with their serious tones, Pocahontas comes across as being somber and melancholic at times, which is a sign of the film trying too hard to be serious and epic. I personally didn't mind the PC-message and the lack of a climatic battle. But the worst aspect of the movie lies on the script, being very straightforward and delivering some obvious plot holes. An example of it is how the lovebirds learns to understand each other by listening with their hearts. For a film striving to be realistic, such a plot hole is laughable. But the worst example lies in the ending. While the ambition of giving a tragic ending is admirable and the ending is an emotionally heart-wrenching moment, it could have been more hopeless and less contrived (yes, the historical Smith was sent back to England, but there is possibility that he would have died during the voyage).Besides that, Pocahontas remains one of my favorites and it is a good movie on it's own merits. It does have some obvious flaws, but it's strengths excels. It is a movie that I'm not ashamed to say that I enjoy and it is a movie that deserves to be appreciated.

I also don't mind when animals and humans speak English together, or when bears sing and dance (ARE there bears in the jungle, by the way?). The story just wasn't very good. One catchy song and that's it. Disney had much better efforts in that era, and I'd recommend just about any of the others over this one. If you liked it as a child you might still like it today, but this kid needed prodding from her parents just to stay awake for the end.

All of the elements make Scream an unforgettable Horror film and is Wes Craven at his best.Scream tells the story of Sidney Prescott(Neve Campbell),a teen who on the one year anniversary of her mother's death discovers that a killer with a ghost face mask is stalking and killing people in her home town. When Sidney finds out she's next on the list Sidney has to try and stop the killer and stay alive.During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen as dead by most critics and audiences I wouldn't say the genre was dead but was more in a coma and waiting to wake up and the film that woke up the Horror genre was Wes Craven's Scream,a brilliant Horror movie that was not only a critical and Box Office hit but also made the Horror genre hot again and paved the way for other slasher films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer(1997)and Urban Legend(1998). Right from the movie scary and now famous 10-15 minute sequence,Scream is an amazing and terrifying Horror movie that takes the Slasher genre and toys around with the Slasher movie giving us a film that is not only scary but also funny,smart and clever giving viewers a film that rethinks the Slasher genre while paying homage to Slasher films of the past. Scream is one of the few films I can think of that mixes Horror and Humor flawlessly with intelligence. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Scream are done with powerful and explosive intensity that punches you right in the face and during the scary scenes none of the characters are never safe or secure with violence in the air. The violence and gore that happens during the scary scenes are horrific and disturbing and reminds me of the in your face brutality of his earlier classics such as A Nightmare On Elm Street(1984),The Last House On The Left(1972)and The Hills Have Eyes(1977)because like those films Craven shows us the disgusting view and doesn't hold back one bit. The Comedy and Humor is funny and at times hilarious because it seems like the teenage characters know that they're in a Horror film are self aware and know all of the Clichés and things that happen in a slasher film(or all of the rules in order to survive a Horror film)which is in line with the post-modern film making of the 1990s. Scream also features terrific and fun references to landmark Horror classics such as Psycho(1960),A Nightmare On Elm Street,Halloween(1978)and Friday The 13th(1980)and some of the references are obvious while others are subtle. The balance of Horror and Humor makes the movie more intense and unforgettable. Sidney Prescott is one of the great Horror movie scream queens\/heroines and that's mainly because like the other scream queens of the past Sidney is tough and can handle herself and you root for her to survive despite the viciousness all around her and when you see her going through terror you will relate to her. The Ghost face killer is a classic villain in the Horror genre because what sets this killer apart from other killers in the genre is that the killer calls on the phone and uses Horror movie knowledge to test the victim and if get the answers wrong Ghost face will kill you with no remorse. The Ghost Face killer will have you on edge when you see Scream the first time and will stick with you and you can say was one of the reasons caller ID was invented. Much of the film's success of Scream is thanks to the screenplay by Kevin Williamson which is amazing,terrific and in my opinion one of the best screenplays in Horror film history. Williamson script is filled with great dialog that is clever,ironic and done with a style that has been imitated but never duplicated. Williamson fills his script with Horror,Mystery,Comedy and Drama all within 112 minutes and giving viewers a unique story that never slows sown. Williamson has never topped his Scream script and I don't think he ever will. The ending of Scream is a classic conclusion that is filled with twists,turns and thrills that will catch you off guard and add to the movie's greatness. An outstanding ending.The cast is incredible. Neve Campbell is excellent as Sidney,one of the great Horror movie heroines,with Campbell bringing toughness,sympathy and depth to the role. Courtney Cox is wonderful as Gale Weathers,a heartless News reporter. Skeet Ulrich is terrific as Billy,Sidney's boyfriend. David Arquette is great and funny as Deputy Dewey. Rose McGowan is fantastic and sexy as Tatum,Sidney's best friend. Jamie Kennedy is outstanding and hilarious as Randy,a movie geek. Matthew Lillard is delightful as Stuart,Tatum's boyfriend. W.Earl Brown(Kenny)and Joseph Whipp(Sheriff Burke)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for credited and uncredited cameos by Liev Schreiber(Cotton Weary),Linda Blair(Obnoxious News reporter),Wes Craven(Fred The Janitor)and Henry Winkler(Principal Arthur Himbry).The direction by Wes Craven is amazing,with Craven always moving the camera and bringing a thrilling and intense style to the film. Wonderful direction,Craven.The score by Marco Beltrami is sensational,suspenseful and intense and adds to the atmosphere to the film. Great score,Beltrami.In final word,if you love Wes Craven,Horror films or Slasher films,I highly suggest you see Scream,an excellent,scary and funny Horror classic that you will never forget and will watch again and again.

Although I was a guy, I was fascinated by the idea of a geek who miraculously changes and ends up conquering all. It seemed to me like an underdog story, and I've always liked that kind of story. But upon rushing to the theater on opening night--April 14, 1989--I was surprised to discover that the movie was really about the dad and his obsession over protecting his daughter. Still, I found it enjoyable enough, even with the PG rating.Exactly 25 years later, I find myself typing a review after having watched She's Out of Control for the second time--on DVD, and on my Xbox One. What compelled me to revisit a movie so notoriously reviled by Siskel and Ebert? I suppose I just wanted to watch again it 25 years to the day (for the perfect timing), and see it from the perspective of a 42-year-old, as opposed to my 17-year-old self in 1989.As many others have noted, this movie is really a movie-length sitcom with some mild profanity, and some other PG-rated material. It's mostly harmless, at least for people 10 and older. It doesn't break any new ground or develop its themes in any insightful way, but I found it reasonably entertaining and likable. It's what you call a family movie, meaning that it tries to appeal to everybody--children, teens, and adults.Those of you looking for late 80s nostalgia will be bombarded with music video-inspired editing and closeups, Paula Abdul-choreographed dancing, and Aqua Net-assisted hair. The girls' bedroom, with its George Michael poster, oversized Swatch clock, and Apple IIc, particularly encapsulates the final years of the Pastel Decade.

He really breaks conventions and pushes the boundaries all to give us not just great visual but substance backed by great intelligence to make it more of an experience; this either makes him a genius or half insane, or probably a combo of both due to what I see.Believe it or not out of his films this one is my favorite one from him and it's one of my favorite films in general. Because this film has the most emotion and a character to feel pathos for.It's hard to really talk about this film because it's one of those one's you have to see to believe and would take more than one watch to uncover more, plus I don't want to give too much away. The production value is great, this was done on a low or modest budget but it was used well and right, the effort really shows. From the use of the location but mainly of all of the set pieces. The music is also really great, some of it is fun mainly that music from the beginning but others express a degree of emotion.But most importantly I really love the visuals and the story that accompanies it. The film in a very weird sense is sort of a story about rising to freedom, I really like how the Greek myth of the Phenix is incorporated into the film. From the fact the main character Fenix has a tattoo of the Phoenix on his chest and his name ironically.This is a character you can't help but feel constant pathos for as he has been tormented by both the past, but his fanatical mom whom somehow psychically controls him. It sort of reflects our subconscious fear of either growing up to be just like our parents, or their ideals and desires interfering with our own. Indeed we see that, from scenes whenever she talks Fenix acts as her hands which I'll admit is impressive the way he moves them to act in sync with her feelings, which isn't an easy feat. This makes it all the more tragic because it shows he has no will of her own, even when she gives an order we know he shouldn't obey but he has no choice.Fenix's mom Bianca is no doubt a monster whom I feel is a villain you just plain hate. She has heavy believe in purity but she is the ultimate hypocrite as she is not pure herself. She is no doubt sexist as she doesn't have a high opinion of men but nor of women as most or all in her mind are impure which is why she believes her son should have no one in his life. Which is why you can say she is unable to fly again, without love you can never really soar to heights.Just like in the myth the Phenix doesn't rise until it is destroyed first and Fenix's life sadly is no bed of roses, as he is tormented internally and externally from the forces from the past and the forces in the present.The world in this film as usual with most of Jodorosky's films is truly a live surreal world where it's dark, strange, dreamlike but all the same fascinating, just about anything can happen here and does. There is always so much going on in the background almost as much as in a Where's Waldo art illustration it might take more than one watch to see it all. Let alone there are some constant symbols and overtones, some on sexuality and innocence.One of the best scenes that stick out no doubt are the elepahant funeral scene which is probably the daftest thing I've ever seen in my life, the only other big funeral for an animal is Lil Sepashian in the TV show Parks and Rec. But the big coffin is dropped down a cliff as food for some white powered villagers storm after it and cut it out and passes parts of the dead elephant. This is obviously metaphor of sexuality and the loss of innocence.Also there is a lot of use with the hands and arms that correlate with the Phenix myth. We see Bianca's religious sect that she possibly created based on a innocent virgin girl that got her arms cut off by some rapists and of course the same fate happens to her. In a way I feel it once again represents the destruction of the Phenix, in a way both women's wings get cut off.But also the back and forth between both Fenix and the deaf mute girl Alna which I think is sweet even though she doesn't talk it was thought her words and facial expressions toward him. The chemistry between both is beautiful because she is the one that can truly give him him freedom because she can give him the one thing he sorely lacks, love. And this is reflected from her constantly giving him the sign of the Phoenix flight. Alna is the protagonist that we bet on and throughout the film are constantly hoping that she will find him and save him, because she herself is a true Phoenix and can make him truly fly.After destruction comes the rise.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"14 April 2014","score":"","review":" Alejandro Jodorosky is one of my favorite movie directors, his films are the kind you don't see every day and still don't.

He really breaks conventions and pushes the boundaries all to give us not just great visual but substance backed by great intelligence to make it more of an experience; this either makes him a genius or half insane, or probably a combo of both due to what I see.Believe it or not out of his films this one is my favorite one from him and it's one of my favorite films in general. Because this film has the most emotion and a character to feel pathos for.It's hard to really talk about this film because it's one of those one's you have to see to believe and would take more than one watch to uncover more, plus I don't want to give too much away. The production value is great, this was done on a low or modest budget but it was used well and right, the effort really shows. From the use of the location but mainly of all of the set pieces. The music is also really great, some of it is fun mainly that music from the beginning but others express a degree of emotion.But most importantly I really love the visuals and the story that accompanies it. The film in a very weird sense is sort of a story about rising to freedom, I really like how the Greek myth of the Phenix is incorporated into the film. From the fact the main character Fenix has a tattoo of the Phoenix on his chest and his name ironically.This is a character you can't help but feel constant pathos for as he has been tormented by both the past, but his fanatical mom whom somehow psychically controls him. It sort of reflects our subconscious fear of either growing up to be just like our parents, or their ideals and desires interfering with our own. Indeed we see that, from scenes whenever she talks Fenix acts as her hands which I'll admit is impressive the way he moves them to act in sync with her feelings, which isn't an easy feat. This makes it all the more tragic because it shows he has no will of her own, even when she gives an order we know he shouldn't obey but he has no choice.Fenix's mom Bianca is no doubt a monster whom I feel is a villain you just plain hate. She has heavy believe in purity but she is the ultimate hypocrite as she is not pure herself. She is no doubt sexist as she doesn't have a high opinion of men but nor of women as most or all in her mind are impure which is why she believes her son should have no one in his life. Which is why you can say she is unable to fly again, without love you can never really soar to heights.Just like in the myth the Phenix doesn't rise until it is destroyed first and Fenix's life sadly is no bed of roses, as he is tormented internally and externally from the forces from the past and the forces in the present.The world in this film as usual with most of Jodorosky's films is truly a live surreal world where it's dark, strange, dreamlike but all the same fascinating, just about anything can happen here and does. There is always so much going on in the background almost as much as in a Where's Waldo art illustration it might take more than one watch to see it all. Let alone there are some constant symbols and overtones, some on sexuality and innocence.One of the best scenes that stick out no doubt are the elepahant funeral scene which is probably the daftest thing I've ever seen in my life, the only other big funeral for an animal is Lil Sepashian in the TV show Parks and Rec. But the big coffin is dropped down a cliff as food for some white powered villagers storm after it and cut it out and passes parts of the dead elephant. This is obviously metaphor of sexuality and the loss of innocence.Also there is a lot of use with the hands and arms that correlate with the Phenix myth. We see Bianca's religious sect that she possibly created based on a innocent virgin girl that got her arms cut off by some rapists and of course the same fate happens to her. In a way I feel it once again represents the destruction of the Phenix, in a way both women's wings get cut off.But also the back and forth between both Fenix and the deaf mute girl Alna which I think is sweet even though she doesn't talk it was thought her words and facial expressions toward him. The chemistry between both is beautiful because she is the one that can truly give him him freedom because she can give him the one thing he sorely lacks, love. And this is reflected from her constantly giving him the sign of the Phoenix flight. Alna is the protagonist that we bet on and throughout the film are constantly hoping that she will find him and save him, because she herself is a true Phoenix and can make him truly fly.After destruction comes the rise.Rating 4 stars ","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"14 April 2014","score":"","review":" This is a very carefree and sweet (like peaches) live action\/computer animated movie based on Roald Dahl children's novel, James and the Giant Beach.In the movie, James has to go live with his two horrible aunts, Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge, after the death of his parents.

The newcomers are also pretty interesting, in particular Andy Garcia, who seems to be channelling Pacino's spirit from the first two movies. I didn't find Sofia Coppola to be distracting in the least, only that the camera is clearly in love with her, which you'd expect given that the director's her father.What I enjoyed most is that the film gets back to the series origins this one's about corruption in high places, religion, betrayal and violent murder. The characters visit some dark places, which is what we the viewer wish to watch, and the extended opera set-piece works nicely along with the helicopter assault.

It's not just the inability for the men to come up with decision that is making them angry, it's little quirks in the story such as the air conditioning being broke, one man is waiting to go to a sporting event, it is raining outside... All of these things make the time pass by quickly and make you admire even more that a film can be fantastic without car chases, explosions and gunfights. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances fantastic dialogue and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time.10\/10 A movie that holds a spot in my top 5 films of all time list.

Although I don't think this is executed perfectly it still makes for good viewing and can still entertain fans and not particular fans a like. The story is somewhat predictable toward the end but with a middle part that I found especially thrilling it makes up for lost time with a great bunch of scenes where Bond is in trouble.Connery starts safely and firmly brings us a taste to come from his era as Bond, with a suave suit that can dazzle the ladies, to a swimsuit that can well, also dazzle the ladies Connery oozes charm. The rest of the cast take a much further back seat to Sean and Ursula Andress as the Bond girl is good but not perfect and I felt she seemed a little lost in this. Other characters such as Quarrel a local Cayman Islander make fun work too and definitely help this films rating go up a little.Terence Young kicks Bond off under his guise and makes a good if not sometimes odd selection job, but overall he does well, The reason it is odd is simple things like physics, the stunts could have been done a certain way but they insist on being ridiculous, and I think Young did this. Written well though and introducing things that are still seen today in Bond the writing creates a sense that Bond was always there, and we always knew it. I loved the location to it, it doesn't really help the films mark but it looks stunning and sets off the adventures Bond goes on.The film isn't a super solid piece and with slower parts and bits that seem pointless, Dr No is a film I feel is overrated but nevertheless a kind of good one. It can sometimes lack the thrills we expect and I am not sure if that is down to it being a light 60's film, or the writing or directing just screwing it up, anyway it is the film still manages a lot of positive away from such things as thrills and drama that may lack here.Bond fans well, I am not saying you should watch it as it is the best, but you have to see it to call yourself a true fan with most of the things Bond does originating from this film. Those wanting a more dark Bond will still be disappointed and a dark Bond doesn't really come round the corner until way off in 1989, so stay off if you dislike charm and style, and want big bucks guns and effects.Overall I give this a 6\/10 meaning It is Strongly an OK film, near to be being good but just misses out with the criticisms I gave it. It is still a fun film and worth a watch as the story is basic like but serves to let you enjoy it, but don't feel you have to like it because others say so much good stuff about it. On that point to any critics, never feel pressured to rate this lower even if everyone seems to love it, the film is far from flawless.

The following year, also the year of Elizabeth's coronation, Hollywood made a film about a beautiful European princess in her mid-twenties. Coincidence? I think not. Scriptwriter Dalton Trumbo did not quite dare call his heroine Princess Elizabeth, but naming her after the Queen's daughter was a pretty clear hint that he had the British monarchy in mind. The blacklisted Trumbo could not publicly take the credit for his story; his Academy Award officially went to his front-man Ian McLellan Hunter. (The Academy's records were later amended to show Trumbo as the rightful winner). I have, however, always thought it strange that an avowed Communist should have written a film which did so much to popularise the idea of monarchy. It just goes to show how misguided the blacklist was; Hollywood Communists (and Trumbo was far from being the only one) did not have much influence even on the films they worked on, and had very little opportunity to make propaganda for their cause. Princess Anne, heir to the throne of an unspecified European country, arrives in Rome during a goodwill tour of several European capitals. Although the tour consists of little more than carrying out official functions and giving bland, uncontroversial speeches, it has generated tremendous publicity and large numbers of international journalists have been assigned to cover it. Another inspiration for the film may have been the similar rainbow tour carried out by Queen Eva of Argentina in 1947. (OK, I know that Eva Peron was not officially royalty, but the press tended to treat her as though she were). Tired of her regimented schedule and of formal protocol, Anne escapes from her country's embassy and goes missing for twenty-four hours. During her absence she meets Joe Bradley, an American journalist, who at first does not recognise her, and the two enjoy a day of freedom together. Of course, they end up falling in love, seemingly setting us up for a classic romantic comedy ending. Most rom-coms show how a couple overcome some obstacle to their love, and in Hollywood's alternative reality the differences between Anne and Joe in nationality, social class and rank, would count as obstacles, but not insuperable ones. Any scriptwriter worth his salt could have contrived a plot involving Joe marrying into the Royal House of Ruritania (or wherever Anne is from) or Anne renouncing the throne to become Mrs Joseph Bradley of Boston (or wherever Joe is from).Trumbo, however, clearly realised that in the real world of the 1950s a marriage between Anne and Joe would have been most unlikely and wanted to produce something more realistic. So the film ends without a conventionally happy ending; the couple renounce their love for one another, and Joe also renounces something else. As one of only a handful of people who knows the truth about Anne's disappearance he could land a journalistic scoop which would bring him a lot of money and professional recognition. Out of loyalty to her, however, he passes up the opportunity, allowing the authorities to maintain the convenient fiction that Anne's absence was due to a sudden illness. Yet this double renunciation is not presented as a conventionally unhappy ending either. What matters for Anne is her duty to her family and her country, and the implication of the ending is that her glimpse of freedom and of real life, however brief, has given her greater strength to carry out that duty in future. Joe too will be able to take comfort from beautiful memories of his friendship with Anne and the knowledge that he too has done his duty in doing the right thing. Roman Holiday was the film which made a star of Audrey Hepburn. She had already had starring roles in British films, but this was her first American film and the first to bring her to international attention. It also brought her first and only Best Actress Oscar (although in my view it should have been the first of several). Here Audrey shows the qualities which were to make her such an icon over the next fifteen years. Her secret lay not just in her luminous beauty, nor in the way she spoke her lines, nor in her gestures or facial expressions, although these were all important ingredients in her success. She seemed to act not just with her voice, her face or her body but with her whole being; she was not, in the technical sense, a Method actress, but few others had her skill in becoming, not merely representing, the character she was playing. In praising Audrey I should not neglect the others who contributed to the success of this movie. There is her co-star Gregory Peck showing that he could be as effective in comedy as in serious drama; there are some amusing exchanges between Joe and his boss Mr. Hennessy. There is Eddie Albert in an important supporting role as Joe's photographer friend Irving. And then there is the city of Rome itself; the film was shot on location and many of the city's most famous sites (the Coliseum, the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps. etc.) are featured. Budgetary considerations apparently precluded the use of Technicolor, but director William Wyler shows that black-and-white photography could be just as effective in creating a sense of place. The scene in which Peck and Hepburn ride through the streets on a motor-scooter must have done wonders for sales of that particular form of transport. Roman Holiday is essentially a romantic comedy, but it stands out as a more than usually thoughtful and serious one. It also deserves to be remembered for launching the career of one of the greatest stars of all time. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 April 2014","score":"","review":" In 1952 the beautiful 25-year-old Princess Elizabeth became, quite literally overnight, the most famous woman in the world when she acceded to the British throne.

The characters are flat and simple. Gwyneth Paltrow does her job of acting being passionately cute with her gasping duck face looks adoring both poetry and poet. Only the bizarre boy shows through his cruel sense of humor and his sadistic obedience how the general perception of violence in public was in those days. Also the Queen is portrayed in an appealing way demonstrating her absolute power and the stiff and inhuman but yet lively and intelligent moves. The final highlight or climax in unacceptable and most improbable unrealistic reactions is when the husband Lord Wessex sneaks into the theatre just to calm down and watch his wife kissing his rival on stage. To my mind this production is a sugar free and condensed version of Shakespeare that can only survive in entertaining by straining overused strategies of modern American film industry. No match to the original.

But I see no problem with what Mervyn LeRoy did here.Apparently LeRoy saw the play on Broadway and was so taken with it that he brought it to Hollywood with all of the principle actors (Kelly, McCormack, Varden, Croydon, Jones, and Heckart) repeating their stage roles. And in directing the film, he made no attempt to have his actors tone their performances down as he might have done. Stage acting and film acting are very different stage acting is BIG, with the cast working to make sure that everyone in the theatre, from the front row to the last row of the balcony, hears everything. It is not easy. It takes a great deal of training, and this training is on display here in a way that you do not often see in a film. The result is almost the experience of seeing the play in the comfort of your living room.The story is legend by now Rhoda Penmark (nine-year-old Patty McCormack in one of the most chilling performances by a child ever given) is outwardly the picture of the perfect little girl, her dresses immaculate, her pigtails never out of place, her manners perfect to the point of being old-fashioned. But this little girl is an amoral predator who when she wants something is quite willing to kill to get it. The story, however, is really about Rhoda's beleaguered mother Christine (Nancy Kelly in a performance that won her a Tony for the Broadway play). She is not completely ignorant of her daughter's peculiarities when the film begins, but all she has is a vague unease. As the story progresses, she discovers things about Rhoda, and about herself, that lead to a shattering climax.Also in the cast are Eileen Heckart as Hortense Daigle, the grief- stricken, drunken mother of a little boy Rhoda has murdered, Evelyn Varden providing much-needed comic relief as landlady\/busybody\/amateur psychoanalyst Monica Breedlove, who dotes on the little monster and with the best of intentions never has the slightest clue what is really going on in the Penmark household.The whole ensemble is great, but in the end the film belongs to Nancy Kelly and Patty McCormack, who deliver what I consider to be two of the best female performances of 1956.This picture may not be everyone's cup of hemlock. The stagy performances make the experience unique; seasoned theatre goers will probably settle back and revel in it (as I did); film buffs may find it overblown and hard to take. But whether you love it or hate it I dare you to forget it.

I'm talking about WWII, but once you start watching this film you wouldn't be so sure if it really is about a war, a relationship, or fight within a war. This film can't be put in as just one genre because there is just so much different events happening nobody could put just one genre on this film.This classic film gives the viewers everything you can want in a film. The film is mainly filmed at night meaning there is a need for lighting that is practically done perfect for every scene. The acting shows great chemistry between the main couple that really only has chemistry in flashbacks. The photography is done so well for dark scenes and even give you scenes from France that make you feel like your in France while the war is only miles away you feel like your there. This film was done as an A film and I agree that it is and found no problems with the editing or any other part of the film.This film was intended to be a patriotic film, but today people who haven't seen would not know just by knowing the name of the film. This film takes the audience to the safe areas of the war and shows them how everyone in the film is affected by the war. The famous scene done with the two anthems being sung at the same time was done to predict the outcome of the war.

There's no family with estrangements, no couple on the outs, just the fantasy of what might happen if the green aliens we have always wondered about decided to attack Earth and destroy humanity.Along side Close as the president is Jack Nicholson, trying to remain together, but horrified as the crisis grows. Nicholson also plays the seemingly sleazy Las Vegas hotel owner, with Annette Bening as his alcoholic wife who is thrilled by the potential of the Martian's arrival. The closest you get to family crisis is Washington D.C. bus driver Pam Grier's discovery that her teenaged kids are skipping school to play video games and husband Jim Brown's absence as he works in Las Vegas, as well as the Kansas trailer park family of sweet Lukas Haas who is shocked by the sudden taking of one of their own by the Martians.They blew up congress!, grandma Sylvia Sidney laughs, and don't count this old lady out.
