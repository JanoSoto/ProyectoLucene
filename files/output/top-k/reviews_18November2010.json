[{"date":"18 November 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Robin William takes on a very sensitive roll in playing the father and husband who loses both of his children in a accident. Having lost both of my children I was skeptical in watching this movie, but it has made my annual movie list to watch every year. Even though Robin loses his life and that is where this movie really takes off from, he has to deal with problems that he cannot control, or can he. The storyline is entrancing and well filmed. The color is fabulous, and the larger the screen to view this movie on the better it will be. Cuba Gooding Jr. acts as Robin's conscious in the middle of the film until Robin discovers who Cuba' character is actually. Please watch this film with a open mind, and accept what you see take place. Dante's Inferno comes to my mind when Robin has to go to Hell to move on to the next place. I cry every time at the end of the movie because I am happy on how it turns out. Not too many movies can take you full circle and bring you back like this one does. Very intense at times, not for the week of heart.

And feel like. It's bright (the Technicolor is amazing), it's snappy, and it's cheerful. It has bits of humor throughout, and a likable hero who is a little super extra good at everything, and it has a slightly fairy tale quality to it all. That is to say, it's pure entertainment, and good stuff at its best.And so it's a long long way from the 2009 Robin Hood which I only saw parts of, but which takes its violence very seriously, and its hero. This 1938 movie was made a year before the Wizard of Oz (another Technicolor fairy tale) and it dazzles as well as enchants. And even more than that more famous movie, Robin Hood is for kids. Adults can enjoy it, but it struck me as just silly at times.The director, Michael Curtiz, is one of those malleable experts who four years later would make Casablanca, and you might not see any resemblance for good reasons. Except that both are so well made. Four years after that was Mildred Pierce, another masterpiece, and Curtiz again shows his chops. Robin Hood takes full advantage of its stars (Olivia de Havilland being a little miscast in my view but Claude Rains pulling off his own transformation very well), and it pulls out every larger than life tidbit in the Robin Hood legend, which is great stuff. The story, above all, is one we can relate to, fighting evil with wit and panache and a little good bow and arrow work. It even has some of the tropes of a later classic, Seven Samurai, as a band of talented rebels is gathered together one by one to fight the oppressive regimes. Robin Hood ended up just a little too lighthearted for my adult taste, but I know the kid in most of us will enjoy it straight through.

The film was written like a small, offbeat character study loony street-person Robin Williams, who imagines himself to be a medieval knight on a mythical quest, saves Bridges from suicide, and Bridges returns the favor by arranging a date between Williams and the painfully neurotic Amanda Plummer. But Gilliam's absurd, distracting over-direction smothers the already flimsy scenario under an avalanche of inappropriate 'style' fish-eye lenses; whizzing dolly shots; exaggerated camera angles; smoke; steam; and one gratuitous, gory flashback to a bloody mass murder, totally out of place in an otherwise light romantic comedy. Any genuine charm or emotion is lost because the visual scheme is so artificial, and the highly praised, ersatz performance by Robin Williams is little more than undisciplined shtick.
