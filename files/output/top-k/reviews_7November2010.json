Put more simply, there are many Pacino fans, many De Niro fans, I myself am a Bruce Willis and Jackie Chan fan, and I acknowledge the justification for Stallone, Schwarzenegger and even Van-Damme fans. It takes all types to make a world. Don't know too many who proclaim themselves die-hard Mickey D fans though.Well after watching Fatal Attraction for the very first time on the weekend I can say that Douglas was r-o-b-b-e-d of an Oscar for this performance, as acting like Glenn Close really got him fired up is one of the strongest acting jobs in history. Seriously Glenn Close in this film is pug-ugly, this film was released over 20 years ago and she looks more attractive now than she did wayyyy back then, more like Inexplicable Attraction&#x85;&#x85; zzzzzzinggggggg! Nowadays if they remade this film I discussed with my wife just who would play a credible version of Alex that might make a plausible enough threat to a happy hubby. We came up with a few 40 somethings, Aniston, Berry, Hayek and Bullock, and I came up with 100s of 20 somethings and several dozen 30 somethings before my wife told me to stop, more than once as I recall. Surely there must have been a few going around 20 years ago??? But seriously folks, there is a joke that might apply here Q &#x96; What is the difference between a dog and a fox? A &#x96; 8 beers. Glenn Close as Alex is at least an 8 beers with a bottle of scotch chaser, and you'd still regret your poor judgment.I think I have made some sort of point there.Mickey is Dan, a lawyer married to Beth. They have a little girl about 6 called Ellen and a dog called Quincy. All is well in the house, Dan's career seems to be going gangbusters and they are contemplating a big move out of the city into the peace and quiet of the sticks. In Dan's working existence he comes across Alex a couple of times, and when the wife and kid go away from the weekend they share a drink, some frank discussion and afterwards some bodily fluids. Lots of bodily fluids if you're at all interested. (Too much if you ask me.) OK so Dan was drunk and stupid and made a heeeuge lapse in good judgment, (just massive, remember the ugliness?). But for some reason he sobers up and thinks yeah let's do that again. So the next night is spent as nothing less than a date, dancing, drinking and more naked ridiculousness.Dan what were you thinking???...She looks like Courtney Love!...After a bender!!!...So Dan takes the morning walk of shame home, checks in with the wife and hopefully slits his wrists, wait no he doesn't&#x85; Alex calls him, babbles like a baby when he tells her it was just a stupid, stupid, stupid mistake on his part, and get this DAN GOES ON TO COMFORT ALEX! Dan you are married to a nice wife, have a young daughter and Alex is a psycho!! I know to make the movie work she needs to be a bit crackers but surely as the film goes on and she goes from a Level 1 Psycho, up through the levels (I ultimately had her around a 6, one more than the Astronaut with a nappy but one less than Jennifer Lopez on a good day) Dan doesn't have to get stupider? Dan starts as a nice guy and by going back to her he is no less than a Level 4 Idiot himself and is partially responsible for his own predicament.Moving on.The movie is an accurate Choose Your Own Adventure story, only if at the end of every section Dan takes the option that is obviously the most ludicrous.I am sure that there are many crazy women (and men) out there that might go to the bizarre lengths that Alex goes to, (and slitting their wrists in grief after the most brief encounter sounds bizarre to me) but for Dan to take the steps that he takes only aids her wacky crusade, and basically leads him into the situation that he finds himself in.I like a good drama, I like a good thriller, can't say that I am a massive fan of either genre, and not enough to put up with illogical over the top nonsense as this.My moral If you boil the pot of water and give the psycho a rabbit, don't expect a good outcome for the rabbit.Final Rating &#x96; 5.5 \/ 10.

Now that I revisit this some 20 years later I think that perhaps his work also merits the dreaded quirky tag.The film starts with a domestic between a young girl and her Dad, the scene culminates with the Dad keeling over dead of a heart attack.The girl is one of two leads, her name is Maria, she is apparently high school age, is pregnant to the quarterback who she now wants nothing to do with, and not wanted at home as her mother blames her for the death of her dad. She also looks a lot like a duck.The other lead is Matthew, played by Martin Donovan in deadpan mode. He is a marginally psychotic TV repairman who is bullied by his single Dad and carries a grenade around with him.Real people dealing with real issues.There is much more of a plot than Maria and Matthew meet, share their problems and decide to make a go of things together, the action occurs as they progress through and come into contact with the various other characters in the film.No-one seems to get along, Maria's mum hates her, and later Matthew. Matthew's dad hates him, and everyone else it seems. Matthew is an angry loner who hates everyone and everyone hates, which leaves Maria and her unborn child as the victim of a tug of war.Everyone in the film seems to be 5% off-normal, not quite enough to be a caricature, but more than enough that they could all aptly be described as weird (at least) by normal people.In this vein Hartley is like Kevin Smith (really), he puts people that you might almost convince yourself that could exist, and in fact you might know someone who really reminds of one of them, only he fills every role with these one-in-a-million characters, so you have a town full of people that would ordinarily be the nut-job.The dialogue is scripted down to the nth degree, which unfortunately leads to conversations that alternate between snappy and robotic, at times in the same scene. At times it is almost like the characters are starting their response before the other sentence is finished.This film is most notable to me as being the first film I can remember seeing that had a character say the C-word, and a female character at that. If this sounds juvenile it is because when I watched the film I was, so it was a genuine surprise to me to see such a taboo word bandied about in an art house film.Even now that I watch this movie and see that I perhaps was looking at my memories with rose coloured glasses, there are moments that are both calculated that still have an impact, you know that the director is trying to scream this is important and want to ignore it but it still works.Like a good sad ballad, you know it is simply trying to manipulate your emotions, but turn off the lights and crank it loud and you can't help but caught up in it. Only Trust is a 90+ minute movie, it's hard to be swept along for that long when everything is so mechanical.Final Rating - 6.5 - 10.

Reading some of the reviews of people who were less than impressed with it, I can see many of their objections as valid. The film is very long. The script is sometimes inchoate, incoherent, and clichéd. The pace lulls you, then yanks you forward. Some plot points are certainly in the realm of coincidence,and the ending is very ambiguous.But the film becomes a country in your mind. The slow start allows you to know these people in the most intimate way. If the script is clumsy and clichéd, it is because the characters are small town people, not adept at tossing off bon mots, and their own experience of movies informs how they express themselves, in ways that are no less sincere for being derivative.The disjointed pacing makes the viewer struggle to follow the story, experiencing the same dislocation and alienation as the three men. And coincidence does happen in life, which is what makes life remarkable.( Charles Dickens used coincidence continuously to great effect!)I think the Cimino's genius in this film was casting superb actors, and giving them the opportunity to breathe in these roles. He shot tons of coverage, and you have the impression that the actors lived, breathed and dreamed in character. Their commitment to the characters they inhabit bridge the gap created by a less than perfect screenplay--in fact it makes you feel that every second in this long, lurching movie is absolutely inevitable, totally right and completely necessary to a proper understanding of these people.In fact, the spare script is a simply a vessel that holds these burning performances, and allows the actors room to live in the film. I had the same feeling after the first time I saw this film, as I did with Manon of the Spring, that I had known these people all my life. They take up a very large place in my psyche.

There is a little humour, tremendous inventive action sequences, booby traps, treachery, treasure and of course creepy crawlies.We also get to follow the expedition for a good three minutes and try to gather exactly what is happening before we even see Indy himself.It is pre WW2, and Indiana Jones is hunting, as always (although we don't know that yet) for lost artifacts and relics that he wants to donate to museums and keep out of the clutches of evil-doers who only want the items to finance nefarious doings.This initial sequence has him tip-toeing through the various traps and pitfalls in order to claim a golden figurine from the centre of a room. It seems that if you have an extremely valuable golden figurine and feel that you must go to the trouble of rigging booby traps and indeed a massive self destruct trigger you might be better served spending the same amount of time hiding the figure instead. Saves you time, money and having to rebuild the whole cave system in the event of a failed treasure hunt.Imagine how p*ssed the natives would be if the figure was simply knocked over by a rat or a bird? Whether Indy gets the item he seeks or not is seldom important, it is the ride that matters, in this case though he fails.Back on US soil we meet the Monday &#x96; Friday Indiana Jones, a very popular college professor of archaeology who is admired by his students, and consulted for his expertise by various parties.In this case it is the army that comes calling, asking for advice regarding an intercepted German communiqué. Apparently Hitler himself has commissioned a hunt for the Ark of the Covenant, and has found the area where it is thought to be located.Of course, Indy agrees to check things out for himself, and with his close friend Marcus, played by Denholm Elliott along for the rise he almost immediately sets off.Here we meet another oft-copied Indy signature, the overlay of a map showing exactly where on the globe Indiana is headed, this helps give a better impression of the vastness of some of his travels and the extent that he goes to to achieve his aims. Initially he heads to Nepal, as a vital piece of equipment that will aid him in his hunt is conveniently located there, even more convenient is the fact that it is held by an ex-girlfriend of his in a seedy bar that she runs herself, her name is Marion (Karen Allen).Marion herself is another strength of the movie, she is spirited and spunky without ever being sexy, and is often in need of help without ever simply being helpless herself.After an uncomfortable hello and the obligatory action sequence Marion decides to tag along, and when I say decides she doesn't have too much alternative as her bar has been razed to the ground. If there is a lesson to be learned from this it is that hanging around Indiana Jones does tend to put you and the things you own in peril.Once the action moves to Cairo the pace of the action steps up another notch as Indiana comes into closer proximity to the naughty Nazis, who being the bad guys will stop at no lengths to get what they want. They have been making slow progress in their search but the arrival of Indiana inadvertently helps them along.We have now met all the key characters in the film, and the final hour or so is simply masterful. In set piece after set piece the audience can hardly pause for breath, each new drama finds Indiana in more and more peril, and brings him closer to his goal but equally finds him also closer to losing everything.The pacing of this film is just great, the action barely relents and important plot events aren't simply introduced in between in expositional conversation, but they unfold as part of the action in a logical manner. You can watch the film with your brain shut off and simply go wow at all the pretty colours and explosions, but Raiders is a little deeper than just mindless action and rewards are had for paying attention.The film is a little scary and violent enough in a PG 13 way that action fans won't be yawning, each death causes consequences that either bring more characters into play, or trigger other events that must be dealt with.Being that it is an 80s film there are some terrific stunts that happen throughout the film, Indy's trademark hat is especially handy in this case as it camouflages the stuntman's face from the screen in the more dangerous bits.Running your eyes down the page should show just why this is almost the perfect action film stunts, humour, action, danger, Nazis, a hat! What more could you ask for? Two sequels is my only answer.Unfortunately we got three.Too many directors now aim to make epic films, in the 80s it was enough to have a movie with a beginning, middle and end, and not bother with red herrings, unnecessary twists or gratuitous violence.Sometimes fun is enough.Final Rating &#x96; 9.0 \/ 10.

Yes, even though I am 17 years old I did not go to the movie theater until I was nine years old. Now that I have that out of the way let me review this scooby-tastic film! This film is definitely not like the original cartoon as you will notice about 10 minutes into the film. For this movie to even have a great plot the character's personality had to have been expanded, which is what the film makers did. Some of the things they added I liked, some I did not. I did not care for Daphne's stuck up attitude and I really thought it was strange for her to be a kung-fu master. The scene where she fought that Spanish wrestler was just over-the-top nonsense. Fred, Velma, Scooby, and Shaggy were cool. So really Daphne was the only one they actually kinda screwed up on. I thought the Shaggy\/Scooby fart and belch scene was extremely awkward and now that I am older I find it extremely unnecessary. I believe they really did a great job at making Scrappy both hatable and a little sorry for at the same time.THE GOOD 1) The fact that a Scooby-Doo movie was actually brought to the big screen and it wasn't bad.2) The character development (besides maybe Daphne) 3) the choice of having Matthew Lillard play Shaggy.4) Scooby-Doo as a character was nicely developed.5) The costume design was excellent.6) The soundtrack and score was terrific.7) It had a surprisingly nice plot, certainly not the best, but it was alright.THE BAD 1) perhaps the choice of Sarah Michelle Gellar for the role of Daphne was not the best choice.2) Freddie Prince Jr. was great, but again, perhaps their was a better choice.3) The Scooby\/Shaggy belch and fart scene.4) Daphne was annoying and the kung-fu was extremely painful to watch.5) It could have been better ENDING STATEMENTS There are probably some other things I could mention or add if I re-watched the film. As of now this is all I have to work with.The movie was good. I enjoyed it and I do believe that is underrated.

Yes, even though I am 17 years old I did not go to the movie theater until I was nine years old. Now that I have that out of the way let me review this scooby-tastic film! This film is definitely not like the original cartoon as you will notice about 10 minutes into the film. For this movie to even have a great plot the character's personality had to have been expanded, which is what the film makers did. Some of the things they added I liked, some I did not.

Initially the boy, played by Fred Savage in his other role. The story revolves around a romance between a young farmhand named Westley and a young woman named Buttercup, who with a name like that was always going to be a fairytale character, or a stripper.So being a fairytale Westley is taken by a notorious pirate named the Dread Pirate Roberts, presumed dead. This depresses Buttercup somewhat, who has only recently decided that he is eternally in love with the boy, and she had decided to marry him.Buttercup is thereafter kidnapped by a trio of kid's movie-awesome, Fizzick, Vizzini and Inigo Montoya. Fizzick is the mostest awesome Andre the Giant, now deceased. I am not sure if he tried to be funny or just deadpanned his way to eternal coolness, but either way he is hilarious in this from the first line he utters until the last. Inigo Montoya is also supercool and has possibly the most honourable and single minded quest in film history, and even Vizzini, the weasely self-dubbed genius who masterminds the kidnapping operation.So after this set up rather than worry about putting events in order, I thought I'd list a grab-bag of the noteworthy events and scenes that face Westley, Buttercup and the gang- Shrieking eels. - Left handed sword fights - Vengeance - Death by poisoning - Quicksand - Killer giant rats - Torture - WWF wrestlers in Robin Hood style outfits - A six fingered man - Vendettas - Being revived from the dead.And furthermore, this film has a myriad of quotable lines that hold up after watching the film time and time again, not least of which is Inconthievable, (should be inconceivable but must be said with a lithp).So to summarise I heartily recommend that even the cynical among you take a break from torture porn (hopefully only watching it) and pointless movie clichés, and watch a kid's movie where the finale simply involves; storming a castle, stopping a wedding, saving the damsel, avenging a father's death, reviving the dead and finding twoo wuv!You might even enjoy it.Final Rating &#x96; 8.5 \/ 10.

Robert De Niro plays the White House equivalent of Mr Wolf from Pulp Fiction Conrad Brean, his role is to bluff the media for just long enough to get past the election, where the President (never seen in the film) had a massive lead in the polls at least before the incident.De Niro and his team never pretend the President didn't commit the act - only that they must cover it up - so Brean decides that the public will only be sufficiently be distracted by a misdemeanor this large by an even larger situation. So Brean and his team consult with a Hollywood producer, Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to see that they get one. They do this by spreading rumours through various sources that the US security has been threatened by another country, in this case Albania, and that America must band together to ward off this enemy.This comes as a surprise to Albania of course as no such peril exists, but I guess that for a film such as this an element of farce is required.Wag the Dog is never especially funny, there are a few chuckles to be had but the main pleasure is derived from some fairly smart dialogue and how the large team that is ultimately amassed deals with inconvenience and developments that aren't in their favour. Of course being a movie nothing runs smoothly, the CIA and the opposition party see to that, but it is how Motss and Brean adapt and react that provides the interest.Motss is initially reluctant to help, given that he won't get any public credit regardless of how the ploy works, but as things develop his relentless positivity is pretty amusing, it doesn't matter how bad things look, he is still there saying This is nothing! and coming up with yet another counter-move.De Niro plays the straight man for much of the film to Hoffman's egotistical Hollywood bigwig, but you sense he is not a man to be messed with and will do anything to make sure that his side wins.As the credits were initially rolling my wife said something along the lines of Wow, everyone is in this, and indeed the cast does boast Kirstin Dunst, Denis Leary, William H Macy and Woody Harrelson, as well as Anne Heche as Brean's loyal yet seemingly a little naive aide.The final third of the film contains some plot points that seem a little bit too extreme even for a satire such as this, especially given the intricate planning and attention to detail given to early situations, but overall what I went away thinking was well that seemed way over the top, but no more than the Lewinsky scandal, and in my mind that is probably the most scary part.Stuff like this probably goes on in America way more than we realise, and that we as the global public probably believe way more of what we are told than we should at times.Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 \/ 10.

Of course being a movie nothing runs smoothly, the CIA and the opposition party see to that, but it is how Motss and Brean adapt and react that provides the interest.Motss is initially reluctant to help, given that he won't get any public credit regardless of how the ploy works, but as things develop his relentless positivity is pretty amusing, it doesn't matter how bad things look, he is still there saying This is nothing! and coming up with yet another counter-move.De Niro plays the straight man for much of the film to Hoffman's egotistical Hollywood bigwig, but you sense he is not a man to be messed with and will do anything to make sure that his side wins.As the credits were initially rolling my wife said something along the lines of Wow, everyone is in this, and indeed the cast does boast Kirstin Dunst, Denis Leary, William H Macy and Woody Harrelson, as well as Anne Heche as Brean's loyal yet seemingly a little naive aide.The final third of the film contains some plot points that seem a little bit too extreme even for a satire such as this, especially given the intricate planning and attention to detail given to early situations, but overall what I went away thinking was well that seemed way over the top, but no more than the Lewinsky scandal, and in my mind that is probably the most scary part.Stuff like this probably goes on in America way more than we realise, and that we as the global public probably believe way more of what we are told than we should at times.Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 \/ 10. OK as a film, this is more a necessary reminder to us all not to believe everything that we hear in the media. (Though while we live in a society that believes that the Osbornes, the Kardashians and Paris Hilton really live like they do on TV this seems a pointless reminder.)

Leone co-wrote the screenplay with Sergio Donati, while the story was provided by Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci. Ennio Morricone scores the music and cinematography is from Tonino Delli Colli.After finishing The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in 1966, Sergio Leone felt he had done all he wanted to do with the Western genre. Thankfully that wasn't to be the case as he was lured back into Oaterville to make the unique and quite superb C'era una volta il West in 1968. Greeted with negative reviews on its release in America, it was a financial flop. But in Europe the film was richly received and took the box offices by storm. Time has showed the film to have risen above cult status to be widely acknowledged as one of the finest Western film's of all time.Everything about the film is bigger and bolder than previous Leone works. Opening with an almost silent ten minute sequence that has become legendary, the film follows four characters as they dovetail towards the reckoning. Harmonica (Bronson), Frank (Fonda), Jill McBain (Cardinale) & Cheyenne (Robards), all linked by death, and with each one represented in the narrative by a piece of music. Leone clinically weaves the four stories into one operatic whole. Not all of it makes perfect sense, which stops it being the masterpiece many consider it being. But its observations of Western mysticism, capitalism and progression of time; and with scores to of course be settled too, it makes for a fine story nestling in amongst the beautiful treats for the eyes and ears.While Leone clearly homages the genre and pays tribute to the old America (you will lose count spotting the Western film steals), his film is ultimately very much a pastiche piece. But he gets away with that lack of freshness (the story at the core mirrors Johnny Guitar for example) due to the unique structure. It's meticulously paced as the characters are fleshed out to the max, sometimes even without dialogue. Smart directing as Leone makes the story more richer and weightier in substance. Morricone's score is magnificent and so is Colli's photography, with the latter's shooting of Monument Valley good enough to have featured in John Ford oeuvre. While the casting is inspiring, notably Fonda as a villain (the impact shocked many back in the day).I can't call it a masterpiece because it does lift from many other sources, but it's darn close to being a perfect movie. One thing is for sure, that in it's uncut form the film is a work of art.

I liked the sister since she was so darned cute in that Tedesco Bruce Willis movie. Caviezel was perfect-- playing a whole hour and a half while still being not too sympathetic so we can hate him at the end. What is less than stunning is the plot. Yeah its tired and hackneyed, but the real crime is the twist at the end. Well, it really is not a twist, its some FSF (film school fuc&s*) who decided it would be cool to screw everyone's head. That is the only reason to do this in a movie, to giggle and show complete contempt for the audience. There may be cocaine abuse involved-- chop chop chop snooooooort--- and yeah man, lets make so he really did it. I think it was just so plotlistically bankrupt that they felt that they had to do something really dramatically stupid for the ending. A twist would OK, we like twists. let's see what's a good twist-- maybe Morgan and a couple Marines are gay? Or have the sister cheating with Ashley Judd's husband before he goes to jail, and its a big drama deal, and Ashley forgives him, and then she has the baby and its black. That would be a nice twist. Morgan, you dog.So when a plot sucks this bad but the acting is brilliant, a good editor might be able to restructure the movie but it surely could have been saved with a couple weeks of re-shoots. OK, I hate that Caveziel guy, so lets have him be an abusive husband and she wants to get a divorce, but he has some hold on her. So lets have her frame him for the crime, and then her boss at the high-tone law firm finds out she did this to get a divorce, and we are all worried for her, but the twist at the end is that this is why they make her a partner, since after all, lawyers are fun to call scumbags. We need that sister in the flick, she is so darn perky, so lets have Morgan get it on with her. After all, he doesn't get to chain up Christina Ricci like Samuel Jackson did, so we need something to get him to agree to the re-shoots.So Cavaziel ends up the schmuck, maybe a cuckolded schmuck, Morgan and the sister do a nice interracial soft-porn featurette, and the female lead reaffirms our shared hatred of the legal profession.

Unlike those films, there is an actual weight to the drama here and some of the ingenuity of classic Disney, owing perhaps to the presence of younger and more driven animators making their debuts as animation directors. Such drive can't quite undo the mixed quality of the animation and the kind of pussying out that keeps it from quite working, but one can understand why it's considered a minor classic from Disney's work.I don't much care for it myself, but I do have to commend Disney for actually taking some risks on this one. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor show some real chemistry as voice actors and make a likable pair, but it's the Penny story that lifts this. There's real Dickensian gravitas to her conflict with Madame Medusa, and a melancholy that even older Disney may not have attempted to accomplish. If Penny can be cloying at times, she's still fairly convincing as a character. Madame Medusa, though a retread of Cruella de Vil, still works thanks to Geraldine Page's performance and Milt Kahl's masterfully bombastic animation (an attempt to one-up his friend Marc Davis, who handled Cruella). There are some tools here for a very entertaining adventure story.Where it falls flat is in the execution. The narrative meanders to an irritating degree, hurling itself at red herrings too much and taking a much longer time than it needs to progress. Very few of the side characters are all that memorable, aside from Ollie Johnston's self caricature as Rufus the Cat. This is probably the slowest Disney film since Fantasia as a result, and not nearly as hypnotic. It also doesn't help that, for all its moody atmospherics, it insists on lightening the mood at the times when it could potentially be at its most ballsy. Medusa pointing a gun at a small child is pretty damn risky for a Disney picture, but thrills turn to insults as she's subsequently besieged by a group of cartoon critters. It's a real shame, as none of these problems are appalling on their own but pile up too much.In terms of animation, this one is a major step up from Robin Hood, but still suffers from the studio's cost-cutting tendencies of the time. The dark bayou backgrounds have a lovely Gothic quality to them, but in general the color design here is dull and never rises above your typical Scooby Doo episode. The mice have jarring flesh colored eyes which echo far too much of latter day Hanna-Barbera dreck. As for key animation, this was a landmark for Disney in that it marked the debut of a non-9 Old Men animator in a directing role. This artist was none other than the infamous Don Bluth, whose influence can be felt throughout the project. He's often credited with doing away with such irritating practices as dividing the different departments with no collaboration amongst them, and I wouldn't be surprised if he had a lot to do with the darker tone of this film. As for his animation, he shows a talent for hyperactive set pieces, such as the Zoo scene (which is a superfluous and stupid sequence otherwise) but also holds responsibility for the airport scene, with some of the most awkward rotoscoping outside of a Ralph Bakshi movie.

At first sight this plot might appear to have been inspired by the killing of President Kennedy, but in fact the film came out in 1962, a year before the assassination.The assassin is Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw, the stepson of a leading Senator and the winner of the Medal of Honor. Shaw won the medal during the Korean War, where he saved the lives of several members of his platoon in combat. Or so it is believed. In fact, the entire platoon was captured by Communist forces, taken to a secret Chinese base in Manchuria where they were brainwashed and false memories implant in their minds. The soldiers were then secretly returned to the American lines, unaware of their ordeal and believing Shaw was responsible for saving them.The film was made at the height of the Cold War- it was released at the time of the Cuban missile crisis- and its politics are firmly anti-Communist. Its political message, however, is put over by means of a clever twist. In the early scenes, it seems more like an anti-anti-Communist satire. It initially seems obvious that Shaw's stepfather, Senator John Iselin, is intended as a satirical portrait of Joseph McCarthy. Iselin appears to be a ranting buffoon, obsessed with a supposed Communist conspiracy to infiltrate the US Defense Department, although he can never remember exactly how many card-carrying Communists are supposed to work there. (He eventually settles on 57, taking that number from a bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup). Iselin's political opponent, Senator Thomas Jordan, is portrayed as a decent liberal, concerned to defend civil liberties and the Constitution. Interestingly, Iselin and Jordan appear to be members of the same party, although it is never made clear whether they are Republicans or Democrats. Jordan's daughter Jocelyn also plays a role as Shaw's love-interest.The film, however, actually supports the basic McCarthyite assumption that the Communists are conspiring to infiltrate America's political establishment. The twist is that Iselin and his wife Eleanor are actually the leading lights in that conspiracy, of which the assassination plot is a key part, and his anti-Communist rhetoric is simply a front to hide his true affiliations. Even Jordan, who sees Iselin as a neo-fascist demagogue, does not realise the true situation.The real hero of the film is not Jordan but Major Bennett Marco, Shaw's former platoon commander in Korea. Marco was one of the brainwashed soldiers, and it was his recommendation which was responsible for Shaw winning the Medal of Honor. Following a series of nightmares, however, Marco, who now works for Army Intelligence, becomes suspicious of the whole affair, and begins his own investigations to uncover the truth.The film has a couple of flaws. The odd sub-plot involving Janet Leigh's character Eugenie seems not only unnecessary but also practically incomprehensible. Perhaps the producers felt they needed a big-name female star. (In 1962 Angela Lansbury was largely though of as a character actress). The character of Dr. Yen Lo, the Chinese head of the brainwashing programme, is uncomfortably close to the racist Fu Manchu stereotype of the fiendish Oriental villain.Those, however, would be my only criticisms. Overall, this was a film I greatly enjoyed. It features three excellent performances- from Frank Sinatra as the dogged Marco, Lansbury as the monstrous, domineering, power-crazed Eleanor who aims to dominate her son, her husband and ultimately the whole country, and Laurence Harvey as Shaw. As in many of her films, Lansbury plays a character considerably older than her real age. (She was only 37 in 1962, only three years older than Harvey who plays her son). Before I saw this film I normally thought of her as a niche actress specialising in elderly female detectives like Jessica Fletcher in the Murder She Wrote series or Miss Marple in The Mirror Crack'd, but here she takes on a dramatic role of great power. (She was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress).Harvey was an actor who never really achieved the international stardom that was at one time predicted for him, but he did make at least two excellent films, this one and Room at the Top from four years earlier. His Shaw is a cold, unsociable character, uneasy with the public adulation he receives after his supposed act of heroism, and even more uneasy with his position as a member of one of America's leading political families. (He detests both his mother and his stepfather). Although Shaw is not in himself evil, it is all too easy to see Harvey's character as a mindless, brainwashed killer.Apart from the acting, what makes The Manchurian Candidate so watchable is its strange, creepy atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion. Although the film is anti-Communist, that does not necessarily mean that it is right-wing. (Its director John Frankenheimer had a reputation as something of a liberal). Its hero is the little man, working outside the system. (Marco's suspicions initially receive no support from his superiors at Army Intelligence). The message, perhaps, is not to trust anyone political, be they Communists or Washington insiders. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The central idea behind The Manchurian Candidate is that a former American serviceman has been brainwashed to assassinate a leading political figure.

But Brigitte Helm is attractive in a 1920s way, and there are a couple of scenes involving the False Maria that are rather sexy.It's impossible to predict how someone else might respond to Metropolis.

After the latter he started making more international films with French and American cast. In 1977 Wenders did his international breakthrough with The American Friend starring Bruno Ganz and Dennis Hopper. After seven years he made Paris, Texas which is usually considered to be his greatest achievement. If these two films represented his international - American period - Wings of Desire meant a return to his home country Germany. Wim Wenders always has made two kind of films; films with a direct script (Paris, Texas) and also films which have no script at all in the beginning (Wings of Desire). The script builds up during the filming and this style was familiar for Wim Wenders from Im Lauf Der Zeit (1976), whose script got written during the road the characters drove.Wings of Desire meant the return to Germany for Wim Wenders and he has said that The film couldn't have taken place in anywhere else but Berlin. It is the only city where one can realize what it mean to be German. The history of it is so emotionally and physically present. Wings of Desire is a film about Berlin and history. It deals with a common theme for Wenders; one has to come to terms with one's past to accept one's present which he already brilliantly showed in Im Lauf Der Zeit but in Wings of Desire he has taken this theme to another level.One cannot miss the connection between Frank Capra's classic It's a Wonderful Life and Wings of Desire. In Capra's film the angels have to earn their wings by lending a helping hand for desperate people; one angel saves the character of James Stewart by showing what life would be like without him. In Wings of Desire the angels are depressed from listening all the worries of desperate people and one angel, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) gets tired of earning his wings. He wants to feel the emotions of common man; pain, love, sadness and happiness.Berlin is perhaps the most important milieu of European history; its place in between of the east and the west, but for Wenders even more interesting is its place in between of past and present. The city has truly suckled the history to itself. Berlin could've easily been the gorgeous central of Europe, but unfortunately got divided by the horrible concrete wall. Wings of Desire describes Berlin of 1987, but also in the early 1940's - a film within a film side plot. It's clearly structured around certain eras and that's why it could be an antithesis for Wenders' timeless masterpiece Paris, Texas.Wings of Desire is both an essay and a romantic love story. It's a story told by an angel tired of earning its wings. It's a film about two angels Damien and Cassiel, who guard above Berlin and lend a helping hand for desperate people, lonely seniors, unemployed and angry wives. The people they help all ask the same questions, the same ontological riddles. It is no coincidence that the library seems to be an essential place for both the angels and the people in Berlin - it means once again a clue to the theme of coming to the terms with one's past. People read history books, while the angels help the loneliest ones the library means a concrete figure of history - it's a constant reminder of the history that will always be present.An elderly man teaches Damien the wonders of secular life; and instantly he falls in love with an aerialist. All the regular people are angels for Damien but they cannot see him. He has to turn into a regular human being to be in love. Usually in films the use of colored and black-and-white scenes are used to divide flashbacks from present but the chose Wim Wenders has done in Wings of Desire is astonishing, beautiful and sentimental.Wings of Desire is like a huge mural, if there is such a thing as Louvre syndrome, there could just as easily be a Wings of Desire syndrome. It's a huge painting which is a reflection of its time. It's a film made just a few years before the Wall was dismantled.

It's a film about two angels Damien and Cassiel, who guard above Berlin and lend a helping hand for desperate people, lonely seniors, unemployed and angry wives. The people they help all ask the same questions, the same ontological riddles. It is no coincidence that the library seems to be an essential place for both the angels and the people in Berlin - it means once again a clue to the theme of coming to the terms with one's past. People read history books, while the angels help the loneliest ones the library means a concrete figure of history - it's a constant reminder of the history that will always be present.An elderly man teaches Damien the wonders of secular life; and instantly he falls in love with an aerialist. All the regular people are angels for Damien but they cannot see him. He has to turn into a regular human being to be in love. Usually in films the use of colored and black-and-white scenes are used to divide flashbacks from present but the chose Wim Wenders has done in Wings of Desire is astonishing, beautiful and sentimental.Wings of Desire is like a huge mural, if there is such a thing as Louvre syndrome, there could just as easily be a Wings of Desire syndrome. It's a huge painting which is a reflection of its time. It's a film made just a few years before the Wall was dismantled. It might just be the most challenging film by Wim Wenders and a film one can watch more than ten times and getting something new out of it on each view. It's an unforgettable angel tale, a deep film about loneliness and the lack of love that can actually change lives.

There, I said it. So complain all you want about how people these days have ridiculously short attention spans - yes, I am not beyond turning my brain off for an hour or two in order to enjoy a movie.However, I also enjoy watching movies that are original, or thought provoking, or character driven, or plot-centered. While the Bourne Identity was plot-centered, it certainly wasn't the other three. It was a failure as both a deep movie AND a brainless action flick.There were no exciting special effects, few explosions, and few fight sequences - all of which could be forgiven (easily!) if the characters were even remotely interesting. I've never seen a Matt Damon movie before, and his performance here didn't make me want to go out and see more of him. Because we know basically from the beginning what happened to him (based on the scenes with the CIA agents), I didn't care at all about his character, either. Franka Potente was all right I suppose, but Marie wasn't written in a way that made me care about her, either. I rolled my eyes at the obligatory kissss meeee scene; I knew it was going to happen eventually, but it was so drawn out and lacking in chemistry.And also - just when it starts to get interesting, when he finds out he's a government project or whatever - it just ends. After all that pointless running around and hiding and Marie, just go! This life isn't good for you!, we don't even delve into what probably would have been the most interesting aspect of the storyline. I suppose in the sequels we learn more about whatever it is they did to him to make him a superspy, but I don't care enough to find out. I only sat through this movie because I was watching it with other people; otherwise, I would have turned it off long before it reached its end.
