Scary Movie was pointless and stupid, There's Something About Mary was too gross at some points to get over, and American Pie is suicide inducing. But this movie breaks the mold in such a big way. It was so funny I saw it three times in the theaters all in 2 weeks. The characters of Jay and Bob deserve their own movie, because they have been the added bonus of Kevin Smith's previous 4 films. Jason Mewes shows his great talent for comedy and really brings Jay to life. Every class in high school has one of those kids who is vulgar as anything, and not afraid to say whatever he's thinking at any moment, that is Jay in a nutshell. Line after line of his vulgar, sexist, New Jersey dialog was hilarious. And Silent Bob was there to bring hilarious silent comedy to the table. The film also makes a great satire of Hollywood, and brings the entire View Askew universe together. My only complaint, other than Will Ferrel, is that this is the last movie we will be seeing with Jay & Bob in it, right when we can all revel in what glorious characters they are. But this film does them so much justice. I recommend it to everyone with a real sense of humor.

As with many movies, especially low budget cult movies, there is always room for improvement. As the saying goes, however, hindsight is always 20\/20. The film was dark and contained a brooding (though primitive) soundtrack based on repeditive percussive beats, matching the systematic mechanical nature of the machines which were the 'enemy' of the film.Many SF readers may be familiar with Asimovs three laws of robotics- 1. A robot must not harm or by inaction allow harm to come to a human. 2. A robot must obey all orders given by humans, unless these contradict the first law. 3. A robot must protect itself from harm unless this contradicts the second and first laws, in order of priority.Many of Asimovs stories were based around both the single mindedness of the robots, and their potential danger when these laws were not installed within them. The Terminator allows the viewer to experience a robot governed by totally different laws, of which, protecting and serving humans is DEFINANTLY NOT one of them. It opened the prospect of artificial intelligence emerging on an unprepared and undereducated world, and developing its own motives and desires, and deciding that human beings are an impedement to these desires (See Terminator 2 for an explanation of these desires - when you hear it, you almost feel sorry for SkyNet, the supercomputer which creates the terminator).Arnold Schwarzenegger has become much more accomplised as an actor over the years, and is quite reasonable now (see the Sixth Day). However, back then, he was quite stiff. This fit the role of an awkward, aggressive robot extremely well, especially with that intimidating scowl permanently fixed upon his face. His then strong Austrian accent, does not impede his performance, but actually seems to enhance it in some sort of subliminal way. Perhaps watching all the old war movies where the Germans were the baddies (the Nazi elite etc...), has something to do with this.The prospects of a Terminator 3 bring me a lot of hope, however I expect a lot of disappointment after discovering who the scriptwriters were. Any computer user will puke when they've seen 'The Net' - one of their 'acclaimed' works. Perhaps a wait of five years and a REMAKE of the first would be more appropriate. It might open the avenue to another tough guy actor playing the Terminator. Let's face it - Arnolds not getting any younger especially with the heart troubles and there's nothing sadder than an aging muscleman.The film, at first, appears to be a tough guy film, especially with the overbuild '4 wheel drive' physique of the younger Arnold Schwarzenegger appearing at the start of the film. Whether it was intentional or not, James Cameron did the film credit by slowly revealing the nature of the Terminator (Arnolds role) as not a tough guy villain, but a very dangerous mechanical device with a totally narrow minded intent to kill the heroine of the movie, Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton). This leads to the end where, the terminator, stripped of its outer covering of cloned flesh, is revealed to be the warmachine it is. The metal skeleton covered with hydraulic muscles is an artistic masterpiece. The scene in the factory, although done with basic stop frame animation, was the one which most impressed me. This would look fantastic if done by computer animation, and lets hope a remake will be made.The second movie, although very imaginative in parts, was disappointing in terms of script (though not in action and visual effects). There were many recycled themes from the first, such as the tanker chase, the mimicking to Sarahs mother\/John Connors Foster mother. There are many more similarities which I'm sure you'll find. James Cameron is an imaginative director, and I think he could have done much better. Why couldn't the T-1000 have a more complex role? For example, instead of going gung-ho for little John Connor, it could in secret, construct terminators in the present time and send them after the Connors one by one.The character change of Sarah Connor from the first movie to the second was a little unsettling, although novel at the first appearance. I didn't find the fact that she had turned into a hardlined semi-sane dragon woman very believable, after the performance of the vulnerable young woman she gave in the first.Like I say, I don't expect much from T3, although, with some better scriptwriters, or some advice from some accomplished science fiction writers (say, Steven Baxter, Arthur C. Clarke, Poul Anderson), a very clever plot could make up for the shortcoming of making a sequel of a sequel. I hope I am pleasantly surprised. After all Aliens (by James Cameron as well) was an excellent sequel to Alien, although not quite as good.

Let's breakdown his career He directs music videos (most notably, Gangsta's Paradise) then he gets tapped to do an American version of the Hong Kong action film.  The Replacement Killers was alright, I suppose, but it certainly didn't live up to its predecessors.  Then he gets stuck directing a movie with Jamie Foxx in the lead.  That had disaster written all over it (Jamie Foxx is absolutely great in supporting roles).  But with Bait, you really could tell that Fuqua had talent, even if the material wasn't good.  But now, with Training Day, he's given a prime opportunity to show us what he's made of.  And it's clear that he's got a good career ahead of him.This movie is a real treat in this time of what seems to be one bad movie after another.  It's very funny at parts, but not to the point where it's a comedy that gets all serious at the end.  Denzel is, of course, great.  I really don't understand why people keep making a big deal out of his performance though.  Sure, it's the first time he's played a bad guy, but I honestly can't think of one time when he's given a bad performance.  He's always great, so this shouldn't be a surprise.  What is a surprise is Ethan Hawke.  For once he's not playing the brooding, misunderstood guy.  He plays this one like it should be and that was the big acting surprise (not seeing Dr. Dre as a cop).Normally, when a movie has a revelation towards the end, it changes your whole viewpoint on what happened earlier.  But, without giving away anything, with this movie, it just makes you uneasy about the events that are to come.  I've also read a few people talking about how the very end is a little hard to swallow.  It makes perfect sense if you really paid attention to the rest of the movie.  And I'm not talking about if you blink, you miss the key point of information.  This film is about setting a certain mood and state of mind.  Both from the director and from the characters.  If you let yourself get into it, the whole movie is a really great experience.Like I said before, this movie is very funny.  But the action in it is some of the best in a while too.  It's not all about special effects and messing with your visual perspective.  Most of the action is shot in a way that allows you to follow it from start to finish.I loved the cameos too Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Macy Gray, Tom Berenger, and that guy who played Redbud in The Usual Suspects.  They were fun, but not distracting.  Overall, I guess the movie does have it's flaws; it does seem to drag a little in parts.  But it is still a great movie worth watching.

The Replacement Killers was alright, I suppose, but it certainly didn't live up to its predecessors.  Then he gets stuck directing a movie with Jamie Foxx in the lead.  That had disaster written all over it (Jamie Foxx is absolutely great in supporting roles).  But with Bait, you really could tell that Fuqua had talent, even if the material wasn't good.  But now, with Training Day, he's given a prime opportunity to show us what he's made of.  And it's clear that he's got a good career ahead of him.This movie is a real treat in this time of what seems to be one bad movie after another.  It's very funny at parts, but not to the point where it's a comedy that gets all serious at the end.  Denzel is, of course, great.  I really don't understand why people keep making a big deal out of his performance though.  Sure, it's the first time he's played a bad guy, but I honestly can't think of one time when he's given a bad performance.  He's always great, so this shouldn't be a surprise.  What is a surprise is Ethan Hawke.  For once he's not playing the brooding, misunderstood guy.  He plays this one like it should be and that was the big acting surprise (not seeing Dr. Dre as a cop).Normally, when a movie has a revelation towards the end, it changes your whole viewpoint on what happened earlier.  But, without giving away anything, with this movie, it just makes you uneasy about the events that are to come.  I've also read a few people talking about how the very end is a little hard to swallow.  It makes perfect sense if you really paid attention to the rest of the movie.  And I'm not talking about if you blink, you miss the key point of information.  This film is about setting a certain mood and state of mind.  Both from the director and from the characters.  If you let yourself get into it, the whole movie is a really great experience.Like I said before, this movie is very funny.  But the action in it is some of the best in a while too.  It's not all about special effects and messing with your visual perspective.  Most of the action is shot in a way that allows you to follow it from start to finish.I loved the cameos too Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Macy Gray, Tom Berenger, and that guy who played Redbud in The Usual Suspects.  They were fun, but not distracting.  Overall, I guess the movie does have it's flaws; it does seem to drag a little in parts.  But it is still a great movie worth watching.  While this is Antoine Fuqua's first really good movie, I hope he now has the ability to get better and better projects.  I've never ended a review with a pun before so I won't call his first two movies training days.  That would just be wrong.

I live in a city which is world famous for its club scene, and in my experience, I haven't seen a film which better reflects my generation.For me, the characters were all likeable and reflected traits I've seen in myself and my own circle of friends.  In some cases, the similarities are uncanny ;)Human Traffic is mostly an upper.  Apart from the kitchen come-down scene, there's very little punishment for our band of clubbers.  I really liked that.  It doesn't try to moralise.  It doesn't demonise the characters for committing the heinous sin of enjoying recreational drugs.  So many movies attempt to provide a message.  Human Traffic lets you make your own mind up. Power to the audience.I've read a few of the user comments on IMDB quite purposefully in fact. The first thing that I thought after watching it was Great movie, but will Americans get it?.  I'm glad to see that some of our American cousins do indeed get it, but I'm not sure that it ever filled multiplexes in the Bible Belt.Concentrating on certain aspects, the cutaways are superb.  The what we really would have said scene is superb, as is the old-skool clubber complaints section.  Koop's girlfriend-induced paranoia is finely realised and the alternative national anthem is inspired.Star Wars references are always welcome, and Moof does a great job of abstracting the series until it makes absolutely no sense whatever. There's a lot of this in the film.  People talk complete crap, open their hearts about their worries and basically reflect the behaviour of anyone on MDMA.Couple of minor issues with it.

Get it at Amazon.)This is a diabolical tale about the wages of greed. Although it is played straight without intentional humor, the irony is so delicious at times that you might find yourself laughing.Jacob Mitchell (Billy Bob Thornton) is the one who begins to feel evil, and rightly so as the bodies begin to pile up. His presumably smarter brother Hank (Bill Paxton) feels mostly fear as he struggles to cover up one mishap after another. Their problems begin when they and Jacob's buddy Lou Chambers (Brent Briscoe) stumble onto a downed airplane in the woods covered with snow in which they find one dead person being feasted on by crows and a duffle bag full of hundred dollar bills. Lou, who might represent the common man, says, let's keep it. Hank, who could be rational man, says, whoa, this money belongs to somebody and besides we could get into trouble. We better turn it in. And Jacob, who is the natural man, sides with his buddy Lou. Afterall they're country poor and this is probably drug money that nobody is going to miss. And anyway, what can go wrong?Well, as Ben Franklin observed a long time ago, 'Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.' As they wait for spring to come and the plane to be discovered before they risk spending the money, the 'simple plan' begins to unravel with horrific consequences.Thornton and Briscoe play country boys to perfection, and Paxton does a great job as a small town golden boy majorly compromised. Bridget Fonda plays Hank's pregnant wife, who turns out to be the brains (as it were) of the group. There are some very nice plot twists as the all too human emotions of the characters begin to crash into one another.

Rat Race is disappointing from the very beginning, because it starts off by showing four or five of the exact scenes that we already saw in the preview and that have therefore lost all effectiveness. This is not a movie based on reality &#150; there can really be no question that even the most eccentric of casino owners would never seriously consider picking a bunch of random gamblers out of their casinos and sending them off on this all-expenses-paid excursion to find a duffle bag containing two million dollars. Sure, these casino guys are all ridiculously rich, but Rat Race doesn't acknowledge the fact that rich people didn't get rich by giving money away. There is no financial return at all in the rat race portrayed here, or even any publicity!(spoilers &#150; but does it really matter?) Rat Race is filled with actors who delivered goofy performances that are far below both their iconography and their reputations as actors. Cuba Gooding Jr. - after great performances in infinitely superior films like As Good As It Gets, Jerry Maguire, Outbreak, and A Few Good Men &#150; performs several idiotic and humiliating skits throughout the course of this horribly disappointing movie. John Cleese manages to deliver some of the only funny lines in the entire film through his comical dentures, but still sinks far below his talent in this borefest. Other bad career choices were made by Seth Green, Amy Smart, and even the more negligible actors, such as Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, and Jon Lovitz. Seth Green, actually, is mostly in a bad role by association. His brother in the film is one of the dumbest characters I've ever seen in a movie, and his disgusting tongue piercing only serves to enhance his tremendous stupidity. I've had my tongue double-pierced since early 1997, have made little to no changes in my oral hygiene, and have never had an infection. If his tongue was that infected, it is entirely a result of his own idiocy (as we soon learn, with the realization that his piercing is self-inflicted), and therefore commands no sympathy or respect. If he wants sympathy, Major Payne can explain to him where to find it. Incidentally, the way he met a girl on the freeway (who shows up later at the Smash Mouth concert) was a shocking move to an even lower level.The movie goes wrong at the very beginning. It's clear that a mass travel to a single location is not the foundation of a good comedy, so they decided to throw in this ludicrous scene where Duane Cody (Seth Green) and his idiot brother get their jeep dragged up the sonar station at the airport in an attempt to ground all flights so that their opponents will not be able to fly to the location of the money (and if they had caught their flight in the first place, the movie would have been over in minutes and we would all have been spared). So at the expense of their remaining means of travel, they have successfully drowned out radio airwaves and grounded all flights. It's too bad the movie was released so soon, because if they had waited until after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the scene would almost certainly have been changed, and the movie could only have been better. This is one of the most moronic scenes in the entire movie, which makes you wonder why they didn't just have Cleese's character add in a stipulation that all transportation must be done on the ground. If the movie had been set for release after the catastrophic terrorist attacks, and they had decided to remove the scene, such a stipulation is almost certainly the thing that they would have decided on, both because it would be the fastest and cheapest replacement, but also because such a tragic event would surely make them realize how foolish the scene was to begin with.While Rat Race manages to avoid sinking to the abysmal level of other ludicrous comedies like the Scary Movies, it is clearly a mindless film that does not quite manage to redeem itself by having at least one or two things in it that can be taken seriously enough for it to be funny. The movie is bad enough even without the appearance of Smash Mouth at the end of the film, who are playing a concert for the poor. The way that all of the contestants in the movie stumble on stage with their newfound wealth at the end of the flim (I typed that accidentally just now, but it strikes me as a better word&#133;), ultimately deciding to donate it to the poor, is both insulting and disappointing. Sure, it would be a bad idea to make a movie that did nothing but promote greed, but all that time and effort by the characters as well as the audience is completely wasted (this is also one of the many things that ruined Titanic). It certainly is a good cause, but it is entirely uninteresting. You'd think that the virtually endless possibilities of the cinema would have inspired the film's writer (or writers, could there possibly have been more than one?) to come up with something more creative than this. In reality, donating to the poor, especially such a huge amount of money, is truly honorable and earns you a well-deserved interview and article in the newspaper. In the movies, it is a cheap way to get out of being accused of advertising greed, and winds up as little more than a boring end to a bad movie.

But for me these forms of art are a basic human need, just like oxygen, food, water and love.Moulin Rouge a lust for the eyes and ears. 10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"18 October 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Sorry, but I found this film, even with top notch actors, a bad taste film.  Surprised Tony Bill directed this.  There was no compassion for any of the characters.  Everyone seemd to be a loser.  Not one role seemd to have any conviction.  They all seemd to be vacant and lost in a maze of self destruction.  John Turturro, at least was thorough in his evil ways.  But the Robbins character seemed poorly written and sadly the actor didn't find any salvation.  The use of animals being beaten and killed, didn't please this viewer.  Any more than throwing people off roofs.  Violence was the theme and helplessness the winner. Not one character had my interest.  In fact, they made me angry.  It was a shame to see Miss Foster in this.  Up to this film I had always liked her performances.  Whatever possessed her to do this clinker? Not recommended for viewing, even on the tube.
