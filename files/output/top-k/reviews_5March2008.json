The movie succeeds on giving the right amount of comedy, drama, eeriness, and romance, and doesn't seem to over due anything. The Comedy mostly stays between Carrey and Linney who give great chemistry and seem liked the really hated each other. The Drama is not in your face but it is extremely effective as some of the scenes in this movie are the most moving scenes I have ever seen on film (The Scene when Truman meets his dad and everyone is watching, and the last 5 mins get me every time.) The Eeriness mostly stays with its Twilight Zone Plot, and this uneasy feeling of how much the media can do, ecspicially now in these times when reality T.V rains supreme. The Romance might drag the story a little but it still is a good part of the story, it still gives the classic notion that you can meet someone only for 5 mins and want to spend the rest of your life with them.

It tells the story of a Taiwanese family coping with the everyday fears and anxieties of which life is made. In the end, the movie suggests, there are no trivial moments in our lives, even if they seem so at the time -- any one person's life is an accumulation of both the trivial and the significant. What makes it worth getting out of bed every day is the fact that we will never live a day exactly like the one before it.The structure of Yi yi mirrors its theme -- the film is a gradual accumulation of quiet moments that build toward something deeply moving. We watch the father of the household reconnect with an old flame, only to see his disappointment when the realities of his past don't match his idealized memories of them. We watch the mother battle depression and the overwhelming sense that she lives day to day doing nothing with herself or her life. She seeks meaning by leaving her family to spend time at a religious commune, but she learns that the answers she's looking for aren't to be found there. We watch the adolescent daughter timidly flirt with sex and dating, a young girl only beginning to unearth the complexities of what it means to become an adult. But my favorite character is the 8-year-old son, who takes pictures with his camera because he wants to show other people what they're not able to see for themselves. He's a little boy who is old enough to understand that there are things he can tell people that they don't already know, but he's too young yet to know how to communicate those things. One has to wonder if this character is the young alter-ego of the film's writer and director, Edward Yang.Yi yi isn't flashy. It doesn't intertwine all of these characters' story lines with clever narrative sleight of hand; it doesn't pile coincidences on top of coincidences like these multi-narrative ensemble films frequently do. It's not histrionic, and it doesn't build to some overheated climax. It's not interested in doing any of those things. It unfolds the way life unfolds, and it makes us deeply care about these people, and even makes us love them in a way, flaws and all. It reminded me very much of an Ozu film, with its static camera that chooses to sit back and observe rather than tell us how to feel.Yi yi feels like a modest work of art while you're watching it, but it lingers in the head and its power builds the longer you have to muse over it. It's the kind of movie I have a feeling we'll look back on in twenty years and recognize as a masterpiece.Grade A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"5 March 2008","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Yi yi is a lovely film, pulsing with warmth and humanity.

Apollo 13 out-rivals any space film in its believability and quality. Nothing about space in this film seems like science-fiction and for all the technical jargon, it's really easy to follow, resulting an a deeply moving film.It might be like Titanic, where you know that the ship is going to sink in the end, but still, Apollo 13 moves you through its characters and the way the story is told. It might also be a near 2.5 hour drama, but it keeps things rolling as well and you don't ever get bored. The premise surrounds the historic successful failure of the Apollo 13 shuttle's attempt to land on the moon, a mission lead by Jim Lovell, played by Tom Hanks, whose patience and poise make him a fascinating character. The bulk of the film is Houston and the crew working together to do whatever they can to get these men back home alive.Simply put, the acting here conveys the danger of the return mission and just how serious it all is. Ed Harris, for example, as NASA flight director Gene Kranz is other-worldly commanding on the screen. These actors suck you in to the last detail of what's going on, the great screenplay pads that with actual media coverage of the event to convey a sense of how the world is feeling, and then Ron Howard steps in to make the transitions flawless (with the help his Oscar-winning editors) There are times where a scene will show in the shuttle, in Houston, inside Lovell's family's home, at the nursing home where his mother lives, etc. all within minutes of each other and it's not confusing at all. No single thread seems overdone, they all work cohesively.Since the focus is on the characters and problem-solving, space does not become an integral part of the storytelling. It is contextual and is used to help convey the astronauts drive and motivation. For example, at first when things on the shuttle go wrong, it's not oh, I hope we survive but damnit, we can't go to the moon now. Especially for Lovell, the missed opportunity for space is something that nags at him despite just being glad he survived. That is what makes this film a great space film space is simply a new place for disaster drama to play out and make us wonder about the implications of being in danger so far from home.Apollo 13 doesn't have all the suspense that a film with a lesser publicly known outcome has, but it certainly gets you riding its emotional train to triumph.

A tragic car accident connects these three stories together and teaches its audience a lesson about life, love and fate. Each of the three characters lives are from a different class, and show a different perception of life in Mexico.There is Octavio, a young James Dean like character who is desperate to run away with his sister-in-law. To raise the money he needs, he enters his dog Cofi into dogfighting championships, which is a very normal thing to do in Mexico. He gets involved with the wrong crowd and everything goes catastrophic. Octavio flees with his best friend and an injured Cofi and drives reaklessly through a red light (which causes the incident). Valeria experiences marriage problems after losing her leg in the crash. We also see her struggle to live life in a wheelchair, when her beloved dog 'Richie' goes missing. El Chivo is a homeless man, his care for stray dogs is the only thing that keeps him going. He happens to witness the fatal accident, and gets involved by saving Cofi's life.The film reminds me a lot of 'Lola Rent' (Run, Lola, Run) In the way it perceives love and fate together. I think its really interesting to see fate brought to life in a film like this because it puts you into perspective and makes you think a lot about your own life.Each of the stories involves a dog, and the owners relationship with that dog. I think only a dog owner can truly understand the love and joy that dogs bring. And this film just shows why they are known as mans best friend. I think for someone who lives in the UK (like myself) the dogfighting scenes are extremely unpleasant to watch. But i think these scenes are a powerful representation of the Mexican culture and the differences in how we treat our animals.Amores Perros translates literally as Loves a Bitch, which i think sums up this film as a whole.

This ADAPTATION wonderfully synthesizes Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little rough in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique sense of place to each of the scenes. Beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that's FAR superior to the acting in the new live action movies. And while the cell animation might not be the most technically proficient animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional fantasy motif to outright abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and JRR Tolkien then this film is a must see.

Seldom does a film come along which demonstrates genuine spiritual reflection or inquiry, which dares to question and reflect upon the age old myths of the bible and attempt to make sense of them in a contemporary context. With that in mind, the tremendous accolades which director Martin Scorsese deserves become abundantly clear, for daring to stand up against the mainstream and the ensuing controversy and delivering The Last Temptation of Christ a tremendously reflective, fiercely thought-provoking and endlessly captivating rumination on the journey of Jesus Christ, embracing the inherent humanity as well as divinity of the figure.It is impossible to imagine such a monumental undertaking being anywhere near as much of a success in the hands of a less capable or reflective director than Scorsese, whose passion and dedication to his cause seem to bleed onto the screen. Working from Nikos Kazantzakis' equally controversial novel (a disclaimer declares the film as merely a reflection rather than biblical truth), Scorsese's most spiritually personal work bristles with vivacity and soul, presenting a genuinely harrowing struggle with spirituality and faith, mirroring the director's own religious ruminations. Intensely controversial for its portrayal of Jesus as ultimately human, and experiencing very human struggles, flaws and temptations throughout his spiritual journey, the film dares to capture the psychological struggle and sacrifices of Christ in a haunting and undeniably affecting fashion. Paul Schrader's sparse script is a masterful piece of work, pounding with torment and reflective fatalism, and while some of Jesus' reflective voiceovers toe the line of melodrama, never before have the guilt, resentment, fear and spiritual struggle of Christ been encompassed with such power and conviction.While the film's slow, thoughtful pacing may drag at times, the seemingly tangible mood of doubt and fatalism is overwhelmingly affecting, using its lengthy running time to full effect. Scorsese's cinematography and editing are sublime, masterfully capturing the arid scenery with a bleak artistry, and Brian Eno's haunting and captivating score heightens the emotional tension to a nearly peerless point.Without the appropriate cast to fully drive home the emotional impact of his story it is distinctly possible to imagine Scorsese's masterpiece falling flat, but thankfully the masterful cast rise to the incredible challenge of bringing such a complex and emotionally challenging vision to life. While seemingly an unorthodox choice, it is impossible to imagine an actor inhabiting the indescribably difficult role of Jesus with more compassion and dignity than Willem Dafoe. Strikingly powerful and thoroughly moving, Dafoe conveys Jesus' overwhelming internal struggle with a grim stoicism, as an ultimately human figure struggling with his pending divinity, seduced by the allure of regular humanity - a flooring work that Dafoe has seldom matched since.In contrast, the disappointing miscasting of Harvey Keitel as the troubled Judas, fated to betray Jesus, proves to be one of the film's few misfires. Despite his intensely powerful and rawly emotional performance, Keitel, with his fiery red hair and unmistakable New York accent always seems out of place, and despite his best efforts, his casting only serves to dampen the film's quality. However, Barbara Hershey is a tremendously powerful presence as Mary Magdalene, representative of Jesus' main struggle with his humanity (and the source of the bulk of the film's controversy) and David Bowie makes a strong impact in a single scene as the reflective Pontius Pilate.In turn disturbing, troubling, haunting and emotionally draining, the sheer visceral impact of Scorsese's labour of love is an irrefutable testament to the film's outstanding quality. With nearly peerless emotional resonance and a fiercely dynamic lead performance, The Last Temptation of Christ can hardly be called an easy watch, but for viewers (religious or not) willing to undergo a profound spiritual and philosophical reflection (and brave the initial controversy) or to simply bask in the masterful command of the cinematic form demonstrated, the film proves ultimately rewarding in a way most films can only allude to.-9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 March 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" When one considers the heated public outcry when a new film presents a spiritual representation which deviates even slightly from the traditional and widely accepted portrayal, it is really no surprise that the vast majority of cinematic biblical adaptations often result as irritatingly earnest and painfully politically correct children's stories.
