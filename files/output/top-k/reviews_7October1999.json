Russell Crowe leads all-star cast that included Hank Azaria, Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Maury Chaykin and Burt Reynolds in Mystery, Alaska.  Full of hope, pride and determination, Mystery, Alaska will capture the hearts of the audience.   A 13 year tradition in Mystery where everybody comes together to participate in the Saturday game, a hockey game played every Saturday, draws the interest of the National Hockey League and the New York Rangers.Charles Danner (Azaria) comes to propose this challenge to the townspeople of Mystery. After some debate at a town meeting, the mayor (Meaney) accepts the challenge to play the Rangers; the players must put their personal feelings aside to win the game.  This game between the team from Mystery and the Rangers becomes a David and Goliath match-up, which ultimately comes down to which team can outduel the other first. Can the team from Mystery rise to the challenge given by the New York Rangers?  Russell Crowe is an actor that has brought integrity to his roles such as Officer Bud White in L.A. Confidential. Crowe, who received critical praise as Bud White, brought the same amount of integrity to Mystery, Alaska, as soft-spoken Sheriff John Biebe.  Burt Reynolds, who has starred in Boogie Nights and received an Oscar nomination for his role as Jack Horner, portrayed hard-nosed Judge Walter Burns in Mystery Alaska. Reynolds role as Judge Burns turned out to be very impressive since it seemed that he took his time and enjoyed portraying the small town judge\/coach from Mystery. Co-writers David E. Kelley and Sean O'Byrne as well as director Jay Roach work in conjunction to make one of the best films in 1999. Kelley, who has enjoyed success as producer of The Practice, Ally McBeal, Chicago Hope, L.A. Law and Picket Fences, has brought originality to the film. This film allows the audience to sit back, relax and focus on putting themselves in the movie. Mystery, Alaska is a highly recommended film that should be seen by everybody because it was performed by a talented cast, well-put together by the writers and director, has a great plot, and noteworthy performances by the actors. Rated R for language and a scene of sexuality, Mystery, Alaska has a running length of 120 minutes.

It tells the story of a giant, amnesiac robot who falls to Earth, and is eventually befriended by a local boy, Hogarth Hughes. Hogarth must hide the robot from a paranoid government agent who suspects it a Soviet weapon of war. The truth is that the robot is indeed essentially a giant gun, but hails from a distant planet and bears unbelievable firepower! Ultimately, it is the friendship with the boy that brings out the robot's compassion and humanity, and saves the town from annihilation.I liked this film so much that after I saw it, I emailed everyone on my many contact lists and practically begged them to put on their shoes and hit the theatre to support this amazing film. Why should I care? Because I am an ardent believer in supporting cinematic--or any other--efforts that one feels strongly about. And I do feel strongly about this film. The Iron Giant is one of the finest, well-written, non-formulaic, intelligent pieces of animated film I have seen in a long long time, and I watch a lot of cartoons. At the time, just a few weeks after the film opened, it came to my attention that it was not doing so well at the box office.

The Brady's manage to save their home and neighborhood.The movie has pleanty of songs from the orginal TV series!!Davy Jones,Florence(original Mrs. Brady), Ann B. Davis(Alice), the original Peter Brady and Greg Brady all have cameos in the movie!!!If you still have not seen the TV series , the watch it and then watch the movie!!This movie was followed by A Very Brady Sequel the next year!!Both Brady Bunch  movies are my favorites because I can relate to them in a big family(I am in a family of 11)!Of course I also grew up watching the series as a kid, it still is one of my favorite TV series(besides Doctor Who,Buffy and Angel!!) IF you have seen this awesome spoof go see it ASAP!!!

I am not at all amazed (or even impressed) by the many Academy Awards it received.

And that's not always a good thing.Awards, nominations, hype and everything that has to do with frenzy put aside, this still is an enormous production. So very mighty and so very grand in scale, so very entertaining and so very well-made. We may never see the liking, the most of us have realized that we didn't see an equal in Titanic.Charlton Heston gives the character of Judah Ben-Hur all the magnitude it needs and he brings a strong impact. Many people are fond of Hugh Griffithin the role of Sheik Ilderiim for which he won an Oscar. I am too, but the most impressive actor of them all in my opinion is, Stephen Boyd as Messala. The scene where Ben-Hur and Messala speak to each other for the last time (the scene right after the chariot race) surely could have appealed enough to the American crowd to bring Boyd an Oscar. For a newcomer, he was an excellent and promising one.The movie itself in its full glory may be dated, but not enough for it to be ridiculous at any standard at all. It still stands up among newcomers and will continue to do so for ages to come.Truly nothing beats a classic.

Let me ask this which is the greatest movie ever made, The Godfather or Schindler's List?  Or Citizen Kane?  This question could start an debate which would last well into the 22nd century.  And each side would have a good argument.However, I pontificate.  Simply put, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is a tragic Shakesperian cinematic opera with outstanding performances by the entire cast.  The screenplay, by Coppola and (author of the original source novel) Mario Puzo is excellent.  The characters are complex and speak with each other rather than to each other.  We watch transfixed as Michael Corleone, back from World War II, attempts to stay out of the family business but is gradually drawn in because of his love for his father.  Personally, my favorite character is hot tempered older brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan).  It seems like the family spends half their time reigning him in as he has a tendency to take things personally in a world where it's supposed to be all business.  Sonny's tollbooth scene on Meadowbrook Parkway on Long Island is a must experience for any serious filmgoer.The Godfather set the standard for crime films that since has yet to be matched.

Not that logic, taste, or intelligence ever mattered to the people who unleashed this mess.Without a script that has a shred of human feeling, there isn't much for the actors to do but react to blue screen. The result is just plain embarrassing. To use that tired old film school expression, didn't the film makers ever seriously consider giving the characters an arc.A word to Brendan Fraser, if you happen to be reading You have been blessed with a career that is granted to very few young actors in any era. You possess a very rare combination of gifts. You are the best farceur\/leading man to emerge in films since Kevin Kline & Cary Grant. You are a solid dramatic actor, as proven in SCHOOL TIES and GODS & MONSTERS. You are potentially the best action movie hero of the New Millennium. You have the golden opportunity to work as long as you want to work. Just please, use your gifts and your apparent intelligence with keener judgment in future. It could be a very bright one.By then, this dismal affair will just be a dim memory of youthful indiscretion.To anyone who hasn't actually seen this mediocrity If you are desperate to find some way to waste two hours of your life, believe me, there a much better ways to do it.

The music of Ryuchi Sakamoto is perfect and really touches you specially in those great images of the Desert. I believe that this movie really shows you about those feelings that sometimes couples are afraid to talk about. What a wonderful relantion between them. For me, this is a great movie in everything. Bertolucci really show us why he is such a great director, you don't need a big deal of action and violence to have a great movie.

He doesn't have a whole lot screen time in Dick, but this movie is a must see just for his performance.    As for the film itself, I knew enough about Watergate to get the majority of the jokes, but being under 30, I know there were a lot of jokes I probably missed out on.  Still, the film flew by, with lots of great character performances, and some great bits of humor (though there were far too many dick jokes, so after awhile those got old).

That aside, I am willing to run the risk of corniness by stating my opinion that `Notting Hill' is a brilliant jewel among movies, despite its reputation as a sappy love story.The movie's plot is formulaic, (boy meets girl, etc.), but with an original twist the girl is the most famous movie star in the world, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts).  The boy she meets is William Thacker (Hugh Grant), a British entrepreneur, who lives in the small London neighbourhood of Notting Hill.  So what happens when their two worlds collide?  They fall in love, of course.  They have minor problems along the way, of course.  And, of course,in the end, they live happily ever after.Regardless, there are plenty of things to set `Notting Hill' aside from the `Pretty Woman'\/`Sleepless in Seattle'\/`You've Got Mail' romantic movie stereotype.  It isn't often that I walk away from a movie completely enthralled with the characters, especially Bella, Max's wife.  She is confined to a wheelchair but still an exceptional and elegant woman.  Her husband shows such obvious adoration in his gentle lifting her off to bed.They have a quiet but deep love, and the happiness they share gives Anna and William's budding relationship a kind of framework-an idea of what true love should be.  Max and Bella don't steal the spotlight, but instead reflect it onto the main characters.Each member of the ensemble cast reveals a distinct personality, instead of portraying the stock characters of `the best friend,'  `the wacky sister,' or `a disabled wife.'  Bernie is not just the loveable loser, but demonstrates great comedic talent.  Upon meeting Anna at Honey's birthday dinner, he asks her occupation, and proceeds to tell the story of a friend from school who tried to be an actor but who ended up making his living as a waiter.  One of the funniest things in this movie is the look on his face when, after several minutes of conversation, he realizes who he's talking to.  People in the theater were laughing out loud.  These are the sort of characters I love.  If they were real people, they'd be invited to my next dinner party.The dinner party scene is a great example of how this movie blurs the lines of casting, until the actors play off each other and have all the chemistry of a close-knit ensemble.  All the `supporting' characters are developed as much as William and Anna.  The closing of Tony's cafe is the setting of several poignant moments in the story, and I feel a sort of distant sympathy that could be more realized with more plot details.  Ah, such are the perils of the editing process.The typical romantic comedy has typically bland camerawork, but the cinematography gets creative in `Notting Hill.'  There's a spectacular aerial shot of the two lovers in a park, like sparkling stars in the sky. Another innovative shot comes after Anna has left William to make another movie.  To portray the passing of time, William is shown walking through the market in his neighborhood, and as he walks, time is marked by the change in seasonal weather from rainy to snowy to warn breezes and sunshine.As per any Hugh Grant movie, the dialogue is witty and delivered well; I loved the press interview scenes, with Grant posing as a writer from Horse and Hound.  Grant has considerable comic talent and we all come away saying, `Awww&#133;.'  In fact, this entire movie makes us want to just say, `Awww&#133;.' But fortunately, it's none the worse for it.
