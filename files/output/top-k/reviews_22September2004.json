[{"date":"22 September 2004","score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILER DETAILS INCLUDEDThis is a cool Irish road movie with brilliant performances from the two lead actors. Brendan Gleeson is a master of these Irish rogue type roles, and his comic timing is impeccable. With his pork-chop sideburns and leather jacket, he would be somebody you couldn't trust as far as you could throw him if you met him in person. It is no wonder that Gleeson is now commanding roles in big budget blockbusters like Mission Impossible 2, AI, and the latest Harry Potter flick. His charisma jumps off the screen and I'm sure he will go from strength to strength.Peter McDonald gives an understated performance as Git, and acts as a perfect foil to the exuberant Gleeson. McDonald's hang-dog expression is perfect for scenes such as the Balaclava fiasco, where he ends up wearing a child's woolly hat! The supporting cast of villains and ne'er do wells is also very convincing, particularly Peter Caffrey as Frank Grogan, whose brand of Irish Blarney and dirty tricks is wonderful to watch.All in all this is a very enjoyable film both for the splendid acting, non-fussy directing, and a storyline that is tight while still allowing plenty of time for the comic antics to run their course.Please see this film if you get the chance.

Films like this are great without big special effects and without the latest stars, therefore it is impossible for them to go out of style.So we have this doctor, Victor Frankenstein, who is a very ambitious scientist. He wants to do the ultimate science experiment 'BRINGING THE DEAD, BACK TO LIFE' or as it is in his mind 'CREATING HIS OWN HUMAN BEING'So he and his deformed helper Fritz go into the graveyard and dig up a dead body. But the brain inside the head of the body is useless, so Fritz goes to a school for science and steals a brain. But what Fritz doesn't realize, is that the brain he steals is the brain of a killer.So when Fritz returns to the lab with this evil brain, they go they're experiment, and end up bringing a dead body back to life. Little do they know, that because of they're project, all hell will soon break loose.I have a warning for some of you people. I have not read the book yet, but from what I hear, the book and FRANKENSTEIN (1931) are two very different films. From what I hear, the film MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN starring Robert DeNiro is the closest movie to the book.But other then that small fact, I think that any fan of Classic Horror will be able to enjoy FRANKENSTEIN (1931). It has a very strong story, very strong performances, and one of the best endings in film history.There is currently a box set out which contains the classic FRANKENSTEIN SERIES, Dracula SERIES, AND WOLF MAN SERIES. I recommend that box set to anybody who loves the old universal horror movies.
