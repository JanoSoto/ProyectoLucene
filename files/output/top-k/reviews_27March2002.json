Ed Norton received a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar Nomination this year for the lead role of Derek. The supporting cast includes Edward Furlong, Stacey Keach, and Avery Brooks.  They carry their weight as the story unfolds. \tThe story is primarily told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong. At the beginning of the story Danny is in trouble yet again for writing a paper on that most misunderstood figure, Adolph Hitler. Danny is an up and coming member of the Skin-Head gang located in that area of California. Avery Brooks, appearing as Danny's principal, doesn't want to give up on the promises he sees in Danny. Instead of throwing him out, he assigns another paper to be written. This is to be on Danny's older brother, Derek, who was just released from prison that morning. Derek was the head of the Skin-Head gang that Danny is currently running with. The rest of the movie flashes back and forth from the past to the present. Through Danny's paper we see how Derek, a brilliant student, is turned into a bitter teen-ager that believes only through `white-power' will he get anywhere in life. We also see the tragic night that causes Derek to be justly imprisoned. In the present phase of the movie we encounter a Derek who has grown intellectually while in prison and will now do anything to get his brother out of the trap he allowed himself to be drawn into. \tEd Norton is wonderful in this role. Those who have seen him in previous roles remember him to be a good actor but built on a rather slight frame. Here he has bulked himself up to be the `Aryan Superman' his character portrays. During the time frame of the movie he carries us convincingly on the journey from embitter teenager to enlightened young adult.\tStrong warning though. This movie well deserves it's R rating. The subject matter alone is disturbing enough. The story is also visually graphic with scenes of violence and rape. If you are prepared for something like this I highly recommend this movie. The story is extremely powerful and the performances by all are moving.

A brilliant mathematician, he suffered from sever paranoid schizophrenia for most of his adult life. But he learned to live with it, as normal a life as possible, and he ended up being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994. It's a great story. Too bad it's so generically told in Ron Howard's film. It's as by-the-numbers as a film like this can really get. The direction is bland, and the writing can be quite dull at times. Shine, for instance, is a much better film very similar in plot and structure. I must make an interjection in my own criticisms for this film, though. One reason why A Beautiful Mind may lack power is that it had some major points spoiled in the advertising. We don't actually know in the film, not until a long time in, that Nash is suffering delusions and fantasies. For instance, Ed Harris' character is imaginary, which can be deduced almost instantly. But would I have assumed that if I didn't know what the film was about? Can't be so sure.Anyhow, A Beautiful Mind is well worth seeing. The actors are pretty good. Russel Crowe may have given his best performance so far in the film. He won an Oscar last year for a rather lame role in Gladiator, but if he wins this year (I write this the night before the Oscars air, by the way) it will be very deserved. We've got an actor here who will continue to impress the hell out of us. Hopefully he can restrain himself from beating the crap out of people (I think that it might cost him the award, but we'll see in approximately 24 hours! An update it did). Jennifer Connely is good, but she's been a lot better elsewhere, most notably in Dark City and Requiem for a Dream. It wouldn't be too out of line to award her, though. The rest of the awards it has been nominated for can vanish, for all I care. There's nothing special about Ron Howard's direction. It may be his best film, but that's a backhanded complement coming from me. The editing is plain. James Horner's score is particularly bad. It's far too overdramatic.

Edward Norton, the narrator is a pessimist, a fed-up modern day adult who trudges through his mundane existence deprived of an outlet to express his feelings, which results in his insomnia. To assuage his disorder, be begins to attend support groups for victims of cancer that provides him with an emotional release that allows him to sleep until he confronts another faker, Marla Singer (Helena Boham-Carter), an even greater cynic than he. While on a business trip, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap manufacturer and salesman, whose outlook on life inspires him. They form a fight club, where men can disperse their rage by viciously pummeling eachother. Doesn't seem too much or appealing to the average viewer, right? Wrong. Fight Club has far more to offer than that plot synopsis, which really doesn't do it justice. I won't elaborate any further upon this. I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. Fight Club boasts five impressive performances, especially from the three leads Norton, Pitt, and Bonham-Carter as well as two supporting actors, singer-turned-actor Meat Loaf and Jared Leto. Fincher's direction is characteristically flashy without being overbearing, as displayed in his other efforts such as Alien 3, Seven, and Panic Room. One especially memorable sequence was when he depicts the furniture in Norton's apartment as magazine clipouts, including dotted-line frames and captions. There is so much more I could compliment this movie upon, but it is so outstanding, I recommend you stop reading this and see this movie. Right now!Grade A+  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"27 March 2002","score":"","review":"  This movie absolutely kicked ass. I had no fingernails left by the time the credits rolled, and felt like I'd just been on a rollercoaster ride. What's more I didn't have to disengage my brain to enjoy it. Compared to what was realised on the screen this was done on a shoestring budget and was full of invention and superbly written and directed. It puts to shame many films that were done on five times the budget, and should act as a lesson in film-making for this genre.Lesson #1. The scenario and scary creatures may be slightly reminiscent of other movies, but you can put an interesting spin on the idea which justifies your film being made. In this picture there were various elements which had been seen before, but the mixture of stranded crew, desert planet and hidden danger is presented with a new spin which is a perfect recipe for suspense and thrills. The opening sequence sets up the scenario nicely and as the seriousness of the situation unfolds, a queasy sensation of mounting horror takes over. From then on I was squirming in my seat thinking Wow, these guys are screwed and wondering how anyone would survive.Lesson #2. Limited resources and lack of big star names can be turned to your advantage. The makers of this film have concentrated on writing a good script and using what resources they do have to make it look interesting. There isn't much in the way of flashy CGI effects but it looks superb, and the director has used some excellent photographic effects to depict the planet and the Riddick character's unusual vision. The writing is excellent and I notice some of the best dialogue has been given a deserved web page of its own on the IMDB site. This combination of good writing and inventive direction makes the whole picture work better, in my humble opinion, than many a film whose special effects cost ten times as much. This is the essence of good sci-fi, because the genre often doesn't get the resources required to realise an ambitious vision and even when it does, it's usually wasted on brainless popcorn-fodder like the Fifth Element.Lesson #3. Characters. The makers of this movie have fortunately realised that it never hurts to come up with interesting characters and creating an ensemble with some interesting chemistry. The leading players all have a slight edge to them that makes them more vulnerable and more interesting than a clean-cut action hero. The pilot haunted by her decision to try and save herself at the expense of others before the crash, now trying to save everyone, the murderous convict who no one can trust, the shady law enforcement officer - all makes for a bit of added spice and makes everyone seem more human and sympathetic. The supporting cast have all got slightly different viewpoints and motivations and this means people can act in different and conflicting ways. It's not Shakespeare but it works well and gives the story the ability to take different turns due to the characters' actions. Vin Diesel is the best thing in this movie with a terrific performance as the convict, but all the actors performed quite well in their various roles thanks to the characterization and good judgement by film-makers who clearly understand what works in a sci-fi movie.Lesson #4. Set up the situation, pile on the problems, and then let the characters try various ways to dig their way out of the hole. The story advances, as do the characters (the surviving ones anyway), as they keep moving on. Pile on a few more problems, suspense and shocks, and plant the characters tantalisingly close to the chance to succeed and stick one last frightening danger in their way. This movie was so gripping and clever I was rapt throughout. The ending was a bit abrupt and inconclusive but perhaps in keeping with the hard-edged, almost bleak mood the film had conjured up until then,Overall, an absolute cracker and worth watching. I expect I will buy this on DVD to keep as one of my favourites of the genre.One criticism While not giving this movie a massive budget to play around with, which might have been a millstone around everyone's neck, was not necessarily a bad move, the studio should have given this movie much more support than it got. Surely when they saw what was in the can, the suits should have given this better distribution and promotion, and taken the opportunity to clean up at the box office with what was the best movie of its kind in years? I saw one trailer for this movie, which didn't do the production justice and made me think it would just be another rip-off of Aliens et al. I waited for the video as I simply don't have the opportunity to see that many films at the cinema and limit myself to the unmissable releases, and then kicked myself black and blue for not queuing round the block in the rain to see this. In the end this movie nearly doubled its money at the US Box Office but this deserved to be a $100m grosser. When you've got something this good, make the most of it.

I've only seen two of his movies, namely his original Clerks film and Dogma and I must be honest, I didn't like either of them that much.  But there was one aspect in both the movies that I thoroughly enjoyed, and that was the characters of Jay and Silent Bob.  There is a very charming stupidity about Jay that is simply hilarious.  He is extremely potty-mouthed, possibly mentally-retarded, and morally bereft, but every single line out of this kid's mouth is pure comedy gold.  I found myself laughing out loud more times than I can count on my fingers and toes.  The Clit Commander home video is reason enough to rent this movie.  Now that I've finally fallen in love with Smith's View Askew galaxy, I am so sad to see them go.  But I guess this was definitely a superb swan song for the entire cast of characters.. I also REALLY enjoyed Will Ferrell's performance in this movie.  Will Ferrell is a comedic genius, and I've felt that way since his first season on Saturday Night Live.  He has the unique ability to improv the absolute funniest lines, and this shows through if you watch the bonus material from Jay and Silent Bob and another recent, but not as funny, movie with Ferrell -- Zoolander.  Mark my words, there will be big things to come for Will Ferrell, and I can't wait to see what he he's going to do next. Some of the things I did NOT like about the movie1.) The acknowledgements of the clever, little inside jokes.  They really didn't have to turn to the camera and wiggle their eyebrows knowingly for the audience to get it.  If you didn't get it, then you're not going to get it regardless of the acknowledgement.2.) Kevin Smith's interpretation of Silent Bob in this film was way over the top and bordering on hammy.  Too many emphatic facial gestures and stuff.  Didn't need it. 3.) Ben Affleck is so lame.But thats it, I was willing to overlook all of the flaws of this movie, because of the large helping of Jay's hilarity, which trumps everything.  I must warn you that this movie is extremely trashy, and if you are the type that cringes every time someone utters the f-word or the s-word, then I would suggest looking elsewhere such as Harry Potter or a Disney animation.  Otherwise, if you are not afraid to get a little down and dirty, this movie is superbly funny! Definitely a must-have for all diehard film geeks.

I believe it was state of the art for its time. Just the same, it did leave itself to some reality checks like the one liner in this summary(possible spoilers) chimed in response to Exedor's comment that the bars Cal & Ruth were stuck to were magnetised.    Though the moveis viewed in the series episodes seemed to be much more corny, I must say that one of the main things I found so funny about the heckling & improvising is the way that it contrasted so much as 90's tolerated dialogue juxtaposed against the straight-laced 50's dialogue of the movie. I reserve comment as to whether the change over time is progress or moral decline, but the mixing of the 2 is a hilarious contrast. That's why I like the fact that the wisecracks sounded like they were on the same sound track. Many of the lines were not particularly funny in & of themselves. But the fact that they were interposed into an era that wouldn't have touched the subject matter made them funny.  For example, Cal was telling his assistant Joe about his all night pondering as to whether or not to take Exedor up on his offer. He said he went through 5 cups of coffee before saying to himself-..I gotta pee! interrupted one of the robots finishing his sentence for him. Also, I knew Russel Johnson was in this, & I knew Professor Jokes were inevitable. Looking back, though they did roll in, it's surprising how constrained they were, apparantly careful not to milk a joke for more than it's worth.  Any criticising of the cartoony nature about the way the robots & Mike Nelson & Forrester behaived should be balanced by realising that nobody in this makes any pretence of expecting to be taken seriously. Also, I can only have so much sympathy for Rex Reason & the other actors in TIE. You would have a hard time convincing me that they didn't do their share of hilarious pratfalls & out-takes during shooting & rehearsals just to get it out of their system. The straighter the script, the greater the comic tension. Maybe not, but don't hold your breath. Anyway, guess I betterauger this baby in.
