No animated being has ever moved, breathed or had its skin crawl quite as convincingly as Shrek, and yet the movie doesn't look like a reprocessed version of the real world.The story follows Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers, who utilizes his Fat Bastard voice from the Austin Powers movie into the role). Shrek is an ogre who lives in a swamp surrounded by Keep Out and Beware the Ogre! signs. He wants only to be left alone, perhaps because he is not such an ogre after all but merely a lonely creature with an inferiority complex because of his ugliness. He is horrified when the solitude of his swamp is disturbed by a sudden invasion of cartoon creatures, who have been banished from Lord Farquaad's kingdom.From there we have our plot Lord Farquaad's desire to wed the Princess Fiona, and his reluctance to slay the dragon that stands between her and would-be suitors. He hires Shrek to attempt the mission, which Shrek is happy to do, providing the loathsome fairy-tale creatures are banished and his swamp returned to its dismal solitude. On his mission, Shrek is joined by a donkey named the Donkey, whose running commentary, voiced by Eddie Murphy, provides some of the movie's best laughs. The expedition to the castle of the Princess involves a suspension bridge above a flaming abyss, and the castle's interior is piled high with the bones of the dragon's previous challengers. When Shrek and the Donkey get inside, there are exuberant action scenes that whirl madly through interior spaces, and revelations about the dragon no one could have guessed. And all along the way, asides and puns, in-jokes and contemporary references, and countless references to other movies.No doubt all of this, and a little dig at DisneyWorld, were inspired by feelings DreamWorks partner Jeffrey Katzenberg has nourished since his painful departure from Disney&#x97;but the elbow in the ribs is more playful than serious.Nowadays, actors who do voice-over work have starring roles with fat paychecks, and the ads for Shrek use big letters to trumpet the names of Myers, Murphy, Cameron Diaz (Fiona) and John Lithgow (Farquaad). Their vocal performances are nicely suited to the characters. I feel like each performance is given great care rather than just having a celebrity do the voice.Shrek unveils creatures who have been designed from the inside out, so that their skin, muscles and fat move upon their bones instead of seeming like a single unit. They aren't realistic, but they're curiously real. The artistry of the locations and setting is equally skilled&#x97;not lifelike, but beyond lifelike, in a merry, stylized way.Still, all the craft in the world would not have made Shrek work if the story hadn't been fun and the ogre so lovable.

And this film is no exception. Simple fact, I'm not a fan at all of Stephen King or his work, or the films that are BASED off his work. Just too dark, too controversial, too creepy, too horrendous, too controversial, and too uncomfortable to sit through.Is this really one of the 10 best films of all time? Shawshank is not a downright bad movie but it has some severe flaws and I have no clue how everyone chooses to overlook them. The problem I have with it is how it absolutely oversimplifies everything. Shawshank for the most part focuses on exploring the idea of Hope (one of the most overused ideas in any prison movie), but in order to do so, it treats everything as black or white with no middle ground. I will say that The Shawshank Redemption is not an awful film. This isn't a poorly made film with more crude humor than storyline. One of the positives of the film lies in the IMAGERY. The shot of all the prisoners in the prison yard looking up to the heavens as music plays is an amazing shot, one of the most memorable shots I've ever seen.Shawshank was really hard to watch; with all the violence and swearing, I don't think it does the story justice. I understand this film was nominated for Best Picture, and I've heard people whine, left and right, that Forrest Gump did, and Shawshank didn't. Well, the way I see it, I really don't mind. I don't like how this film seems to use the name of God, or Jesus, as a bad thing, used by the world's biggest hypocrites in Shawshank (ie. the Warden); it's one of the reasons why I like Forrest Gump better so much; there isn't much violence, hardly any swearing, and even treats & talks the name of the Lord in a good way.The villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was.I see that actors William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn are well known for being in this flick, though a much better film that they both star in is Rocketman (1997), a wild, slap-happy family-friendly comedy. Please do check it out sometime!! And I don't even like hearing Morgan Freeman curse at all. Driving Miss Daisy is a much better performance of his, and is a great way for people to be introduced to him, growing up (or maybe even Evan Almighty is a good one, too). Tim Robbins, I guess was okay. Though he was also bizarrely in Howard the Duck; it doesn't have anything to do with it, I know - it's queer to see how far he's come. And it sure is strange the head guard, who is often so prone to violence & swearing is the one who voiced Mr. Krabs in Spongebob Squarepants. Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar! Though to be fair, the escape scene is really where things get interesting, how everything comes together, and the ending definitely is pretty sweet - kinda makes you wish you could see the ending go on from there.But in the end, I'm quite glad I didn't grow up with this film - because, sadly like many others, it might have brainwashed, badly-influenced, or manipulated me to what reality is supposed to be like in such a subversive & biased way.I never had any friends that ever owned or ever recommended this film, because likely they feel the same way. One other thing that subtly bothered me was, if this story takes place over 20 years in prison... why doesn't anybody seem to AGE???

His talent is that he does it all himself.That was my first problem with 'Romeo Must Die' which doesn't star Chan but Hong Kong action star Jet Li and when he faces five guys, special effects allow him to suspend himself in the air while fighting. He needs help from the special effects artists.This trick did work in the 'The Matrix' because we knew that we were inside a virtual reality world. But to watch a guy do this on a football field in a real setting whirling around in the air and kicking people just looks silly.The story doesn't fair much better. It's borrows one idea from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet when Li travels to America and falls for an African-American woman (Aaliyah) whose father (Delroy Lindo) was responsible for his brother's death in Hong Kong. The two lovers don't generate much chemistry because every moment alone is interrupted by a violent encounter. Li plays Han, who was once a cop in the far east. His detective work leads him to a plot by her father to build a stadium by threatening local merchants to sign over their businesses &#x96; or else.

'Romeo Must Die' is a very violent action movie, so violent that is distracts from anything else even when there isn't much else to see.Final Note Why is it that latest film versions of 'Hamlet' seem to be new and inventive (the best being Branagh's 1996 film) while the latest versions of 'Romeo and Juliet' seem to be tired and silly.

It's was so amazingly different from anything I'd ever seen before or since. It felt powerfully unique and special to me, and what it was about was very quaint, no fantastical elements whatsoever, only the endlessly fascinating eccentricities of people. Well a little more so, in this case. It struck a real deep chord with me and felt very much like a type of story that had never been told the same way in anything else. There's a melancholy windblown kind of feeling to it that would probably come off as dull and dreary if the film didn't happen to be so utterly charming and brilliantly captivating in its own understated simplicity. I found the situations, story, and really the overall world of the movie to be very enchanting in-and-of itself, it felt very authentic and starkly real. And although a lot of the tone is strange, contemplative and even surreal at moments, I still found all the characters to be always believable and I had a lot of sympathy for all sides involved in what was going on. I really followed those characters closely and wished them all well. I thought it was simple yet ingenious how the story was set up and played out, with the two sisters being so close at first and then gradually growing apart and eventually becoming estranged to the point of them practically being strangers as the youngest of the two, Lucille, becomes ashamed of her own sister and rejects the plain existential life that she seems content to live, and who eventually leaves after she adopts herself to a school teacher, whereas the gangly and socially-awkward Ruth finds a true kindred spirit in her aunt and the two grow ever-closer and more isolated from the real world, which I found a little unsettling.. One of the things I loved about this movie was how it makes you think about and question the morals of the story, and how whether or not it was right or not for Ruth to be with Sylvie was very much a matter of perspective and entirely up to the viewer. To me the main theme of it seemed to be that of the differences between those who desire to be a part of things and those wandering souls who appear to derive more satisfaction from being apart and and being their own person no matter the consequences. And there was such an uncanny strangeness in the patterns of the 'madness' passed down from generation to generation, like the eerie story of the doomed train that was swallowed up by the icy lake in the dead of night, and how that was similar to the film's startling opening scene where the girls' mother calmly drives her car into the same waters. Christine Lahti gave such a phenomenal performance, I found her gentle character so fascinating, how she was extremely eccentric to the point where some may have been in their right to consider her mentally disturbed, yet she was completely sincere and lucid all at once. I loved how she used her eccentric view of things to make miserable and scary situations seem like whimsical games, to herself and to the girls. Perhaps as a subconscious way of dealing with the daunting obstacles. One of my favourite parts is when they visit the forsaken-looking wreck of an old cabin on a lonely frost-covered island and it looks like a very saddening place to be, but she makes it seem like such a magical dreamlike place. You really do get people like Sylvie in the world, the ones who despite themselves are just too damn odd to ever truly fit into the regular scheme of things, and that's okay, that's just the way it is sometimes. Some people are meant to be with others, and some are just different and for the most part prefer to be alone and don't care about fitting in.

It's was so amazingly different from anything I'd ever seen before or since. It felt powerfully unique and special to me, and what it was about was very quaint, no fantastical elements whatsoever, only the endlessly fascinating eccentricities of people. Well a little more so, in this case. It struck a real deep chord with me and felt very much like a type of story that had never been told the same way in anything else. There's a melancholy windblown kind of feeling to it that would probably come off as dull and dreary if the film didn't happen to be so utterly charming and brilliantly captivating in its own understated simplicity. I found the situations, story, and really the overall world of the movie to be very enchanting in-and-of itself, it felt very authentic and starkly real. And although a lot of the tone is strange, contemplative and even surreal at moments, I still found all the characters to be always believable and I had a lot of sympathy for all sides involved in what was going on. I really followed those characters closely and wished them all well. I thought it was simple yet ingenious how the story was set up and played out, with the two sisters being so close at first and then gradually growing apart and eventually becoming estranged to the point of them practically being strangers as the youngest of the two, Lucille, becomes ashamed of her own sister and rejects the plain existential life that she seems content to live, and who eventually leaves after she adopts herself to a school teacher, whereas the gangly and socially-awkward Ruth finds a true kindred spirit in her aunt and the two grow ever-closer and more isolated from the real world, which I found a little unsettling.. One of the things I loved about this movie was how it makes you think about and question the morals of the story, and how whether or not it was right or not for Ruth to be with Sylvie was very much a matter of perspective and entirely up to the viewer. To me the main theme of it seemed to be that of the differences between those who desire to be a part of things and those wandering souls who appear to derive more satisfaction from being apart and and being their own person no matter the consequences. And there was such an uncanny strangeness in the patterns of the 'madness' passed down from generation to generation, like the eerie story of the doomed train that was swallowed up by the icy lake in the dead of night, and how that was similar to the film's startling opening scene where the girls' mother calmly drives her car into the same waters. Christine Lahti gave such a phenomenal performance, I found her gentle character so fascinating, how she was extremely eccentric to the point where some may have been in their right to consider her mentally disturbed, yet she was completely sincere and lucid all at once. I loved how she used her eccentric view of things to make miserable and scary situations seem like whimsical games, to herself and to the girls. Perhaps as a subconscious way of dealing with the daunting obstacles. One of my favourite parts is when they visit the forsaken-looking wreck of an old cabin on a lonely frost-covered island and it looks like a very saddening place to be, but she makes it seem like such a magical dreamlike place. You really do get people like Sylvie in the world, the ones who despite themselves are just too damn odd to ever truly fit into the regular scheme of things, and that's okay, that's just the way it is sometimes.

Shining heroes and devilish villains are not out of place in, say, Indiana Jones movies, which trade in concepts of good and evil in a world where magic is real and the stakes include the destruction of the world, but in Spielberg's historical films his black and white view of life can feel stifling, arbitrary, and preachy. In The Color Purple and in Schindler's List no less than in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the story unfolds through a series of good and evil actions committed by characters who are either right or wrong, respectively. To be fair, Oskar Schindler is a flawed hero in the latter movie, and in this film Celie Harris Johnson (Whoopie Goldberg) has one line that suggests complication. This moment occurs early in the movie, when she suggests, perhaps for lack of any other example of male behavior, that a man beat his wife in order to make her more docile. But for the most part, Celie and the other characters in The Color Purple have at most two settings, and when they alternate between them it is with a rapidity that is more in service of plot and message than of truth. Spielberg is not obliged to make truthful movies, of course, but in his historical movies he seems to want to have it both ways he seems to want to say something honest and meaningful, but through characters who are too idealized and abstractified to connect with.Here, the film opens with an idyllic pastoral scene young girls playing in a field of flowers. When they step out of the head-high stalks, we see that one of the girls, Celie, is pregnant. Clearly, something is amiss. The next two scenes reveal Celie's painful childbirth, the cruel theft of the infant by her father, and the statement that her father is also the father of her child. The moral lines are very stark, the villain and victim very clear. If only real life had the perfect clarity that it has in Spielberg's versions of it.At times, of course, it does. There have been, and still are, women like Celie (Whoopie Goldberg), abused and despised and trapped by their deranged fathers or husbands. There have been, and still are, women like Sofia (Oprah Winfrey), unjustly imprisoned or mistreated by their employers because of the color of their skin. But do people bear their circumstances with the saintly, childlike, often bemused patience of Celie, or alternate between Sofia's polar extremes of unbridled confidence and utterly defeated resignation? Some perhaps do, but for most people, life is lived in the middle. There are monsters in the world, like Danny Glover's tyrannical Albert, but do monsters like that ever change in time for a Spielberg-sanctioned happy ending? These characters are simple when they should be rich, and mercurial when they should be static.That said, if Spielberg's prime objective is to convey a strong, positive message through raw, uplifting emotion, he succeeds. Many have focused on the film's famous march to a church, a big musical number that feels good and creates a neat resolution for a juke joint singer named Shug (Margaret Avery). Yet this is actually a side plot, and not strictly necessary to the core ideas about strong female relationships. In fact, it works against those ideas Shug is the film's most complicated and interesting on-screen character (an equally intriguing storyline set in Africa exists only on the margins), but in the church she is railroaded into what audiences in 1985 found a crowd-pleasing conformity that, to me, just feels like conformity. The idea that really drives The Color Purple, and that remains as daring and intense and uncompromising and subversive now as it was then, is that bonds between women have the ability to weather the destructive power that certain men employ to maintain their position of privilege in society. Celie's different but equally strong connections with Sofia, Shug, and a sister who remade herself in Africa are mutually empowering and healing, and the worthiness of this message makes the film worth seeing and talking about in spite of its many missteps.

Connery wouldn't be a major star without Young's help, and he shows that on every interview he is on when discussing Bond, trying to make sure no one would forget how vital Young was. His leaving the series is also another possible reason why he'd eventually have a falling out with the Bond producers that lead to his departure.It's definitely a Bond film, but it's much different from all the follow ups. It has less action and Bond is more of a detective here. That's mostly because this film is low budget. Some of that shows such as Bond featured in a car chase where he's obviously in front of back projection. However, despite instances like that it overall doesn't feel low budget because of how well made it is. The script is solid and a great with Sean Connery who just oozes charisma, already playing it cool on his first frame. The locations and elaborate sets are made to full effect, leaving a big impression onto viewers.There's a reason Sean Connery is most popular Bond. With his natural charisma and cool attitude it's no wonder his films were the biggest and most hyped of the series. Connery is cool, tough as nails, dangerous and when he needs to be, ruthless. In Dr. No, Bond was at his peak when it came to being ruthless. A scene between Bond and a henchman named Dent really elaborates on that idea.The supporting players are all good as well. Jack Lord is the best of all the Felix Leiters. It's a shame he couldn't reprise the role. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder is gorgeous, adding to the exotic nature of this film. If any flaw, the characters do not feel as well rounded as they were in the novel the film is based on. The lead up to Dr. No's lair, Crab Key, arguably takes longer to get to in the film than it did in the novel. It's not damning to the film, but it's always been something on the back of my mind.In many ways this is the quintessential Bond film. It doesn't have staples the next films would play with like gadgets, but there's enough here to surprise anyone who's familiar with Bond on how Bondian it was from the start, such as the beginning with the gun barrel having the signature theme music blasting. All that said, it's a pretty laid back picture compared to what would come later in the series.

His leaving the series is also another possible reason why he'd eventually have a falling out with the Bond producers that lead to his departure.It's definitely a Bond film, but it's much different from all the follow ups. It has less action and Bond is more of a detective here. That's mostly because this film is low budget. Some of that shows such as Bond featured in a car chase where he's obviously in front of back projection. However, despite instances like that it overall doesn't feel low budget because of how well made it is. The script is solid and a great with Sean Connery who just oozes charisma, already playing it cool on his first frame. The locations and elaborate sets are made to full effect, leaving a big impression onto viewers.There's a reason Sean Connery is most popular Bond. With his natural charisma and cool attitude it's no wonder his films were the biggest and most hyped of the series. Connery is cool, tough as nails, dangerous and when he needs to be, ruthless. In Dr. No, Bond was at his peak when it came to being ruthless. A scene between Bond and a henchman named Dent really elaborates on that idea.The supporting players are all good as well. Jack Lord is the best of all the Felix Leiters. It's a shame he couldn't reprise the role. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder is gorgeous, adding to the exotic nature of this film. If any flaw, the characters do not feel as well rounded as they were in the novel the film is based on. The lead up to Dr. No's lair, Crab Key, arguably takes longer to get to in the film than it did in the novel. It's not damning to the film, but it's always been something on the back of my mind.In many ways this is the quintessential Bond film. It doesn't have staples the next films would play with like gadgets, but there's enough here to surprise anyone who's familiar with Bond on how Bondian it was from the start, such as the beginning with the gun barrel having the signature theme music blasting. All that said, it's a pretty laid back picture compared to what would come later in the series. It's best described as a hang out picture, where viewers are asked to settle down and take in the atmosphere, characters, etc. I'd say that's an accurate description of most Bond films starring Sean Connery.

People get a sore throat and an abdominal workout from some comedies, often without knowing what it is about themselves that makes the movie appeal to them. Other times the same people will watch another comedy and think, How the heck is this supposed to be even remotely funny? Your sense of humor just something that's wired into you and nobody can control it. That said, if you aren't a fan of Mel Brooks humor. find something else to watch. This isn't a comedy that has other elements in it like the Ocean's Trilogy or many Robin Williams movies. Nothing in this movie is done for any reason apart from getting laughs out of the audience, so if it doesn't tickle your funnybone, Men in Tights will just be a waste of hundred minutes. The rating certification for this movie is listed as Off color humor, and there is certainly a fair amount of that. I found that this was the main detracting area of the movie. Call me whatever derogatory name you want for it, but the sexual humor just didn't really sit well with me. Despite that, there is still enough cleaner humor to make it enjoyable for (insert plural form of derogatory name mentioned above here). It references the original Prince of Thieves, among other things, to an extent, but not so much that those who haven't seen the original Kevin Costner film won't enjoy it. The references that are made are pretty good though (e.g. Unlike some Robin Hood's, I *can* speak in a British accent). Some of the lines are just ridiculous like Asneeze's On the count of kick line. Other jokes have a witty Monty Python feel to them. The lines feel well placed and well worded for the most part, which is the only area where execution comes into play in this sort of comedy apart from the acting, which is fine. Otherwise, as long as it makes you laugh, the execution isn't a problem. After all, comedies are supposed to be enjoyed, not debated. Nobody writes essays about dynamic characters from comedies. There certainly aren't any of these in this movie, though each main role is well established. Robin Hood is an overly gallant and dashing soldier that exits all of his encounters on top, usually after humiliating the Sheriff of Rottingham. The Sheriff is a cocky, though blundering character that is very good at making a fool of himself, though somehow retaining an air of superiority. His sidekick of sorts, and my personal favorite is Prince John. His lines are excellent and the mole that teleports from one spot on his face to another in each scene is pretty funny. Maid Marion is a tragic red-head that has a few good lines namely 'Twould be . . . Tweriffic. The other main roles lie with the Merry Men. First to be recruited is Achoo son of Asneeze. He brings a modern touch to the Middle Ages setting and he also has some pretty good lines, many of them emphasizing his being a black guy in the middle of England. The next recruit is Blinkin (Did you just say Abe Linclon?), the blind man. He is somewhat of a klutz, being blind, but that does not detract from his verbal humor. Finally, Little John and Will Scarlett join the ranks. Little John sort of leads the Merry Men and is made to be kind of an all brawn and no brains sort of character, exemplified by his introduction at the river. Will Scarlett is not really developed, but does have a few scattered one-liners. To conclude, Men in Tights is a very slapstick comedy that, while hitting many areas of comedy, may not be well accepted in any given group. The movie is extremely quotable, which can be a bad sign to anyone who knows someone who really likes it. So in a nutshell, its worth a rent, but if you question whether you're going to like it after about twenty minutes, it may not be a good idea to continue. Overall Rating 8.2\/10.

Little John sort of leads the Merry Men and is made to be kind of an all brawn and no brains sort of character, exemplified by his introduction at the river. Will Scarlett is not really developed, but does have a few scattered one-liners. To conclude, Men in Tights is a very slapstick comedy that, while hitting many areas of comedy, may not be well accepted in any given group. The movie is extremely quotable, which can be a bad sign to anyone who knows someone who really likes it. So in a nutshell, its worth a rent, but if you question whether you're going to like it after about twenty minutes, it may not be a good idea to continue. Overall Rating 8.2\/10.

Autism is more common today than it was in the 80s, so Rain Man is perhaps more relevant now than then. It follows selfish yuppie, Charlie Babbitt (Cruise) who is angry that he did not get over $1 million of inheritance from his father whom he never had a good relationship with. When he finds out all the money went to his older brother, Raymond, (Hoffman) with high-functioning autism he never knew he had, Charlie kidnaps him to get his cut. Raymond's social ignorance, lack of communication and odd rituals bug the living hell out of Charlie, until Charlie sees the good in Raymond and gets out of his self-centred world. Dustin Hoffman gives his most recognizable and best performance as the Rain Man. The movie may be a drama, but Hoffman provides all the comic-relief this movie needs with his rituals, ignorance and intelligence. The movie is a triumph based on Hoffman's performance alone. His Oscar win for this was one of the easiest wins in the Academy's history. Tom Cruise also gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the one that drives the movie. He is the protagonist and the one that changes the most throughout the film, starting as a mean car salesman to a humble, loving one. I mentioned that it was funny seeing Hoffman bug Cruise, but it is just as funny seeing Cruise throw his hissy fits because his is so annoyed by his brother. The brother-to-brother relationship is strong and original. The information that is delivered about autism is done in a strong and simple way. This is a must see movie that just makes you want to hug yourself because of how nice it is.

The Movie is based upon the novel by Stephen King, The Body. Four childhood friends embark on an adventure to find the body of a missing boy. The four friends are different from each other and each have their demons that they are battling. Throughout the film, their issues are unfolded which lead to the choices they make. Will Wheaton plays the lead, Gordie Lachance, a quiet, reserved character who is living in his late brother's shadow and with a resentful father, he bears guilt. River Phoenix plays Chris Chambers, who came from a bad family and is known as a thief. Corey Feldman plays Teddy Duchamp, a known physically abused kid. Jerry O'Connell plays Vern Tessio, the pathetic, easily teased, fat kid. The editing effectively guides the audiences' thoughts, associations, and emotional responses right from the beginning sequence. In the beginning, we see the storyteller, played by Richard Dreyfuss, sitting in his pickup, looking into the distance as two young teens pedal by on their bicycles. He looks at a news article telling of a person's death. The camera zooms in slow motion focusing in on the expression of Dreyfuss' character who looks deep in thought. The zoom transitions into a start of a flashback as the narrator begins to voice-over the story. This one scene involves a massive amount of editing in such a small amount of time. The music in the background also sets an emotional tone. The kids on bicycles riding by, perhaps foreshadows that the story is about kids that age. And who is the person in the article of the paper? Will we find out? This scene is a great example of smooth continuity and coherence.During the scene at the junk yard, involving Chopper, the infamous, scary, guard dog, sound effects come into play. The invisible dog sound effects are effective. These sound effects of a dog barking evoke a mood and atmosphere of fear for Gordie and the others which creates drama of what's to come next. The camera angle is also focused on Gordie's face and it's only after he makes it safely over the fence that we see that less intimidating Chopper. This same effect reminds me of the scene in the movie, The Sandlot, where a similar effect was achieved. The sound effects along with the filming of the scene creates the mood of suspense right before the object, the dog, is shown. It achieves a greater effect by leaving it to the audience's imagination. The movie is a great coming of age film, riveting, and nostalgic for many. I grew up loving this film at about the same age as the leading characters. I also am a fan of the fantastic soundtrack that was included in the plot line.

Just like the Firestarter sequel (Rekindled), this one travels way too far from the original plot, the characters are preppy high school students and the soundtrack is horrible, as is the acting.The Rage follows telekinetic outcast and killer Carrie White's half-sister, Racheal, as she discovers her own horrible powers. As a child her mom was committed to a mental hospital so now Racheal lives with her trailer-trash foster parents and her only friend has committed suicide, leaving her alone. Racheal's beloved basset hound, Walter, is squashed by a car, and afterwards Racheal begins to learn that the urban legend of Carrie White, who wrecked the town in the Seventies, was indeed a true story, and soon everyone at school is coming face-to-face with Racheal's telekinetic rage.There are so many cliché horror elements in this movie that it's not even funny. I cared nothing about what happened to any of the characters, the guys were all sleazy sex maniacs and the girls were all snotty Barbie clones or emo teens, nothing unique about anyone. For some reason Racheal has a heart-shaped tattoo, no idea why, and when she uses her powers, vines grow out of it. Why? Like I said, no idea whatsoever, just a pointless waste of the movie's budget.The only bright side to this pathetic load of garbage is that Amy Irving, who played the original Sue Snell in the 1976 Carrie, comes back to play the role of Sue Snell again as an adult. This movie reminded me more of The Haunting of Molly Hartley than it did of Carrie.My advice? Don't watch The Rage unless you're incredibly bored.

Just like the Firestarter sequel (Rekindled), this one travels way too far from the original plot, the characters are preppy high school students and the soundtrack is horrible, as is the acting.The Rage follows telekinetic outcast and killer Carrie White's half-sister, Racheal, as she discovers her own horrible powers. As a child her mom was committed to a mental hospital so now Racheal lives with her trailer-trash foster parents and her only friend has committed suicide, leaving her alone. Racheal's beloved basset hound, Walter, is squashed by a car, and afterwards Racheal begins to learn that the urban legend of Carrie White, who wrecked the town in the Seventies, was indeed a true story, and soon everyone at school is coming face-to-face with Racheal's telekinetic rage.There are so many cliché horror elements in this movie that it's not even funny. I cared nothing about what happened to any of the characters, the guys were all sleazy sex maniacs and the girls were all snotty Barbie clones or emo teens, nothing unique about anyone. For some reason Racheal has a heart-shaped tattoo, no idea why, and when she uses her powers, vines grow out of it. Why?

Stand and Deliver (1988)Director Ramón MenéndezStarring Edward James Olmos, Lou Diamond Phillips Screenwriter Ramón Menéndez & Tom Musca Music Kralg Safan Brief summary of the filmIn 1982 a determined teacher, in a social drama movie, enters the Garfield High School in a Hispanic district of Los Angeles to teach the lazy and rude students Calculus. The students used to study in the school not to learn but to pass the time. Teaching Calculus seems impossible or at least tough job which no teacher man before Escalante dared to invest its time and energy on it. Escalante,not just the teacher but an actor, sympathetic and lover of his job has a difficult task to reform not the learning but the characters as well. There is no place where this crisis is more acute than in the inner-city schools of our major cities. Garfield that barely merits the title, school is one of the schools which its students dare to terrorize their teacher. But Escalante was successful and he won. 18 students with parents reluctant to let their children pursue higher education learned calculus. They changed their way of thinking and could pass the state exam of AP Calculus Program.Genre Social Drama Main characters A boy named Angel who wears sunglasses and a hairnet and refuses to pay attention in class. But even he comes around eventually. The teacher shows sensitivity yet firmness, and a large part of his success one feels is that he saw potential and opportunity in young people where nobody else concerned did. Teaching mostly Hispanic pupils at a high school in East Los Angeles, this Bolivian teacher speaks directly to his students frankly and Hispanic accent I'm finger man too, basic math is easy to every man, grandness ''Tough guys don't do math, tough guys deep-fry chicken for a living'' and ''Go to wood shop, make yourself a shoeshine box, you're gonna need it.''

Teaching in a usual and formal science theory in a tough culture community of students is not possible and some artist guys like Escalante is necessary to bring the best from the worst. The Bad News Bears (1976) and Hoosiers (1986) in the realm of sports films, To Sir with Love (1968) and Dangerous Minds (1999) in the teacher\/hero genre are some example which we can compare to Stand and deliver.I personally liked this movie because of my personal experienced in a high school like Garfield whit a talented of history teacher who used to put us in a historical event as an active observer. So I believe our educational systems need some teacher like Escalante more than any other facilities and equipment.
