A wide range of character drink, smoke and have fun talking about what life is about to offer them. I think it's fair to say that this film did for the 70s what American GRAFFITI did for the 50s in that it was a very nostalgic look back for a director who was clearly putting his memories on film so that future generations could look back and use the film to say that's what it was like back in the day. Director Linklater does a remarkable job capturing the mood and spirit of teenagers and the colorful soundtrack really packs a punch even if none of the characters are really drawn out any. If there was a flaw with the film its the character who are all lovable but at the same time there's really nothing but one stereotype after another, although some might say this was done on purpose by the director. What does work here is that the actors playing these parts are at the top of their game and seeing this movie today is a lot different than when I saw it in theaters back when it was first released. I still remember watching this movie and being impressed by all of the unknowns but when you see the film today it's rather shocking to see how many went on to bigger things. Jason London, Rory Cochrane, Wiley Wiggins, Adam Goldberg, Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams, Ben Affleck and Parker Posey are just a few of the familiar faces and all of them do a fine job with their characters. Another important part of the film is its terrific soundtrack, which includes the likes of Aerosmith, Bob Dylan, Alice Cooper, ZZ Top, KISS, Deep Purple, Ted Nugent, Peter Frampton, War, Nazareth and many others. This soundtrack is certainly a killer album with one great track after another and there's actually more music than actual dialogue. There's no question that the story is fairly light as there's really not too much going on except for drinking and smoking but I think there was a point to that. I think Linklater is certainly telling more messages than your typical high school film and there's no question that the quality here is much higher than you'd normally see. The young faces and terrific music are two of the biggest highlights and in the end there's no way not to be impressed with what you're seeing.

Easily the most prolific and respected director of all time, you'd need at least a third hand to count on each finger all of his classic films. Unfortunately though the popularity of films like Psycho, Vertigo, and Rear Window has overshadowed many of Hitchcock's lesser known films in the passing decades since his death. This is a damn shame, because it turns an amazing film such as this one into a forgotten gem.Adapted from the popular stage play, Rope is both a technical and philosophical achievement that ranks up there with many of Hitchcock's other classic films. The film is more then just a murder\/suspense film, it's a meditation on what exactly drives a man to kill, and the justification of it in the eyes of the murderers.The two murderers\/main characters are completely different people. Where Brandon (Dall) is egotistical and confident in his belief that he is a truly superior human being, Phillip (Granger) is nervous, unsure of himself and easily manipulated by Brandon. The acting from both Dall and Granger is top notch stuff, with Dall specifically shining as the cunning mastermind of the murder.James Stewart is his usual amazing self (the man could literally do nothing wrong in my eyes) as a former professor of the two men, and a strange sort of inspiration for the murder itself. It's obvious that Brandon in particular idolizes Stewart's character, taking a conversation the three of them had years prior about Nietzsche's Übermensch (or Supermen) and the so called art of murder as a tool to express superiority as inspiration for the killing.The entire film takes place in one room, and yet it never bores you. You're gripped into this story from the opening murder to the ending credits. Rather short even by the standards of the time, the film clocks in at 80 minutes and is required viewing for anyone who considers themselves a fan of Hitchcock. His direction is top-notch as always, specifically a sequence in which Hitchcock and the camera take us around the apartment as James Stewart describes how he would murder someone and how he would get away with it. The finale of the film in which Stewart calmly walks around the apartment, trying to coax a confession out of the two is a textbook example of how to build a suspense.Many philosophical questions are raised in this film on the subject of murder and superiority. Another interesting point to the film is the relationship between the two killers, and how relevant it is even today. They reminded me very much of the case of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, the two boys responsible for the Columbine shootings. One was brash and angry, nearly nihilistic, while the other was timid, weak-willed, hurt and confused, easily manipulated.Can murder be justifiable? Are some lifeforms truly superior to others? Is murder technically an art form? You'll be pondering these questions for days after viewing this great film.
