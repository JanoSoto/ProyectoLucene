Sometimes these works are just self-indulgent ways for their creators to exorcise their personal demons&#151;and sometimes, like Truffaut's The 400 Blows, they go far beyond that. This movie allows those of us who were never young hellraisers like Truffaut or his protagonist Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) to understand him and discover the universality of his story. The way that Antoine's family alternates between loudly arguing and pretending that everything is happy is very recognizable. So is the way that Antoine is stuck somewhere between childhood and adolescence and expected to take responsibility for his actions, even though the adults' rules don't make sense.The 400 Blows is basically a character study of Antoine, a lower-middle-class Parisian boy. Occasionally, his willful disaffectedness reminded me of a French Holden Caulfield, but he lacks Holden's cynical, superior attitude. The movie shows us that other characters think of Antoine as a rage-fueled delinquent, but that in reality he is an aimless youth who always chooses the wrong moments to act defiant. Léaud gives an amazing performance that perfectly matches the movie's tone sympathetic to Antoine's plight, yet resisting the temptation to make him into a downtrodden victim. I have seen a few other Truffaut films, and one of the things I like best about his style is his skillful use of long wordless sequences, often set to music. The 400 Blows is full of these, conveying everything from the joy of skipping school and going to the movies, to the panic and exhilaration of a spinning carnival ride, to the poignancy of riding through late-night Paris in a police van. The famous, marvelously ambiguous ending tops them all. This innovative style was groundbreaking in its time and started what became known as the French New Wave. But The 400 Blows is not just a bag of cinematic tricks or an arty, inaccessible critics' darling. Instead, it's a wonderful movie about childhood, highly recommended for its lyricism, its emotional range, and its sympathetic but not sentimental look at a misunderstood boy.

Ace was a hell of a fun character to see. as the film evolves you see a lot of drama in the world of ace and it goes from great to good to bad to worse and Robert De Niro rolls with the punches and fights fire with fire like no other actor i know of could have done. not since The Deer hunter has De Niro starred in a film that captured my emotion on such a scale. an absolutely brilliant character played by an absolutely brilliant actor. the character of Nicky Santoro being a quite versatile role required someone who could be sensitive, funny, bold, brilliant, scary, intimidating, and admired in the same character. well they cast the best choice for my money when they cast Joe Pesci. aside from the brutal heartless side of him that comes out when someone interferes with him or his job he was an admirable character. someone who could do what it takes to get the job done while at the same time being a good friend to Ace and also having a wife and a son. its not easy being such a serious character I'm sure but only Joe Pearce would know how challenging it was to tackle this role. when someone told his friend to stick a pen up his A**, well let me tell you he didn't have one shred of decency in his character. he took the pen and stabbed the man at least three dozen times. such a moving character, who has a popular restaurant of his own where he was in some eyes more famous than the famous people there had so many traits that were evolved in this film. hands down this role was handled beautifully and masterfully by the skills of Joe Pesci who in my opinion is the best choice for such a serious mob role. Sharon stone takes her role as the money obsessed, drug addicted, alcoholic, whore Ginger. she only cared about money and a boyfriend who took it from her. for some reason even when Ace proposed she was still tied to that loser lowlife pimp who ran her life. in the film she even tries to finance his bullshit by taking Aces money. when Ace finds out you almost wish he had killed both of them. because when the good pl' boys beat him down and leave him in a mess in his car ginger cries and sobs like he didn't deserve what came to him. tell me honestly do you think you would deserve getting beaten by three men at once for sneaking around with the wife of a casino boss with mob ties, then trying to take 25,000 dollars of his money. well you decide for yourself. each character gives you a reason to like or hate them. but only good actors can assure that you will feel both throughout the film. if you haven't seen this film i highly recommend it. if you have like mob movies you will love this film. And even if you don't love mafia movies but enjoy a movie with good acting, good storyline, good accuracy, or any one of the above and more you will find this movie quite to your liking. without doubt a two thumbs up.

And Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Vorhees is the would-be scene stealer were it not for the formidable performance of Adrianne King who hasn't done much since this movie and it's sequel probably because of the association to her character. The population of this movie with people who seem real, not too melodramatic makes a wonderful partnership with Tom Savini's special effects artistry.This is the most realistic stuff I've ever seen on film. The soundtrack is unforgettable. The name of the composer is right on the tip of my tongue, but alas, it escapes me.The stories told in the sequels really don't hold up against the first one. I am more sympathetic to the killer(s) in the earlier movies as tragic victoms of grief rather than being evil. This less-dramatic plot device makes the movie all the scarier.There is a sequel, or rather a re-imagining of Friday the thirteenth in the works. I hope that through a multitude of sequels the producers have learned not to tamper with a winning formula.I'm Cecil Miller. Thank you for reading.

Friday stands on it's own merit as the first serial killer horror movie with a high body count. Another contributing factor to the endurable greatness of this film is the fact that the motive behind the murders is saved until near the end. The character development is subtle, but present. There is Mr. Christy, who wants to make the camp a success after taking it over from his family. He has an attraction to his right-hand employee, Alice, who may have to go back to California to take care of some personal business. There is a love triangle of sorts involving Kevin Bacon's character, his girlfriend and their best friend,Ned. Local crazy,Ralph tries to warn the lot to no avail and the murders happen. And Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Vorhees is the would-be scene stealer were it not for the formidable performance of Adrianne King who hasn't done much since this movie and it's sequel probably because of the association to her character.

He's a genius with making epics and fantasy movies. His early work is just as good as his latest, and he never fails to fill a theater. His earliest work have become the stuff of legend. His fantasy series consists of four incredibly popular films The Duellists, Alien, Blade Runner, and Legend. Today I will tell you why Legend is one of the finest Ridley Scott films ever made and how it stands up there with Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and Kingdom of Heaven.Trouble is brewing in the land of Legend. The Lord of Darkness has hatched a plot most sinister. If he succeeds there may never be another dawn. He's sent his goblins to locate and kill the mystical Unicorns, who hold the power over the seasons and day and night. At the same time, Princess Lily is visiting in the forest with her friend Jack, the wild boy. Jack shows Lily the Unicorns and Lily tries to stop the Goblins from killing one. Captured by the goblins, Lily is taken to the Lord of Darkness's castle and is being forced to become his bride. Jack, along with the help of fairies, spirits, and a group of hearty dwarfs, goes after Darkness to save Lily, who's being forced to kill the last Unicorn.Legend is quite an interesting film. It's a little darker than say Hook or The Adventures of Robin Hood, but it still is a good family film, especially the Director's Cut with Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score. Ridley Scott unleashes himself completely, creating a magical world with impressive special effects and amazing visuals. Cast-wise, this film has three great stars. Tim Curry is outstanding and perfect as the Lord of Darkness, a monstrous creature made up of incredible Makeup effects. Tom Cruise is swashbuckling as Jack and plays his final role as a small-time actor before becoming flying into the Danger Zone in Top Gun and Risky Business. Mia Sara is quite lovely in her first role and holds her own against Cruise and Curry.Signed, The Constant DVD CollectorParental Warning This is actually a good film for kids to watch.

Here we see Jason catching a ride with a luxury cruiser (the appropriately-named Lazarus), come ashore in Manhattan and continue his trek to slaughter almost everything in his path (though for some reason he does nothing to the dozens of people on the Subway). This was the eighth and final film that Jason Voorhees appeared in for Paramount Pictures before being picked up by New Line Cinema (and saved, in my opinion). Written and directed by Rob Hedden, who is known for practically nothing. He worked on a variety of television shows in the 1980s and 1990s for one or two episodes, and often times nothing really worth talking about (Knight Rider 2000 and Simon and Simon, for example). With all due respect to Mr. Hedden, I am under the impression he was given this film because he was about the least expensive writer and director available. But sadly, he also had the capability to make the film completely worthless even by low-budget standards.I don't think it's a big surprise that this film failed. There was basically nothing new going on (watching a guy walk without dialogue and hack things up is fun, but eight movies in a row?). No new mythology. No great death scenes (in fact, these are almost the weakest and least gory death scenes in the entire series).Jason's ability to teleport reaches an all-time high in this film. Even after getting a quarter-mile behind his victim, he still magically teleports ahead of them, sometimes even up a flight of stairs and then back down to the bottom. Sure, he can run when he really wants to, but not quite that fast.The victims weren't worth caring about. The dad or principal or whatever his role was supposed to be... annoying, to the point that nothing could redeem him. He would make a great vampire, but he's awful in this movie. The two heroes (the young lovers) didn't give me any reason to care about them. Everyone else was forgettable or unlikable. The heroin from the gang members (or whatever that stuff was) did not play into the film nearly as much as it should have. Apparently, it doesn't do anything the first time you inject it and driving a car is still relatively easy. I could point out a dozen other flaws and continuity errors. And sure, I could say it's a horror film and that's to be expected, but they really put no effort at all into making this one streamlined.Two best parts the boxing scene (though still not as good as the fight scene in They Live), and when Jason fights the cook. (The cook was played by the guy -- Ken Kirzinger -- who would take over Voorhees from Kane Hodder many years later, so it was almost like a Jason versus Jason moment. At the time this film was released, that meant nothing. But looking back, that's a fun thing to watch for.) The boxing scene is what most people remember from this film, I believe. And it's not bad, but if you're sitting through the whole thing waiting for that moment, you're going to be let down.I should also point out this is the film debut of Kelly Hu, who plays the very 1980s-dressed Asian girl in this movie. She's easy to miss, as her role is rather small and of no real consequence. But Kelly would go on to much bigger and better things (and thankfully become more attractive with age). You might know her from Strange Days, X2 or Cradle 2 the Grave... I absolutely adored her in the 2006 horror film Devil's Den alongside Devon Sawa and Ken Foree.If you like Jason Voorhees, you'll probably be okay with this film since you'll be getting what you've come to expect. But the thrills are smaller, the deaths less violent, the plot runs a little thin. This is possibly the least of the 11-part series, or pretty close. Watch the next installment Jason Goes to Hell, the best in the series, by far. That's the only cure for this failure.

Nevertheless, there have been some directors who attempted to make a movie about the giant Norsemen. Except for Richard Fleischer, who made a primarily adventure film with top cast of the time in 1958, John McTiernan is a man who had a wonderful idea in 1999 to make not only an epic, a spectacle with historical facts, but combine most popular aspects of today's cinema in a movie the action of which is set more than 1000 years ago. Yet, did the idea work in practice?The combination of horror, epic, history and adventure at first seems to work in the 13TH WARRIOR. As an epic fan, I watched it with historical imagination, as a thriller fan, I saw it full of curiosity of the action, particularly the sequence with mysterious, cannibalistic Creatures of the Mist and their leader Wendol (the content partly based on BEOWULF). The moody atmosphere reaches its peak before the cruel attacks on villages. The moments, though brutal, exceptionally involved me. The witch who comes and selects the twelve Viking warriors to fight the enemy...the moment she says that the thirteenth warrior cannot be a Norseman is unforgettable. Except for horror fans, there is also much for adventure lovers. The entire content is a pure adventure. Since what may be equally interesting and mysterious than the 10th century Scandinavia? What may be equally involving than the brave bloody combats of the strong warriors of the North? However, though the director seems to manage the combination of horror with epic and adventure with history, there is so much of it that a conclusion sounds like this You simply don't know what the film is going at...The cast give pretty good performances. In my opinion, however, it is not Antonio Banderas who is at the top. He does no outstanding job in the portrayal of his character, though an interesting one of Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, the 13th warrior. Many moments are unnatural, particularly the first half when Banderas is exposed to live and fight among the unclean, brute, strong, giant blond masters of the seas. Yet, there are better performances in THE 13TH WARRIOR. The actors who shine in their roles are Vladimit Kulich, who is absolutely brilliant as an untamed, courageous Viking leader Buliwyf and Omar Sharif as a wise man from the Far East, Melchisedek (unfortunately given rather too little time on screen). It's a pity that the director did not develop the character of Olga (Maria Donnevie). A plot of a love affair would be something that many viewers could find absorbing in such a film). But it is another omission that the film has. But let us now concentrate on some advantages that the movie can boast.The cinematography and scenery are fine. Although THE 13TH WARRIOR was not filmed in Scandinavia as the aforementioned VIKINGS (Fleischer made his film in Geiranger Fjord in Norway), McTiernan's shooting locations of Canada and Canadian natural beauties do leave an unfading trace in many viewers. And they really look authentic. The battle scenes, in spite of being too long, sometimes, are very realistic and imitate Ridley Scott's films (KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). I also liked the mysterious grandeur that was exposed in the scene of a royal funeral. These aspects, however, serve primarily the purpose of an epic and the illogic of it all is that THE 13TH WARRIOR is not an epic film - it only seems to be in a way. Therefore, it's pretty hard to evaluate what the film really is. It's a sort of combination, which makes it a really confusing movie for many people.Finally, I would like to concentrate on one positive aspect of the film that many users did not entail in their comments...a different (and accurate) way of seeing Arabs. Their living conditions, their elegance, their riches and exceptional hygiene were far higher than the ones found in the Europe of that time. The main character, Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas) is shocked by the lack of hygiene that the Vikings had. In this way, historically speaking, we, Europeans, learned a lot from our brothers, Muslims. This aspect is wonderfully developed in the film, not only in the scene about drawing sounds (writing) at which Buliwyf is amazed but also at the moment Ahmed prays to Allah at the end. I cannot say that I disliked THE 13TH WARRIOR. This is a sort of film that should not be treated as a serious history and categorized within one genre. The movie rather combines many aspects of movie genres thrilling atmosphere of adventure, facts of history, grandeur of spectacle, violence of battles, courage of warriors, mystery of horrors, and wisdom of reflections.

I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers, and perhaps I expect too much of them. But they also happen to have some of the finest chops in working neo-noir out with great visuals pizazz and very natural screenplays. Miller's Crossing is a little different though, even as it's through and through one of their movies. This time, for their first time on their only 3rd film, they have here something very polished, with a cast that includes the most powerful of character actors and a star or two. And they even draw influence from Dashiell Hammett from a couple of his novels (Red Harvest one of them). So why does this feel so, well, self-conscious? Even more self-conscious than they usually do I mean? It's probably because at times there's such an icy-cold precision working with these characters, at least through Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), that the nuttiness that makes the film much more entertaining kind of has to muscle in for room. It's an homage that really walks that fine line of becoming too aware of itself, like a superhero constantly adjusting his cape and weapons belt.That's really the only liabilities I felt, or thought, from the film. And maybe it might be better on a repeat viewing (The Man Who Wasn't There, which I thought was very good on a first go-around, now I find to be one of their masterpieces). Still, there's much in the film that kept me watching it till the end. Jon Polito is in one of the very best performances of his entire career- which also includes other stints in Coen brothers pictures- as a half agitated, half talky-chummy kind of 1930s Italian crime boss, who sometimes in-between the problems with the gamblers and Bernie Bernbaum (John Tuturro) has to smack some sense into his pudgy son. But Tuturro too is once again striking some rich material with his performance, who is maybe even more of an ice-cold movie cliché gangster than Byrne's character, as the two end up playing each and the other side back and forth. There's also some style from Finney and Marcia Gay Harden too. And some of these set-pieces are real knockouts, such as the shoot-out at Leo's place, or that first major scene in the woods at the crossing.But in the end maybe the only disappointment I could say is that it's so much of a good thing that the Coens almost forget about putting these people in the real world. Everything becomes so much akin to the old movies and novels in the world of Miller's Crossing that the pleasures of watching it- and they are available via Sonnenfeld's camera and the performances- get in danger of putting almost too many words in their mouths, with it being too, well, written out.

The recent trilogy, to me, aren't even total masterpieces, but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post-modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good, sweeping entertainments. But as one who has not read the books, I end up now looking upon the two versions, live-action (albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way) and animated (albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework) in relation to just the basic story, not even complete faithfulness to the books. And with Bakshi's version, it's almost not fair in a way, as what we do see is really not the complete vision, not what Jackson really had (probably final cut). Robbed of Return of the King's big climactic rush of the story, and with the other two parts becoming rushed, I ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations, though as such those same limitations make it disappointing.What's interesting too, after seeing the Jackson films first- which I also slightly regret being that I might've reacted to this differently when I was younger and prior to five years ago- is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with. Everything that is really needed to tell the Fellowship of the Ring story is actually pretty much intact, and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in Tolkien's book is given some clarity in this section. The actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes, are more or less adequate for the parts, with a few parts standing out (John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squire as Gandalf). The lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face-value for those who've not even seen the other films or read the books and can't put them into context. But there is some level of interest always with the characters, and here there's a more old-fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more. This is not a garden variety Disney adaptation- warts and all, this is a Bakshi film, with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of Middle Earth.And what Bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen, in all its abbreviated form, its hit or miss appeal. Along with being not totally complete as a film, or as stories, the form of the film is an experiment, to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped. The results end up bringing what seems now to be retro, but at the time of course was something that was a rough, crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers. Might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation? In some parts, yeah; it does become a little noticeable, as was also the case in Bakshi's American Pop, that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky, like some kind of comic-book form done in a different way. Still, there's much I admired in what was done. The orcs, for example, I found to be really amazing in they're surreal surroundings. They're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live-action, especially during parts where there isn't battle footage (that's really the real hit-or-miss section, as there isn't continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping), and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback. It's creepy in a good way. And the backgrounds, while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy, are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together. It's almost something for art-film buffs as much as for the ring-nuts.So, how would I recommend this animated take on the Lord of the Rings? I don't know, to tell the truth. It's certainly a good notch above the other Tolkien animated film I've seen, the Hobbit (and I've yet to see the animated ROTK), and there is some real artistry going on. There's also some stilted dialog, an all-too-rushed Two Towers segment with the most intriguing character Gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all. And seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films. If you're a fan of the books contemplating checking this out, I would say it's worth a chance, even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. As for it fitting into Bakshi's other films I've seen it's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement, where as with Lynch's Dune it's bound to draw a dark, mordor-like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don't.

But as one who has not read the books, I end up now looking upon the two versions, live-action (albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way) and animated (albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework) in relation to just the basic story, not even complete faithfulness to the books. And with Bakshi's version, it's almost not fair in a way, as what we do see is really not the complete vision, not what Jackson really had (probably final cut). Robbed of Return of the King's big climactic rush of the story, and with the other two parts becoming rushed, I ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations, though as such those same limitations make it disappointing.What's interesting too, after seeing the Jackson films first- which I also slightly regret being that I might've reacted to this differently when I was younger and prior to five years ago- is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with. Everything that is really needed to tell the Fellowship of the Ring story is actually pretty much intact, and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in Tolkien's book is given some clarity in this section. The actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes, are more or less adequate for the parts, with a few parts standing out (John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squire as Gandalf). The lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face-value for those who've not even seen the other films or read the books and can't put them into context. But there is some level of interest always with the characters, and here there's a more old-fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more. This is not a garden variety Disney adaptation- warts and all, this is a Bakshi film, with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of Middle Earth.And what Bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen, in all its abbreviated form, its hit or miss appeal. Along with being not totally complete as a film, or as stories, the form of the film is an experiment, to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped. The results end up bringing what seems now to be retro, but at the time of course was something that was a rough, crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers. Might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation? In some parts, yeah; it does become a little noticeable, as was also the case in Bakshi's American Pop, that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky, like some kind of comic-book form done in a different way. Still, there's much I admired in what was done. The orcs, for example, I found to be really amazing in they're surreal surroundings. They're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live-action, especially during parts where there isn't battle footage (that's really the real hit-or-miss section, as there isn't continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping), and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback. It's creepy in a good way. And the backgrounds, while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy, are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together. It's almost something for art-film buffs as much as for the ring-nuts.So, how would I recommend this animated take on the Lord of the Rings? I don't know, to tell the truth. It's certainly a good notch above the other Tolkien animated film I've seen, the Hobbit (and I've yet to see the animated ROTK), and there is some real artistry going on. There's also some stilted dialog, an all-too-rushed Two Towers segment with the most intriguing character Gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all. And seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films. If you're a fan of the books contemplating checking this out, I would say it's worth a chance, even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. As for it fitting into Bakshi's other films I've seen it's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement, where as with Lynch's Dune it's bound to draw a dark, mordor-like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don't. I don't.

Why Clark didn't change into Superman in the hotel's revolving doors instead of getting in the back of a car (Superman breaks into cars, yet more lawlessness by Clark Kent) I don't know.Oh, and how did Clark ring the door bell when Superman was still inside the room? If Nuclear Man is a clone from Superman's DNA, why doesn't he look like Superman? I don't see how Superman can stop a Volcano by plugging it up. Pressure builds up and the plug would just be ejected, it'd be a matter of time. Why not just do freezing breath inside the Volcano to cool it.

Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance. Set in the Deep South of Lee's childhood in the fictional town of Maycomb in 1932, the story, adapted by writer Horton Foote, focuses on six-year old Scout, the tomboy, motherless daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch.Along with her four-years older brother Jem, Scout regales the new neighbor boy Dill with horror stories about the bleak-looking Radley house and its chief occupant, Boo, whom they believe has been locked up in the basement. Finch, in the meantime, has been given the unenviable task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella, the cry-wolf daughter of a white trash racist farmer, Bob Ewell. The two stories meld seamlessly with the model behavior of Finch, who tries to teach his children not to come to judgment based on hearsay and perception. Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing. Because of the town's pervasive racism, Finch loses the case, and tragic consequences ensue. However, life lessons for the children emerge as well as Boo in an unexpected heroic act.Gregory Peck gives his career-best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human-sized dimensions to a most honorable man. It's inspiring work from a great screen legend. Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem. Brock Peters plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as Boo Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voice-over for the grown-up Scout neé Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get.The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J. Pakula, a superb director in his own right. There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom-seen Badham, and the original theatrical trailer.The second disc offers a fascinating, ninety-minute 1998 documentary, Fearful Symmetry, filmed effectively in black-and-white, which goes well beyond the standard making-of featurette. It includes interviews with Peck, Badham, Alford, Pakula, Mulligan, Foote and Bernstein, and paints a remarkably penetrating story of the production. There is a second feature, 1999's A Conversation with Gregory Peck, directed by famed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, which is actually a full-blown feature about the actor as he prepares for an onstage tribute.

From that, let me say that I am so very thankful I didn't have to sit through 3 hours of this.The constant background monologue of thoughts prevents any imagination or intuitive reasoning by the audience. The foreshadowing is about as subtle as a brick to the head. Many characters appear to exist only to fill screen time (Thufir Hawat for one). The special effects, although occasionally very well done, are often missed. During the last battle scene, if you look closely you will see that although many in the background are firing, only those in the foreground have any apparent muzzle blast. The worms are essentially a repeat of the space worm in Star Wars (most likely b\/c the same creature designers worked on both), and they go from being these destructive monsters capable of destroying mining plants to cuddly little vehicles for Paul and his men. The psychotic little Alia manages to age to at least 6 years old in the space of 2 years, and I have yet to see the connection between the worms and the spice, although that may be from my lack of book knowledge. With few exceptions, the acting is just atrocious. Give me Plan 9 From Outer Space over this execrable mess any day.The only bright light in this dung heap is Jurgen Prochnow's performance as Duke Leto. He appears to be everything that one would want in a leader. Unfortunately, his death spins the minds and acting abilities of his whole family out of control. In fact, thats the best description of this movie a mind out of control.

The story is wonderful and the movie is cast so well, you can almost forgive the moments where it doesn't feel quite real.Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, who is the highest-ranking guard at death row. The movie begins with a new prisoner (Michael Clarke Duncan) arriving at the Green Mile as they call it, so named after the green floor. This new prisoner changes everyone in the prison- criminals and guards alike.The performances very nearly make the movie. Tom Hanks doesn't have an incredible amount of acting to do (Duncan and Jeter take the main honors in this movie), but as usual he is so honest and real I had no trouble believing him, no matter how outrageous any choices his character makes might seem. I also liked David Morse as Brutal, Edgecomb's second-in-command and good friend. Neither actor is able to steal the scene away from the prisoners though; and I don't think they really try to. If they did, it would have thrown the movie off-balance. Michael Clarke Duncan plays a simple character but he invests him with such passion and honesty that he comes off as real and unreal at the same time- the perfect combination for a movie about the unexplainable. He is perfect as Coffey, and without such a good performance in this role, the movie would have been mediocre. Michael Jeter is also very good and sympathetic in his role as the French prisoner. Doug Hutchison is appropriately sleazy in his role and Sam Rockwell appropriately crazy in his. The way these performances fit together is amazing to watch.Besides the cast, the story is superb. It balances the real and supernatural so well, the supernatural seems to fit perfectly into this world. The movie also wisely does not explain the phenomena- sometimes there are things we just can't explain. I won't ruin exactly what happens, but I will say this the movie was telling its story well before anything supernatural happened, but when it does happen it feels right, and you know you're dealing with a movie that has all the trappings of achieving greatness.However there are certain scenes that feel awkward to me. The scene where Paul invites the other guards to dinner and then forces them to decide what to do seemed contrived to me, as did the entire prologue to the movie. Even so, I really liked the movie and the epilogue is so satisfying and it completes the movie so well, I'm willing to put those scenes aside and wholeheartedly recommend this movie. It's quite a story, and deserves to be heard by anyone who loves movies.

There, I got it out there in the open so that it wouldn't hold me back as I talked about how great of a cinematic journey I Am Sam was. I remember when this film was released and how disgusted I was to hear that Sean Penn was taking the role of a mentally challenged individual because I am under the utter beliefs that if you want realism in your film, just hire someone who faces it daily. I didn't see the point of getting Sean Penn to over dramatize it. I am here to say that I was wrong. For once, I think Sean Penn was the perfect choice for this film. Yet, it wasn't just Penn that made this film worth more than one viewing. I believe that director Jessie Nelson realized that she had a cliché Hollywood story on her hands, in fact just another retelling of Kramer vs. Kramer (which is referenced throughout the film), and needed to do something to set it apart from the rest. Her answer, Beatles songs, imaginative cinematography, and gathering the best of the best to tackle her main characters. While Michelle Pfeiffer seemed to be an odd fit, the rest fell into place beautifully. Let me say this now, Dakota Fanning will win Oscars (more than one) during her film career. Needless to say, this was a much better film that initially represented. I Am Sam is one of those movies that we assume will be just like every other Hollywood outing, but until you open the box, put the DVD into your player, and experience the music, the visuals, as well as the phenomenal acting; you will never quite understand why I Am Sam carried above the Hollywood standard.On the apparent level, I Am Sam works because of Sean Penn. As I watch more and more of this actor's body of work, I cannot help but be continually impressed. Penn brings more to the screen than any other actor could imagine. His presence, in my eyes, dwarfs Hanks and Cruise phenomenon. Penn is constantly surprising us with challenging roles that fluctuate between light and dark. He is not focused on one genre, but always impressing with his ability to move between films. One will never quite know what he has in his back pocket until we see him on screen. He is that impressive. I believe that it was also the aid of Dakota Fanning which gave Penn the strength to be the character that he was. For her first feature film, Fanning came out with the prose and professionalism that has nearly gone missing in Hollywood. She stood up, worked with Penn like they had been companions for a lifetime, and succeeded in giving us the emotion this film desperately deserved. She was an element of I Am Sam that was needed to bring a human element to Sam, and she did it with the greatest of ease. I can say the same about everyone else in the film to those that played Sam's friends, to Diane Wiest, to even Laura Dern. They all created an ensemble cast that brought emotion, humility, and sincerity to this film. Alas, I just can't say the same for Michelle Pfeiffer. I thought her role in this film was too dramatic; she seemed to be the only one that fit within the cliché walls, and just seemed to be a bit miscast. There was a level of annoyance with her as well. The lawyer that leans more about herself through her client was just too much for me. I think if she just played herself being a lawyer, than it would have worked better. She tried to hard to counter Penn's brilliance, and it didn't work. Fanning did it exceptionally well, but Pfeiffer seemed too familiar. I know we could have expected more from her, the sad thing is, we didn't get it in this film.There are two other elements of I Am Sam that nearly knocked me off the couch because I wasn't expecting them. The first was the cinematography which added a very artistic element to this film. The cut scenes added a new level of humanity to everyone involved, while the choice of colors for different moments really added to the raw emotion of the film. This wasn't your typical film where it was the stagnate colors and straight-forward camera work, this was a movie that took unfamiliar leaps with the camera, choosing to use darkened colors for the courtroom scenes, and lightened colors for the moments between Penn and Fanning. This is much different than your typical courtroom film. I thought this idea worked brilliantly to bring a defined tone to the film. Coupled with the fabulous and detailed Beatles' music that was used with superb accuracy, I Am Sam transformed into more than what I was ready for. I read that Penn was influential in getting the Beatles' music for the film, and the choice to use one band to compliment the film was yet another tool not used often in cinema. Again, I Am Sam took risks, and it is those risks (like the music and cinematography) that took this a-typical film into a whole new galaxy.Overall, I thought this was a surprising film. I was not expecting the level of superiority that I witnessed when I watched this movie. I was expecting your typical courtroom drama with Sean Penn befouling a character that he had no right to play. I am nearly certain his portrayal here should have won him the Oscar over Denzel. The only negative I have is Pfeiffer, but she can be easily overshadowed by Fanning and Penn if you get too deeply into this film. I highly suggest this film to anyone as a more than once viewing.

I can say the same about everyone else in the film to those that played Sam's friends, to Diane Wiest, to even Laura Dern. They all created an ensemble cast that brought emotion, humility, and sincerity to this film. Alas, I just can't say the same for Michelle Pfeiffer. I thought her role in this film was too dramatic; she seemed to be the only one that fit within the cliché walls, and just seemed to be a bit miscast. There was a level of annoyance with her as well. The lawyer that leans more about herself through her client was just too much for me. I think if she just played herself being a lawyer, than it would have worked better. She tried to hard to counter Penn's brilliance, and it didn't work. Fanning did it exceptionally well, but Pfeiffer seemed too familiar. I know we could have expected more from her, the sad thing is, we didn't get it in this film.There are two other elements of I Am Sam that nearly knocked me off the couch because I wasn't expecting them. The first was the cinematography which added a very artistic element to this film. The cut scenes added a new level of humanity to everyone involved, while the choice of colors for different moments really added to the raw emotion of the film. This wasn't your typical film where it was the stagnate colors and straight-forward camera work, this was a movie that took unfamiliar leaps with the camera, choosing to use darkened colors for the courtroom scenes, and lightened colors for the moments between Penn and Fanning. This is much different than your typical courtroom film. I thought this idea worked brilliantly to bring a defined tone to the film. Coupled with the fabulous and detailed Beatles' music that was used with superb accuracy, I Am Sam transformed into more than what I was ready for. I read that Penn was influential in getting the Beatles' music for the film, and the choice to use one band to compliment the film was yet another tool not used often in cinema. Again, I Am Sam took risks, and it is those risks (like the music and cinematography) that took this a-typical film into a whole new galaxy.Overall, I thought this was a surprising film. I was not expecting the level of superiority that I witnessed when I watched this movie. I was expecting your typical courtroom drama with Sean Penn befouling a character that he had no right to play. I am nearly certain his portrayal here should have won him the Oscar over Denzel. The only negative I have is Pfeiffer, but she can be easily overshadowed by Fanning and Penn if you get too deeply into this film. I highly suggest this film to anyone as a more than once viewing. I think you will be just as surprised\/shocked as I was!!

With an awesome all-star cast and directed by John McTiernan (Die Hard, Rollerball, The Thomas Crown Affair Remake) The Hunt for Red October is a must-see thriller about the men who hold the power of Armageddon in their hands.Captain Marko Ramius is defecting from the Russian navy along with his finest commanders and the submarine Red October, a new Typhoon-class sub with the ability to run underwater silently through the use of an invention called the caterpillar drive. However, the Russian government discovers Ramius's plan and inform the world that Ramius has gone insane from grief over his dead wife and is planning to destroy the United States with a missile attack. The only American who knows Ramius isn't attacking is CIA Analyst Jack Ryan. Jack is given three days to find the Red October and verify that Ramius is defecting. Jack teams up with a skeptical Sub Commander, Bart Mancuso, and they try to locate the Red October before Ramius's protégé, Captain Tupolov, and his ship the Konavolov destroy the Red October.The Hunt for Red October is a superbly cast film. Alec Baldwin is almost unrecognizable since he's so young in this film. Sean Connery is his usual awesome self as Marko Ramius, the only Russian with a Scottish accent. It's refreshing to see James Earl Jones in a role that's not Darth Vader and I found his performance as Admiral Greer to be quite cool. Sam Neill has some really great scenes as Vasily, especially a really moving one where he and Ramius discuss what they'll do when they reach America. Tim Curry is unrecognizable also without his beard, awesome evil laugh, and sinister acting as he plays the wimpy Dr. Petrov. Stellen Skarsgaard, one of the best actors out there, has a good guest star appearance also as Captain Tupolov. All in all, great film and the Best of the Jack Ryan films.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector ","genre":null},{"date":"17 September 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Dear Readers,In 1993 US Navy Satellites momentarily picked up a Typhoon-class submarine off the coast of Maine near the Grande Banks.However, the Submarine was never verified as an actual submarine and both the United States and Russian governments denied its existence.But, the US Dallas, a Los Angeles-class sub, and a CIA agent both reported that a new variation of the Sovier Union's Typhoon Submarines had put to sea out of the Polijarney inlet in Northern Russia.Despite that...none of these events...ever happened...The Hunt for Red October is the best of all the Jack Ryan films and is the second best spy film ever (First being the Bourne Identity).

I need to compare because prior to the newest remake of The Wicker Man I had never heard of this film. After seeing the very decent and harshly panned remake starring Nicholas Cage I knew I HAD to see this glorious, terrific, classic original that everyone was raving about. Now I won't pretend the film wasn't good, the original Anthony Shaffer's The Wicker Man is a decent and disturbing occult drama. I can't say thriller because there isn't near the thrill that the remake had to it. This original was more of a dramatic, and disturbing look at a very disturbed little island. This is where the remake absolutely trounced the original because Neil LaBute's Wicker Man had so much more depth and background information and left no major plot holes like the original does. Why does Sergeant Howie (the exact person they needed for the sacrifice) come to the island?? Who sent the letter?? Why was he sent alone?? All these questions are dealt with in the remake with more a secure story and background. Still Anthony Shaffer's The Wicker Man takes the cake on twisted. The people on this island are not just cult freaks and cut off from the mainland...they are utterly and completely insane. This is proved with the very strange sudden burst into song making it into a semi-musical complete with naked dancing and slapping their rear ends while they dance. The film has a very dark and disturbing undertone for certain but it's claim to fame is questionable?? Edward Woodward plays Sergeant Howie, and absolutely impresses!! Woodward is terrific as the morally secure, determined police officer. I would say that he does a significant better job at the part than his predecessor Nicholas Cage. Much like the remake Woodward truly is the star and everyone else is a supporting cast, some more than others. The beautiful Britt Ekland is thrown in there as a seductive temptress and does a decent job in that role. Irene Sunters plays the mother of the missing girl and her role hardly takes her from her kitchen but she still manages to come across as disturbed and creepy so kudos to her. And legendary actor Christopher Lee makes an appearance in the latter half of the film as the mysterious leader Lord Summerisle. Lee has a small part but he definitely adds to the cast and does a terrific job as Summerisle. The debate between Lee and Woodward over their pagan rituals is quite interesting.The film is not mind blowing although it is ripe with culture of the British which is great for them. I can see it being a highlight of their movie making history because it's intriguing and haunting. The Irish or English ballads that are used throughout the film absolutely chill you to the bone and are reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkle. Director Robin Hardy who never really went anywhere after this film does a really great job capturing the beauty of this island and the people and their foreign ways. But the film doesn't give you enough answers to all the peculiar questions. The story feels half fulfilled and the ending instead of being a thrill turns out to be disappointing because the questions are just not answered. For that reason the original falls short of being as good as or better than the recent remake. I know that's not a popular opinion and I might get booed for it but the remake had so much more of a story and besides the fact that the depth of the story was added there was so much that they kept faithful to the original film which is why I don't understand the outcry of hatred towards the remake. They were almost identical!! EXCEPT the new Wicker Man made so much more sense because the background information provided and the spin on the story. Either way both are worth seeing one is a cult classic and the other should be seen to compare. Definitely unique and strange film made by the British and possibly one of their best. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 September 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is far more than just a review.
