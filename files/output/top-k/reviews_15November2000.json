In World War II it was just about to eliminate a threat, which was not direct to most Americans, seeing as the battle was not fought in their own backyard. It is the origin of the War that makes it so different, the whole history behind it and the motives of the people to either be on one side or the other.The film itself has great scenes in it, my favorite ones are when Mel Gibson Rides off to leave his family for the second time, the two cannonball scenes and the ghost scene.

This is one of those movies, one where there is a lot of promise... a lot of unrealized promise. If someone could have taken it and shaped it more carefully, I think it could have been a lot more interesting.If you've seen the trailers, this movie looks like We crash land on Mars, and then our robot doggie comes and kills us one by one. What it really is is Obstacles One Might Face When Journeying To Mars. The main characters just face one hurdle after another and keep going, and not one thing emerges as the biggest challenge. Thus, this movie has more of a road movie structure than suspense or action structure. Which is fine, you just have to get used to it. I personally found it enjoyable, in not terribly exciting. You could do a lot worse.THERE ARE SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT>>>>>There were some opportunities that I thought were really wasted, the biggest being Carrie AM's shooting out into space at the end. She is cooped up in the constricting ship the whole time, while Val is on the ground, with the tension constricting around him also. When she shoots herself from the confined ship into space--with the accompanying choral music--it's exciting, but it more hints at how really enthralling it could have been had the entire movie been shaped better. This scene really could have been the orgasm of the film--where all the built up tension is suddenly and thrillingly released, with a symbolic rush into space--but it just wasn't handled carefully enough to come off as well as it should have. Maybe some other film will use this better.Carrie AM is very good in this. I would like to see her get more dramatic parts. She is strong without being a ball-buster, and projects intelligence. Val Kilmer is one of my favorite actors, not because he's always that good, but because whatever he does, he makes it INTERESTING. His performance here may seem flat, but I think he's just decided to play this character as a low-key guy-- he IS the space janitor, after all. I think the archetype of this movie is in boys' initiation rituals into manhood. Val is the least mature member of his crew--he's the janitor. He has a flirtation with the only female in the film, but cannot complete it. There is a father figure who offers spiritual guidance. Then he is exiled to a planet with no females, and his father figure is taken away. He must endure a number of trials; seeing his friends turn on each other, trying to survive, etc. He begins to absorb the spiritual lessons offerred by the father figure, and has to slay a monster (the robot) at the end, before he can return to the female, matured, and ready to complete his connection with her.

My plea to directors is let us watch and judge the merits of the characters, don't tell us he's everyman, so then we will melt, cry and react emotionally!  We are smarter than you think.  Really!  We will get it without the affectations and overt pulls at the heartstrings.  What ever happened to subtlety in film?  I am sorry for those of you who think this is the best film you've ever seen.  Watch a few more movies before you make such comments.  Or maybe, just learn to watch what you do watch more critically.  Don't let yourselves be manipulated.

Our exposure of politics doesn't come close to our American cousins so when the Prime Minister does something a little out of the ordinary, it makes the news for a couple of days and then it pretty much goes away.  But we watch CNN and we keep abreast of what is happening in the USA.  And one of the things that has always struck me as silly when it comes to the judging of politicians is when their personal life becomes just as important to the public as their politics does.  The way I see it, the American public wants a person for president that just does not exist. They want someone who doesn't smoke, believes in God, goes to church, has never thought of committing adultery, has never had pre-marital sex, has never had a drink in their life, has never taken any sort of illegal drugs in their life, has never been tempted by anyone or anything to commit an indecent act, someone who never speeds, is in fantastic shape, listens to good Christian music, never curses, shouts, frowns and probably a president that never has to do number 2 in the bathroom.  They want perfection in a person when no person can be perfect.  If a president commits one act of impropriety, in anyone's eyes, then they are labeled unfit to serve.  It's like the line in some movie who's title escapes me right now, that says,  I always wondered why if someone was a prostitute all of a sudden they can't see very well.  American's want a seemingly perfect person when they themselves may be as imperfect as the next person, and that only stands to reason.The Contender is a film that takes a stand.  It takes a stand and takes it firmly.Joan Allen, in an Oscar worthy performance, plays Lane Hanson, a state senator that is being nominated for the Vice Presidency after the former died in office.  There are other politicians that feel that she should not be the V.P. and they will stop at nothing to prevent her from succeeding. It's not that her views and politics are diametric to what the others are, it's just that she is a woman.  And it also turns out that she is a woman with a past.Shelley Runyon, also an Oscar worthy performance by Gary Oldman, is the perpetrator behind the scheme to drag her name through the mud.  It seems that Lane was privy to a party in her first year of university where she may have been involved in a gang bang.  The pictures look like her and there are men that are coming forward to substantiate the story.  It is here that her character is put on trial.  We also learn that she slept with a married man, that she does not go to church and she does not believe in the Biblical God and she feels that church and school should be separate entities.  And she believes in abortion.  She is grilled by Runyon in hopes that she will crack and that her reputation is damaged enough so that the American people would never support a questionale character like this.  But Lane will not comment on her personal life.  She will not substantiate the claims of her alleged gang bang in college and the reason that she won't do so is because it is really no ones business.The problem with this is that she has been recommended by the President of the United States, to succeed as the V.P.  Now this makes the president and his advisers, particularly, Kermit Newman, played with delicious venomness by an unrecognizable Sam Elliot, also in an Oscar worthy performance, become questionable characters because they are the ones that are supporting her. To Lane's credit, she will not bow to pressure.  Not from the public, not from Runyon, and not even from the President himself, to come forward and at least admit that she did the act.  Lane vehemently maintains that her personal life should stay personal.I will not spoil the film by telling you how it turns out.  I won't even tell you how some of the situations play out.  What I will say is that the film had a grip on me.  It indoctrinated me with how it felt and what it believed.  There are not many films that have the integrity and the guts to tell it like it is.  The Contender does.  It makes us open our eyes and ask ourselves why does it really matter if someone has questionable morals. If you commited adultery, would you be fired from your job?  If you slept with 75 women or in this case, 75 men, before you got married, should you be labelled a slut and deemed not fit to serve?  What does that have to do with how capable you are to run a country and keep it's beliefs and democracy safe?  There is so much emphasis put on one's sexual appetite that we seem to forget that one has nothing to do with another.The Contender has my vote as being one of the best films to come out so far this year.  I would only put High Fidelity and Gladiator above it.  But since those two pictures have zero chance of winning Oscars, I will say that this should be the leading Contender for Oscar.10 out of 10- you will not find a better film this year.

For one thing, it moves at a far slower pace than one would ever expect from director James Cameron, who helmed the exciting actioner Aliens.  With The Abyss, he tries to mix action with profound themes, and though the result is not a bad film by a long shot, it still is quite flawed.Ed Harris plays Virgil Bud Brigman, head of an oil drilling team underwater.  He and his men are informed by the U.S. military that a nuclear submarine has sunk somewhere nearby, and they would like Brigman and his men to help retrieve any survivors.A Navy Seal Team and Brigman's ex-wife (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) arrive to help in the recovery, but soon things begin to go wrong.  Not only are there not any survivors, it seems the Navy Seals have been ordered to bring back one warhead.  The drilling habitat also encounters a disaster, killing several people, with the oxygen leaking rather quickly.  At the same time, it seems that some sort of nonterrestrial intelligence is lurking nearby, waiting to make some sort of contact, but the threat of war could possibly break any means of peace with this newly discovered race.First and foremost, The Abyss would like to be an action\/thriller and a sci-fi piece.  It's not always a successful combination nor does it always work individually.  As a matter of fact, director Brian De Palma did a much better job incorporating these elements in his own sci-fi opus Mission to Mars (a vastly underrated film).  Sure, there are some exciting, slam-bang action scenes, but not nearly as many as you would expect from Cameron, plus the fact that this is a film that runs nearly 3 hours doesn't help the pacing, either.  At some spots, the film almost feels sluggish.Cameron's own script is ambitious, perhaps more so than most of his other films (that's saying a lot), but he's more successful with romance in this film than anything else.  Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio truly have a lot of strong chemistry together and the love that begins to grow back between them is heartfelt.  Both deliver strong performances, which is better than can be said of most everybody else.  Michael Biehn has the tendency to play a military man, but I find it quite hard to believe that a Navy Seal (who should have been properly tested) would crack underneath the sea.  But Cameron isn't exactly well-known for penning brilliant dialogue, and The Abyss has its fair share of lackluster conversations between characters.  Perhaps Cameron should leave the dialogue up to somebody else to figure out.The special effects are appropriately spectacular, and why shouldn't they be.  At 70 million dollars (most expensive film at its time) the effects should be ground-breaking.  That is to say, of course, that not every visual in the film works.  There is an occasional scene that features a rather fake-looking effect, but that's a minor complaint.  Then there's the ending, which in some ways, is the best and worst part of the film.  Those sci-fi fans waiting for a grand finale full of profound themes and great special effects will enjoy it, but it might disappoint those who were just hoping for the film to keep a survivalist tone.  To be honest, I'm rather split by this.  I liked the ending in the fact that it is moderately thought-provoking and even grandiose, but it does interfere with the tone the film kept before the finale, or could it rather be that everything before the conclusion was what damaged the mood and tone.  Either way, it's a flaw that, while not by any means detrimental to the film as a whole, will cause at least some disappointment.

As a matter of fact, director Brian De Palma did a much better job incorporating these elements in his own sci-fi opus Mission to Mars (a vastly underrated film).  Sure, there are some exciting, slam-bang action scenes, but not nearly as many as you would expect from Cameron, plus the fact that this is a film that runs nearly 3 hours doesn't help the pacing, either.  At some spots, the film almost feels sluggish.Cameron's own script is ambitious, perhaps more so than most of his other films (that's saying a lot), but he's more successful with romance in this film than anything else.  Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio truly have a lot of strong chemistry together and the love that begins to grow back between them is heartfelt.  Both deliver strong performances, which is better than can be said of most everybody else.  Michael Biehn has the tendency to play a military man, but I find it quite hard to believe that a Navy Seal (who should have been properly tested) would crack underneath the sea.  But Cameron isn't exactly well-known for penning brilliant dialogue, and The Abyss has its fair share of lackluster conversations between characters.  Perhaps Cameron should leave the dialogue up to somebody else to figure out.The special effects are appropriately spectacular, and why shouldn't they be.  At 70 million dollars (most expensive film at its time) the effects should be ground-breaking.  That is to say, of course, that not every visual in the film works.  There is an occasional scene that features a rather fake-looking effect, but that's a minor complaint.  Then there's the ending, which in some ways, is the best and worst part of the film.  Those sci-fi fans waiting for a grand finale full of profound themes and great special effects will enjoy it, but it might disappoint those who were just hoping for the film to keep a survivalist tone.  To be honest, I'm rather split by this.  I liked the ending in the fact that it is moderately thought-provoking and even grandiose, but it does interfere with the tone the film kept before the finale, or could it rather be that everything before the conclusion was what damaged the mood and tone.  Either way, it's a flaw that, while not by any means detrimental to the film as a whole, will cause at least some disappointment.

For one thing, it moves at a far slower pace than one would ever expect from director James Cameron, who helmed the exciting actioner Aliens.  With The Abyss, he tries to mix action with profound themes, and though the result is not a bad film by a long shot, it still is quite flawed.Ed Harris plays Virgil Bud Brigman, head of an oil drilling team underwater.  He and his men are informed by the U.S. military that a nuclear submarine has sunk somewhere nearby, and they would like Brigman and his men to help retrieve any survivors.A Navy Seal Team and Brigman's ex-wife (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) arrive to help in the recovery, but soon things begin to go wrong.  Not only are there not any survivors, it seems the Navy Seals have been ordered to bring back one warhead.  The drilling habitat also encounters a disaster, killing several people, with the oxygen leaking rather quickly.

The nominating committee chairman Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) wants Governor Hathaway (William Peterson) to be the VP instead of Lanie, so he instigates a sex-scandal investigation to discredit Lanie so that the President will (by default) nominate his 2nd choice, Governor Hathaway, after what Shelly hopes will be American public disapproval, and therefore de-nomination, of Lanie.The Contender contains the elements of a major `politico' film, where the powers in Washington are portrayed commanding power in ways one could arguably expect them to have such control. One of those ways is that the President can order any food he likes. The President is seen constantly calling the White-House kitchen to order such food as a shark steak sandwich, oatmeal cookies with grape-sized raisins, Kung-Pao chicken, grilled cheese, etc.Shelly is in some food scenes too, at a luncheon eating a Porterhouse steak with mouth-smacking enjoyment that makes the steak look absolutely delicious. Shelly informs Laine during that lunchon that she, too, should get the Porterhouse steak (burnt on the outside). However, Lanie insists that she is a vegan and instead orders the penne.In another meeting Shelly offers Reginald Webster (Christian Slater) a licorice stick, during which time he chews on one while talking to his aide.There is something very appealing about watching a good actor\/actress eat with mouth-smack affection during an acting scene. I must confess that Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman have true `eat-n-act' appeal. Moreso, Bridges is seen lighting a cigarette, and inhaling it in a very satisfying way while he talks to the governor about nomination.The scenes that involve food help to characterize the screenplay. They add an extra dimension when done well. Woody Allen is another writer who includes many food scenes with characters who speak with mouths full of food, or who have an experience at the dinner table or at a restaurant.It takes a certain acting talent to be able to act with a mouth full of food, and I think that one of the selling points of the film is just that -- Gary Oldman & Jeff Bridges both act with perfect accuracy in every food scene. It adds credibility to the subject; these ARE busy people, after all, who multitask. They conduct business while they eat.The Contender is worth seeing just for the performances of Gary Oldman and Jeff Bridges, who are both incredibly talented actors.I am at a loss, however, while trying to figure out what type of person Shelly is supposed to represent. He IS a moral character in the film. As his wife mentions, he spearheaded an initiative that made hate crimes a felony, but in the same movie he reduces himself during the movie's confirmation hearing plot because, she said, he acts as a second-rate McCarthy in his pursuit of Laine's sex-scandal. This is a mis-mash of events. Shelly is not inherently `evil', but he does miss the point. He misses the point that a woman can be Vice-President. However he is made out to look like an idiotically-blind committee chairman, a characteristic that opposes the rest of his character development.After seeing the movie twice, I am convinced that the movie was edited in a way that misses the bigger picture..In the scene where Laine is first notified about the sex-scandal pictures, a funny thing happens. Lanie looks at a couple of the pictures, puts them down, then tilts her head and rests it in her hand as though she is deeply pensive. The film cuts immediately to the actual sex scene where a young girl is being gang-banged.This editing suggests that Lanie WAS involved in the gang-bang. In every movie I have ever watched...whenever a film shows an actor\/actress up close, then cuts to a silent scene for a few seconds...this is a method of conveying that the actor is thinking about what the viewer sees. Like a cartoon character with little bubbles forming a line to a small cloud, and inside the cloud is a sentence...we all know that the cartoon character is thinking something.In THIS scene, the film shows Laine thinking about the gang-bang, which by the way is exactly the same scene that is repeated throughout the film. So here we have Lanie, who is contemplating something. That something is the gang-bang scene. It's LANIE's gang-bang scene because the standards of filmmaking show it to be that.But here is why I am confused. At the end of the film Lanie denies the gang-bang to the President.So at the end of the film we know 2 possible things. One is that Lanie is a liar and lied to the President. But this doesn't make sense, because Lanie is a very, very moral person who has extremely high standards. She CAN'T be lying, because the entire film portrays her as one of the most high-standing individuals in the history of Washington D.C.The *second* option is that the film was just edited loosely, and the scene that cuts to Lanie thinking about the actual gang-bang, which in the rest of Hollywood would have meant that somebody was thinking about something, instead in this film seems to have been utilized so that the viewer could conceptualize the scene.I lean toward the 2nd option, because Shelly's character is underdeveloped and not nearly as complex as Gary Oldman, a genius actor, helps to create in this character. I believe that the filmmakers did not have the resources to make this film worthy of all the talent in it. It was cut and pasted together in a manner that leaves holes in what could have been a film with a bigger story to tell.That said, the film is filled with beautifully-acted scenes. I think that just about every scene is worthy of watching. To put it another way, The Contender is a patchwork where every scene is fascinating to watch for the scene's own merits. That alone makes it worth watching more than once.As a side note, it is interesting that Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and Saul Rubinek were ALL in 1993's True Romance, a brilliant film.I recommend The Contender because it is a satisfying film to watch. I felt a closeness to the characters and scenes that not many movies convey.

Woody Allen is another writer who includes many food scenes with characters who speak with mouths full of food, or who have an experience at the dinner table or at a restaurant.It takes a certain acting talent to be able to act with a mouth full of food, and I think that one of the selling points of the film is just that -- Gary Oldman & Jeff Bridges both act with perfect accuracy in every food scene.

They conduct business while they eat.The Contender is worth seeing just for the performances of Gary Oldman and Jeff Bridges, who are both incredibly talented actors.I am at a loss, however, while trying to figure out what type of person Shelly is supposed to represent.

However he is made out to look like an idiotically-blind committee chairman, a characteristic that opposes the rest of his character development.After seeing the movie twice, I am convinced that the movie was edited in a way that misses the bigger picture..In the scene where Laine is first notified about the sex-scandal pictures, a funny thing happens. Lanie looks at a couple of the pictures, puts them down, then tilts her head and rests it in her hand as though she is deeply pensive.

In every movie I have ever watched...whenever a film shows an actor\/actress up close, then cuts to a silent scene for a few seconds...this is a method of conveying that the actor is thinking about what the viewer sees. Like a cartoon character with little bubbles forming a line to a small cloud, and inside the cloud is a sentence...we all know that the cartoon character is thinking something.In THIS scene, the film shows Laine thinking about the gang-bang, which by the way is exactly the same scene that is repeated throughout the film. So here we have Lanie, who is contemplating something. That something is the gang-bang scene. It's LANIE's gang-bang scene because the standards of filmmaking show it to be that.But here is why I am confused. At the end of the film Lanie denies the gang-bang to the President.So at the end of the film we know 2 possible things. One is that Lanie is a liar and lied to the President. But this doesn't make sense, because Lanie is a very, very moral person who has extremely high standards. She CAN'T be lying, because the entire film portrays her as one of the most high-standing individuals in the history of Washington D.C.The *second* option is that the film was just edited loosely, and the scene that cuts to Lanie thinking about the actual gang-bang, which in the rest of Hollywood would have meant that somebody was thinking about something, instead in this film seems to have been utilized so that the viewer could conceptualize the scene.I lean toward the 2nd option, because Shelly's character is underdeveloped and not nearly as complex as Gary Oldman, a genius actor, helps to create in this character. I believe that the filmmakers did not have the resources to make this film worthy of all the talent in it. It was cut and pasted together in a manner that leaves holes in what could have been a film with a bigger story to tell.That said, the film is filled with beautifully-acted scenes. I think that just about every scene is worthy of watching. To put it another way, The Contender is a patchwork where every scene is fascinating to watch for the scene's own merits. That alone makes it worth watching more than once.As a side note, it is interesting that Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and Saul Rubinek were ALL in 1993's True Romance, a brilliant film.I recommend The Contender because it is a satisfying film to watch. I felt a closeness to the characters and scenes that not many movies convey.

The nominating committee chairman Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) wants Governor Hathaway (William Peterson) to be the VP instead of Lanie, so he instigates a sex-scandal investigation to discredit Lanie so that the President will (by default) nominate his 2nd choice, Governor Hathaway, after what Shelly hopes will be American public disapproval, and therefore de-nomination, of Lanie.The Contender contains the elements of a major `politico' film, where the powers in Washington are portrayed commanding power in ways one could arguably expect them to have such control. One of those ways is that the President can order any food he likes. The President is seen constantly calling the White-House kitchen to order such food as a shark steak sandwich, oatmeal cookies with grape-sized raisins, Kung-Pao chicken, grilled cheese, etc.Shelly is in some food scenes too, at a luncheon eating a Porterhouse steak with mouth-smacking enjoyment that makes the steak look absolutely delicious. Shelly informs Laine during that lunchon that she, too, should get the Porterhouse steak (burnt on the outside). However, Lanie insists that she is a vegan and instead orders the penne.In another meeting Shelly offers Reginald Webster (Christian Slater) a licorice stick, during which time he chews on one while talking to his aide.There is something very appealing about watching a good actor\/actress eat with mouth-smack affection during an acting scene. I must confess that Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman have true `eat-n-act' appeal. Moreso, Bridges is seen lighting a cigarette, and inhaling it in a very satisfying way while he talks to the governor about nomination.The scenes that involve food help to characterize the screenplay.
