In fact, I think that only the great Robert Mitchum seemed better cast as Marlowe, but Bogie surely gets away with doing what he does best playing a wise-talking detective in a similar vein to his Sam Spade of 'The Maltese Falcon'(1941).Within minutes, you can tell that this is a Warner Brothers film. The minute Marlowe walks into the Acme Book Shop! But it's all okay. It certainly adds to the charm to see Bogie sharing a drink with a knowledgeable young book seller who, when she removes her spectacles, becomes a seductive potential conquest.Undoubtedly, this is also one of those films that served as a vehicle for both Bogart and Lauren Bacall, as they remain the most memorable characters, getting into several scrapes and several scenes that hold a lot of comic lure without sliding into slapstick.Amongst the supporting cast, Sonia Darrin as Agnes Lowzier, Louis Jean Heydt as Joe Brody and Martha Vickers as Carmen Sternwood really stand out. Even Elisha Cook Jr. returns from the 'The Maltese Falcon', albeit in a slightly different role. Vickers in particular, in the few small scenes that she has, really could have excelled as the literally Looney Tunes Carmen, but the role was scaled back in order to satisfy the Hayes production code of the time (and, according to Chandler himself, to prevent her from upstaging Bacall). Other areas of the plot are also scaled back for similar reasons (especially the Geiger pornography\/blackmail plot)and, although Chandler purists may baulk at them, this is, after all, an adaptation and is, thus, open to interpretation.On that note, John Ridgely is, sadly, underwhelming in the pivotal role of Eddie Mars and Charles Waldron is simply an old man sat in a wheelchair when compared with the dying and crippled General Guy Sternwood of the novel. However, Charles D. Brown is quite entertaining at times as the Sternwood butler, Norris, even if he is a bit wooden.But the charm of the Bogie 'Big Sleep' is in its atmosphere. From the rain-soaked residential streets and high-rises of 1946 Los Angeles to Mars' jolly countryside gambling club and the honky-tonk bistro where Bogie's Marlowe meets Bacall's Vivian Rutledge, this really is a gem, despite Raymond Chandler's absence from script duties ((he was busy writing the screenplay to 'The Blue Dahlia (1946)).In fact, it appeared that it was Bogie and Bacall that the audience paid to see, and the on-screen chemistry between the two is obvious, from their jokey arguments to the characters' whirlwind romance. So obvious, in fact, that several exposition scenes of dialogue explaining the plot of the film were deleted and scenes re-shot so as to focus on the future Mr. and Mrs Bogart!!An awesome adaptation of an awesome and engaging novel, 'The Big Sleep', though focusing on Bogart and Bacall, and lacking a truly inspired supporting cast, has the distinction of being an adaptation set in Chandler's Los Angeles.The 8\/10 was awarded because, despite its flaws and the focus on the personal love affair of its stars, this really is an entertaining Chandler adaptation that is well worth a watch, both for crime buffs and Chandler die-hards alike!

Although it's far from his best film, Hooper clearly had big visions for Lifeforce and, with some confidant support from the film's producers, it looks visually impressive. Starting out as essentially an Alien (1979) rip-off (didn't they all around this era?), the film moves on to vampire movie, action movie, zombie movie and then disaster movie. It's an insane trip, but, if you can forgive its many, many flaws, this is actually a lot of fun.The crew of space shuttle Churchill locate an alien craft inside the corona of Halley's Comet, and inside they find hundreds of dead alien bodies, as well as three humanoids, suspended and frozen inside glass pods. On their return journey, all contact is lost with mission control. The rescue mission find the entire crew dead from a fire, but the humanoids intact. The aliens are taken back to a research centre in London, watched over by Dr. Fallada (Frank Finlay). While there, the female alien awakens and sucks the 'life force' out of a guard, turning him into a shrivelled zombie. She escapes, and S.A.S. operative Col. Caine (Peter Firth) and Col. Carlsen (Steve Railsback) - whose escape pod from Churchill is found in Texas - start trying to track down the mysterious alien vampire.If the movie has one trump card, it is in the form of Mathilda May, who plays the female vampire. She is a woman of such staggering beauty that you can understand Carlsen's relentless pursuit of her, and the storyline that she has placed a kind of a love spell on him seems that little bit less ridiculous. Special mention must also go to John Dykstra (winner of the Academy Award for Star Wars (1977)), whose special- effects are still impressive to this day. The problems are that the plot is too convoluted, the acting is awkward, and Tobe Hooper over-reaches himself. It seems like his vision was so big, that he forgot to make it small enough to fit into 116 minutes and make a coherent movie.

Plus, Rashomon is now in the public domain, so you can watch it for free legally on the Internet. Which you should. I watched it for the first time when I was very young, but it wasn't until later years that I could fully appreciate it. It's a movie for adults in the best sense of the word.Strangely, while Rashomon was celebrated by international critics, Japanese critics didn't like it and suggested that it appealed to Westeners only because it was exotic, as Kurosawa bitterly noticed. Well, a prophet has no honor in his own country. Although it cannot be denied that the exoticism of Rashomon adds to its appeal, that alone cannot explain the out-of-nowhere international success of this movie. There has to be something about Rashomon that strikes a chord in viewers independent of their cultural background. I think it has something to do with the fact that - intentionally or not - Rashomon plays with an archetypal constellation, a pattern more or less subconsciously known, and thus understood, in all cultures (and often expressed by mythological figures) The Trickster. A trickster constellation is a pattern where several or all of the following occur simultaneously deception, disruption, reduced sexual inhibition, blurring of boundaries, and magical practices. Rashomon is about all of that. The tragedy begins with an act of deception by the bandit Tajomaru, and the deception doesn't end there. The events are disruptive - especially, of course, to the murdered Samurai and his wife. Obviously, uncontrolled sexuality plays a role as well, as does the blurring of boundaries. Ultimatily, Rashomon blurs the boundaries between truth and fiction. Even the supernatural aspect is there A dead man speaking from his grave through a medium, once again blurring a boundary, namely that between the living and the dead. The feelings of dread expressed by the monk near the end are also in line with trickster phenomena. At least that's what Jungian psychology says. Looking at the creation of Rashomon and at its international reception, I have come to believe that there's more to archetypal psychology than I once thought.Now, I think there is a reason why foreign critics liked the movie better than Japanese critics. It is simple but paradoxical It is easier for foreigners to detect the psychological content of the movie. For a foreigner, much of the movie is exotic. Yet the more exotic a movie is for a viewer, the easier it is for him to spot the aspects of it which are familiar, which are fundamentally human and independent of culture.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"12 November 2013","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" If you like Asian movies, Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon is a definite must-see because it is not only an overall great film but also the first Japanese film that became an international success, a classic that started it all. Plus, Rashomon is now in the public domain, so you can watch it for free legally on the Internet. Which you should. I watched it for the first time when I was very young, but it wasn't until later years that I could fully appreciate it. It's a movie for adults in the best sense of the word.Strangely, while Rashomon was celebrated by international critics, Japanese critics didn't like it and suggested that it appealed to Westeners only because it was exotic, as Kurosawa bitterly noticed. Well, a prophet has no honor in his own country. Although it cannot be denied that the exoticism of Rashomon adds to its appeal, that alone cannot explain the out-of-nowhere international success of this movie. There has to be something about Rashomon that strikes a chord in viewers independent of their cultural background. I think it has something to do with the fact that - intentionally or not - Rashomon plays with an archetypal constellation, a pattern more or less subconsciously known, and thus understood, in all cultures (and often expressed by mythological figures) The Trickster. A trickster constellation is a pattern where several or all of the following occur simultaneously deception, disruption, reduced sexual inhibition, blurring of boundaries, and magical practices. Rashomon is about all of that. The tragedy begins with an act of deception by the bandit Tajomaru, and the deception doesn't end there. The events are disruptive - especially, of course, to the murdered Samurai and his wife. Obviously, uncontrolled sexuality plays a role as well, as does the blurring of boundaries. Ultimatily, Rashomon blurs the boundaries between truth and fiction. Even the supernatural aspect is there A dead man speaking from his grave through a medium, once again blurring a boundary, namely that between the living and the dead. The feelings of dread expressed by the monk near the end are also in line with trickster phenomena. At least that's what Jungian psychology says. Looking at the creation of Rashomon and at its international reception, I have come to believe that there's more to archetypal psychology than I once thought.Now, I think there is a reason why foreign critics liked the movie better than Japanese critics. It is simple but paradoxical It is easier for foreigners to detect the psychological content of the movie. For a foreigner, much of the movie is exotic. Yet the more exotic a movie is for a viewer, the easier it is for him to spot the aspects of it which are familiar, which are fundamentally human and independent of culture. Hence, foreigners are in advantage when it comes to noticing the psychology of the movie. This paradox, again, fits nicely with the trickster character of Rashomon.

So America's first several centuries certainly had its faults, the most obvious of which was its European explorers who claimed to have discovered it yet basically banished or enslaved the natives who were already here and had already discovered it. But as the American colonies grew, so did the desire for those under British rule to form a new nation, and the congress congregated in Philadelphia were even divided about that. These long-ago patriots included famous inventors and future presidents, several state governors and notorious rebels. Here, the focus is on three of these men with others given moments in the spotlight to share their history. Future presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, who have had their own more truthful tales revealed through T.V. and movies, and Benjamin Franklin, inventor extraordinary who has had more controversy revealed yet remains one of our greatest non-presidential figures ever in the American history books.The Broadway musical shocked everybody with its success, most theater people convinced that a musical about a basic High School History lesson would bomb quicker than the Americans over Hiroshima. But the way in which the story was told, passionately, elegantly and quaintly, surprised even the most cynical of critics, and the show ran for years, producing this motion picture as a result and later a successful revival that managed to extend past its intended limited run. The secret to the success of the show is the passion put into each of these characters, not simply American folk heroes whom we've only seen paintings of, but flesh and blood men and a few women who had dreams, passions and ideals, even if some of them have been a bit soiled over the years.William Daniels heads the pack as John Adams, the future second president (and first V.P.) who realized he was too obnoxious and disliked to write the Declaration of Independence. Adams may not be the most popular man in the congress (which he considers three or more useless men to be considered), but as you see his intentions and his desperation (told with sweet vignettes concerning his wife, seen in dream sequences describing their letters to each other), you can't help but like him. Benjamin Franklin, as played by Howard da Silva, is a lovable rascal, a bit perverted (although history has insinuated it to be more so), and every inch the bigger than life man his legacy has made him out to be. Future White Shadow Ken Howard is the soft spoken Thomas Jefferson, and while his controversial life as father to one of his slaves' children has since been revealed, here, it is his silent love for writing and his beautiful wife (Blythe Danner in one of her earliest roles) that makes him get down to write the most famous document in American history. Virginia Vestoff is tender as the feisty but loyal Abigal, and her singing several romantic duets with Daniels is one of the film's many highlights.For Daniels, Da Silva and Danner, there is the show-stopping He Plays the Violin where Danner confides the quiet Jefferson's secret of lovemaking to them. It leads into a lively dance sequence that proves you don't need tons of chorus people to make you tap your feet. Daniels and Da Silva are joined by Howard for The Egg in which they seemingly fictionally imagine what bird will be made the symbol of their hopeful new nation. In spite of its obvious falsity, the sequence is a symbol of hope that probably every patriot of a new nation felt as they stepped forward to change the course of history.The other congress people are a magnificent bunch of Broadway and Film actors, especially Ron Holgate as Richard Henry Lee, repeating his Tony Winning role with the show-stopping Lee's of Old Virginia, theater legend John Cullum as Edward Ruthledge who is determined to keep slavery alive in spite of objections of the northerners in congress, Roy Poole as the drunken Stephen Hopkins, William Hansen totally moving as the seemingly dying Cesar Rodney, original Annie Get Your Gun co-star Ray Middleton as the very Scottish Thomas McKean, David Ford as Congressional President John Hancock (the first man to sign the declaration, hence the slang term give me your J.H.) and John Myhers as the portly Robert Livingston. Along with Rex Robbins, Daniels, Da Silva, Howard and Mhyers sing the rousingly unforgettable But Mr. Adams in which the declaration committee argues over who will actually write it. Also memorable is William Duell as the feisty Andrew McNair, the congressional custodian who gets his own moment when he sings a bit of the moving Mama, Look Sharp, an obviously anti-war song about what was going on at the time in Vietnam with young innocent men being killed or maimed. Future Benson governor James Noble is obviously recognizable as one of the New Jersey delegates. Fans of the 1984 Academy Award Winning Best Film Amadeus will recognize a few of the smaller roles here from that later masterpiece which ironically took place at the same time yet many thousands of miles away. You can't call all of this the truth although many of the lines have been proved to have been actually spoken by the men who say them on screen here. Beautifully photographed and scored with an opening credit scene that reminded me of paintings of Charles Dickens novels, 1776 is a must see, not only for theater fans and history students, but practically everybody else who loves what America stands for.
