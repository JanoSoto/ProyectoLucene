If you're more or less a casual film fan, who watches movies once in a while, you might not like this too much. As for me, I'm sort of in a transitional stage, so I enjoyed myself without understanding everything. Considering that this film comes from Robert Altman (look at his profile, click on some links for his movies if you don't know who he is. His movies are weird and usually have good casts), you can expect it to have some weird features. The story follows Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), a Hollywood executive that has a million and a half mediocre ideas thrown at him every day. One day, he has a couple of drinks with a writer (Vincent D'Onofrio) and ends up killing him. The movie is basically plotless, and yet complicated. Griffin goes paranoid and thinks everyone is after him, including a pair of cops, played by Whoopi Goldberg and Lyle Lovett. The movie is splendid, right from the opening shot played as an homage to Hitchcock'S Rope. The opening shot is eight minutes long, without a single cut. It just pans all over the place as people talk. The performances by the main cast are pretty good, especially Robbins. But the part that's really worth seeing is the ton of celebrity cameos. Just about the whole world shows up here. Bruce Willis, Cher, Elliot Gould, Rod Steiger, Julia Roberts, Anjelica Huston, Lily Tomlin, Burt Reynolds, Mimi Rogers, Susan Sarandon, Nick Nolte,Marlee Matlin and Jeff Goldblum are just some of the cameos. The in-jokes are very funny if you can understand them, and the whole pace of the movie is good, if a little overlong. (It's not really that long,either.) If you think you know enough about movies and Hollywood, then take a crack at The Player.

Although not exactly original, the scene where the federal witness is kidnapped from an airplane in mid-flight is pretty well-done, however improbable, and it leads into a fairly interesting story involving Gary Busey back in the bad guy type of role that he plays best and, ironically enough, he steals the show.There are two main problems with Drop Zone, one of them is Wesley Snipes, and the other one is the badly screwed up skydiving scenes. Snipes delivers an awful performance in a role strikingly similar to Keanu Reeves' role in Point Break. Look for example, at his goofy antics after his first jump. This is just dumb acting, and it really takes a lot away from what might otherwise have been a much better film. .However, if this film was to be of any quality at all, there had to be a complete overhaul and reconstruction of the idiotic skydiving scenes. There were quite a few scenes that contained actual footage of skydiving, but there were falsified close-ups edited into those scenes that completely ruined them as a whole. As a novice skydiver myself, these half-assed attempts at re-creating the mind-blowing reality of skydiving were very disturbing because they were so unrealistic. Besides that, some of the smart-ass stunts were even worse. For example, early in the film when Jessie drops Snipes through a trapdoor in the bottom of the plane without a parachute (she didn't like him at the beginning), the pilot makes a comment to her about how she wouldn't normally do something like that (if I remember correctly), she says something back, and then finally jumps out after him, catches up to him, secures him to her, opens her parachute, and they skydive safely the rest of the way to the ground. This is just total nonsense, and I hate seeing total nonsense in movies. In order to make airborne contact with another skydiver in the air, particularly before opening your chute, you literally have to jump out of the plane right on top of that person. If you wait more than about 2 seconds after they jump, they're already so far away and so lost in the tremendous sky that you won't even be able to see them again until after that person opens their chute. Keep in mind that when you jump out of a plane the sky is all around you, not just above you, and you're moving at high speed, so it's extremely difficult not to lose someone up there. Besides that, about 2 seconds after jumping from the plane, you can no longer tell which direction the plane was traveling, so you don't know which direction is backward, making it even more difficult to locate someone who jumped before you. In real life, that cute little stunt she pulled to give him a little scare would have meant certain death for him. The botched production of the skydiving element of this film was a huge disappointment, which is significant, given the name of the movie. On the other hand, it had a pretty interesting crime story that provided for some good action, and thank God Gary Busey was in this, because he really saved the movie from being a total loss. But I guess if you've never gone skydiving yourself, you probably won't notice all of those screw-ups as much as I did.

I thought the final scenes with Julianne and Hopkins, after the dinner were as beautiful and as intense as anything i have ever scene on the screen. This moment was only enhanced by the horror of what we had just seen prior to this. A sign of a good movie, sometimes, is one that actually has a physical effect on you. Of course, any gore can accomplish this. (Note Mason Verger's character could accomplish this on its own!) Yet, when intensity of storyline, gore, character, and music come from quality sources, you take it all the more seriously, such as with anything in life.

Although I think someone else could've nailed that part just as well as she could've (or better) she played as best she could.I thought the 2 guys protecting the drug-dealer-guy were funny. The Hispanic one was in Magnolia and was equally funny in that one.EVERYONE ACTS GREAT IN THIS FILM. Everyone!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!**************************************************There's even that small part with the guy who asks Benecio del Toro for a cig, then ends up getting hired by Catherine Zeta-Jones to kill that other guy but gets killed in the parking lot before he can do it. Even he's awesome. END SPOILER =)   END SPOILER =) END SPOILER =) **************This is the kind of film that will probably get newcomers or already-known actors noticed.I felt the pacing of the film was also great. It was always engrossing. My boyfriend was kinda upset at the role Dennis Quaid played in it, but as long as the shoe fit...................ps. It's also with movies like these that I unfortunately don't see getting as much revenue as deserved. Most people won't want to see this again and again, because it is oftentimes disturbing. However, I admit that I'd see this again over Magnolia, simply because this relied a tad bit more on the actor's performances and the plot rather than style and score.ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!*****  I thought the ending credits, with the baseball game was perfect. I was so close to crying in the end, just because the ending was so beautiful.********************END SPOILEREveryone should go see this. Even little kids. Believe me; it WILL TAKE THE GLAMOUR OUT OF DOING SMACK OR ANY OTHER KIND OF DRUG.OH........one more thing. I don't feel using 4 or 5 subplots in this kind of movie is confusing...on the contrary..it puts things more into perspective. In a David Spade movie, you don't want many subplots. But for an earnest view at important subject matter, I feel it is essential.Plus it keeps the film from getting boring!

But on the other, hand, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is still a great movie. There are some incredible fight scenes, in particular. This movie had women fighting with swords in scenes that were faster and more impressive than anything that I've ever seen from Jackie Chan or Jet Li. This was by far the best element of the film, by the way - the stunning fight scenes, particularly the ones that were executed while the fighters were on the ground as opposed to flying inexplicably through the atmosphere.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a film that you really have to watch more than once in order to fully understand it, not only because of the complex plot, but also the fact that there is just so much going on that there is a lot that you can miss in only one viewing. Sure, it's subtitled, but is that really such a big deal? A lot of people complain that they can't really watch the movie because they are always trying to read what's going on in the subtitles. Well, if it takes someone so long to read one line of dialogue at a time that they are unable to pay attention to what is actually happening on screen, then it might be a better idea to stay home and work on reading skills instead of going out to the movies. You can almost always be sure that a foreign film will be good, because foreign countries don't ship out their crappy movies for the world to see. The best ones are weeded out and those are what we get, and Crouching tiger, Hidden Dragon is no exception.(spoilers) The incredible martial arts strongly overshadow what would otherwise be the main plot of the film, which is that of a young woman, the daughter of a nobleman, who is being forced to marry against her will, and yearns for a more dangerous and exciting life. Having been sheltered for most of her life, she wants to experience the excitement of a different life, and when she enters into that life, she obviously finds many more problems and troubles than she had anticipated. She encounters a goofy guy who steals her comb (providing for some good laughs), and a rather unlikely but surprisingly effective romance develops between the two.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon contains a lot of fairly strong feminism. Women are portrayed as being very powerful and independent, which is a refreshing thing to see in the movies. There's nothing worse than seeing a movie where the female characters are just stupid bimbos. That may sound kind of extreme, but my point is that in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the role of women stands out because the difference is so strong that it really grabs your attention.

I bet that 90% of us who saw the movie could not  grasp the significance of the film's coda.

Let me leave a few clues to what I am referring to  ( Warning to those who sadly haven't seen the film yet Spoilers ahead)If you are going to a second viewing of CTHD, take time to-a) Relish the sexual tension between two of the the protagonists when they first met. And I don't mean, in the desert!b) Notice their eyes glazed over and became limpid when they stared at each other over their crossed swords. Can anybody spell R-E-X complex ?c) Think over why she dispatched her handsome brigand lover; after all he travelled great distance to come to her. And inspite of the red hot passion that had earlier transpired between them, why did she turned cold ?  Really puts the flashback into perspective, eh?  She could have so easily followed him back into the desert to evade the marriage, but she felt so utterly confused and guilty.  Having been smitten in a 5-minute encounter, she chose to punish herself for harboring irrational and wildly desirous feelings for a total stranger that she subjected herself into going ahead with the loveless marriage. Is this a way to curb her unheathly desire and put an end to it ? Is this an act of atonement for forsaking Lo after her runaway feelings for someone else ? Isn't irrational love at first sight and irrepressible desire for someone you meet for the first time, a rhetorical crouching tiger, hidden dragon ?d) Consider the overladen implication of Li's offer to Jen to have her follow him to Wudan Mountain as his disciple ? This is indeed a proposition fraught with dangerous precedence and implications.For Li Mu Bai This is my chance to break this wrongful discriminating Wudan tradition of not imparting martial art skills to women. This injustice had banefully brought us to this sorrowful Jade Fox treacherous episode. Also, I need to turn Jen away from the Dark Side and show her the Way (Tao)of the Giang Hu.  Lately, my meditation has not gone well ( he confided to ShuLien but not in so many words ) because I am in conflict with myself.  I am determined to give away Green Destiny and not pursue this rather dubious revenge ( after all, Jade Fox is as much a victim) and yet it pains me because I am bound by honor and tradition to exact it. I thought I can submerge all this Giang Hu righteousness and repair to a serene non-martial life loving ShuLien and now this happens !  Didn't someone said that those who lives by the sword -------.For Jen  I thought my love for Lo is strong but what is this strange feeling coming over me ? Am I spellbound by Li Mu Bai ? Is this an re-enactment of the dangerous liaison between mentor and pupil ? Is this dejavu all over again as with Jade Fox.  Yet I am so much drawn into this maelstrom.  I envy ShuLien for her Giang Hu life when I met her.  Now it seems that I am just jealous of her.... like two sisters in love with the same man.  Maybe it is best that I steal Green Destiny a second time and lose myself in the Giang Hu world and not succumb to my desire for an older man.For Yu ShuLien Oh no, don't let this happen, I may lose him to youth.  Jen has fallen for him, the same way I did even though I was bethrothed then to his brother-in-arms, years ago.  After my fiance's death, Li and I suppress our feelings out of despair and unsurmountable guilt because we have our suspicion that my fiance sacrificed himself to save Li in battle after stumbling upon our secret love.

I am beginning to detest her.For Lo  Whatever has happened to Jen? She has changed.  She has lost that lovelight in her eyes! *Sigh* I have come this far to Peking for naught.For Jade Fox  I had to kill Li Mu Bai's mentor for stealing my innocence. Now, I will have to kill Li Mu Bai for stealing my innocent.e) Savor the dripping irony in the kiln scene where a drippingly wet and sensual Jen holding tightly onto the sword, stuporified with Jade Fox's potion and stupefied with sudden unseated emotion, issued a challenge to  i Mu Bai to &#145;come clean' with a double entendre, pregnant with possibilities, ` Is it ME or the Green Destiny, that you come for ?'. (Emphasis is mine.) Li Mu Bai was taken aback by Jen's forthrightness.  His mojo was shaken, for sure.  The undercurrent is so thick that only a Green Destiny can slice through.  The first time I saw the scene, I was nonplussed. The second time epiphany !f) Experience the split second pain and consternation that shot through Yun ShuLien when she stumbled onto the kiln scene, catching Li Mu Bai laying hands on Jen to extricate the drug from her body. It's honorable; not what she thought but the expression on her face goes What the heck is going on....? Oh holy bogdhisattva, my worst nightmare has come true !( And I mean, this is before Li Mu Bai took a vicious purple Yin poison dart in his jugular!)g) Feel the dreamy passion playing on Jen's face when she took flight at the end, leaving Lo as an also-ran on the bridge.  Lo's demeanor seemed to show a zen of understanding as Jen plunged or soared (your pick) to join her deceased hero. Truly, Jen's is a magnificent obsession &#133; to the end.  Puts a whole new meaning to the words Fatal Attraction, isn't it ?( By the way, only the charismatic Chow Yun-Fat has the sheer magnetism to pull that off -- to stir a young damsel's blood and set her heart a'flutter; Jet Li just won't cut it being Li Mu Bai.  When Chow came aboard replacing Jet Li, it was a godsend and Ang Lee judiciously tailored the script, insert the innuendo of Jen's infatuation and expanded Li Mu Bai's screen presence to showcase Chow Yun-Fat's screen presence. )h) Finally, some wag in some review, has called Green Destiny, a phallic symbol.

Isn't irrational love at first sight and irrepressible desire for someone you meet for the first time, a rhetorical crouching tiger, hidden dragon ?d) Consider the overladen implication of Li's offer to Jen to have her follow him to Wudan Mountain as his disciple ? This is indeed a proposition fraught with dangerous precedence and implications.For Li Mu Bai This is my chance to break this wrongful discriminating Wudan tradition of not imparting martial art skills to women. This injustice had banefully brought us to this sorrowful Jade Fox treacherous episode. Also, I need to turn Jen away from the Dark Side and show her the Way (Tao)of the Giang Hu.  Lately, my meditation has not gone well ( he confided to ShuLien but not in so many words ) because I am in conflict with myself.  I am determined to give away Green Destiny and not pursue this rather dubious revenge ( after all, Jade Fox is as much a victim) and yet it pains me because I am bound by honor and tradition to exact it. I thought I can submerge all this Giang Hu righteousness and repair to a serene non-martial life loving ShuLien and now this happens !  Didn't someone said that those who lives by the sword -------.For Jen  I thought my love for Lo is strong but what is this strange feeling coming over me ? Am I spellbound by Li Mu Bai ? Is this an re-enactment of the dangerous liaison between mentor and pupil ? Is this dejavu all over again as with Jade Fox.  Yet I am so much drawn into this maelstrom.  I envy ShuLien for her Giang Hu life when I met her.  Now it seems that I am just jealous of her.... like two sisters in love with the same man.  Maybe it is best that I steal Green Destiny a second time and lose myself in the Giang Hu world and not succumb to my desire for an older man.For Yu ShuLien Oh no, don't let this happen, I may lose him to youth.  Jen has fallen for him, the same way I did even though I was bethrothed then to his brother-in-arms, years ago.  After my fiance's death, Li and I suppress our feelings out of despair and unsurmountable guilt because we have our suspicion that my fiance sacrificed himself to save Li in battle after stumbling upon our secret love. ( this is my conjecture, ha ha ).  After all these wasted years, Mu Bai has finally transcend his guilty feelings to be with me ..... And now this has to happen ! I am beginning to detest her.For Lo  Whatever has happened to Jen? She has changed.  She has lost that lovelight in her eyes! *Sigh* I have come this far to Peking for naught.For Jade Fox  I had to kill Li Mu Bai's mentor for stealing my innocence. Now, I will have to kill Li Mu Bai for stealing my innocent.e) Savor the dripping irony in the kiln scene where a drippingly wet and sensual Jen holding tightly onto the sword, stuporified with Jade Fox's potion and stupefied with sudden unseated emotion, issued a challenge to  i Mu Bai to &#145;come clean' with a double entendre, pregnant with possibilities, ` Is it ME or the Green Destiny, that you come for ?'. (Emphasis is mine.) Li Mu Bai was taken aback by Jen's forthrightness.  His mojo was shaken, for sure.  The undercurrent is so thick that only a Green Destiny can slice through.  The first time I saw the scene, I was nonplussed. The second time epiphany !f) Experience the split second pain and consternation that shot through Yun ShuLien when she stumbled onto the kiln scene, catching Li Mu Bai laying hands on Jen to extricate the drug from her body. It's honorable; not what she thought but the expression on her face goes What the heck is going on....? Oh holy bogdhisattva, my worst nightmare has come true !( And I mean, this is before Li Mu Bai took a vicious purple Yin poison dart in his jugular!)g) Feel the dreamy passion playing on Jen's face when she took flight at the end, leaving Lo as an also-ran on the bridge.  Lo's demeanor seemed to show a zen of understanding as Jen plunged or soared (your pick) to join her deceased hero. Truly, Jen's is a magnificent obsession &#133; to the end.  Puts a whole new meaning to the words Fatal Attraction, isn't it ?( By the way, only the charismatic Chow Yun-Fat has the sheer magnetism to pull that off -- to stir a young damsel's blood and set her heart a'flutter; Jet Li just won't cut it being Li Mu Bai.  When Chow came aboard replacing Jet Li, it was a godsend and Ang Lee judiciously tailored the script, insert the innuendo of Jen's infatuation and expanded Li Mu Bai's screen presence to showcase Chow Yun-Fat's screen presence. )h) Finally, some wag in some review, has called Green Destiny, a phallic symbol. Li Mu Bai's.? Very allegorical and very true.  Many a true word is spoken in jest. Yes?Like I've said, only Ang Lee with the assistance of his very capable writers, Shamus et al, can construct such a powerful yet subtle masterpiece. Truly this film is a Sense and Sensibility  with martial arts.  With deference to those who disparagingly called this a kung phooey movie with nonsensical flying, I said to them ` Take your blinders off, my friends and let your hearts take flight', if not, then Take a hike.`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is one of the top 10 films of all time. Well done, Ang Lee. Hopefully, you have paved the way for further celluloid excellence to be followed in this new century.  Hollywood, please take note.In case you haven't noticed, as Wo Hu Zang Long goes up from 10 to 9 on the IMDB Top 250, my vote for it goes from a 9 point to a 10. Giving it any less is a sacrilege !Hey, everyone move back and make room on the bandwagon for me. Glad to join you all on board.And Mr. L. Santoro ( love your fantastic review ) extend me your hand, help me climb aboard before we all get hemmed in by the arrival of the Oscars.

HEAVEN CAN WAIT was a remake of HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, but with it's funny script and good acting, it was fun.  Now a remake of a remake is out, and it's DOWN TO EARTH.  And like another remake of a remake (LAST MAN STANDING) you wonder why people even bother.  But DOWN TO EARTH does have some enjoyable moments, but not enough to recommend it.      Chris Rock (in Warren Beatty's place)stars as Lance Barton, a delivery boy who is trying to become a successful comedian.  His agent, Whitney (Frankie Faison, in Jack Warden's role) says that he needs to work on his public skills.  As Lance leaves Whitney, he keeps his eyes fixated on Suntee (Regina King, doing Julie Christie) which leads to Lance getting hit by a semi-truck, exactly like HEAVEN CAN WAIT.  Lance meets angels Keyes (Eugene Levy, the Buck Henry role) and Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri, the James Mason role) who say that Lance can return to Earth in someone else's body.  Yet, unlike HEAVEN CAN WAIT it doesn't explain on why Lance has to choose a different body.  In HEAVEN CAN WAIT, Beatty character's body was creamated, Rock's it's part of the rules.  So Lance returns in the body of a mega-millionare, with a cheating wife (Jennifer Coolidge-Dyan Cannon) and crooked assistant (Greg Germann-Charles Grodin) who were trying to kill the millionare.  With Lance in the body of this powerful man, he tries to win the affection of Suntee by giving more to charity.  And Lance in the body of a 55 year old man, who is balding and chubby, he makes a effort to perform at the closing of the Apollo Theater.  In the meantime, the wife and assistant try another plan to kill the husband\/boss.      Seeing HEAVEN CAN WAIT before this, I saw the entire outline of this film before watching it.  But what Paramount probably wants those who already seen HEAVEN to enjoy are the jokes.  There are some funny jokes in the film that Rock delivers, and I enjoy Chris Rock a lot more than Martin Lawrence.

Rock has been able to elivate films with his outstanding supporting roles including them in New Jack City, Dogma and Nurse Betty (Betty and Dogma actually getting such a boost by him they got in my top ten lists), but here, he is brought on the second time in a starring role.  While he is slightly funnier here than in CB4, he isn't as good as he could've been.  What Rock stars in is a remake of a remake that is probably from a play and that might also be a flaw.  Rock and his staff of writers (ie Chris Rock show) do what they can with they're script about a flawful comedian named Lance who gets sent up to heaven to early and is sent back in a body for a short while, except the body is white.  While many of the scenes with Rock as Lance inside the old white guy aren't laugh out loud funny, they are interesting for me being a Chris Rock fan (seeing a man like the one Chris gets himself into telling his famous Black Mall skit had me thinking while laughing).  Not always on the money, to say the least, but it isn't a waste of total time.

But the reviews and word of mouth were so good that I made the effort and - together with my 24 year old son - I found a powerful and challenging work.Both the subject matter and the style make this an uneasy experience. It's no fun seeing young people overdosing or turning to prostitution and the whole movie is shot in a grainy, bleached, jerky documentary style with rapid inter-cutting of different narratives.  Director Steven Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan take a social problem so often viewed in simplistic terms and present a multi-layered, multi-faceted approach, devoid of easy answers and even any answers at all. The final line if dialogue is `We're here to listen' and I guess that the purpose of the movie is to make us think rather than to offer us a solution.This is one of those films in which there are many good performances and no one is allowed to overshadow the subject matter itself. Real life husband and wife Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones play respectively a judge turned drugs czar and a naïve wife turned drug baroness, but they never appear on screen together. There are some excellent roles for minority actors - indeed almost half the dialogue is in Spanish - with Benicio Del Toro particularly impressive as a Mexican policeman in a moral maze. You'll be thinking about this work long after you've left the cinema and that can only be beneficial, given the scale and complexity of our drugs problem.
