It's most annoying that these languages are always spoken in sharp, short bursts which have no flow. Why Swedish? If one is going to use an alien language, just make it up or find a language which is less-known. Viveca Lindfors was sadly wasted as were the other actors in the beginning of the film.

The premise was interesting but the behavior on the 'parallel' world was ridiculous. The cliches flew quick and fast. James Spaders falls in love with dusky native maiden. How many times has this 'instant cross cultural love' been used? What is really offensive about this plot device is that 99% of the time, it's always a white MALE who gets the 'native'.The other cliches were just as bad.

A paraphrased Ebert argued in favor of black and white films because they enhance the whole idea that (paraphrased) We, the audience, are taken into a room where the lights dim and for two plus hours we are taken into a dreamy almost surreal world. And in my mind, Shakespeare in Love perfects this, in accomplishing this very objective, as Siskel and Ebert believed, of movies as works of art.The film itself was a glorious story told with such brilliance and wit that made it very surreal and dreamy.  And much like a good dream that one hates to wake up from, I found myself ready and willing to sit for hours more as Viola made her way across the sand in the end of the movie.There was a tremendous amount working in this film, most of which I credit to the writing.  The parallel of what was going on in the film, with what was going on in the play, was so very Shakespearean.  The use of plays within plays is one of Shakespeare's favorite devices, and Stoppard used it with such a brilliance as we the audience watched the development of Twelfth Night-like plot twists on screen, as the film actors, played actors, who acted out Romeo and Juliet on their stage.  Anyone who knows Shakespeare, surely understands how completely awesome this writing is.As for some of the technical aspects of the film... I did not much care for some of the jump cutting that John Madden used in some of the scenes (i.e. dance scene between Will and Viola) which I am left to assume his purpose in doing so was to show the instant chemistry between the two lovers.  Not really necessary in my mind and frankly, I found it jarring, for more often than not, it (the camera) moved in the opposite direction that the actors danced in, indicating confusion, not synchronization between the two.Which brings me to my final point, that being the under-appreciation of writers in Hollywood.  Newsweek recently published an interview with Stoppard, Begnini, Beatty (Ha!) and two other screenwriters, whose names have escaped me.  The article only reinforced my belief about the necessity of good writers in Hollywood and the unfortunate lack of respect that they get.  After reading some of the critical reviews I am glad to see that Tom Stoppard (who I read somewhere as being, The only man smart enough to put Shakespeare's words in his mouth.) is receiving at least some of the credit he deserves.  Without knowing how much Marc Normand helped Stoppard, it is difficult for me to either exclude him or give him the same credit as Stoppard for he has neither a Rosencrantz nor a Guildenstern in his filmography.  (A small plug for those of you who haven't seen another of Stoppard's wonderfully written films, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, which I believe he also directed).  I will reside to the fact that the film was well directed, but I can only commend Madden half-heartedly, for most of his success, I believe, comes about as a result of his standing on the shoulders of others (i.e. Judi Dench in Mrs. Brown).  Personally, I think there are a number of directors who would have done a fine job working with the writers to bring the story to the screen.  Perhaps there will come a day when the proper person (Stoppard) will get the majority of the credit regarding the genius of a film like Shakespeare in Love, rather than simply giving it to the default recipient, the director.  Hopefully on Oscar night, Stoppard will get his Oscar, and perhaps one for Madden as well, for the film is nothing shy of Oscar worthy.

I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects,  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works. Redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death, memories and realities.  Redford shows the hands of the Creator so magnificently and a river runs through it.  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 March 1999","score":"","review":"  200 Cigarettes is at times very, very funny.

His character is smart, articulate, and so convincing it's scary.  Too bad I can't say the same for the rest of the movie.  Although I really enjoyed Norton's performance, this movie lacks in something called...um...plot (is this a film-making trend?).  It seems to substitute dialogue for plenty of lip-smackin' violence, and it really lays the melodrama down thick. Norton's character again has two distinct faces (remember Primal Fear?). He turns from nice guy to mad-dog killer, to nice guy again all within a couple of years.  How dramatically convenient.  But I like the way AHX shows the hysterical racial venom of the skinheads the way that it does, and I love how Norton can create a memorable character that has the ability to give a, sort of, guilty pleasure to the audience.  Not to mention he looks really hot in this movie - minus the swastika tattoo.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, overall, I liked this movie.  And I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Norton at the Oscars, but if my prediction is correct, he'll probably lose to Nick Nolte.
