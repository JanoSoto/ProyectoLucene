I was first introduced to him through a Cartoon Network airing of 'Howl's Moving Chastle'. I loved the magic of the film and wanted to share it with everyone I knew. My mom in particular enjoyed its whimsical and fantastical world. Although it was made in Japan it felt like it equally garnered to the western audience. Yesterday I bought 'Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime')' and was brought back to a world of fantasy. The film starts out with Ashitaka defending his village from a possessed boar. He ends being struck by the demon and receives a curse on his arm. He then starts a travel to the west to find a cure and hopefully retain his life. Along the way he encounters many interesting and complex characters. I say complex because no one is really evil (or good for that matter) in this movie. When you look at it from the character's perspective they all want something that they deem is correct. The story deals with many themes such as enviormentalism, spirituality, and even what makes your identity. The art here is top of the line. When you watch this movie you feel like you've been in the mind of a genius (and you would be correct with that assumption). The animation is smooth and expressive throughout. The visuals for the spirit of the forest are immaculate. The English dub is hailed as one of the best ever done with Billy Bob Thortan, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, and Claire Danes. Billy Crudup in particular gave the performance a nice touch. The score is also excellent. I'm under the impression that score is the most important facet of a motion picture and it doesn't disappoint. 'Journey to the West' the main theme of the picture is very well done and will literally take your breath away when you hear it for the first time. For those with kids you may want to preview it first before you let children under the age of eleven or so watch. It is quite gory at times. But if your progeny are mature enough to watch this film please give them the gift of seeing what animation is capable of. This movie has a fair chance of putting 'Ben-Hur' at number two on my list.

Taken from Cornelius Ryan's excellent book of the same name (with Ryan and various others working on the screenplay) about the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, an invasion officially known as Operation Overlord, THE LONGEST DAY shows how numerous elements of planning and chance helped bring about the single biggest military campaign in history, one that led to the eventual end of Hitler's Third Reich. And for this, Zanuck had assembled a massive crew in which three directors (the legendary Andrew Marton for the U.S.; Ken Annakin for the Brits; and Bernhard Wicki for the Germans), special effects men, and a huge cast of Hollywood stars put themselves in service of this epic true story.While certain elements are inevitably fictionalized, notably elements of the landing itself (which, as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's opening sequence shows, wasn't a cakewalk by any stretch of the imagination), the film does capture the behind-the-scenes planning amongst the top men and officers on both sides of the conflict, including the Germans, whose soldiers are seen accurately in this film as basic foot soldiers just doing their job, and not the goose-stepping Nazi goons in Berlin who sent twenty million people, including plenty of their own, to their deaths. At three hours, this still may be a lot for people to take in, even if their attention spans haven't been warped by the sound and fury of war movies past and present. On the other hand, if the length of the film is a bit much, and the film itself is old-fashioned by today's standards, there is always that unbelievable gathering of Hollywood heavyweights to keep one's attention focused John Wayne (who, ironically, never served in World War II), Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner, Edmond O'Brien, Robert Ryan, Sean Connery (just as he ascended to stardom as James Bond), Roddy McDowall, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Fabian, Richard Burton, Richard Todd, and tons of others. All of this was done at what was then considered an exorbitant cost of $10 million (though Fox had poured $40 million into CLEOPATRA at the same time, and almost went bankrupt doing so), and it became one of the biggest moneymakers of its day, as well as the most commercially successful black-and-white film until Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST.Unlike a lot of war films of its time, THE LONGEST DAY, while stirring and stunning, doesn't make any heavy pretenses or apologies towards patriotism, because it was understood that Operation Overlord was an absolute necessity in order to save Europe and the world at large; as such, the gravity of the situation was enough to unite everybody. Those men who fought that day, regardless of their nationalities, are to be saluted for their courage and bravery; and even though it may have been surpassed by SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE LONGEST DAY still remains one of Hollywood's great war films, one to be remembered for many more decades to come.

You know, one of those where some surreal character comes out and does some silly stuff for a minute or so and then goes away. Now imagine one of those skits without a host there to play straight man, no studio audience to draw energy from and it goes on for almost an hour and a half. Congratulations! You've now seen Cabin Boy.Nathanial Mayweather (Chris Elliott) is a prissy, fussy, arrogant, dimwitted son of a rich man. After graduating from finishing school is all his bewigged glory, Nathanial gets misdirected and instead of winding up on a luxury cruiser taking him home to Hawaii, he winds up a cabin boy on a fishing boat named The Filthy Whore. After a whole bunch of lame inanity with 4 grubby and overacting fishermen, Nathanial falls in love at first sight with a girl swimming around the world and must prove his manhood to her by having sex with the slutty 2nd cousin of the Hindu goddess Shiva. And that's not as funny as it may sound. After teaming up with a shark man to battle a giant appliance salesman (that's a giant salesman who sells appliances, not a regular size salesman who sells giant appliances), Nathanial realizes he no longer wants a life of aimless wealth and rides his new girlfriend out to sea. Again, not as funny as it may sound.This film is like a primer on why Letterman has gotten his ass kicked in the ratings by Jay Leno for years, why Conan bombed at The Tonight Show and hasn't set the world on fire at TBS and why there are so many comics beloved of other comics who never manage to achieve much mainstream success. There's a certain breed of comedian who are mainly focused on entertaining themselves. They're usually very bright and clever, oftentimes dark or subversive or edgy, but their humor is disconnected from or perpendicular to what other people find funny. They just make themselves laugh and if it amuses anyone else, that's a bonus. Such inwardly directed, almost defiant comedy can be hilarious to the general public in small bursts. It's essentially impossible to sustain it for a long period of time, something Cabin Boy makes agonizingly clear.I suppose disaffected, supercilious hipsters might find some laughs in this movie, or at least convince themselves to laugh at what they think only they are with it enough to appreciate. Normal folk will only stare at the screen in slackjawed amazement at how pitiful it all is. There's no narrative standard by which anything in this motion picture works. The attempts at humor are so fractured and esoteric that even stoned slackers would be hard pressed to summon up a giggle in response.Let me give you an example. Even back in 1994, goofy looking Chris Elliott was too balding and too bearded to play a kid fresh out of finishing school. We first see Nathanial when he's singing in a choir with his schoolmates. Now, a traditional attempt at comedy would fill the choir with fresh-faced teens and leave Elliott sticking out like a sore thumb. Cabin Boy fills the choir with guys who, just like Elliott, are far too old and too hirsute to pass for a student body. You see, you're supposed to anticipate the joke that would normally be told and instead appreciate them doing the complete opposite. This isn't smart humor. It's humor that wants to be applauded for being smart, which isn't the same at all.I quite enjoyed seeing Chris Elliott show up on the old Letterman show, not that I'm dating myself or anything.

It never gets old, the humour is wonderful, the puppets are unquestionably expertly designed and made, and lets face it David Bowie if pants got any tighter I would be in heaven! I recommend this movie for anyone of any gender, age, genre allegiance, it speaks to your inner child while not insulting your adult sensibilities. The songs are a tad cheesy (really just one in particular, you'll know it when you hear it) and the masquerade ball makes you yearn for a era when those events and costumes really took place.

I recommend this movie for anyone of any gender, age, genre allegiance, it speaks to your inner child while not insulting your adult sensibilities. The songs are a tad cheesy (really just one in particular, you'll know it when you hear it) and the masquerade ball makes you yearn for a era when those events and costumes really took place.

Needless to say, it's hard to talk about this without repeating the same praise others have heaped on this film.Strangely enough, for something that's become known as one of the definitive Clint Eastwood vehicles, the real main character (as far as the script is concerned) is Eli Wallach's Tuco Ramirez. It's through the eyes of Tuco that most of the action is witnessed and all of the character development takes place. As flashy as their roles are, Eastwood's man with no name and Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes seen almost cardboard by comparison.When it comes to deleted and extended scenes, I find myself (surprisingly) in agreement with United Artists' studio hucksters from way back when. Added scenes are either unnecessary and awkward, like the introduction of Tuco's gang, or they interrupt the flow of the story, like Angel Eyes' trip to the pitiful rebel camp. It's much more effective to watch Van Cleef disappear after his encounter with Bill Carson's woman and become almost forgotten, only to reappear at the Confederate prisoner-of-war camp, in time to get in on the action.One surprise that awaits those who've seen the movie multiple times and then listened to Ennio Morricone's soundtrack album, is that the climactic showdown theme Il Triello (the trio) differs substantially on the album from the take used in the final film, with the movie version featuring a callback to the musical pocket watch in For A Few Dollars More and the album version containing an extended horn solo at the end, lasting longer than in the film.

But while it raises very thought-provoking interrogations, it fails to come back with meaningful answers.I concede that the film was brave enough to have a very unsympathetic character as the lead, Edward Norton is brilliant as Derek Vinyard, a young ideologically disoriented man whose level of hatred and violence is defined by his aptitude to kill and a huge chest-tattooed swastika, and the film was even braver to try to depict his 'moral salvation'. But the film's problem is that both his downfall and his redemption are not treated with the same level of intelligence. I couldn't buy it would take only one rape by a gang of Nazi prisoners and a subplot involving the friendship with a black guy working in the laundry, to redeem Derek. How could the movie be so indulgent toward his racism by reducing it to a sickness whose only remedy was 'to see the light'? If David McKenna's script had the guts to depict one of the most disturbing and shocking (realistic) deaths the curb-stomping, how did he expect to make a nice guy out of such a despicable character in less than two hours? It took more than three for Spike Lee to make us root for Malcolm X and he wasn't as cold-blooded and merciless as Derek Vinyard. Intelligence and fast-paced editing are not the most compatible elements for such provocative and promising character studies. Unfortunately, the whole deconstruction of Derek's personality fallaciously shows him more as a victim of racism than the true and condemnable perpetrator of racist acts.

Though news of the programme was only brought to the public's attention in 1974, MKULTRA's run time coincided with a number of spy, secret agent and brainwashing movies (Ipcress File, The Manchurian Candidate, The Parallax View, A Clockwork Orange, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, Seven Days in May, Dr No etc), many of which saw unwitting suspects brainwashed into committing assassinations or acts of violence (Clockwork does the opposite, its hero brainwashed into passivity).Two of these films, The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and The Parallax View (1974), are themselves eerily similar, though they are separated by over a decade and encapsulate very different political periods. Released in 1974, Alan J. Pakula's The Parallax View is very blatant in its left-leaning politics. One must remember that during this time a number of nefarious news stories were being dropped into the laps of the US public. The Watergate legacy had snowballed, the Pentagon Papers had revealed that Congress had been railroaded into Vietnam, the JFK and RFK assassination theories were in full bloom, the Warren Commision was viewed with much suspicion, the killings of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King - along with numerous bizarre occurrences in which All American Boys snapped and went on shooting rampages - were filling the public with fear, and reality itself was seen to be a conspiracy, an act of shared pretence. Pakula's film thus captures a very specific historical mood trust no one and fck the Man. Such pessimism is routine today. We take widespread corruption as a truth. Back then it was a kind of momentary birth of consciousness.John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate, however, was released in 1962, and though it has on its mind the communist witch hunts and rabid MacCarthyism of the 1950s, its overall politics are harder to get a grasp of. The plot a US infantry platoon is captured during the Korean war. The captured men are taken to Manchuria where they are brainwashed by a cabal of Chinese communists and Russian KGB agents. The platoon's leader, Sergeant Shaw, is given the specific task of killing a US senator. It is hoped that this will result in the senator's rival, Shaw's own father, becoming President of the United States. Shaw's KGB handler is his mother. Shaw's father is Senator John Iselin. Modelled on Joseph McCarthy, Iselin's a super right-wing, fear-mongering politician who exists to fan the flames of war, paranoia and anti-communist mania. For most of the film the US public views Iselin as an idiot. Once they witness the assassination of his rival by evil commies, however, they will no doubt embrace his politics and swiftly agree to his somewhat authoritarian plans (marshal law and various emergency measures). End result the communists &#x96; Russia and China &#x96; would thus have a puppet dictator controlling America. Or so they think. Iselin's camp is itself merely using the enemy to get themselves elected into power.So on one hand the film seems to be in the tradition of 1950s and 1960s bash-a-commie movies, which exploited fears of communist plots, red invasion and right-wing fantasies in which the Chinese and Russians band together and scheme to overthrow the White House. But while the film affirms all these possibilities, it openly mocks such fantasies and paints all these characters as rabid idiots. Even more bizarrely, while the film shows deranged right-wingers working with the Commies, Shaw's mother is herself secretly working against the communists, and Shaw's final action is not to carry out the assassination of his father's rival but to kill his mother and father instead. End result while there may be a communist threat, rightwingers are largely using commies as bogeymen, the ideological war between Democracy and Communism is ultimately ridiculous and contemptible and the real loser is Shaw, who becomes symbolic of all innocent men who are sacrificed by all sides. The film's many ideological overlaps are encapsulated by the incestuous relationship Shaw has with his mother everyone's in bed with one another, but he's getting screwed. Beyond this, the film's brainwashing subplot extends to all human behaviour. If all behaviour is unconsciously programmed, then this is doubly true of politics, in which all is performance, all identity is artificial, flat and everyone seems to be a puppet.Incidentally, Candidate was released shortly before the assassination of John F. Kennedy. And like Frankenheimer's sinister plot, Kennedy's assassination, most likely orchestrated by then vice president Lyndon B. Johnson, resulted in a fanatical warmonger entering the oval office. Frank Sinatra, who stars in Candidate and was good friends with Kennedy, also stared in 1954's Suddenly, a very good film noir in which a group of men prepare to snipe the US president. Replace Candidate's goof-ball senator Iselin with Bush, assassination with 9\/11, communists with terrorists, martial law with emergency powers and you've also basically got the 2001-2009 US Presidency. Iselin's cosying up to communists with the intention of ditching them later is itself always US policy create or fund your rivals, and then turn them into boogeymen to justify wars. Recognising this, director Jonathan Demme released a remake of The Manchurian Candidate in 2004.Frankenheimer's direction throughout Candidate is customarily bombastic. His style is Orson Welles on cocaine, the director mixing a range of styles, techniques (chiaroscuro, wide angles, deep focus, expressionism, jump cuts, overlapping dialogue etc) and genres (war, noir, political thriller, melodrama, satire, Kafka, pseudo-documentary, black comedy, parody, horror, science fiction, action, art house, existential psychodrama, incestuous soap opera) and then leaving it up to the audience to make sense of the mess. The film's constant gear-shifting shouldn't work, but as the film is itself about discontinuity and disorientation, and as most of its characters are drugged, hypnotised, fanatical and on the brink of insanity, Frankenheimer's unstable aesthetic fits fine.

It seems that we already know all about Eve at the glimpse of her modest gesture. Yet, we soon realize there is a lot to be revealed for the sake of honesty between the award in her hands and her speech of gratitude; a lot in the drama fully equipped with classy entertainment and clever dialogs. The girl's heart is as old as a theater where applause gives all satisfaction but...each theater has its stage and its wings.As a holder of many awards, including the Best Picture Oscar, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's movie has been acclaimed as one of the most significant movies ever made, one of the 1950s' gems. Truly, more than half a century later, we can still say that the film is a captivating experience. Yet, its strength does not lie in innovative camera-work, great sets nor special effects. ALL ABOUT EVE relies on clever screenplay and absorbing performances. Its major strength, in other words, lies in the film's theatrical nature. Here, let me quote James Berardinelli who states accurately that ALL ABOUT EVE stands out as one of the best small-scale dramas ever produced under the Hollywood system (2003). He adds that the film could easily be mistaken for a movie adaptation of a stage play. And from within the truly clever script and the stagy nature emerge brilliant performances.Although Anne Baxter as the title character calls viewers' attention naturally due to her duality, we get to know her thanks to other characters around her. As naturally as life can appear...a person is perceived better by others than by oneself. Viewers call their attention towards those people in the lead, particularly Bette Davis as Margo Channing and George Sanders as Addison DeWitt. They are not only given some best lines in the film but also portray their characters with real charisma and climactic focuses.BETTE DAVIS There are many reasons why we can openly say that this was one of her greatest roles, a real milestone in her later career. Why? This part not only re-established the actress after her farewell at the Warners Studios and welcome at Twentieth Century Fox but Margo is a sort of character Bette was born to play. Bette and Margo...a lot of parallels between two women! Bette's primary contribution is her own personality her strong straightforward attitude, charisma of an aging star, pretentious with producers who leaves 'peace and quiet for the libraries' striving to be on the top, jealous of women who are too many things for a man she loves. 'Liebestraum' by Franz Liszt appears to be merely a 'cheap sentiment' that she detests. Davis admitted her confusion as for where the fictional personality ended and the real-life personality began. Although her roles galore are worth attention, this performance of hers is a must-see.GEORGE SANDERS As the narrator of the story and an intensely dry Martini of the drama, his major merit is distance to all characters and his 'rapport' with viewers. He is certainly 'nobody's fool' who is 'essential to the theater' and to both Margo and Eve. Sarcastic, sympathetic at moments, cold in emotions, a perfect observer who leaves us all with a breathless delight. His lines occur to be the main entertainment of the storyline that raise unique movie fans' experience. Similarly to the director, he also seems to psychoanalyze the characters around. Sanders as DeWitt makes the entire story truly believable and inspiring. He simply leaves a viewer with pure admiration for the performance that vibrant. Sanders's best moments include the sarcastic talks with young Marilyn Monroe as Claudia and acting as a sardonic 'master' of disguised Eve in the harsh talk filled with 'boxing terms.' ANNE BAXTER She has a hard role, supposedly the hardest one, because as the title character she cannot allow herself to be predominated by other cast. Ms Baxter, as one of my favorite actresses, absolutely rivets me as a shy Margo's fan who takes a chance of a lucky evening and visits her idol in her dressing room. There, she submits herself to the self-expected emotions and desirable impressions from her listeners. She bursts out with all her passionate fan's love but no hysteria. And, viewers along with Margo Channing allow themselves for a delusive sympathy for the young Eve. Then, her task is to reveal her true nature and her means that, at first, appear so good and honest. Then, we realize that she would do much more for the part that good, for the goal that ambitious and the career that promising. Does she manage in executing that? I think she does it well artistically but we, as viewers, no longer like her, she disappoints us as a character and, consequently, major appreciation is not of Eve\/Baxter.SUPPORTING CAST There are two people who are most memorable as an extra ingredient to the whole drama's taste Gary Merill as Bill Sampson and Thelma Ritter as Birdie. Mr Merill as Margo's lover delivers some best lines about the theater, about his own dilemmas and accurately depicts a young man in this reality. Ms Ritter is excellent at her doubts about Eve.

It was directed by Victor Fleming from a screenplay by Sidney Howard. The film stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and Hattie McDaniel.It was set in the nineteenth century and tells a story of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era from a Southern point of view.It boils down to a story about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7- million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett O'Hara hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes plans to marry mealy mouthed Melanie Hamilton. Despite warnings from her father and her faithful servant Mammy, Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks. Alone with Ashley, she goes into a fit of histrionics, all of which is witnessed by roguish Rhett Butler, the black sheep of a wealthy Charleston family, who is instantly fascinated by the feisty, thoroughly self-centered Scarlett.Gone with the Wind's famous action continues from the burning of Atlanta through the now-classic closing line, Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. The movie is definitely one of the greatest movies ever made.It won 10 Academy Awards, a record that stood for 20 years with Ben-Hur surpassing it in 1960.It was an engaging movie from beginning to end.The performances of cast like Clark Gable and most especially,Vivien Leigh were definitely excellent and outstanding.It maybe dated but it serves as a benchmark for historical epic movies.

The film stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and Hattie McDaniel.It was set in the nineteenth century and tells a story of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era from a Southern point of view.It boils down to a story about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7- million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett O'Hara hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes plans to marry mealy mouthed Melanie Hamilton. Despite warnings from her father and her faithful servant Mammy, Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks. Alone with Ashley, she goes into a fit of histrionics, all of which is witnessed by roguish Rhett Butler, the black sheep of a wealthy Charleston family, who is instantly fascinated by the feisty, thoroughly self-centered Scarlett.Gone with the Wind's famous action continues from the burning of Atlanta through the now-classic closing line, Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. The movie is definitely one of the greatest movies ever made.It won 10 Academy Awards, a record that stood for 20 years with Ben-Hur surpassing it in 1960.It was an engaging movie from beginning to end.The performances of cast like Clark Gable and most especially,Vivien Leigh were definitely excellent and outstanding.It maybe dated but it serves as a benchmark for historical epic movies.

Well, sadly Today those days are gone as politically correctness takes over. Don't offend this group of people, make sure to emphasize on this other group, let's make Bert and Ernie gay because it offends homosexuals who watch the show otherwise, Elmo needs to be classified as one with drugs because of his voice and grammar! All of this crap ruins the classics.So watching this movie which was filmed right before things started to get really worse was great. The plot was simple, yet the story became so complex but not in a bad way. It was entertaining to watch it progress and the musicals were put in well. I enjoyed the many new characters Elmo met and the final 'battle' was simple yet humorous.Rated 8\/10 for a great classic.

Kubrick's slow Barry Lyndon pace works nicely, the plot is intriguing enough, acting and score are excellent. The film is much better written than the original novella -Dream Story by Arthur Schnitzler-, which is very poor literature indeed. Actually, the novella is more like a draft of a novel yet to be written than anything else. Fortunately, it has been written, if not by Schnitzler. Kubrick also threw in some drugs, several homosexual aspects and two new characters Victor Ziegler and Mandy. Not all of these additions are improvements. The stoned couple does reveal some secret thoughts, but the gay elements don't add anything, quite the contrary. In the novella, the street incident has nothing to do with gay bashing but with death in duel, which fits nicely between the deceased patient and driving to the orgy in a hearse. Mandy also doesn't add anything except her nice body and some extra confusion. She ends up in the morgue, and Victor claims she was the mysterious woman, but he's definitely lying. If you watch closely enough (it's a hard job, but someone has to do it), you see their bodies are different; if you're lazy, just verify the credits, and you'll find that, in real life, one is called Julienne Davis and the other Abigail Good. Are we expected to overlook this, or is it an extra dreamlike layer deliberately added by Kubrick? The nice thing for an author or a director dealing in dreams is that logical inconsistencies are part of the game! This said, the novella, while poorly written, is less inconsistent than the movie. Schnitzler's intruder is betrayed at the orgy because he's the only one not to change costumes, and -speaking of costumes- the shop owner's daughter is caught wearing a whig and sitting with two gentlemen dressed as judges. I fail to see why Kubrick had to turn these into Japanese. (Incidentally, Marion Nathanson's fiancé, a historian according to Schnitzler, is a mathematician in the film. As neither detail has any importance, one wonders why such changes are made at all.) Most importantly, Schnitzler's password for the orgy is directly linked to the woman's infidelity fantasy; it's a pity that Kubrick threw away this crucial entrance key to the man's fantasy. The novella ends with the mask on the pillow. If only Kubrick had done the same! His last scene, trivial and cheap, is a complete letdown.
