Well being 24 now and seeing the movie for many times i can only say it's a classic. As with a lot of action\/sci-fi movies the story is not all to great.. It got some big plot holes in it, the biggest one being that Reese is John Conners father. But i think people who complain about the story and think about it to deeply don't understand the movie. This movie does not try to tell a great story, this movies tries to give you action and the tension of being hunted by an unstoppable killing machine. And it delivers just that. The dark mood in this movie makes it all a little more tensive then it's sequels which rely more on action then on tension.I hear and read some people complain that the effects in the movie are looking old an dated.. What do they expect, of course they look out of date for todays standard, the movie is from 1984 you can not compare it with todays special effects. But for an early 80's low budget movie this film looks great and the special effect were really well done. And it sure got memorable moments, and i am not talking about the line All be back but who can ever forget the scene with the eye, or seeing the terminator skeleton for the first time.All in all this movie is one of the best movie of the 80's and in my opinion of all time.

However, i was quite pleasantly surprised when i finished the movie.  The issues that this film portray with are completely relevant to teenagers of today (which includes myself) despite the fact that its nearly 10 years old.  It deals with young people who after having their heads stuffed full of idealism during their education are then thrown into the real world, where they try to infuse that idealism into simple everyday acts like making enough money or paying the house payment all the while trying not to be a sellout(yuppie).Despite what some of the other viewers said (that the characters are too shallow, etc) I found the acting to be very good.  Winona Ryder's performance as Lelaina Pierce, the valedictorian film student who has a misunderstood genius for unadulterated documentary film making, was very believable though at times she did seem a little too, well, overdramatic(like when she was in the diner and michael called her about his bringing of the tapes to NY.  She was screaming into the phone.  I dunno, maybe she was just excited).  But still, Winona was great!  Troy Dyer(Ethan Hawke),  the pseudo-intellectual couch potato, and Michael Grates(Ben Stiller), Troy's antithesis, the hardworking TV executive, were greatly acted, not to mention believable as well.

Admittedly, I'm aware of several films with similar stories (Midnight Express, Return to Paradise, and Red Corner), and I must also admit I've only see one of those three aforementioned films, which might be why much of it felt fresh and engrossing to me.  Either that, or it's just a story that's told damn well.Bill Pullman also stars in the picture as an American lawyer named Hank Greene, who feels for the girls' plight and fights to prove their innocence.  But the real focus is on Beckinsale and Danes, whose wonderful performances are the anchor to the film's drama and moral quandaries.  Beckinsale's Darlene is the more reserved and quieter of the two, the kind of person who sort of follows her friend without question, and certainly not the type to take unwarranted risks (unless her friend persuades her to).  She's almost a direct opposite of Danes' Alice, whose outgoing and semi-rebellious behavior is the indirect link to their current troubles.I hesitate to give much more of the movie away, suffice to say that their friendship is what's ultimately put to the test, and watching the twists and turns (almost all of which are perfectly believable) in the story is utterly captivating.  The film slinks to melodrama in its climactic moments, but still rings true thanks to the tour-de-force turns from Beckinsale and Danes.It's an open-ended question as to whether or not either of the girls committed the crime of smuggling narcotics, and such ambiguity might upset some, but I liked not knowing for certain, and it's not as if it makes the final scenes any less believable.  In fact, the ambiguity only makes it all the more compelling.  Yes, the plot has its share of head-scratching moments (what purpose does that Thai girl who despises Darlene and Alice really serve?) and lacks subtlety on occasion, but it's a well-crafted film that boasts great performances, and has the guts not to cop out in the end.

She's almost a direct opposite of Danes' Alice, whose outgoing and semi-rebellious behavior is the indirect link to their current troubles.I hesitate to give much more of the movie away, suffice to say that their friendship is what's ultimately put to the test, and watching the twists and turns (almost all of which are perfectly believable) in the story is utterly captivating.  The film slinks to melodrama in its climactic moments, but still rings true thanks to the tour-de-force turns from Beckinsale and Danes.It's an open-ended question as to whether or not either of the girls committed the crime of smuggling narcotics, and such ambiguity might upset some, but I liked not knowing for certain, and it's not as if it makes the final scenes any less believable.  In fact, the ambiguity only makes it all the more compelling.  Yes, the plot has its share of head-scratching moments (what purpose does that Thai girl who despises Darlene and Alice really serve?) and lacks subtlety on occasion, but it's a well-crafted film that boasts great performances, and has the guts not to cop out in the end.

Admittedly, I'm aware of several films with similar stories (Midnight Express, Return to Paradise, and Red Corner), and I must also admit I've only see one of those three aforementioned films, which might be why much of it felt fresh and engrossing to me.  Either that, or it's just a story that's told damn well.Bill Pullman also stars in the picture as an American lawyer named Hank Greene, who feels for the girls' plight and fights to prove their innocence.

After seeing it, i think i'll buy the dvd!This film was simply incredible.  This was NOT a rehash of cliché sci-fi plots, or of other genre movies.  Far from it, i think this is one of the most original movies i've ever seen.The most stunning aspect? The RESERVED and TASTEFUL application of special effects.  They were only put in when they added to the story which only made them more effective.  I particularly liked the gliding motion of the strangers when they moved.  A cheap effect in most movies but here it totally worked.  The final view of the city in space was awesome.  The sets were so well constructed.  The scene where they are taking that boat along that canal to find a way out... man, a scene out of a nightmare - well done.The acting was very well done, the dark atmosphere was almost claustrophobic. When they ran down that narrowing corridor only to see that huge poster i almost choked! What a relief when we finally see Shell beach! I like the indeterminate milieu.  Much better done than the batman movies (P-EW!!!) Instead there is a dominant 1940's theme with anything from the 20's to the 60's mixed in without anything seeming anachronistic.  (the automobiles seemed to vary from around 1939 to 1965).The story is well told and great attention to detail throughout.  I was a bit taken aback when they first broke through that brick wall and Bumstead (William Hurt - a much better role for him than Duke Leto in sci-fi's Dune) and the stranger are sucked out.  It wasn't making sense to me until they passed through the force field.I was a little disappointed in the ending only because the struggle for control of the machine between Murdoch and Mr. Book wasn't as drawn out and personal between them as it could have been. (or as clear) Outwardly, it just seemed a fight between two telekinetics.  Better to have them clearly struggling for control of the machine.I was also disappointed that we get so little explained of the true physiology of the strangers.  They appear to be something like a cross between a tapeworm and a chinese dragon that possess dead bodies in order to run their laboratory (the city).  I would like to have seen more of their true form and to have explained why it was necessary for them to inhabit the human bodies to fulfill their role. After all, they never went about among the inhabitants for the most part.  They only went out at midnight when everyone was asleep.  And beyond that, what will finding out what it means to be human do to help the survival of their dying race?I also found Mr. Hand's desire to take on the characteristics of a serial killer when exposed to murdoch's memories a little disturbing. It almost seems he is doing it by choice, as if he's letting an inhibition slide rather than he is being controlled by murdoch's memories.The love story between Emma\/Anna and Murdoch is done with a light touch and that is exactly what the story called for.  The love between the two characters really comes out without taking over the story or becoming sappy.Still, the acting, the sets, the script, the score, the camera work all seemed flawless.  The only thing that separates this movie from something like american beauty is the dark, gothic sci-fi atmosphere. If you like art films and have an open mind this one might grab you.

He wants to work as a doctor here where they are needed, and he wants to raise his daughter a Muslim and have her attend Iranian schools. She argues with him, but he tells her his decision has been made and they will be staying. She is angry with him for lying to her and tells him that, but he said if he hadn't done that he never would have gotten her to come. He hits her and says she is his wife and she will do as he says. Soon after that he starts beating her, she is not allowed to use the telephone for any reason, and she is not allowed to leave the house alone and his family reports back to him everything she does.

Betty Mahmoody is married to a doctor who was born in Iran but has lived in the US for 20 years. he has always been a loving husband and good father to their daughter. He starts missing his family in Iran and wants to go for a visit. Betty doesn't want to, simply because Iran is not a great place to be at this time, especially for Americans and the way they treat women. Her husband holds the Koran and swears to her that if she agrees to go for 2 weeks, nothing will happen, they will be safe, and they will return home in 2 weeks.  The day before they are to return to America her husband tells her that he has decided that they will remain in Iran. He wants to work as a doctor here where they are needed, and he wants to raise his daughter a Muslim and have her attend Iranian schools. She argues with him, but he tells her his decision has been made and they will be staying. She is angry with him for lying to her and tells him that, but he said if he hadn't done that he never would have gotten her to come. He hits her and says she is his wife and she will do as he says. Soon after that he starts beating her, she is not allowed to use the telephone for any reason, and she is not allowed to leave the house alone and his family reports back to him everything she does. Every time she tries to call her parents back in the USA she is beaten, or sometimes he takes their daughter away for a few days and sends her to stay with other family.   So right away of course she tries to escape Iran. She does manage to speak with her mother for a short time who tells her to go the Swiss Embassy in Tehran. She manages to get there a few times but they aren't able to help her very much. when she does arrive home late, she is usually beaten or punished somehow. They tell her that because her husband is an Iranian citizen, she is his property, as well as her daughter. She could choose to divorce him, but she will lose her daughter, and it is illegal for her to take her daughter and leave the country. So she makes some friends who help her come up with a way to escape. It's dangerous, but she will be able to get someplace where they will help and American woman with a child.

I hesitate to call it a sequel, as sequel is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like The Matrix Reloaded is a sequel - The Godfather Part II is something more. It's just too good to be called a sequel.The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in The Godfather Part II, Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. The Godfather was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. The Godfather Part II may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a sequel almost seems insulting.
