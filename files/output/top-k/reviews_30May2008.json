I took my first film class about six months later, at which point I learned to really appreciate the great films and filmmakers, and one of the first things I learned was that the first three Alien films are spectacular achievements of science fiction cinema and the third sequel is a sad, ridiculous mess. This happens all too often with sequels and yes, part four is not yet another amazingly impressive Alien film, but come on, it's not THAT bad. I watched it last night for the first time in almost ten years, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's strange that I liked it so much, because it shows all the signs of a botched, modernized sequel of a series that should have been left alone long ago. The characters, most of all, are almost all goofy caricatures with preposterous dialogue and routine motivations, and some just don't belong at all. Personally I am a pretty big fan of Winona Ryder, but only in roles that suit her, and she has had a lengthy list of roles that suit her, but Annallee Call in Alien Resurrection is just not one of them. Too often she comes off as a tough talking teenager in this movie and it just gets hard to take her character seriously. She's like Ja Rule in Half Past Dead, but less ridiculous.Then again, this could just have been a result of her starring alongside Sigourney Weaver, and that woman is just awesome. Dan Hedaya is suitably over-the-top in his role as the gleefully neurotic General Perez, and I have to admit that I was curious to see the performance of Gary Dourdan as Christie. Lately I've been watching countless hours of CSI on DVD, and it's amazing to see how different his role is in this movie from the most serious role he would play later in that show. I prefer the later performance, myself.The resurrection implied in the title refers to Ripley being borough back to life 200 years after her death for the purpose of creating one of the alien queens, and then breeding the animals for twisted scientific purposes. They decide to keep Ripley alive for observation after surgically removing the alien from her chest, only to discover that she and the aliens are clearly more than they are prepared to handle. There is a negligible subplot involving a group of shady characters headed by the wonderfully sinister Michael Wincott as a Frank Elgyn, who promises his men won't start trouble or get into any fights if they are allowed to stay on board for a few days and nights. I also have to mention Ron Perlman, who just has a face for this kind of movie. Probably most recognizable lately as Hellboy, this has to be one of the least appreciated actors of the last few decades. In just over 20 years he has acted in more than 150 films and TV shows, and at the time of this writing he has 18 projects in the works. Unbelievable! He also has one of the best lines in the movie (Why the waste of ammo?! Must be a chick thing&#133;).The aliens are probably the thing that will make or break this movie, and in my opinion they were impressive enough. The occasional CGI effects are never convincing, but then again they never are, so luckily they didn't overdo them. Even the aliens swimming underwater was not too much for me to accept, perhaps given the automatic tension that is immediately generated in almost any movie where someone has to hold their breath for a long time. This went on far too long to be anything remotely realistic in this movie, but it was a good scene nonetheless. I would also argue that this is the goriest of all of the four alien movies, particularly at the end, but also contains some of the best comic relief. This combination makes the movie highly entertaining, even following in the long shadows of its spectacular predecessors. There is a high energy scene in the third act of the film where Perlman's character performs a daredevil stunt to shoot one of the pursuing aliens dead which is followed by what has to be the funniest spider killing in film history. I haven't laughed out loud like that at a movie in a long, long time. In browsing through the posts on the message board for Resurrection I have been inspired to raise my rating for the movie from a 7 to an 8, if only because it is so obvious that everyone is jumping on the bandwagon about bashing this movie. I see nothing but whiny, pouting little brats whimpering and griping about little nitpicky details in the movie, condemning the third sequel in the Alien quadrilogy as a travesty and an embarrassment and a pathetic way to end the series. Stupid people in large numbers, man. It's sad to see such a clear mob mentality slamming a movie that is about 100 times better than most people say. No, it's not up to the same level as the first two films and it definitely has its drawbacks, but it is definitely a good installment in the series, and you could certainly do a lot worse for some fun popcorn sci-fi on a Friday night. I'll admit that my judgment might be a little skewed because I watched the staggeringly awful Eaten Alive just before seeing this, but it is clear to me that Alien Resurrection has yet to receive the respect it deserves.

In it, newspaperman Walter Burns (Cary Grant) tries any means necessary to get back his ex-wife and ace reporter Hildy (Rosalind Russell) before she marries a mild-mannered insurance salesman (Ralph Bellamy) the next day.I had seen the first scene of His Girl Friday in a film class as an example of screwball comedy dialogue Hildy comes into Walter's office to announce her upcoming marriage, but it turns into nearly ten minutes of reminiscing, bickering, and talking circles around each other. And they speak as fast as they can spit the words out! Grant and Russell obviously have a lot of fun playing off of one another, and their scenes made me almost dizzy with delight--marveling at the writing, the acting, and the sheer speed of it all! But, while I knew to expect a love-triangle plot and fast-paced dialogue from His Girl Friday, I wasn't expecting it to be such a cynical and tough-minded look into the newspaper business. More than just a romantic comedy, it has an exciting subplot centered on serious issues like the death penalty and political corruption. An escaped prisoner points a gun at Hildy; Walter conspires with lowlifes to get Hildy's fiancé arrested. Both Hildy and Walter are pretty unscrupulous in pursuit of a good story, but this serves to humanize them--they're real people with big desires, not just machines spouting rat-a-tat dialogue.

Then again he could quite easily have taken up a medical degree and become a surgeon as the ability to stand the sight of blood, guts and human remains just seems to come to him naturally. But this is the sort of role Woods relishes, it is a role that does not need to be developed beyond a certain point and yet we witness a point the character's life during which he is at the peak of his game. Crow doesn't take orders, he doesn't take much stick and if an enemy needs to be disposed of then it will be with no questions asked.So we have a John Carpenter film in which the best character or certainly the most interesting is in fact the hero himself. From what I've seen Myers was more interesting in Halloween; the thing itself was more of an intriguing element in that film than anything else and the fog in the film of the same name carried that same presence and air of mystery that the thing did in that respective film. So who or what are the bad guys here? Just plain old vampires, of course. Oh, there is a head vampire or 'master' as he's known but he doesn't come close to any of Carpenter's previous antagonists &#150; he's sort of what Myers might have been like if he had gone around trying to bite everyone to death.Like Carpenter's films, the title bears a direct link to the enemy of the film or setting. 'Precinct 13' and 'New York' are both places with 'Halloween' acting as a timeframe for a film. Here whilst trying to work out the thinking behind simply calling a film 'Vampires', is when it occurs - Vampires are the enemy just as The Thing and The Fog were so why not? Vampires takes place in a world in which the average Joe might consider a nightmare scenario. The film is Dawn of the Dead set across North America and from what we hear Europe as well only there are pockets of resistance to help kill the uncanny enemy. Carpenter's heroes in his horror films inhabit spaces in which they really do not want to be but they have no choice (see Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween and Escape From New York). Here, Crow enjoys his work and likes his life. One man's dystopia is another man's utopia &#150; all the killing and maiming in Crow's life keeps him going whereas in a 'normal' environment he'd be left twiddling his thumbs.But it is not just the killing, it is the booze and the women after hours. Crow is living out a sort of American Dream by doing his job during the day and then spending it on hosting women supported by local crooked cops and drinking beer, only difference is he hasn't just put in a days work at a steel mill or something. But Vampires is a little more than just an interesting set up and predicament even if it is for the bad. We catch up with the gang just as things decide to get ugly and the vampires threaten to up their race for world domination &#150; look at it as a Cold War during which the other side are just about to obtain plans for Weapons of Mass Destruction. Jan Valek (Griffith) plays the role of the indestructible monster with the job to predominantly find an ancient cross that can be used to kill off mankind's hope once and for all and thus begins the mission to stop him. There were a few things I had problems with and the first one as to why Valek does what he does to one of the loose girls at a party the vampires gate crash. After Valek puts his little spell on her and bites her, she can see everything Valek sees making her a valuable tool for Crow and co. to use against the enemy. Is there a reason Valek was so kind as to give them that aid? Then there is the manner in which a false and rather silly romance begins to flourish between this girl and Anthony Montoya (Baldwin), Crow's best friend and ally-come-sparring partner. The romance actually takes over toward the end and is solely relied upon for the films ultimate tragedy which is the only reason it exists. Then there is the way the film develops the skills of one time priest and now loyal sidekick Adam Guiteau (Guinee) from rookie into proper hunter, sort of relegating a man of the church to level of comic relief which is done in poor and more importantly for the audience, 'unfunny' taste. But it is the way the film eerily borrows from Blade toward the end when it turns out the hero is needed for the final steps of the process to end mankind and raise the Vampires. The climax itself is a little off with the process having to be performed just-before-sunrise-and in a small area that none of the other vampires bother to check throughout the night just in case Guiteau might be hiding there. While Vampires isn't necessarily bad, it is sketchy with some pretty illogical occurrences going on. That said, it is a lot of fun and there is an energy behind it. Carpenter clearly hadn't fallen out of love making films at this pointing his career and that should be enough to make someone want to give it a go.

Then again he could quite easily have taken up a medical degree and become a surgeon as the ability to stand the sight of blood, guts and human remains just seems to come to him naturally. But this is the sort of role Woods relishes, it is a role that does not need to be developed beyond a certain point and yet we witness a point the character's life during which he is at the peak of his game. Crow doesn't take orders, he doesn't take much stick and if an enemy needs to be disposed of then it will be with no questions asked.So we have a John Carpenter film in which the best character or certainly the most interesting is in fact the hero himself. From what I've seen Myers was more interesting in Halloween; the thing itself was more of an intriguing element in that film than anything else and the fog in the film of the same name carried that same presence and air of mystery that the thing did in that respective film. So who or what are the bad guys here? Just plain old vampires, of course. Oh, there is a head vampire or 'master' as he's known but he doesn't come close to any of Carpenter's previous antagonists &#150; he's sort of what Myers might have been like if he had gone around trying to bite everyone to death.Like Carpenter's films, the title bears a direct link to the enemy of the film or setting. 'Precinct 13' and 'New York' are both places with 'Halloween' acting as a timeframe for a film. Here whilst trying to work out the thinking behind simply calling a film 'Vampires', is when it occurs - Vampires are the enemy just as The Thing and The Fog were so why not? Vampires takes place in a world in which the average Joe might consider a nightmare scenario. The film is Dawn of the Dead set across North America and from what we hear Europe as well only there are pockets of resistance to help kill the uncanny enemy. Carpenter's heroes in his horror films inhabit spaces in which they really do not want to be but they have no choice (see Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween and Escape From New York). Here, Crow enjoys his work and likes his life. One man's dystopia is another man's utopia &#150; all the killing and maiming in Crow's life keeps him going whereas in a 'normal' environment he'd be left twiddling his thumbs.But it is not just the killing, it is the booze and the women after hours. Crow is living out a sort of American Dream by doing his job during the day and then spending it on hosting women supported by local crooked cops and drinking beer, only difference is he hasn't just put in a days work at a steel mill or something. But Vampires is a little more than just an interesting set up and predicament even if it is for the bad. We catch up with the gang just as things decide to get ugly and the vampires threaten to up their race for world domination &#150; look at it as a Cold War during which the other side are just about to obtain plans for Weapons of Mass Destruction. Jan Valek (Griffith) plays the role of the indestructible monster with the job to predominantly find an ancient cross that can be used to kill off mankind's hope once and for all and thus begins the mission to stop him. There were a few things I had problems with and the first one as to why Valek does what he does to one of the loose girls at a party the vampires gate crash. After Valek puts his little spell on her and bites her, she can see everything Valek sees making her a valuable tool for Crow and co. to use against the enemy. Is there a reason Valek was so kind as to give them that aid? Then there is the manner in which a false and rather silly romance begins to flourish between this girl and Anthony Montoya (Baldwin), Crow's best friend and ally-come-sparring partner. The romance actually takes over toward the end and is solely relied upon for the films ultimate tragedy which is the only reason it exists. Then there is the way the film develops the skills of one time priest and now loyal sidekick Adam Guiteau (Guinee) from rookie into proper hunter, sort of relegating a man of the church to level of comic relief which is done in poor and more importantly for the audience, 'unfunny' taste. But it is the way the film eerily borrows from Blade toward the end when it turns out the hero is needed for the final steps of the process to end mankind and raise the Vampires. The climax itself is a little off with the process having to be performed just-before-sunrise-and in a small area that none of the other vampires bother to check throughout the night just in case Guiteau might be hiding there. While Vampires isn't necessarily bad, it is sketchy with some pretty illogical occurrences going on. That said, it is a lot of fun and there is an energy behind it. Carpenter clearly hadn't fallen out of love making films at this pointing his career and that should be enough to make someone want to give it a go.

Now, though, television seems to have taken its place. All throughout the land grown men fall asleep to its warm, comforting glow and children everywhere suckle on its electronic teat. The idiot box has taken over our lives.Poltergeist begins with the 'Star-Spangled Banner' ringing comfortingly from a suburban television set as a middle-class father respires gently in the living room. Yes, it's the TV that is the centre of this family, not the man snoring in an armchair.At first the Freeling family is kind of amused by the fact that their daughter talks to the television set and that weird forces are present that move furniture. But just when the family thinks the phenomena is harmless, a tree attacks their son and a closet eats their daughter.It must be said that the special effects for the tree attack are simply atrocious. Yes you have to bear in mind the fact that the film was produced in the early 80s, but still, there's very little horror to be had when you can clearly see that the tree is made out of rubber &#150; it wobbles like mad. And it also doesn't help that the dialogue is atrocious. A young child is being sucked up by a tree and it's going to eat him and the child screams, 'It's taking me in!' I don't know about you, but if I were about to be devoured by a woody plant I'd be screaming in a series of grunts. I wouldn't be very precisely describing what was happening like it was a minor annoyance.Another abysmal piece of effects work occurs when a group of paranormal investigators are trying to help the Freeling family. One guy wanders the house at night and sees a piece of meat crawl along the kitchen work surface. It then opens up and maggots crawl out. Disgusted, he goes to the toilet and then sees his face becoming distorted like the meat. He then rips his face off, flesh coming apart in handfuls. Really this should be a scary scene, but it just looks ridiculous. The face-melting scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark is infinitely more effective.But the film really does fail quite spectacularly in trying to be scary. There's one bit where through a bit of nonsense the mother has to go into another dimension to rescue her child who is trapped between worlds. In order to do this she has to go into the closet while attached to a bit of rope that her husband holds. So the husband holds onto the rope as she disappears and then from within the closest comes a massive skull. It's meant to be a frightening physical manifestation of the evil force that is holding this family hostage, but instead it just looks like a gnarly skull a marijuana-sozzled Ozzy Osbourne fan would worship. Confronted by this fearsome sight you could imagine this fan getting on his knees, venerating it with the devil horns finger salute and rhythmically banging his greasy, lice-infested head.Then there's the infamous clown scene. Now I know a lot of people have an irrational clown fear. Somehow they fail to appreciate the belly laughs that strange men with white painted faces, freakishly bright hair and silly clothes generate. They don't see the warmth, the love and the benevolence that resides within. But still, the clown doll in this film is insane. It leers at the children like an inanimate psychopath. Quite why any parent would buy it, I don't know. But despite all of this the scene is just silly. The toy strangles the child and drags him under the bed and then the child beats it up. Maybe if you're ten or you've never embraced clown love, it's a crapathon, but otherwise it's just kind of amusing. But poor kid, eh? First a tree tries to kill him and then a toy clown wants him dead. Have a nice life, pal. Don't spend too much on therapy.But even though we're meant to feel sorry for this family, I can't help but wonder whether they had their tree\/skull\/clown apocalypse coming. We see the mother smoking pot while the father avidly reads a book about Ronald Reagan. Yes, you took your hippie ethos and got into bed with a monkey-loving, gay-hating, astrology-fixated nincompoop. Congratulations, you're middle-class, conformist scum.And there's also a scene where the youngest child is watching the static on TV. The mother comes along and says it's bad for her eyes and switches over to a war film. Yes, violence is much better for a child's eyes.But the criticism of Reagan's America goes further. The father sells houses for a corporate scumbag who moves graveyards to make way for housing. But to make it even worse, we find out that the family's house is itself on the site of an old graveyard. The only problem is that only the headstones were moved &#150; the skeletons were left in place, hence the bad vibes.The end of the film sees the family booking into a Holiday Inn and then moving the television out of the room. The lesson to be learned? Corporate greed is bad and you shouldn't let television bring up your children.But although it's nice that a horror film has a message, it's a shame that the film is so poor. The film is devoid of scares and most of it makes little sense. Plus it features a wise midget with a strong Southern accent who supposedly gets rid of all the bad vibes only for the clown doll to go mental when she's gone.

Then they are usually killed anyway. They might as well have spilled the beans. I had a hard time keeping up with who got killed and what their relationship to the plot was. They all seem to be bland-looking, middle-aged white men with pudgy tummies and receding hairlines. But I could be wrong about that. Anyway, it's a good thing 'The Pelican Brief' is so sombre and sneaky and foreboding. Once the truth is finally exposed and brought out into the open, it's not terribly interesting. A rich oilman wants to drill for oil in Louisiana. In order to do that, he has to kill a couple of Supreme Court justices so their successors will rule in his favor. Oh, and the brown pelicans of Louisiana's coast will be wiped out as a result too. I don't know, I think if I was in this movie, I'd be one of the bad guys. I'd rather drill for the oil than worry about the brown pelicans. And didn't FDR have a court-packing scheme of his own? Of course, he didn't kill anybody. That we know of. Director Alan Pakula certainly makes the most of what he has to work with here by keeping the suspense level high and by keeping our interest, period. I've read several of John Grisham's books, but this isn't one of them; from the evidence presented here, I'd guess it's one of his lesser works. Denzel Washington plays Gray Grantham (does that sound like a superhero's alter ego, or what?), a Washington journalist, in a quietly authoritative manner. It's as if he dares anyone to question his honor. He is the epitome of journalistic integrity, if that's not an oxymoron. Were it not for Washington's considerable acting skills, his character would simply be too good to be true. He comes to the aid of Darby Shaw, played by Julia Roberts. In keeping with the film's quiet and suspicious nature, Roberts portrays Shaw as smart but increasingly paranoid, which is understandable as she is pursued by quite a few of those middle-aged white men who work for the President or the FBI or the CIA or some oil cartel... I was never quite clear on that either. It is an effective performance. I suppose part of the fun of reviewing a film like 'The Pelican Brief' is poking holes, or attempting to, in the plot's logic. For instance, I found it rather difficult to believe that the aforementioned intelligence agencies and assorted bad guys could not capture or kill the Darby Shaw character. She stays in various motels and hotels using her own credit cards; they spy on her, they tap her phone, but by golly, they never can seem to get their hands on her. She always outruns them or ducks into a crowd or jumps in Grantham's car at just the right moment. I know, this is standard issue stuff for a political intrigue\/murder mystery, but it really sticks out here as improbable. It's almost as if they stop chasing her after eight p.m. so she can get a good night's sleep. There is a funny moment too (though I don't think it's intentional) during one of those many hushed phone conversations; Shaw calls Grantham to give him some tidbits of information, and when he tries to find out more, she says, Don't ask me any questions. Grantham gets a confused look on his face and says, quite logically, Hey, YOU called ME. In that moment, he has become a surrogate for the film audience. So kudos to Pakula, Roberts, and Washington for keeping things fairly exciting and interesting almost to the end; 'The Pelican Brief' does peter out as it reaches its conclusion. Still, it could have been a lot worse.

It's as if he dares anyone to question his honor. He is the epitome of journalistic integrity, if that's not an oxymoron. Were it not for Washington's considerable acting skills, his character would simply be too good to be true. He comes to the aid of Darby Shaw, played by Julia Roberts. In keeping with the film's quiet and suspicious nature, Roberts portrays Shaw as smart but increasingly paranoid, which is understandable as she is pursued by quite a few of those middle-aged white men who work for the President or the FBI or the CIA or some oil cartel... I was never quite clear on that either. It is an effective performance. I suppose part of the fun of reviewing a film like 'The Pelican Brief' is poking holes, or attempting to, in the plot's logic. For instance, I found it rather difficult to believe that the aforementioned intelligence agencies and assorted bad guys could not capture or kill the Darby Shaw character. She stays in various motels and hotels using her own credit cards; they spy on her, they tap her phone, but by golly, they never can seem to get their hands on her. She always outruns them or ducks into a crowd or jumps in Grantham's car at just the right moment. I know, this is standard issue stuff for a political intrigue\/murder mystery, but it really sticks out here as improbable. It's almost as if they stop chasing her after eight p.m. so she can get a good night's sleep. There is a funny moment too (though I don't think it's intentional) during one of those many hushed phone conversations; Shaw calls Grantham to give him some tidbits of information, and when he tries to find out more, she says, Don't ask me any questions. Grantham gets a confused look on his face and says, quite logically, Hey, YOU called ME. In that moment, he has become a surrogate for the film audience. So kudos to Pakula, Roberts, and Washington for keeping things fairly exciting and interesting almost to the end; 'The Pelican Brief' does peter out as it reaches its conclusion. Still, it could have been a lot worse.

There are a lot of hushed phone calls from people who offer tantalizing bits of information and clues before changing their minds and deciding not to say anything else. Then they are usually killed anyway. They might as well have spilled the beans. I had a hard time keeping up with who got killed and what their relationship to the plot was. They all seem to be bland-looking, middle-aged white men with pudgy tummies and receding hairlines. But I could be wrong about that. Anyway, it's a good thing 'The Pelican Brief' is so sombre and sneaky and foreboding. Once the truth is finally exposed and brought out into the open, it's not terribly interesting. A rich oilman wants to drill for oil in Louisiana. In order to do that, he has to kill a couple of Supreme Court justices so their successors will rule in his favor. Oh, and the brown pelicans of Louisiana's coast will be wiped out as a result too. I don't know, I think if I was in this movie, I'd be one of the bad guys. I'd rather drill for the oil than worry about the brown pelicans. And didn't FDR have a court-packing scheme of his own? Of course, he didn't kill anybody. That we know of. Director Alan Pakula certainly makes the most of what he has to work with here by keeping the suspense level high and by keeping our interest, period.

It arrives to a nicely civilized small town in the west. Comes out a famous politician. He says he came for the funeral of a friend, Tom Doniphon, that most people have forgotten. The politician sees the body, insists where are his boots? where is his gun belt. The boots, which was awfully nice, was taken by the undertaker, the funeral paid by the county. I am not going to make any money out of this, the undertaker says, who was going to sell these boots for gaining some extras. A fat and sad old man, a former marshal, mentions very quietly about the gun belt, he didn't carry a handgun for years.With a masterful economy of narrative, the beginning already crystallizes the thematic cores of this film, one of the last westerns by the master of the genre John Ford. Once it was a wilderness, the wild west. Now it's a garden, with churches, high schools, shops... civilized. But already the progress doesn't seem to be that positive--the symbol of civilization that opens the film, the train, is invading the innocence of the nature with black smoke. It's menacing. The town is clean but void of any charms. Many conversation about money, rather petty amounts. When the politician meets the black guy who worked for the dead friend, he palms some bills pretending to shake hand--a very acted out gesture of subtly caring--Jimmy Stewart is superb. The politician is obviously bluffing, acting out his charm. But at the funeral parlor, his attitude, even his manner, changes totally. Suddenly he is sincere, asking that his friend should be buried with boots and gun belt, symbol of a heroic westerner--that everybody has forgotten, now perished in poverty and oblivion.With James Stewart the iconic star of 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and the hero of the heroes of the western genre John Wayne, both playing more their own star personas, the ideals they had represented for the American cinema, than just their roles in one film, John Ford weaves out a complex analytical elegy on the myth of the west, crystallizing its inherit contradictions. This melancholic elegy is in no way sentimental nor positive, even surprisingly bitter and cold for the filmmaker that Orson Welles once called the poet and the comedian.The politician confesses the past between his and the friend who has died, the surprising truth about how he became the champion of law and order, arriving to the west with the hope of bringing civilization and democracy to the people of the west.But that tale is in no way an idyllic one. The young lawyer that he was being totally powerless against the law of the guns and violence of the west. The local community of small everyday people was menaced by an outlaw hired by the big ranchers. Only the heroic western gun man, that friend now going to be buried, could confront the outlaw. He told the young lawyer he should carry a gun if he wanted to survive. the young lawyer initially refused, as that would contradict his ideals of civilizations.The young lawyer opened a school. When he was talking about the democratic principles of the United States in the class room decorated by portraits of Washington and Lincoln and the Stars and Stripes, the gunman-friend came in to warn that the outlaw was approaching the small town. All the students had to leave, for safety. The lawyer, depressed, erased what he had written on the blackboard; education is the basis of law and order.The plot develops around how the lawyer Jimmy Stewart and the gunman John Wayne, totally disagreeing with each other, yet somewhat joined hand to beat the outlaw and the big ranchers. But the struggle can only be a twisted one. It reveals the most terrible sacrifice democracy and civilization needed to pay to be realized--by making compromises, ending up betraying the very core of its ideology. The honest and non-violent lawyer becomes a politician by taking violence in his hands and then corrupting his morals; nevertheless that was a necessity for the people. The old-fashioned heroic gunman has to disappear in oblivion, even willingly so, so that democracy and civilization can take over the outlaw wilderness.Disguising a western mixed with a mystery whodunit story, what 'The Man Liberty Valance' really tells is the dark side of the American history.

I like Sean Connery. Good start. We've got two great actors bouncing off one another.The plot is not paper thin, and Michael Bay leaves room for action, but doesn't make this film a completely mindless shootfest. The fact that Ed Harris is not a psychopath also adds depth to the film, as it is not a simple matter of good versus evil.Special effects and stunts are very well performed. As far as non-CGI action goes, this is a wonderful film.What makes this film? Two things the actors, and the action. The script works well because of the actors, and the film works well because of the thrill ride that the audience is taken along for.Michael Bay is not normally a good director, so it looks like he stumbled upon a decent film when he made this. Most of his films are tedious, patriotic to the extent of pukefests, and edited so quickly, that it's like watching a hard-house music video most of the time. For once, though, he's done alright.
