Alien 3 shares many similar elements with the original, many hapless outmatched victims in a confined space being hunted down by a single-minded killing machine, and despite the undeniable similarities with the first film I think Fincher brings enough new elements and flourishes to the table to make Alien 3 worthwhile, and in snippets compelling viewing &#x96; even though when you think about it all the Alien films are basically space monster films.Taking place immediately, only decades after the events of Aliens &#x96; but decades in hypersleep &#x96; the escape pod harbouring Lt Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Newt, Hicks and Bishop crash-land on Fury 161, a remote prison planet with a staff\/inmate population of about 25ish. After all the sh*t they went through in Aliens only Ripley survives, which if you think about it means she would have been infinitely better off declining that mission in the first place as she wisely did initially.Ripley comes to to find that as well as being the only survivor of the last mission, she is now surrounded by various rapists, murderers and plain old nasty types. The fact that the planet is also infested with lice and that all inhabitants must routinely shave their heads bald just seems unfair.The early stages find Ripley coming to terms with her situation and taking steps to discover is there were *other* stowaways on board the escape pod, including a graphic-without-being-graphic autopsy of young deceased Newt, carried out by Fury 161's Doc Clemens (Charles Dance), who Ripley swiftly decides to be one of the only sane and non-dangerous members of her new community, leading to the first scene involving nudie hijinks in an Alien film, even though there is no on screen shenanigans.The remainder of the inmates have not so much as seen a fully functional woman in decades, and some harbour nefarious thoughts toward her &#x96; even when Weaver is mannish to begin with and bald to boot! Sensing this the Head of the facility Andrews immediately requests an evac of Ripley off the planet, and is astonished to find that his request is not only acknowledged but fast tracked.So with the impending pick up looming all that is left is for Ripley to stay put and keep out of the way of those that might do her harm.But that's before the inmates start to go missing.In desperation Ripley consults the remaining half of Bishop who was unceremoniously dumped on a scrap heap, using him to hack into the escape pod's onboard black box to ascertain if they were truly alone.

Very quickly. It soon learns that it is there for one reason only, that being to chew through each and every inhabitant on the prison planet. Hey you gotta stick with what you know I guess.Once Ripley realizes that they are not alone she starts delivering warnings left and right. As is always the case with these films the warnings are taken as they usually are&#x85; until the Alien starts a'chomping.The rest of the film has Ripley and the various riff-raff of staff and inmates standing around wondering who is to be picked off next and saying F*CK a lot. In fact that word is uttered so frequently and so forcefully in this film that I can't help but wonder if the crew had a competition to see who could deliver the line with the most conviction &#x96; and spittle.Alien 3 is not particularly gory or violent, with a couple of notable exceptions in the latter stages of the film, but even in the early going David Fincher knew that a trickle of blood can go a long way and provoke as many squirms as any graphic on screen violence. There are a great many speeches in this film, with various characters getting their shot at standing up and delivering impassioned demands with impressive musical accompaniment &#x96; often just before they are chomped on.

Jesus is somewhat oblivious as to why this is happening, but he knows it has something to do with a device he found in his antiques store. The Cronos was made by an alchemist in the 1500's, and comes into the possession of Jesus by way of an angel statuette. Strange things start happening after Jesus accidentally activates the Cronos.

I think it's because Matheson and Jack Arnold managed to catch lightning in a bottle when they made it, and a remake would lose the resonance and relevance of the source material. It's a hard story to tell properly, especially with the ambiguously metaphysical ending, and it appears no one really wants to try (even Matheson appeared to give up on a sequel).It took a while for me to connect Grant Williams in this role with the first two roles I saw him (his last two roles, Brain Of Blood and The Doomsday Machine), and it's saddening to think that this actor peaked so early in his career, only to end up in dreck like Brain Of Blood. He really is excellent here - a beautiful bland cipher who somehow manages to stand in for Everyman with his combination of good looks and vulnerability.The movie's sense of paranoia, inexplicable disaster, and identity crisis combine with some stellar special effects that hold up very well more than 50 years later.

It's pretty much a cliché now, but Clint got there first.There was an attempt I think to liberalize Dirty Harry. They gave him a black partner and an Asian girlfriend, neither of whom could act.So here's the plot. Someone is killing all of San Francisco's bad guys. Harry suspects that it might be a fellow cop as they were able to get fairly close to their targets without a problem. He uncovers a Death Squad within the SFPD, run by Hal Holbrook, of all people.Lots of good actors in this cast- David Soul, Robert Urich, Tim Matheson - who would go on to better things.Oh, can we talk about the Albert Popwell. Al appeared in all four Harry movies, playing different characters. In the original, he was one of the bank robbers who had the good sense to not try to figure out how many bullets Harry shot. In this one, he plays a pimp who kills one of his girls with drain cleaner, and is killed himself by the Death Squad.Al Popwell. He lived. He died. He lived again. He died again. And seriously, Clint, do you think we didn't all notice it was the same guy? This is your quintessential 1970's cop movie. Enjoy it for what it is.

It's pretty much a cliché now, but Clint got there first.There was an attempt I think to liberalize Dirty Harry. They gave him a black partner and an Asian girlfriend, neither of whom could act.So here's the plot. Someone is killing all of San Francisco's bad guys. Harry suspects that it might be a fellow cop as they were able to get fairly close to their targets without a problem. He uncovers a Death Squad within the SFPD, run by Hal Holbrook, of all people.Lots of good actors in this cast- David Soul, Robert Urich, Tim Matheson - who would go on to better things.Oh, can we talk about the Albert Popwell. Al appeared in all four Harry movies, playing different characters. In the original, he was one of the bank robbers who had the good sense to not try to figure out how many bullets Harry shot.

Rains makes for a brilliant pre-Phantom, but only his shadow is present for the remainder. His slip into madness is also quite sudden. It would have been nice for the main plot to take place 10 years after the scarring. It's typical Hollywood cinema of the 40's, catering to the widest market. It helps that each of Christine's suiters is given enough time to develop, and none of them are unlikable. We even get a hilariously misjudged comedic scene where two men keep saying the exact same thing AND get stuck in a doorway. The musical productions are also very detailed, with the sets being impressive in both scale and design.
