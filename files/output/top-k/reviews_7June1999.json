Everything about it is great direction, script, performances, cinematography, art direction, costumes, makeup, and music.This film was made to demonstrate how Princess Elizabeth went from being a trusting and love-struck young girl and developed into a queen who devoted herself entirely to her country. This movie was NOT made to focus on specific acts she did during her reign--that would've taken endless hours.  Furthermore, would anyone really care about those specific acts?  Most people wouldn't.  This film gives viewers a general idea of what was required of Elizabeth as a woman in order to rule with absolute power for the sake of her country.A very clever touch in this film was that early in the film, you see Elizabeth behind curtains, or behind a window, or even behind bars....you don't get to see a clear picture of her, something which parallels the way that her life was at that time, considering that she had an uncertain future.What is perhaps the most remarkable thing about this movie is the way that Elizabeth undergoes a transformation.  She comes to realize that she can't trust anyone.Cate Blanchett gives an excellent performance as the woman who would become known as England's greatest monarch.  The supporting cast is also terrific, especially Christopher Eccleston and Geoffrey Rush.  I also like the fact that some of the lines in this film are quite memorable. What I consider to be the most memorable scene in this movie is the ending--a truly amazing ending, and Cate Blanchett's final line in this film sums it all up best. Elizabeth is a tour de force in filmmaking, and a period piece for the nineties.  Much better than the overrated atrocity Shakespeare in Love.

The Haze woman must be UNattractive. Shelly Winters in Kubrick's Lolita (1962) was perfect for the part because she was a woman who had once been attractive, but had become fat and had lost her looks. Charlotte must be unattractive as a contrast to Lo (and not just in Humbert's mind); furthermore the references to her as a fat cow and Humbert's disinclination to make love to her, do not play well if she's attractive. Melanie Griffith is actually better looking than the young star, Dominique Swain, who plays Lolita. Swain is pretty enough, however, and although not the great beauty that Sue Lyon (who played Lolita in the original) was, she is actually sexier, and she is an excellent actress. She does the coquettish muggings better than Sue Lyon did and she is allowed more latitude. Humbert never even kissed Lolita in Kubrick's version! The direction is patently stupid in parts as though Lyne wasn't paying attention to his film. He has Humbert stare at Lolita in the famous scene when he first spots her on the lawn much, much too long so that Charlotte Haze could not help but notice his noticing. And in the scene on the front porch, with the three of them together on the couch, Charlotte would have to be blind not to see the sex play between the two right there in front of her eyes.This is a cynical, loveless Lolita. The scene at the Enchanted Huntress is not enchanted. Instead Lo teaches Hum some sex numbers. By the time they are in the car driving away from the Enchanted Huntress, the romance is over.Once on the road, Humbert finds out that he has to be a father as well as a lover. She thus begins to despise him. But she has nowhere else to turn. The rooms of the motels are not romanticized. Lyne makes them sorted and cheap. He shows a sign advertising Children under 14 free at one of Humbert's choice stopping places, slyly reminding the cognoscente that Nabokov's nymphet should be younger than Shakespeare's Juliet, who was thirteen. (Given the puritanical nature of the American political psyche, neither Lyne nor Kubrick was able to make a true to the book film.) Irons is now looking older with the stress of taking care of Lo and dealing with his forbidden love.Lyne wants to emphasize the idea that Lolita has been robbed of part of her childhood. She becomes a prostitute, effectively speaking, as she negotiates with Humbert about quarters and dollars for her favors. Kubrick glossed over this while Lyne highlights it. When Humbert tries to grab her saved-up money for fear she will use it to escape him, she shouts indignantly, I EARNED that money! We feel no affection or identification for Humbert as played by Irons because he seems so consumed by his sexual need that he is aware of nothing else. James Mason as Kubrick's Humbert at least aroused our pity. In the novel and in the Kubrick film it was clear that Humbert loved her. In this version it appears that he only wants to use her to get off. And in fact can only get off with her, and so in one sense he is her prisoner.One of the strong points of Lyne's film is the photography of Swain. The camera brings both her adolescent body and face alive. She is natural and confident. It's hard not to feel a strong affection for her. Again I would like to see more evidence that Humbert loves her. In some scenes we see that she, in her on-again off- again way, loves him, as though she cannot not help but love him because there is no one else. It is kind of like we love our parents because they are our parents--and hate them since they control us.The Kubrick film and the novel had Humbert as the focus. The Lyne film, despite the Humbert voice-over, is really seen from Lo's point of view. And Lyne did not, I suspect, like all the comedy in the Kubrick version.The really terrible thing about Nabokov's tale that both directors got right is the unrelenting possessiveness of Humbert, the unrelenting control he exercised over Lolita. That was his undoing of course, and really shows the perverted nature of his love for her. If he had really loved her, he would have stepped aside and let her live a normal life. That's what fathers do. That he loved her as a woman is not in itself a tragedy. It was the jealousy and control. Lolita makes this clear when as the pregnant, married and glasses-wearing Dolly, looking common and matronly in a cheap house with a dirt yard and a working-class husband, she sees Humbert for the last time.Lyne wanted us to focus on something sad and corrupted. This is a Lolita for the Nineties. She is exploitative; he is a sick man she is exploiting. This interpretation will be more agreeable to some since it reenforces the idea that teen sexuality is wrong. As usual, we see that nobody cares about the girl. The feminists know she has the sexual power, and they are jealous. They want to put her off limits so that they have a better currency themselves. This is the political position of the sexual wars, and Lyne has fallen into it. I think we need a French Lolita, as done by somebody like Louis Malle. I don't expect this for another hundred years, however. This film ought to kill the theme for quite a while.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Second, the supporting cast delivers a great performance, and in some cases, eclipses the lead actor and actress. I would really like to rant out, but time barely permits me.  My only concern is that the film is tailored somewhat to the dating scene of the mid-twenties, especially those like hip-hop or R & B.

Or even how animals feel when they are displaced by aliens in flying machines destroying their homes to take away the resources (gee, folks, the crop duster character...).This movie is telling us to feel about ourselves the way we felt about the alien threat. Shucks, they came in the first place because they had consumed their planet's resources. Doesn't that sound like us?! (deforestation, water and air pollution, are we that oblivious to what's happening?) War has involved pillaging resources for thousands of years, from fighting over share of the hunted herds to fighting over the land to cultivate to fighting for the gold...And, let's not even begin to talk about colonialism and slavery...Notice also that the crop duster is the one worthy to destroy the aliens by sacrifice; he seems to judge himself at the same time, and as it were justifies his killing them by dying with them.There is a whole lot in this film.Compare the presidential characterization in this movie versus, say, The Rock.Or, how about the scene where Will Smith punches out the alien - preposterous, we might say. But, think about it -- if the creature is carbon-based, and if the whole universe came from one big bang start, why can't it be as fragile as earth-bound carbon-based forms? We have this idea that, if we ever met an alien, it must be stronger - why? who's ever authenticated a meeting with one to say?If you missed all this (and so much more, but there's a limit here!), you may need to watch it again.

Before viewing the movie I had an advantage of reading people's positive and negative reviews which, on par, were evenly balanced from those who loved the move to those who despised TPM. I walked into the theatre feeling neutral due to the even feedback presented by the public.I came out of the cinema feeling satisfied about TPM. For the critics who slammed TPM I think they over react. One must remember that this is the FIRST movie out of six and therefore has to set a foundation which focused on Anakin. So there did not have to be an emphasis on Darth Maul or the Jedi characters and I felt we were sufficiently educated on Anakin's background.TPM was high on special effects I agree, possibly too high, but it's a sci-fi movie meaning that its ALL artificial anyway. So whats the difference can I ask those harsh critics between an artificial sci-fi movie world low in SFX and another movie with high SFX such as TPM? The panoramic views of the cities and landscapes were fantastic but I felt the SFX fell down with the characters on two grounds, one I felt they were copied and pasted as one does using a graphics programme causing over duplication of the same character thus losing individuality of creatures. The other ground where SFX fell down was the motion of the created creatures which appeared unnatural.Now for Jar-Jar Binks. Lets face it, you either like him or hate him. I personally found him an ok addition. I would have liked him more if he and his race spoke without that jibberish dialect and a little less of the slapstick clumsy comedy would have definitely done Jar-Jar's character more justice.The plot has come under criticism but I found it simplistic like the other three Star Wars movies which is not a bad thing at all. At least one can sit down and enjoy the movie rather than have to think through a movie about what people did or said earlier on. And whilst on speech, yes, the script was light on and over done with the force cliches. But overall the plot and the dialogue was ok.I can't understand critics saying TPM was boring. They must have been asleep thats all I can say. The fight scenes were great. Especially the final fight sequence accompanied by some fantastic classical music. And if that did'nt capture your eye, as I previously mentioned, the pure creation of these cities are incredible. The pod race was also exciting but I must agree with critics who say it was a Ben Hur chariot race star wars style. It was appropriate in my mind and I liked how Lucas threw in the Jawas and Tuscans from Star War in that scene. The only thing which made it a bit corny and cliche was the sport commentators.Overall, I enjoyed the movie, the effects, the characters and even the plot.
