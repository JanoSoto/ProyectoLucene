One is that it is referred to as a sequel, which if you watch this film straight after you have watched ED, you will notice some major continuity errors, such as the disappearance of Scotty, Cheryl & Shelly from the storyline. In fact at the beginning of this film we even see Ash (Campbell) and Linda (doing a terrible job is Blixler, who has replaced the wonderful Betsy Baker) arriving at the Cabin alone, and now the run-down almost empty cabin we saw in the first film is a fully furnished and deluxe cabin, with a fully done out kitchen. I know I'm splitting hairs here, but the fact is if you're going to make a sequel to a film, at least try and make sure everything makes sense.. I mean it really couldn't have been that hard for Raimi to re-watch the first film and get some of the continuity right. Also, another thing is why Ash stopped being a Deadite in sunlight? That didn't make sense at all, since there is no reason why light would affect the force of the ED.The other problem I have with DBD is it's decent into mass commercialism. One of the great things about ED was that it was an independent film, and had such a freaky atmospheric feel to it. DBD has none of that, it's like mass marketed film made for all the eye candy horror-wannabes who wanted to see Ash return to fight the big bad evil. And instead of getting a great sequel to a great horror film, we have gotten a horrored up version of Ash doing an I-Love-Lucy smashing kitchen plates on his head, and going completely crazy. Now that I have said the negative, let me go on to say that as a stand-alone horror film, apart from ED. DBD is actually quite a good film. It mixes comedy, with horror(although once again the Deadites in this film, are more like Hollywood zombies than those seen in ED), and has some quite hilarious scenes such as Ash battling Knoby's now Deadite wife Henrietta (played brilliant by a young Ted Raimi), and the laughing deer & lamp in Knoby's study, which added such weirdness to the film. The ending which falls into the next film in the ED Trilogy, Army of Darkness, is also quite well done.All in all, don't watch DBD straight after ED, in fact look at DBD as a remake, rather than a sequel, because then you will enjoy it much more.

Now from his two previous films that I have seen I have guessed that this man makes some quite disturbing movies that really have no point and it all happens over again with The Addiction which really is a film trying to be something else.Lilly Taylor plays Kathleen, a philosophy student who is quite an outcast to the world. She has friends and likes to mind her own business till one night she is walking home from the University and she is suddenly grabbed by an unknown woman played by Annabella Scirroa and she takes a liking to her neck and before any introducing she starts to get stuck in. Whether or not she is a vampire I can't answer as in this entire film of many neck biting moments you do not see one fang throughout so this questions the film whether the film is about Vampires with fangs or vampires without and just like to taste blood. Afterwards changes begin to occur in Kathleen's life and of course her zest for the taste of blood becomes more apart of her life. At first it just starts by her injecting other people's blood into her veins but then the she begins to invite people around to her apartment and really get stuck in. Here her life is turned around by all this and she is taken into a journey of madness. On the way she meets more victims then she finally meets Christopher Walken who is just like her but knows how to control his addiction for blood better than others. More of the so called story unfolds and it just seems this film goes nowhere whatsoever. I don't understand why studio's would give funding to a film like this. All the way through it just talks about redemption and stuff and I don't feel convinced by any of this. I've spoken to some people and they say it's probably his best work but I still think King of New York is his best work to date and if he keeps making films like The addiction it will be his best film for a long time to come. The performances from Lili Taylor was very good but I just got this feeling that she was trying to hard to be her character and just goes on in scenes and doesn't make any sense of it. I suppose if I had been bitten by somebody on the neck then I wouldn't be in the right frame of mind but that's not the point, the point is that Abel Ferrara has thrown out a film that is to short and at 79 minutes running time, you can't be expected to throw out a good enough film with this long a film. Christopher Walken was the best thing about it as his character isn't to much to take in and he actually sounds interesting without be annoying unlike Lili Taylor who just drove me mad throughout cause I don't like her acting at all. The Addiction is the reason why Abel Ferrara won't be remembered in 50 years and if he is then it will be to just remember that he made that crap film The Addiction and was trying to hard. Hopefully King of New York will stand its time, but if you watch Driller Killer which is beyond awful, Bad Lieutenant which is just a shock film without the shocks , King of New York will restore your faith in Ferrara and The Funeral which isn't half bad, but the Addiction is just not what I wanted and neither will you.

I am trying really hard to watch some of these older films. They are the backbone to modern cinema ... but can't they be any better. I am still waiting for me to discover that gem. I think that is my mission now. I want to see an older film that is virtually unheard of, but is movie making at its best. So, what was wrong with Beat the Devil you may ask? The fades were one aspect I had trouble getting over. Another was what the director was trying to do with Bogart. Trying to enjoy the spoof that the director, John Houston, was planting in the film was hard. What Houston was trying to do was spoof all of Bogart's prior films. This movie was like all of Bogart's films meshed together so to speak. While you don't normally see this in many movies (the only one that comes to mind is True Lies with Arnie), in this film it was done so badly that the humor was lost to confusion. This was one of those films that you have to watch, and your initial reaction is going to be the true feeling that you have for this film. I thought about re-watching this film to see if it got any better for me, but as I thought about it, I had to pass. My initial reaction was not good, and I had this feeling deep in me that it wasn't going to get much better with a second viewing. Maybe I was expecting better, I mean Truman Capote wrote the film ... that should mean something ... right? Finally, and perhaps I just need to see more of them, but I have trouble watching a satire without any jokes. Growing up in the era of Mel Brooks, I wanted scenes and words that I would just fall over with laughter about. This film carried none of this. There was only one scene that made me smile a bit (and perhaps it was because my throat was dry), and that was when Bogart's buggy went down the cliff and into the ocean. The only reason for me laughing at that was because it reminded me of Hawaii and our trip up a huge mountain!! Blach! Watch out for this one ... it's a doozie!!Grade ** out of *****  ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"24 September 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I first saw this movie in Montparnasse Paris on the only 70mm screen in Europe.

This is our initial introduction to the life and business of two brothers named Secondo and Primo (symbolically named second and first to make sure that we the viewers can remember which is the older and which is the younger). Together they have come from Italy in hopes of pursuing the American dream, to become popular and wealthy with their trade. Each brother has his own trade. Secondo (played by Tucci) is the business suave brother, he attempts to keep the restaurant afloat by pleading with the bankers, while on the other hand test driving the newest Cadillacs because he believes in the philosophy, To be successful, you must first look like you are successful. Primo, played perfectly by Tony Shalhoub (best known for the TV series Monk and the Men in Black films), is the chef of the family. Although both brothers can cook, Primo prides himself to know food the best. His belief is that the food will bring the customers in through the doors, not due to the booze, women, or music. Together, with the help of some of their friends, they try to keep their heritage alive by trying to save their restaurant.Alright, before you say, Well, I don't need to read further, I know what the review is going to be... Think again. This film was honestly one of the worst independent films that I have seen for some time. Tucci's style of film-making (along with Scott) is almost like we were watching a theater group on the big screen. I understand that is a very common style to use, but it didn't cut it during this film. While Shalhoub is amazing in his role, it is almost erased by Tucci's role. He overplays his character to the limit. We forget about the two brothers and spend so much time trying to get past Tucci's acting in this film, that we loose sight of the whole picture. I also felt like the timing was off. Several times I glanced at my watch to see how much time was remaining on this picture. Coming fresh off of Mostly Martha, and being a fan of Chocolat, I wanted to see so much Italian food that I would immediately rush out after the film and gorge myself with all the Italian food that Southwest Virginia had to offer. I wanted to salivate every time I saw or even heard Italian food, but unfortunately, Pavlov still had a lot to work to do. Unfortunately, after watching this film, I wanted to immediately purge myself of all Italian food that I had eaten in my lifetime.Big Night left a horrible taste in my mouth. It was a beautiful ensemble, with some great actors, but Tucci needed to give them something to stand out of the screen with. I felt, and I know the film was about the two brothers, that the other characters didn't mean anything. When the secret from Pascal was announced, I didn't see him as the self-proclaimed villain. He was just a liar, nothing more...but I wanted more. People have raved about this film, but I don't see the big secret. Nothing new, nothing special. Big Night showed that lack of creativity, and without power or money the American dream cannot become a reality. It was almost a insult to what America has to offer. To respond to brotherly love, it really didn't seem like the two brothers wanted to work for their money. They just wanted the 'American Dream' to appear and be theirs..

They just threw in some science fiction and time-traveling to make it seem fresh and new. The idea of criminals committing crimes in the past is kind of good, but the futuristic science fiction aspects of the film don't hold water. It's not just because we are now actually in 2004, which is where the movie takes place, since, being made ten years ago, I guess they thought it wasn't entirely impossible for this time to be so developed, no, it's more the fact that we're expected to believe that virtually every single crime being committed(every major one, at least) is being with one intent and purpose, and organized by one man. Of course, I won't reveal neither the purpose nor the person here; wouldn't want to spoil the story for someone who actually *does* care about it; I can't say that I did. The plot is the typical predictable out-to-avenge-a-wronging action plot. It's decently paced. The acting is laughable at best, with Van Damme having the exact same facial expression for the entirety of the 90-minute runtime. The characters are for the most part clichés and stereotypes. The action is pretty good, but nothing you haven't seen in all of Van Damme's other action flicks. The special effects are poor. The writing is simple. The dialog is often cringe-worthy rather than funny or exciting. The science fiction aspects are poorly done with (apparently) little to no actual thought put into it. All in all, the film is just the typical Van Damme flick. Not really anything that sets it apart from the rest of his films.

Oh, and throw in a bunch of children smoking pot and having sex to appeal to the niche market that really, really enjoys watching five year old girls prance around in beauty contests.Then create a doosie of a PR campaign that would make any performance artist proud--one that convinces even the critics that the film is so profound, if you don't like it, that's only because you're just not clever enough to get it.The sad thing is, I'm not trying to be funny.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"24 September 2004","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  For those of you who have not read the story, basically we follow the life of a black stallion named Black Beauty and Blackjack when he has his name changed near the center of the film. We watch as Black Beauty goes through all the emotions and feelings of a human through his life. He learns of love from his mother at birth, and later through another horse named Ginger. He learns of friendship through his first family, through a boy named Joe, and even through a archaic taxi driver. Through the course of an hour and a half, we see the highs and lows of life through the eyes of this beautiful stallion.I feel that the initial response that I will get from this review is that if I do give it a poor review, it means that I agree with the cruel treatment of animals. First of all that is not the case. I am a vegetarian, not that it has anything to do with animals, but it is fun to say. There is something I need to get off my chest about this film. For an hour and a half I sat and watched the cruel treatment of this fine horse by humans. I watched as the director attempted to show that humans are capable of both love and hate. A theme used in almost every film today. My biggest gripe about this film is not with the film itself, but with what was happening behind the camera. During the course of the film, you could not help but wonder how the trainers were getting these horses to move, act, and react on cue. I am almost one hundred percent certain that these horses did not have their own trailers, that they did not have an acting coach, and most importantly that there was a scene rehearsal. I am certain that these animals were thrown right in front of the camera as their trainers did everything possible to make sure that they did everything they were supposed to. For all of those reviews I have read about how this film shows a much needed side of humanity and their cruelty of animals, I think this film is a double standard. It teaches\/shows the cruelty of animals, yet we do not see behind the camera. I am not a betting man, but if I was I would have to say that perhaps what the camera didn't show was madness, mayhem, and cruelty. I could see it in the extra's eyes that they were not treated fairly (the extras were cows ... you can tell a lot about a cow through the eyes). Do animals get the same treatment as actors? Is there a union for these horses, or do they have representation? If the answer is no to both of these, then I am going to have to say that we DEFINITELY need to look behind the camera and see the true cruelty that is happening to these beasts.Also, why was is this film considered an independent film? I am going out on a limb here by saying that they only reason is due to Alan Cumming. I think that his early work is considered independent, so they added it to this bookTo sum up quickly, this film was horrible. Not only was my mind constantly questioning the treatment when the cameras went off, but I felt the story was too coincidence. I know it is very Hollywood to have these coincidences, but too many of them make an unbelievable story. To believe that this horse, of all the horses in the world, came full circle to happiness really made me question the sanity of the director. The words coming from the horse were to the utmost cheese factor. The line that sticks so heavily in my mind is hearing Alan Cumming (in character of Black Beauty) say, Oats. Wonderful oats. I was hoping to die a happy man without those words passing through my mind. But oh well, who would have thought it.Overall, this is a children's story and film, so maybe I needed more children to fully enjoy it. Black Beauty was not the film that I was hoping for, nor will I ever rest until my animal friends have proper film representation. I think I am going to call the law offices of Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe. I think they are the only ones that can help...Grade * out of *****  ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2004","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  For those of you who have not read the story, basically we follow the life of a black stallion named Black Beauty and Blackjack when he has his name changed near the center of the film.
