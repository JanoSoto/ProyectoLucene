The film is well-acted, expertly crafted, and does a remarkably good job at getting the viewer involved in its derivative story. The decision to make a belated sequel to a 23-year old horror classic could have met with disaster, and I was initially shocked that Hollywood would even want to try it, considering the financial hardship Broadway met with after they tried to create a musical stage version (!) of Stephen King's story a few years after the original film came out. But the final result is surprisingly watchable, and it's certainly a cut above the many half-assed horror sequels that have wasted valuable screen space over the past year, such as Species II and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. There is, however, one crucial element that Carrie 2 sorely lacks a reason for even existing in the first place.Basically, the film just rehashes the standard plotline of the original, and adds very few new elements of its own to the proceedings. The only difference this time is that the lead character is named Rachel, not Carrie (which renders the title completely meaningless, but never mind). Rachel is a teenage outcast (but, as usual, is far more attractive than most of the outcasts we know in real life), who inadvertently ends up getting the more popular kids at her school into trouble. They decide to play a very cruel practical joke on her in retaliation, which relies on Jesse, the school's most likable jock, asking her out. He ends up really falling in love with her, however, and just as Rachel begins to feel accepted for the first time in her life, the bad kids go through with their prank. But having just recently found out that she is Carrie's illegitimate sister and has inherited her power of telekinesis, Rachel decides to utilize that gift to ensure that they will not live to see college. The only survivor of this ordeal ends up receiving the jolt of their life in the epilogue. Sounds a little familiar, doesn't it? The only real surprise in the film evolves from the subplot involving Rachel's abusive foster family. After the drunken father smacks her around a bit, one's expecting a rehash of the riveting finale in the original where Carrie vented all her rage against her religiously hysterical mother, but the character completely disappears from the picture!Most of the picture's energy is devoted to the climactic sequence when Rachel finally vents her rage against her peers. It's actually quite entertaining since the filmmakers come up with some delightfully over-the-top ways for the kids to perish. Yet it doesn't pack near the same emotional wallop as the prom set piece from the original since it doesn't add anything new to the formula. And that's a shame because newcomer Emily Bergl is terrific in the lead, and does an impressive job at measuring up to Sissy Spacek's remarkable performance in the original. It is because of her that the film is as involving as it is, and the love story between her and Jesse is surprisingly sweet. It is actually more interesting than the relationships we see in most straight teen romance films these days. There are many elements of Carrie 2 that work quite well and since the basic story is one that we can all identify with, the film is able to hold one's interest from beginning to end. It's just too bad the picture as a whole is so routine. Just because a horror sequel is watchable does not mean that it is particularly invigorating.

Although I see a good number of movies, I tend not to relate all that well to female actors, and this was the first time Susan Sarandon ever really grabbed me.  She is luminous in this film, and I haven't missed a movie of hers since (although there were one or two I wish I had).The material is just as fresh and edgy now as it was 8 years ago when I first saw it.  The camera work in the New Mexico\/Arizona lanscape as night fades into morning is stupendous, as it is at the Arkansas bar where the adventure begins.  My dismay at the aftermath of Brad Pitt's visit to Thelma is as palpable now as ever it was, and my heart sails with these incredible women each time I see them launch their new lives at the end of the movie.Much is made of whether the end of this movie is depressing or exhilarating.  I vote wholeheartedly for exhilarating  I don't know if I'd have the cojones to do it or not, but Thelma and Louise bring their impossible situation to a satisfying close on their terms, and they do it with gusto.  I feel certain that the tears I shed every time I see this movie are joy, not sadness.Kallie Khouri richly deserved her Oscar for screenwriting, and I've always felt that both Sarandon and Davis were robbed.  Jodi Foster, you may remember, won best actress in 1991, for her portrayal of Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs.  There have been Oscars that Foster deserved, but Clarice was not her best role, and it certainly wasn't the best role played by a woman that year.I think, too, that this movie, aside from being the greatest buddy movie ever made, is a great feminist manifesto.  The male characters, with the exception Hal Slocumb and Jimmy, are total buffoons, and I've known a thousand men like them.  This is a story of two women who fight back against the oppression of idiot losers, and live their lives honestly, justly, and on their own terms.

Although I see a good number of movies, I tend not to relate all that well to female actors, and this was the first time Susan Sarandon ever really grabbed me.  She is luminous in this film, and I haven't missed a movie of hers since (although there were one or two I wish I had).The material is just as fresh and edgy now as it was 8 years ago when I first saw it.  The camera work in the New Mexico\/Arizona lanscape as night fades into morning is stupendous, as it is at the Arkansas bar where the adventure begins.

Sweet without being sugary. Light without being too shallow. Touching without being preachy or pompous. Incredible but somehow you want to believe it. I liked it.The opening scenes are of Drew Barrymore standing on the pitcher's mound (Is that right? I sometimes have trouble with this Transatlantic language lark) in a baseball stadium. But why is she there? Why is the clock ticking?Barrymore's character is that of Josie Geller, a, ferociously efficient but retentive 25 year old copy editor who longs to be a reporter. Her big break comes when the manically self obsessed proprietor of her Chicago newspaper gives her an  assignment - to go back to high school, an environment in which she suffered mightily first time round (who didn't?), to dish the inside dirt on the youth of today. Brief and incomplete plot synopsis followsYou don't need to work too hard to guess what happens, but in general things are, as P G Wodehouse might have said, &#145;pretty scaly'. As before, she is reviled by the beautiful young things who gravitate to the social circle of the boy-who-has-everything. Eventually, through the intervention of her brother (a baseball whizz but, at time of telling, another of life's losers, working in a dead end job), she eventually gets accepted by the very kind of social group that made her life a misery in her real school years. On the way, guess what? She loses sight of the unconditional friendship given to her by the school geeks (errr, what, you mean her alter egos? Gosh nearly missed that.).Things get more complex when she falls (mutually) in love with her English teacher. A whole lot of ducking and diving ensues until the eventual denouement. The misunderstandings lead us back, via a favourite device of American directors, the prom night, to the opening scene. We find she is actually waiting, in front of a huge TV audience, for the teacher to come to her and give her her first real kiss. Does he arrive? I shall let you find out.This is not all sweetness and light; there is a harder edge. The depiction of the relentless school prejudice against oddballs is horribly true to life (even if Aldys, the ringleader of the main oddball group, the Denominators, falls into the Laney Boggs camp). There is even a line referring to &#145;Carrie'. It is made as a throwaway, but it is a neat reference; there is a real sense that it could all go very ugly very quickly indeed.On the other hand Barrymore turns in yet another sterling performance in a romantic comedy, a field she is rapidly making her own. The Prom Queen speech may be a bit heavy handed (oops, I gave away a plot line), but it does have the ring of truth about it, and she manages to pull it off without an outbreak of mass wincing in the audience.Go and see it, not because it will expand your mind, but just because it is a really nice film.

And it undermines everything that I had ever thought that Ben and Janeane and Bill Macy and PeeWee stood for in terms of thematic development. And it was SO unnecessary! Mystery Men could've easily stood on its own merits as a great satire, but NO... they have to go and DESTROY it by adding a cliched little 'message' to the end.Don't let it get the best of you when you see this film (which I must highly reccommend-- it's unbelievably funny, in a guilty-pleasure context), don't watch the last 20 minutes. They're every bit as heavy-handed as the ending of Contact, which is a huge disappointment.You'd hope that this particular cast would be ABOVE doing something so trite. KEEP THE ILLUSION ALIVE.Rating 8 out of 10. That excludes the stupid ending, because it simply DOES NOT FIT with the rest of this otherwise-hilarious satire. Janeane, HOW COULD YOU?

Mystery Men could've easily stood on its own merits as a great satire, but NO... they have to go and DESTROY it by adding a cliched little 'message' to the end.Don't let it get the best of you when you see this film (which I must highly reccommend-- it's unbelievably funny, in a guilty-pleasure context), don't watch the last 20 minutes. They're every bit as heavy-handed as the ending of Contact, which is a huge disappointment.You'd hope that this particular cast would be ABOVE doing something so trite.

The cast... the satire... unparallelled bliss!And for much of this film, I was not disappointed. Mystery Men takes all of the cheap shots-- but it pulls them off intelligently, with all of the derision that one would expect from Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo (an absolute GODDESS... there just aren't enough superlative adjectives to describe how brilliant she is.)The 'rescue scene' with Captain Amazing (a hilarious Greg Kinnear) is executed brilliantly, effortlessly blending slapstick and satire.Visually, the film is stunning, as well.

It has all of the elements necessary for a good movie- 1.) A good (not all believable) plot, 2.) Convincing acting, 3.) John Travolta and Nicholas Cage doing some of their best work, and 4.) John Woo directing it.  If you add all four of those things together, you will get a hit movie.  I knew that my friends would like the movie, but I was amazed at how much the critics enjoyed it as well.This movie should be seen for the action and comedy.  I would not recommend that little kids see this due to some images at the start of the movie. (those that have seen it know what I am talking about)Travolta and Cage were great together.  They complimented each others acting abilities very well.  Joan Allen and Dominique Swain were also very good in there respected roles.I have seen this movie at least 40 times.  Seriously 40 times.  I still do not get board watching it.  It was 10 times more enjoyable than Titanic, which won for best picture of 1997 at the Academy Awards.  At least Face\/Off was nominated for the MTV Movie Awards for best picture.  It's an honor just being nominated.  I personally feel that it should have won, but the nomination was nice.If you are an action fan, you probably will like this movie.  If you are a drama fan, you probably will like parts of this movie.  If you have a pulse, you probably will like this movie. That is my personal opinion.

The plot as represented in the media makes the film sound so basic and dull (seen it all before, one thinks) that the rave reviews that accompany the film leads to the conclusion that it must have something good to offer. It does not. It's a huge disappointment, in particular as the director's last film, Swingers, was so great. I thought the POV switch, upon which virtually the whole film is structured was a shameless rip off of the marvellous Jackie Brown. It only goes to show that it ain't what you do, its the way that you do it. In tone, the film does indeed ape Pulp Fiction, but isn't fit to lick it's boots. The action is unbelievable and the characters behaviour non-sensical. At no point does one identify with any of them and I personally spent the whole time wishing the worst for them. The actors try their best, but they are in the main playing shallow characatures.
