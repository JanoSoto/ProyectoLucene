It suffers from a supremely lack-luster storyline, auto-pilot acting and unexciting 'action'. Both Stallone and Reynolds, two formally great actors, gave me false hope that they would each return to excellent form (Sly in the superb Copland, and Burt for his great role in Boogie Nights), but any good will that those two films bought them from me is sadly shot right down again with this atrocious effort.My Grade D- DVD Extras Commentary by Director Renny Harlin; 15 minute 'Making of' featurette; 10 minute featurette on the visual effects; 51 minutes of deleted scenes with Stallone Commentary; Cast and Crew Filmographies; Theatrical Trailer; and a trailer for the video game tie-in ","genre":null},{"date":"25 June 2005","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Stallone and Renny Harlin team up again almost a decade after the action packed Cliifhanger, but the outcome is not nearly as good in this tale of an emotionally scarred former racing star (Stallone) hired by car owner (Burt Reynolds) to teach a talented rookie how to go the distance and stay focused.

Not that coolio was bad, but it just dragged along. Probably more accurate about the Hollywood mindset then people in LA are willing to admit.The best moments were between Jeni and Oneal, the manic studio men. Richard Jeni had the right sarcastic edge and the best lines. Stallone, Goldberg and Chan were also amusing, but Eric Idle was a bit over the top. Some scenes were simply pointless, such as the cussing between Coolio and the black cop.There are some inaccuracies in the trivia, which claims this to be the last film to use Alan Smithee, but the IMDb lists at least a dozen other projects after 1997 with that name as well.Would have had a better impact, maybe even memorable like Spinal Tap if there was more work done, maybe some tighter editing or better writing to pick up the pace. Instead, it becomes forgettable.
