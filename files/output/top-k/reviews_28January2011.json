With Lone Star I bemoaned the lack of a visual imagination, but coming to a Sayles film for a narrative like I did with Matewan, I leave completely satisfied. The man excels in telling us stories with scope and values of importance.What a lovely world he creates here, among the derelict shacks and cabins of the Pennsylvania foothills of Matewan a moral struggle is fought, flawed characters with faces blackened by coaldust fumble with great ideals and big hopes for a better future, and the one thing that stands between them and justice is their own prejudice. I like how the film suggests that for the collective to be reformed the individual must be reformed first, that we need to look inwards first before we make a stand. The stand in the film is heroic but also desperate, a bit of a lawless old West on the way to emancipation. John Sayles is a leftist and this comes across loud and clear in Matewan, but unlike a Godard film like Week End, Sayles doesn't call for blood, he calls for social justice.The narrative here sprawls in and out of log cabins where sullen faces plot strikes and discuss ideals, in and out of makeshift tents and muddy town streets where coalminers live and die and sing, now a fiddle or harmonica is calling out from the dark the sad tune of a life of suffering, and the finale is sealed with a shootout filled with tragedy and hope. Sayles' camera doesn't intrude in any of this, rather it's invited in and hankers down out of way to quietly listen or conspire.Matewan makes a great doublebill with Martin Ritt's The Molly Maguires, another forlorn drama of the oppressed that speaks of moral devastation in the Pennsylvania coal fields, but more, it stands by itself as one of the great American narratives of the 80's.

Strictly speaking, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a prequel rather than a sequel, being set in 1935 whereas Raiders was set in 1936. Some, in fact, have claimed that this was the first film ever to be described as a prequel and have credited its producer George Lucas with inventing the term, but this is not correct. It would appear that the word was first used in the 1950s and was widely used in the seventies to describe films such as The Godfather Part II and Butch and Sundance The Early Days.Like the other episodes in the franchise there is an opening action scene which bears only a slight connection with the rest of the film. In this case the opening scene is set in Shanghai, where Indiana narrowly escapes from an evil gangster and flees on a plane. After surviving a plane crash in the Himalayas, he makes his way into India, then under British rule, together with his two companions, a nightclub singer named Willie Scott and a young Chinese boy called Short Round. Willie, it should be noted, is a woman. In the cast list she is officially listed as Wilhelmina, but the only explanation given in the film for her masculine praenomen is It's a stage name. (Apparently, the character was actually named after Steven Spielberg's dog).Temple of Doom is the only film in the original Indiana Jones trilogy in which the Nazis are not the villains. The main action mostly takes place in an underground temple controlled by the Thuggee religious cult, devotees of the goddess Kali, and tells how Indy thwarts the evil designs of the said cult, aided by a certain amount of help from Short Round, but none at all from Willie who spends most of the film screaming at the top of her voice.The film was highly controversial in India, the country in which most of the action is supposedly set, and the Indian government refused permission for it to be shot in their country. (The Indian scenes were actually filmed in Sri Lanka). Lawrence Kasdan, who had written the script for Raiders, refused the offer to do the same for Temple of Doom because he disliked the storyline, which he described as ugly and mean-spirited. Although I am not normally an advocate of political correctness, I have to admit that Kasdan and the Indian critics were right.Spielberg and Lucas have stated that the franchise was inspired by the film serials of the thirties and forties. Unfortunately, Temple of Doom also appears to have been inspired by some of the more reprehensible political and racial attitudes of that era. The Indian characters are all depicted either as evil or as weak and helpless, in need of protection from a gallant white hero. It is the sort of film about India that some B-movie producer might have churned out fifty years earlier, except that in 1934 the white hero would probably have been a dashing British officer rather than an American archaeologist. Racial stereotypes do not end with the Indians; the fiendish Chinese gangsters in the opening scene seem to be direct descendants of Boris Karloff's Fu Manchu.The film also gives a very misleading idea of Hinduism; any viewer not previously aware of the tenets of that religion would come to the conclusion that its practices include child slavery, black magic and human sacrifice. None of these, of course, form any part of Hinduism, and were not even practised by the Thugs. Indeed, many historians have disputed that Thuggee was a religious cult at all. Not all Thugs were worshippers of Kali; there were even some who were Muslims or Sikhs, not Hindus at all. Whatever their ostensible faith, the Thugs were motivated by greed rather than religious fanaticism, and they bore more resemblance to organised crime gangs than to a religious sect.Quite apart from its racist attitudes, there were other things I disliked about the film. It is notably darker than the other two episodes in the original trilogy, both in the literal sense- much of the action takes place in an underground cavern- and in the metaphorical, lacking their lightness of touch, sense of adventure and devil-may-care spirit. Kate Capshaw's Willie, always whining when she is not screaming, is one of the most annoying heroines in the history of the cinema, not a patch on Karen Allen's feisty Marion from Raiders or Alison Doody's seductively menacing Elsa from The Last Crusade. (Capshaw- obviously forgiven for her dreadful performance- later became the second Mrs Spielberg.).Steven Spielberg later admitted that he wasn't happy with Temple of Doom at all, and he certainly had good cause to be dissatisfied. He has sometimes been described as the man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget. This is perhaps unfair when one considers that he has made serious films as good as Schindler's List, but there is a measure of truth in it as far as his adventure blockbusters are concerned.

And in fact, that is the one real criticism I have about this film -- a lack of character continuity. For the most part, Susan Hayward's character's involvement is all at the same time frame -- while her husband (Gregory Peck) lies dying in Africa. Yet, in her scenes at the beginning of the film she is cold as ice, but just a couple of days later (albeit at the end of the film), she is dramatically different...brave, sympathetic, and in fact the heroine. Similarly, when the witch doctor visits the camp, first she hates him, then she is sympathetic to him, and then she screams at him and sends him away. Similarly, Gregory Pecks character is first totally unsympathetic, then fairly likable...even before his reevaluation of life. The African hunting scenes are stunning, especially for their time, and its too bad the film was made in 1952...a couple of years later it could have been wide-screen. But the color photography is impressive, and you'll be especially intrigued by the performance of the hyena near the end of the film. It is said that Hemingway was unhappy that in the film, Peck's character lives, while in the short story he dies. Well, Ernest, a film is a different vehicle than the written word, and thinking back to Ebeneezer Scrooge's question to the third spirit -- it can't be too late, otherwise why show me these things. Well, if Peck's character simply dies, what then was the sense of him finally understanding his own failings? Frankly, in my view, the film got it right. In addition to the Africa filming, other scenes in Europe are quite impressive, and I found the scenes in the Spanish civil war particularly effective. Supporting players include Leo G. Carroll (great, as usual) and Hildegard Neff (sorry, totally unlikable character...and a rather poor performance).

The film then focuses on exactly what the viewer considers to be mad.Nicholson and Saito, the commandant, are quickly involved in a face off. Saito wants all of the British to work on the bridge. Nicholson says the Geneva Convention states officers may not be forced to perform manual labour. He even produces a copy of the document, which Saito uses to whip him across the face, drawing blood. Nicholson is prepared to die rather than bend on principle, and eventually, in one of the film's best-known sequences, he's locked inside 'the Oven', a corrugated iron hut that stands in the sun.The story in the jungle moves ahead neatly, economically and powerfully. Holden is extremely good as the malingerer and unlikely hero &#x96; you see his character come full circle as the film ends. Note should be made of Hawkins brilliant, perhaps his finest role, as the focused British commando. With all Hawkins military characters you really have faith that he is who he plays. The long march where he refuses to be carried is a good example of the stiff upper lipism that he carries so well. He and Holden handle the British humour well with Hawkins providing lines such as 'Jolly good show' to which Holden replies 'yes jolly good show, jolly jolly good&#x85;good hunting' in perhaps the most humorous moment of the film. The film's central relationship is between Saito and Nicholson, a professional soldier approaching his 28th anniversary of army service 'I don't suppose I've been at home more than 10 months in all that time'.The Japanese colonel is not a professional soldier, but he is a rigidly dutiful officer. We see him weeping privately with humiliation because Nicholson is a stronger willed man &#x96; a great insult to a Japanese officer. Most war movies are either for or against their wars. This film is one of the few that focuses not on rights and wrongs but on the individuals.

There's a train journey as there are in many Hitchcock films, and of course, the icy, mysterious blonde, in this case the excellent Madeleine Carroll. The director cites this as one of his favourite films of all time &#x96; it contains all the requisite elements &#x96; pace, noir and at times black humour.The film is in essence a spy story, with man, Richard Hannay, accused of murder right from the outset. At one point of the movie he is handcuffed to a beautiful girl but this gives the film its extra sexual edge and also Hitchcock the territory to exploit desperate situations for humour. Note should be taken of the risqué 'stockings scene' if I can call it that. Carroll removes her stockings whilst she is still handcuffed to Donat in a bedroom &#x96; by today's standards I'm sure it's laughable but not in 1935.There are two criticisms commonly made of this film. The first is that there are logical imperfections in the story. This is true of almost all Hitchcock films (as well as those of most other directors). The second criticism is that this film, whilst based on John Buchan's novel of the same name, departs very considerably from the story in the book. Few films very closely follow the original book &#x96; simply because they are different mediums.The script fairly crackles and the pace is nearly relentless until the protagonists arrive at the inn for the night. It's jumping from trains, man hunts across the moors and enemy agents turning up everywhere. The dialogue is sexy by 1930's standards, reminiscent somehow of Bacall and Bogart in The Big Sleep - the electricity between Carroll and Donat is a joy to watch. It's all innuendo, of course, which is far steamier than being explicit about things - but I bet it initially troubled the censors all the same. The acting too is top-notch and some mention should be made of Dame Peggy Ashcroft (looking sexier than Carroll in my view) in an early role. Donat is superb as a kind of proto-type James Bond, all debonair and very, very English.The film may not have the budget or the scale of some of Hitchcock's later work but there's no doubting his way with a story. We have to remember than this movie was made 70 years ago and in context is full of violence sex and a roller coaster ride!

The acting too is top-notch and some mention should be made of Dame Peggy Ashcroft (looking sexier than Carroll in my view) in an early role. Donat is superb as a kind of proto-type James Bond, all debonair and very, very English.The film may not have the budget or the scale of some of Hitchcock's later work but there's no doubting his way with a story. We have to remember than this movie was made 70 years ago and in context is full of violence sex and a roller coaster ride! We are right into the thick of the story within about three minutes of the opening titles and it never lets up. ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"28 January 2011","score":"","review":" An absolute marvel which has been remade a couple of times &#x96; only really to show how good the original was. Alfred Hitchcock had received a contract to create spy thriller and this he did and then some&#x85; This film was the marker which established his reputation as the master of suspense, something which remained unchallenged throughout the remainder of his career.There are also several Hitchcock hallmarks that would recur in his later films - the innocent man being suddenly catapulted by accident into the sinister world of spies and secret agents is very much like his later 'North By Northwest'. There's a train journey as there are in many Hitchcock films, and of course, the icy, mysterious blonde, in this case the excellent Madeleine Carroll. The director cites this as one of his favourite films of all time &#x96; it contains all the requisite elements &#x96; pace, noir and at times black humour.The film is in essence a spy story, with man, Richard Hannay, accused of murder right from the outset. At one point of the movie he is handcuffed to a beautiful girl but this gives the film its extra sexual edge and also Hitchcock the territory to exploit desperate situations for humour. Note should be taken of the risqué 'stockings scene' if I can call it that. Carroll removes her stockings whilst she is still handcuffed to Donat in a bedroom &#x96; by today's standards I'm sure it's laughable but not in 1935.There are two criticisms commonly made of this film. The first is that there are logical imperfections in the story. This is true of almost all Hitchcock films (as well as those of most other directors). The second criticism is that this film, whilst based on John Buchan's novel of the same name, departs very considerably from the story in the book. Few films very closely follow the original book &#x96; simply because they are different mediums.The script fairly crackles and the pace is nearly relentless until the protagonists arrive at the inn for the night. It's jumping from trains, man hunts across the moors and enemy agents turning up everywhere. The dialogue is sexy by 1930's standards, reminiscent somehow of Bacall and Bogart in The Big Sleep - the electricity between Carroll and Donat is a joy to watch. It's all innuendo, of course, which is far steamier than being explicit about things - but I bet it initially troubled the censors all the same.

It sounded interesting enough and watched it and I am so glad I did!! For a very unknown film both Voight and Roberts get Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for their roles which are more than well deserved. They took what is probably a 7\/10 film into a full 9\/10 and blew it away. But more on them later. The film starts in a prison, you get a full scale nail biting prison escape into Alaskan tundra and onto a train which is suddenly on the verge of disaster which it is unmanned and flying towards destruction. The film has you on the edge of your seat for every minute as you see man vs man, man vs nature and man vs himself at every turn. The film doesn't stay within one setting but jumps through what most films strive to do in three different movies. Violent, gritty, disturbing, and absolutely brilliantly acted. If you want to see something that isn't a blockbuster but probably should have been and will completely entertain you from beginning to end and even if you aren't a fan of Voight or Roberts their performances are jaw dropping.Jon Voight is an acting legend and I've always felt I've never really seen where his legendary status comes from. I'm sure that this isn't what people have in mind but I am now convinced. His absolutely violent and brilliant portrayal of safe cracker and dangerous criminal Manny is mind blowing. Truly brilliant in every way. I might place Manny into a top ten list of the best cinematic characters in history for me. Eric Roberts I have always known as the B-Movie actor who has been around forever. I know now that I have seen him at his absolutely very best. His performance as Manny follower Buck is equally as stunning as Voight. Buck is dim witted, passionate and hyper and the connection he has with Voight's Manny is disturbing and twisted. The chemistry between them is just palpable. If you don't see this for any other reason see it for them! A very young Rebecca De Mornay plays Sara, the young train rider who ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time and becomes something of a romantic interest for Buck. De Mornay does a decent job but unfortunately her character is unnecessary and awkwardly tossed into the story. There is no reason for her to be there and I think they added her strictly to have a female presence. It does however give rise to Buck going against Manny. Supporting cast are all decent but don't particularly stand out especially against the leading cast.In reading about Runaway Train it seems as though it went through a lot of changes and attempted castings before finally getting off the ground. Jeff Bridges, Henry Fonda, Tom Berenger, Karen Allen and Peter Falk were all tied to the project. Russian director Andrey Konchalovskiy must be given props for his brilliant use of the cold tundra setting and the fast paced action and giving Voight and Roberts the room to really devour these characters. It isn't very often that in a action flick characters can really get depth like this. Konchalovskiy proved he has this talent again in the eighties classic Tango and Cash. The film has some really violent scenes and some truly great moments of action and intensity. The one fault to the film is the ending which leaves things a little unsatisfactory when they spend the entire film on such an incredible build up to have a rather lack luster ending.

I don't recall cheering in too many teenager movies for the protagonist to accomplish a certain goal, but I couldn't help myself. This is the kind of movie that is one I'll remember for years to come. It's nothing shy of it's expectations, and puts other movies of it's kind to shame. It's so polished and witty, I'm surprised John Hughes didn't have his name on this gem.I bring that up because it's a good point. John Hughes was always doing movies that revolved around the underdog or someone who was an unlikely hero. In Weird Science, the premise was centered around a couple of geeky kids, Career Opportunities is centered around a Target slacker, and Sixteen Candles was when the geeky kid gets the girl. So it looks like someone beat John Hughes to his own game making a film about the nerd and the dream girl. Still, no disrespect to the God of teen films.Lucas (Haim) is a nerdy fourteen year old who meets and quickly falls in love with a girl named Maggie (Green). Maggie is a new girl, and Lucas wants her all to himself. Who could blame him? Maggie is a gorgeous individual. Id want her all to myself as well. If I went to the high school Lucas was in, it'd be The Battle of the Nerds.Like many would guess, Lucas' nerdy ways and foul mouth get him into all kinds of trouble. The main bullies are ones on the football, but due to their high appeal of being men, Maggie is attracted to Cappie (Sheen). Cappie is a football player who sticks up for Lucas because he fears his mouth will get him hurt. Maggie and Cappie become close friends, which drives Lucas nuts. Lucas begins to become more and more distant from Maggie.The film captures what many teen movies ignore, or don't focus on too much; the first love. I'm going to kind of follow Roger Ebert and say your first love isn't because of beauty, it's because the other person is perfect in their own way. I remember my first love way back in first grade. I invited her over to my house countless times. During the second grade, she went to a Catholic school and I never saw her again.Thankfully, I found her on Facebook this past year. She lives out of state, and we talk every now and then. By now and then I mean once every six months. It hurts because I know we'll never be close like we used to. I was nuts about her, and talking to her not too long ago she said she even knew I was head over heals, but never told me. I was so shocked.I got over it like anyone would, but I think about her a lot from time to time. She was perfect, but chances are I'll never see her again. She was one who made me think about marriage at age six! Thats an accomplishment. Thats what makes her on my unforgettable people list.Going back to the film, I can say with a straight face I saw myself inside Lucas. The way he was picked on and mocked, to be loved and cherished at the end is how I see myself sometimes. I can be ridiculed at points in life, but I'm also loved by lots of people. I'm extremely grateful for that in every possible way.Lucas is one of the many teen movies that is worth watching, but only one of the handful that deserve the title of coming-of-age. Lucas himself shows you that it's okay to live life on the sidelines and to stand up for what you believe. He shows you it's okay to be different. And most importantly, he delivers one of the simplistic but satisfying lines in a film; Keep an open mind. You go, Lucas!

I think John Goodman was just PERFECT as Pacino's buddy detective, he adds a lot to this one, and their chemistry is amazing. When I think about it, if there is one Hollywood actor I'd love to have a drink it - well, it's got to be Goodman, he just seems like he's acting himself in most of the films he's in. The actress is just amazingly sexy, she projects so much sexuality, it can drive you crazy. Anyway, it's a good, maybe even very good thriller, very 80's like. I think that with a better script it could've been much better, but nevertheless, it features some very good acting, great dialogs, some hot scenes, and overall it's a light thriller, with some comedy, and even some drama sprinkled here and there.

It's hard for me to dislike anything that falls in these categories. I would not say that I did not enjoy this movie; Ciaran Hinds is wonderful, the Crofts are immensely lovable, I was amused by Sophie Thompson as the self-centered Mary Musgrove, I even liked to dislike Sir Elliott. But Amanda Root as Anne Elliott sometimes gets on my nerves, with her poor me expressions and her sad puppy eyes. It was too much; Jane Austen heroes - and heroines - are all about hiding true emotions in public in order to appear as composed as possible at any time. I had a really hard time to believe people would not have seen through Anne's displays of emotion. However, I must say that as I've watched the movie several times, I notice it less, and it doesn't get on my nerves as much anymore.

He is a great actor and enjoyed some of the films he was in, in fact he is one of my favorite actor. In fact the main reason why I decided to watch this movie is because of Edward Norton, and already knowing about the plot revolving around the rivalry between Ed and Robin Williams made me want to watch it even more. But for the most part was let down, it just went too much in the narrow and predictable direction. The start of the movie began pretty well though, but besides that I found the plot to be pretty dull. It wasn't even smart, clever or witty in anyway, although I wished it could have been, mostly it's a wasted potential of a movie. It did have a good message though and it did have it's moments although very few. Overall it really isn't a good black comedy and hardly has any funny parts in it. On a main positive note, the casting was brilliant but that is about it, there is little to no elements that grabs the attention.4.8\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"28 January 2011","score":"","review":" The idea of this movie is pretty creative, but besides that there really isn't anything positive about this movie besides Edward Norton being in it.

Cousins is one of those rare films that uses reality differently.Instead of beating us all with the heavy handed notion that anything real equates to reasons to slit our wrists, Cousins, seem to suggest that reality can be also magical. This in itself is a rare gesture of hopeful dreaming. An all too uncommon trait within the artist to make art that is life affirming in the light that being mortal is fraught with struggle and disappointment.Make no mistake, this film covers those aspects too. But offers us an alternative to jumping off a cliff.One line in the film sums up what the film is trying to say - You've only got one life to live. You can either make it chicken sh*t or chicken salad.As unpoetic as this philosophy sounds, the film itself unfolds poetically with almost ordinary people doing extraordinary things through the magical power of love. They don't even do it by offering flowers but by giving their time and opening up to each other with honesty and good humor.Love is not just about the big sweeping gestures but about the small things we do... and those gestures are captured here to great affection and effect. Politeness become fashionable again. Gentle unforced love becomes heroic once more.In a world where reality often means when you're down, you're out... this world captured by Cousins offers second chances. If you seek a means to see a universe where we can find happiness, true happiness after years of sadness or let downs... without too much sugar coating, or Hollywood sappy endings...
