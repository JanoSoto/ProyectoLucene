At one instance, it is a total guy flick with all the action and the blowing up and the grenades and so on.  On the other hand, Meg Ryan is in it so can anyone out there say chick flick?  Something for everyone you say?  Not unless that person has an excellent attention span and an eye for mercurious details.  I believe that you just cannot make a film that is at one moment bloody and at the next moment all romantically sweet and saccharine.

Obviously, there are people complaining about sentimentality, sickening pro-Americanism, etc. Well, for those people - I'm anything but a patriot, but I still loved this film - it is THE greatest war film ever, and the second best FILM ever.It's been said, but I will still say it if you don't like this, fine - just DON'T BASH IT FOR BEING PRO-AMERICAN WHEN IT IS AN AMERICAN FILM! Stereotypes?  Whatever - then there are plenty of '40s and '50s movies for you to make fun of, since they were so one-sided.  This is a film about soldiers, NOT a crappy all-star extravaganza with big names top-billed for maybe twenty minutes of screen time and slow battle scenes - Midway, Tora! Tora! Tora! (extremely overrated IMO), and The Battle of the Bulge - where half of the movie is the opposing generals planning the battle. Ah well.The plot is a bit hackneyed eight crack US soldiers are sent on a mission to rescue Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who has crashlanded behind enemy lines.  The reason?  Because all of his brothers have already been butchered, and the US Military (in the persona of Chief of Staff George C. Marshall Harve Presnell) decides for public relations reasons to save him. The soldiers, led by John Miller (Tom Hanks!), go through a war-scarred countryside, engaging in a skirmish or two along the way and seeing the ravages of war up close and personal.Sound corny?Well, it is but the EXECUTION is perfect.  Yes, the opening and closing scenes at the Normany Memorial could've been left out without making the film any worse - but they're a very small part of the experience.The battle scenes and the acting are great - even Vin Diesel, who after seeing the abomination that is XXX I now despise, is good (though he only has about fifteen minutes of screen time anyway).  The opening D-Day fighting features some of the most graphic violence ever put on film, with Dr. Strangelove-esque cinematography.  Let's just say, however, that after seeing We Were Soldiers, The Wild Bunch, The Patriot, etc. before this, I was not shocked by the violence at all.  Even the soldier who had his guts blown out did not disgust me - I thought it looked like foam spray. But it's still a graphic scene.One of the best scenes of the film is the attack on the radar station, for more than one reason.  Seven of the US troops (Diesel's character was killed by a German sniper in a French town a while back) attack a small German force.  The battle is not shown, really instead, we see a brief firefight with no gore at all through the view of the green interpreter Corporal Upham (the superb Jeffrey Davies).  Then one of the grunts, a Private Wade (Giovanni Rizzi), has been gut shot.  In a heart-rendering scene, his comrades gather around him and attempt to stop the bleeding before he dies. Then, the Americans come across a German soldier (Joerg Sadler), who is forced to dig a grave for Wade.  Upham pleads for the German's life, while Miller and his men want to execute him.  The German utters token English phrases (such as F*ck Hitler!) in an attempt to have himself spared. Miller, for whatever reason, decides to let him go.The best battle scene of all, however, is the final confrontation.  Having finally found Ryan and several men of his patrol, Miller and his men decide to join them in the defense of a crucial bridgehead against what would prove to be a last-stand.  This battle scene is graphic and moving - no realism is spared.  The ending was predictably cop-out, but given how it played out, I didn't much care.Ten stars is an award that I give very few films - but Spielberg - arguably the greatest filmmaker working today - deserves it with this.

Uponm arriving to America he meets loud mouthed James Carter (Chris Tucker, in a funny yet winning performance) and discovers he must team up with him on the investigation.This movie surprised me when I saw it for the first time. I didn't expect much from Tucker because I stereotyped him as an annoying loud mouth. But he was pretty funny in Rush Hour. Chan is good (like most of the times in his movies) with his ocasional laughs and fast action moves. If only Tucker acted out his character in the sequel like he did in this film, then this and Rush Hour 2 would be a pair of good movies. Don't get me wrong, they're both good but the first has a better effect than the second.WAR! WHUH!

The important stuff is the action and the film has just enough to carry it.  The opening snowbound stuff, the fight in a warehouse and the climax are all pretty good sequences and the rest is filler which is also OK.

When a film brings it all back to him he recounts the story of the time when a huge black prisoner called John Coffey was put into wing.  It is not too long before the peaceful, loving prisoner, found guilty of the rape and murder of two children, has mysterious gifts that transcend the decay of the lives around the prison.After Shawskank Redemption I was attracted to this as many of the makers were the same not to mention the author, the prison setting and the running time.  However that same running time and some negative reviews put me off and I didn't get round to seeing it till recently.  The film is very slow and this is occasionally to it's detriment but not too often.  It's main failing is that it's supernatural spin makes it difficult to get involved and lose yourself in completely.  `Redemption's ` strength was that it was a human story.  Green Mile tries to have the strength of human spirit at it's core but it doesn't quite come off.That's not to say that the story still isn't moving and involving because it is.  However it doesn't come as easily as it should and when the story slows a little bit it does feel slow.  It could easily have lost 30 minutes as at it's current  length it feels like a long movie which is a bad thing &#150; Two Towers is long but didn't FEEL long!  Also something I always find annoying is when a score really works the emotion where the actual film can't manage it by itself &#150; here the score is working overtime to wring every drop of emotion from the scenes.The film is very well directed and there are powerful moments of cruelty.  When the chair is used I couldn't help but feel that it was real.  However the main attraction (other than the mouse!) is a wonderful performance by Duncan.  True there is an element of slave cliché about it but he rises above that a gives a performance of such emotion and such gentleness that came as a surprise from someone of his build.  Hanks is also good and wisely plays it quite low-key and the support cast is solid, comprised of many many well known faces including Morse and Cromwell.Overall this is good but overlong.  It is a very different film from Shawshank and many will compare it to that much better film.  However the film is worth the work despite some simplistic errors and flaws.

Ryan Phillipe is no John Malkovich and I think he knew that, but sometimes I think he was trying to be as cold and calculating as he was and wasn't doing a good job at it. Gellar shone as the bad girl that you had no problem hating. Reese was ok, but a bit hard to swallow when she became angry. It seems like she can't. Selma Blair is silly and fun to watch as the chick who grew up under a rock on 5th Ave. Jackson was good too and was a fun character. Not too bad.

I'd certainly put it on a par with 12 Monkeys and The Sixth Sense in terms of a film made to invoke audience intelligence.Actually my wife and I watched it flabberghasted at the detail and puzzle of each moment as it unfolded. Each trying to answer the final answer as the film ran it's course.Since watching it, I availed myself of the many sites dedicated to unfolding the mysteries within the movie. At first I was unclear to the conjecture and *myths within the confounds of a basically simple film.  Then as I was drawn into the numerous (and often) quirky and deep reverential references made (or supposed) and found myself drawn into the ideas based on much effort and imagination based on investigation unequalled for a movie as this.In fact I read so much as to the unanswered (and guessed at) in this movie that it spoilt my initial enjoyment - and came to this simple conclusion Leonard cannot cope with life without the impetus to find his wife's killer at all costs. It is this simple emotion that drives him and keeps him alive. Without it he has no reason to live.  The STM leads only to the next time he has to chase his next victim. Without this reason to find his wife's killer he may well as be dead.  That's why when he gives himself information about Teddy at the start of the film, with the numberplate, he leaves himself another time-period to find his wife's killer again. How many times this has happened? But does it matter, because this film is a snapshot of a few days of Leonards life - what happened before who knows (apart from being coerced by a bent cop) and after - whatever?This mans whole life is driven by love.  A love for a dead wife, who's rapist and murderer he must seek to destroy to keep his own life.NO he is not Sammmy. STM is very rare to this extent and I feel this focus is to reinforce Leonard's own mental state.I liked this film a lot.  So much so I've given a few lines on this website - something I've never felt driven to before.  But I implore anyone who watches this.  Just watch and enjoy, don't try to look too deeply.Kj ","genre":null},{"date":"8 March 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I've just watched Memento and was amazed that such superb films can still be made these days in comparison to the mass-media crap that has been the norm for way too many years now.

Donnie Darko would be one of Harlan Ellison's favorite pet-projects for his Glass Teat column in the last year of the sixties.  To use his words, this movie is soul-robbing and dehumanizing. It requires that the viewer stop thinking, completely.  I have never seen a movie more worthless than this.  Drew Barrymore's performance is appalling. Patrick Swayze's character and performance are mind-numbing.  Jake Gwyl-whatever's performance ranks up there with the dumb-a** guys in Dumb and Dumber, American Pie, and Dude, Where's My Car?Something immediately comes to mind when reading reviews for this sad excuse for a film.   Those who like the film always seem to attack the intelligence of those who don't.  Comments about not getting it abound. This is sad.  Just because someone posts an unfavorable review of a movie you like doesn't necessarily mean they are less intelligent than you.  In fact, the opposite case may be true...So to state it plainly, the acting in this film is deplorable.  the story starts off interesting, but deteriorates into drivel.  No one can really care about Donnie or his family...  they are boring.  The idea of putting an overweight Asian girl as a pathetic love-interest in Donnie is the saddest attempt by a filmamker to be politically correct (let's make sure we cover ALL the bases-- what hasn't been tried before; but we can always fall back on fairness if we get slagged for it).Comparisons to Memento, David Lynch, Jacob's Ladder, etc are unwarranted.  This movie cannot ever aspire to the heady, thought-inspiring genius that these other achieve. Those who attack others' ability to get it, need to ask themselves what is there to get?  The answer is, nothing.Rating  negative one, out of ten.
