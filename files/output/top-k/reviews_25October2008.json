I hadn't seen it in years, and stumbled across it one afternoon.I was stunned as I was completely drawn into the world of Detective Harry Angel, and sat mesmerized for the next two hours, until the film's stunning conclusion left me breathless, even though I knew what was coming.This is not a simple movie, but the simple plot line is that a hard nosed private eye gets in too deep when hired by a mysterious client to find a missing person. What follows is a complex, twisted tale of morality, secrets, and the fact that you can never outrun your past, no matter how hard you try. For those of you who only know Mickey Rourke as the hulking ruin you saw in Sin City, you really need to see this film. Rourke was at his prime here, and gives a performance that is both believable and shattering. It is a portrait of a man who knows he is losing his hold on everything that he knows to be true, but is unable to stop going down the road that he senses will lead him to oblivion.The first time I saw this movie, I was a teenager, and thought the movie was too slowly paced. Now, with a more mature set of eyes, I think the pacing is perfect. Languidly allowing the viewer to be steeped in the humid, foreign atmosphere of a sultry Louisiana.The cinematography is fantastic, with every detail authentic, down to the fact that people didn't wear antiperspirant back then -)I absolutely believed in the world that Harry found himself being trapped by, and the horror kept growing as every new detail was slowly brought to light.This is a film that demands to be seen at least twice. I have watched it twice more since that afternoon, and I am still finding new details that I had not noticed before. Be warned, it is intense, but it is an unforgettable classic film.

Here is a tale of the undead that is still copied and paid respect to today, some forty years later. Even writer\/director George Romero continues to add installments to the saga with his most recent entries gracing theatres in the past few years. It is interesting to note that this film, the most notorious zombie flick, never uses the Z word. This might be because the word just wasn't part of our lexicon. Instead we are treated with the slow moving ghouls leaving partially devoured victims in their wake. It really is just low-budget terror entertainment more than anything else. I had always heard about its great social commentary, and I guess you can make parallels to the red scare and communism, but in the end it's all really just a film to instill fear in the young and laughs for the unaffected.I jest a little about the laughs as this is not as poorly acted as one might think. Sure there are moments of cringe-worthy deliveries and over-acted moments, but for the most part everyone is restrained enough to allow the themes of survival, heroism, and humanity's penchant for destruction to resonate. From the get-go I will admit to being worried, especially with Judith O'Dea's shrill screams for her brother to stop scaring her&#151;Johnny!! I think the amateurish acting helps lend some character to the film, though, being such a cheaply made one, (I mean that cost-wise not production-wise as the film is very well made), especially since Romero shoots most of it in close-up. It's as though he wants us to see firsthand and up close the mostly unsuccessful attempts at naturalism.The sheer simplicity of it all is what really stands tall when the credits finally role. At the center of the tale is this inexplicable outbreak of the recently dead being brought back to life with a hunger for human flesh, thus turning their victims into ghouls too. Scientists believe the destruction is a direct result from a satellite beacon returning from Venus that was shot down as it entered our atmosphere with extremely high levels of radiation &#133; possibly the most obvious comment on the Cold War. Horrors have always been the strongest comment on politics and societal distress because of the inherent fear they bring. Films give us an embodiment of the evils and monsters out there waiting for an opportunity to strike. With Night of the Living Dead, we are being overtaken by radioactively triggered automatons, stumbling into our homes looking for blood. Could this be the mechanical and emotionless face of Communism seamlessly integrating their way into our world? A wave of fear that people who look just like us could in fact be the enemy? Maybe. The ghouls consist of our brothers and sisters and friends, and once they have been turned, they show no remorse or kinship, only a lust to turn you too. Huh, maybe I've changed my mind during the course of writing this review; I guess there is more social commentary than I initially thought.To get back to the surface, though, the story of these three small groups, trying to survive against the onslaught, I enjoyed what Romero did. He gives us the semi-locals&#151;Tom and Judy&#151;both young and unsure of their place, doing what they can to help, but letting emotions get in the way; the older stubborn Harry Cooper, entrenched in his views that his need for self-worth shields him from the right and smart moves; his wife and ill daughter caught in the middle as they must stick with Cooper no matter if he is wrong; and our outsiders, Barbra and Ben, caught up in the mix and truly the wild cards. Barbra is catatonic for most of the film, but her eccentricities cause immense unease and some of the best tension offered. As for Ben, Duane Jones is the epitome of the manly man hero. His take charge attitude is perfect as he will never back down to Karl Hardman's overly brash Cooper, nor allow the wild Barbra get to him, willing to smack her if needed. Ben is the one with a head on his shoulders, looking for survival no matter the cost, trying to help as many as he can, but unafraid to leave them behind if they don't want to jump onboard.So, when all is said and done, Romero has crafted something here that I'm sure was odd and unique back in 1968. This is the backbone to every zombie story you can think of, it started a trend that doesn't seem to have an end in sight. Utilizing the media as a main character even in his first film, the newscaster becomes a voice of reason. Our implicit trust in the man on TV\/radio, the person accessible to everyone and therefore must be the authority on the subject is the real scary aspect of the story. Our heroes do what they are told, not because it's the right thing, but because it is the popular choice. I will say that the ending is superb and in tone with what had been going on. America as a land of cowboys, shoot first and ask questions later &#133; ah, McCarthyism at its finest.

This in general wasn't fun, or funny, in my opinion. It is absolutely tasteless at one point. It gets too far out, slapstick and cartoonish. It boils down to that this seems like a largely aimless, if finely edited and shot, long music video. So, did they mainly want to put something that could be described as that up on the silver screen? If so, hey, good for them, they succeeded. This also stooped to the level of gratuitous sexuality, if no nudity, in more than one sequence. It contains some language, fairly harsh. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer, production photos and notes, posters and a making of. I recommend this to... fans of the tunes, I suppose. I'll admit that this isn't the worst flick out there, but as a sequel, it's quite underwhelming. 5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"25 October 2008","score":"","review":" While some viewers may disagree, the one sure element of Ed Wood's legacy is this film, his 'love song' to the legend of Bela Lugosi.

But enough about my rating issue.I was not expecting the scariest film ever when I sat down to watch The Exorcist, tonight. I feel this is important, as too often I have seen others build up a film to God-like proportions, that they go into it with the PROMISE that they will be frightened, shocked, disturbed, whatever. When the film doesn't meet their expectations, they feel that it is the filmmakers fault. Not their preconceived ideas of what the film was SUPPOSED to deliver, in their mind, at least.Of course, it's not entirely their fault. The Exorcist is undoubtedly the most well-known, praised and notorious horror film ever. It is difficult to completely ignore the years of hype, and the ever-so widely tossed around scariest movie ever title. But, I did the best I could.The Exorcist is a decently made film. I didn't have any problems with the pacing, I think it's well shot, I think all the actors fit their roles very well. I was not bored during the running time, things just weren't clicking with me.Where The Exorcist falls down is the dialogue, and I'm not referring to Regan's possessed foul-mouthed rants. I thought the script was pathetically weak. Every line is just so clichéd, and uninformative. The cast work adequately with what they've got, but the dialogue is so empty. Characters don't really communicate with one another, they merely accept things and get on with it. This may work for some people, but I just find it weird, and it succeeded greatly in distancing myself from the characters and the events at hand.And that there is my biggest problem with The Exorcist. I didn't feel involved in the plight of this girl. I didn't feel for the characters, I wasn't concerned about their well being or their fate. The best kind of film makes you feel like you are right there watching. Or better yet, experiencing it exactly with the main character(s). Inside (2007) is a good example. Watching The Exorcist, I felt like a mere bystander.I also find the story pretty weak, and not very tightly constricted. The bulk of the film basically rests on and revolves around the possession of Reagan. So we get various visits to her room by different people. We witness her apparent worsening state as time goes on. I'm sure this was terrifying back when it was first released, but for me there is Nada scary in watching a 12 year old girl scream profanities. Most of which could easily come from a demon-free 12 year old boy with an attitude. Although, kudos on the, fine day for an exorcism line. That was a witty one. The rest, not so much. Shove it up your ass, faggot! gave me a smile, though.As for the masturbating scene, to me it looked more like self-harm. I see nothing masturbatory about it, aside from the demon yelling LET Jesus F!CK YOU! Regan was bleeding, so clearly the demon wasn't forcing her to do it for the purpose of pleasure, it was to harm and shock. Which is pretty much all The Exorcist does. There is no great focus on good vs evil, which I would have liked. Instead, Friedkin just throws this possession in our face, then delivers a bunch of gross out and shock tactics, while he expects the swearing, demon-infested, stronger than Hulk monstrosity upstairs to carry the film.Oh, and one thing that's been really bugging me.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"25 October 2008","score":"","review":" Up until 1998 comic book movies were a joke. Sometimes they had some campy charm and were marginal successes but aside from the Michael Keaton Batman film in 1989 none of them had been all of that good and even its sequels were very poor. Marvel had a particularly hard time releasing its products to film and its two successes up to 1998, The Punisher and Captain America, were so bad that even fans of the characters felt the need to apologize for them.Into this mix came Blade, a much lesser known character than previous Marvel and DC attempts to make movies about their characters but in a way that helped. Writer David Goyer and Director Stephen Norrington were able to tell the story that they wanted to tell without having to pay homage to 25 years of comic book history. In fact the movie deviates greatly from the Marvel version of Blade's origin and his powers.This movie was a success for several reasons. First, it took the story seriously. Blade wasn't a campy super-hero who had hilarious misadventures. The movie is serious from the opening moments when a man who thought that he was being picked up by a hot woman and taken to a party finds out that he's really the appetizer at a vampire rave. While certain elements like the character of Quinn lighten specific moments the characters always act as if the danger and the situations are real.Second, the movie is an action movie rather than a horror movie. Vampires have almost always been placed in the horror mold. The genius of Blade is to depict vampires more as members of a kind of mafia rather than as the creatures that live in solitary mansions and prey on hapless virgins. The horror and fear are there. Norrington does a tremendous job in presenting a world to us in which creatures skulk around in the dark and the script describes a world that most of us are unaware of but influences our lives on a daily basis. However, even with these elements we are in full action mode as Blade takes on this mafia with all of the weapons at his disposal and his knowledge of martial arts. The fighting is done so well that you even let our cheers as Blade dispatches his foes in spectacular style. Many of the things that the Matrix would take credit for, such as bullet time and the idea that the world that we live in is an illusion (although this is a little more literal in Matrix), were developed in Blade first and usually with far more skill and style.Third, there is an emphasis on character here that shouldn't be taken for granted. Most superhero movies are obsessed with action to the point that characters simply don't have time to grow. That isn't so here. The tragedy of Blade's life is presented to us and then further developed as we see how Blade being a man that fits into neither world can't live with vampires and that the relationships that he establishes with humans can never last. Deacon Frost is also developed well as his relationships with Quinn, Karen, and Dragonetti develop him to show that he is the complete antithesis of Blade A hedonist that cares only about fomenting chaos and gratifying his own desires.Finally, there's a wonderful synergy from all involved. The actors give great performances. Wesley Snipes is the gruff hero with just enough sass to deliver some witty lines to break the tension in some dramatic scenes. Kris Kristofferson plays the father figure and elder hero who has to die to give way to the younger generation. His obvious love for Blade comes through the subtleties of the performance rather than any overt dialog. Stephen Dorff is fantastic as Deacon Frost who wants nothing more than to gratify his own desires and to be restrained by no one. His casual disdain of everyone around him except when he wants something shows the kind of character that he is. Then we have some great direction from Norrington who has the world move around us with time lapse photography when we aren't looking and gives the impression of things hidden all around. Turning up the brightness during the daylight helps to showcase how foreign that world is once you've been steeped in Blade's nighttime world. The script is a top-notch Goyer contribution. As usual with Goyer everything that is introduced has a purpose and all of the elements join together by the end of the movie so that everything from Blade's mom to comments about whether or not Karen will turn, to the biting of Dr Webb all come back when they will have maximum story impact.If the story has any flaws it is that Deacon's idea to turn everyone into vampires makes no sense unless you assume that he is so interested in fomenting chaos that he would like to see a world full of vampires who feed on each other but this is never stated on screen and it would have been nice if there was some dialog for it. The other problem is that La Magra is a bit of a disappointment once it appears. After building up to this since the midway point of the movie you expect something more than what you see but this is one of those things that you don't really think about until after your first viewing when you're thinking back on the movie.Many movies like the Matrix, Daredevil, and the X-Men trilogy probably would have never been made or would have been radically different if it wasn't for the cult success of Blade and the techniques that it pioneered.

In that one the former was a police officer who is trying to protect the Pope on a visit to San Francisco, and the latter is an innocent by-stander who stumbles into the details of an assassination plot. The story worked with the assistance of Dudley Moore as a befuddled not-so-innocent third party who gets dragged into the proceedings by Hawn, Eugene Roche as a conspirator, Billy Barty as an accidental victim of Hawn's fears and hysteria, and Burgess Meredith and Rachel Roberts having an unexpected classic judo face off. Oh, all to the concluding music from Act I of Gilbert and Sullivan's THE MIKADO.SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES is a remake of sorts of the 1942 film THE TALK OF THE TOWN. That film dealt with Cary Grant as a fugitive being hidden in a house by Jean Arthur, while jurist Ronald Colman (just nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court) is renting the same house from Arthur. Here Chase is the fugitive, hiding in the garage of his first wife Hawn, unbeknown-st to her second husband Charles Grodin (who is being considered for the post of Attorney General of California. The screenplay is by Neil Simon this time, and there is good supporting roles by Robert Guillaume, George Grizzard, and Harold Gould (as an increasingly annoyed local judge). However, TALK OF THE TOWN was dealing with a man accused of an arson murder due to his labor union activities. Grant was an activist in that film. Chase comes across as something of a schmuck here - he is forced at gunpoint to assist two men in a bank robbery, is set up to deliver the note to the teller, gets his face photographed too well by the bank's camera, and is then tossed out of the speeding car on a hillside by the two felons. The audience knows Chase is innocent, and gradually Hawn and Grondin and Guillaume realize it too. But it seems that Chase had a similar bad experience in Mexico regarding being framed for a drug deal - and had spent some time in prison as a result there. He seems to be an unlucky sort.The weaknesses of Chase's character aside, SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES is funny, and understandably so - it has a Neil Simon script. In fact, aside from the one-liners that pepper it, there are moments in it that reminded me of other films and plays Simon has written. In some late moments of intimacy between Hawn and Chase I felt that some of Chase's descriptions of Hawn's little idiosyncrasies actually could have been dialog left over from BAREFOOT IN THE PARK, from scenes between Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. And the unwelcome intrusion of Chase into an organized household resembles the situations in THE ODD COUPLE and THE SUNSHINE BOY, where Oscar has to make room for Felix, and Willie Clark has to reunite with Al Lewis.There are plenty of amusing sections Chase fighting back fear and hysteria when he is with the kidnapping bank robbers (when he compliments the wording of the bank robbing note, the robber who wrote it thanks him); Hawn's fighting for the underdog legal practice, which results in her having a growing number of clients she is helping to get honest employment for - even in her own household; Gould's judge trying to get to the point of the ridiculous arguments and fact patterns that first Hawn and later Grodin put into his court; Grizzard's governor looking forward to dinner with his future attorney general, and his favorite dish, only to find the state's number one criminal is serving it to him. All in all it is an entertaining film. But it is not as concentrated and unified a script as FOUL PLAY was. You will enjoy the film, but FOUL PLAY is somewhat more memorable.

This film controls the comedy of Abbott and Costello in the framework of a horror film and mixes them both well.Lou Costello's persona of a child like bumbler is well contained here, and perfectly contrasts with the dark and shadowy presence of Count Dracula and The Wolfman. We are blessed to have them played by Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney respectively, as well they should be, in this, the last Universal monster fest. Frankenstein's monster, the creature of pained self-awareness as conceived by Mary and Percy Shelley and portrayed by Boris Karloff in 'Frankenstein' (1931) and 'The Bride of Frankenstein' (1935) by this time has been turned into a lumbering walking statue and is the least interesting of the three 'monsters' present here. The title of the film is misleading, since it really is 'Abbott and Costello Meet Dracula.' Fortunately for us, the Frankenstein monster is not the main attraction, but rather it's Bela Lugosi instead who is given a major role as he seeks to revive it by transplanting Lou's brain into the monster's body. We get a great scene where Bela reprises his hypnotic hand gestures and eyes as he seduces his lab assistant, Dr. Morney (Lenore Ubert). Near the end he utilizes his great hand gestures again to pull Lou up to his laboratory. Oh what we missed by his not being in other major productions during the forties!The well edited film tightly mixes Abbott and Costello's verbal and slapstick comedy with the dark spookiness of their horrific environment and encounters. Both Bud and Lou are totally believable throughout, even in their reactions to the (now to us) preposterous costumed 'monsters.' It's all played straight. This is not just their radio or stage show schtick.The only weaknesses are that the interactions between the three monsters and our heroes are not more prominent in the film (occuring just at the end) and do not go on long enough. The first twenty five minutes basically focus on Costello and his reaction comedy. It's as if the monsters are shortchanged to a just rapid chase sequence at the end of the film. When I first re-watched the film a few years ago, I was shocked by how much the actions of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster made it seem like I was watching Grandpa and Herman in 'The Munsters' (1964) -- nothing scary here. Now I've found out that Charles Barton, the director, was not only Abbott and Costello's best director, but was also the director of 'The Munsters', where he clearly appropriated what he did in this film.Of course, all of this doesn't matter.

So, in essence, if you watch Jason X expecting to be scared or expecting a riveting plot line , you are watching the wrong movie. Go watch Halloween or the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. On the other hand, if you want to laugh and still get to see gratuitous violence, then by all means, watch Jason X. It has all of the staples of the series and some fairly creative kills along with parts that are so ridiculous you can't help but laugh, such as the hologram sequences and uber-Jason.

I didn't know much about it, all i knew was that Leonardo Dicaprio was in it. and that he played a Mentally Challenged boy. I begin to watch it. Even the starting is amazing. It just shows the Grape family living there day. Gilbert is the Leader of the family. his father built the house but ever since his father had died. He was in charge of the repairs. He had an overweight mom, an annoying sister and another sister who was like the mom of the family.Throughout the WHOLE movie. I couldn't believe Leonardo Dicaprios performance! It was perfection! Sometimes he made you laugh, sometimes he made you cry. And even sometimes i actually thought he was mentally challenged. Ya, the other performances we're o.k. Like John. C. Reilly's and Julitte Lewis's but Leo's performance was AMAZING! In my opinion it is one of my favorite performances and one of the best performances in decades! This is Leonardo Dicaprio at his best! This Movie had a great story line. Great adaption from the book. It is a classic and it is one of my favorites! If you want to see Leo's bets performance when he was just starting out you have to see this movie NO DOUBT. Leo deserved that Oscar Nomination 100%. I even think he should have won! In Conclusion. The Movie was great! The cast was great. But Leo was even greater. Go see this movie. Go rent it. go. NOW.As Arnie Would say. Match in the Gas Tank. BOOM BOOM ","genre":null},{"date":"25 October 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I turn on my t.v and decide that i am going to watch What's Eating Gilbert Grape.

After watching it all i can see is WOW. His performance is truly captivating and is one that really tightens the chest threatening to bring on the tears. Derek Vinyard is man influenced by those around him being raised to descriminate. When he is sent to prison for the murder of three African American's he encounters friendship, betrayal, as well as an understanding of how life isn't about hate. His journey through prison as well as a shocking conclusion adds to the brilliance of this emotional film. along with Ed Nortan's flawless performance, Edward Furlong provides one of his greatest as Derek's brother and soon to be heir to his racial throne. Recommended to anyone with a love for the drama genre. TO THUMBS WAY UP!
