Logistically, this was a mess. There was a writer's strike in the middle of production, meaning the script couldn't be tweaked. They wanted to get Sean Connery to play Sybok (Spock's half brother who rejects Vulcan logic and wants to find God), but they were forced to settle for Laurence Luckenbill. (Laurence Luckenbill. Who the heck is Laurence Luckenbill? Oh, yeah, he was Lucy and Desi's son in law!) There was a whole sequence with Rock Monsters that had to be dropped because 1989 vintage FX couldn't render them effectively. (A couple years later you had the first CGI that would have done fine.) Another problem was that the movie didn't know if it wanted to be a serious drama like Star Trek II and III, or a lighter comedic film like Star Trek IV. So it tried to do both and did neither well. The drama of possible war with the Klingons, Spock confronting his past and finding GOD, for crying out loud, was offset by cheap slapstick like Scotty bumping his head on an I-beam and Uhura doing a fan dance. (Ahhhh---it burns, it burns.) The next problem was Shatner himself. Let's be honest, Shatner has had a strained relationship with his alter-Ego. In fifty years, he's not going to be remembered as T.J. Hooker or Denny Crane, he's going to be remembered as James T. Kirk. This movie gave him unprecedented control over the character's portrayal, and he misused it.

Several years after embodying the Western anti-hero, the 'Man With No Name' in Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollar-trilogy, which culminated in the matchless masterpiece The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of 1966 (the all-time greatest Western, and, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made), Eastwood reprises the role of the nameless stranger - and creates an antihero incomparably more ruthless than the role he owes his fame to. High Plains Drifter was Eastwood's second feature-length film as a director. I am not the biggest fan of his debut, the 1971 thriller Play Misty For Me (which is doubtlessly more than decent, though), and would personally regard High Plains Drifter as Eastwood's first directorial masterwork. The film is an incredibly dark, gritty and sometimes obscure Western with many elements of a supernatural Thriller. It's protagonist is an antihero with a stress on the 'anti' - ruthless, violent and cold-blooded. It is not surprising that the first Western directed by the most famous star of the Spaghetti Western is also arguably THE American Western which could most easily be mistaken for an Italian one. It were the Italian Westerns which made the Genre gritty and turned its heroes into antiheroes, and High Plains Drifter epitomizes these aspects.A nameless stranger (Eastwood) comes to a small lakeside town in the West called Lago. By proving his talent as a gunman, he quickly establishes his superiority over the, initially hostile, townspeople, who subsequently ask for his protection against a bunch of outlaws. The stranger is not the kind of person to give away his help out of good will, however...From the first sequence, High Plains Drifter is incredibly atmospheric. The music, the photography, the setting - it all goes perfectly in hand. The film brilliantly brings up the feeling of a supernatural Thriller with a highly uncanny undertone. Eastwood is brilliant in his role of the nameless stranger, a man more ruthless than the 'Man With No Name' in Leone's films. Then again, he is only ruthless towards the self-satisfied, hypocritical townspeople, who are more or less scumbags themselves - only weaker scumbags, that is. 'The Man With No Name' is arguably the all-time epitome of cinematic coolness. So is this 'Stranger' here, only that he is more aggressive, cynical and violent than Eastwood's earlier role. The rest of the cast is also good, especially worth mentioning are the two female cast members (The Stranger treats the two female characters vastly differently) Verena Bloom and especially Marianna Hill, whose character Callie is 'tought some manners' early in the film. High Plains Drifter may well be called Eastwood's first masterpiece as a director, and if I don't give it the full rating, it is just due to the superiority of Leone's films (especially The Good, The Bad And The Ugly) to which it cannot quite compare - but that, no other film can. Overall, High Plains Drifter is a sublime first Western directed by Clint Eastwood, and along with films like The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven it stands among his greatest directorial works. Not to be missed!

While this movie didn't contain much gore, it had some unforgettable moments of suspense and it was obviously a F13th rip-off but a pretty decent one at that and characters. Even though they're all stereotypical, I think that they were surprisingly sympathetic and it really did feel as if they were all friends which is an unusual thing to find in slasher flicks. It was a theatrical movie it had good production values as well. My fave character has to be, well I can't remember her name in this movie but Amy Steel a brilliant addition to the cast, a great heroine I loved her in Friday The 13th part 2 and I also love her in this, it's such a shame that she never became a big star, but she will always be remembered as a terrific actress in my heart, she was always my fave lead heroine of all of the Jason movies, and yet again she plays the female lead in this which I was very happy with and again she was great.And finally the big reveal the ending which I thought was a major letdown, but at least they did something fun with it that no one expected.All in all April Fool's Day is a mediocre but entertaining slasher flick, starring the ever likable and wonderful Amy Steel.

Basically Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) are two homosexual (I never would have guessed) who share a New York apartment, and using a rope, they have committed the perfect murder, killing David Kentley (Dick Hogan). Brandon sees it as an experiment or challenge, while Phillip is panicking about being caught, and with the body disposed of in a chest, covered with a cloth for food and drinks, he is bound to crack eventually. Guests they have invited for a small party are relatives and friends of David, including father Mr. Kentley (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), fiancée Janet Walker (Joan Chandler), aunt Mrs. Atwater (Constance Collier), David's rival for Janet's affections - Kenneth Lawrence (Douglas Dick), and of course, Brandon and Phillip's old teacher, Rupert Cadell (Stewart). As the evening goes on, Brandon uses his sense of intellectual superiority to drop tiny hints about the nasty goings on, while Phillip is trying to hold his nerve, but this is becoming increasingly difficult when Rupert is being very snoopy. It is when everyone else has eventually left that Rupert comes back to return an item they might want back, the rope they used to murder! Of course, Rupert realises they committed the murder experiment because of ideas he put in their heads about human life expenditure (or something like that), so when a gun gets involved, the film ends with Rupert getting people to hear gun shots, and the police arriving. Also starring Edith Evanson as Mrs. Wilson, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man walking down the street during the opening credits. What makes this film unique is the continuous long takes, the film is made up of ten long takes, ranging from four and even ten minutes long, and the only time you can tell there is a cutaway is the camera zooming into a dark object, or just a simple straight cut. This thriller may not be one of the most exciting films in Hitch's career, being very chatty, and Stewart may not have the biggest part of the film compared to Dall and Granger, but it still a very watchable film. James Stewart was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.

Now, yes, Jeff Daniels is great as always, quiet and true. Martin Sheen's Lee is majestic, visionary, awesome in the original sense. And Tom Berenger is at his most restrained and earnest.But for every solid, believable performance, there are two or three outrageous characterizations so large they seem not designed to fit the biggest of big screens. Rather, in the inverse ratio of acting size, a performance as large as Sam Elliott's Buford could only seem appropriate if watched on a cell phone. Stephen Lang's Pickett is so big he threatens to explode my television. And the late Richard Jordan's Armistead, while obviously heartfelt and impressively teary, very nearly blew the windows out of my house. Here's the thing these are good actors. Sam Elliott's never this bad. C. Thomas Howell and Kevin Conway are never exactly naturalistic, not to say credible, but Richard Jordan's never been so damn unrestrained.So we must point the finger at this film's writer and director Ronald Maxwell, a finger aimed in persecution of his terrible mishandling not only of some fine performers, but of nearly every element of this godawful production. This pompous dolt has made an embarrassing habit of attacking the work of better men. His idiotic snipings at Luc Besson's Joan of Arc picture - not that I'm defending it - are among the least accurate and most self-serving in the history of sour-grapes hack hyperbole. With GETTYSBURG he leaves himself wide open to broadsides of the same sort of derision, only this time the criticism has some basis in reality.Maxwell takes Michael Shaara's classic novel and keeps all its philosophizing - the stuff a novel can get away with because of the depth of investigation of which only a novel is capable - while abandoning most of the simple human action that makes the book readable. What remains is three hours of hopes-and-dreams speechmaking, followed by 90 minutes of bad second-unit photography men running uncertainly up toward the enemy, then performing pantomime stage combat exercises. The battle's most tragic and hideous example of the horrors of war (about which this movie mouths many words), Pickett's Charge, doesn't seem to be in the movie. At least, it is indistinguishable from the other bland scenes of men trotting with muskets that serve only as background to Randy Edelman's obsession with his string section.Another bizarre mistake, just absolutely unaccountable in a movie this god damn long, is the abandonment of the central character IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE. Maxwell follows Daniels' Chamberlain from forced march to bayonet charge, and this is in fact the most compelling portion of the picture, featuring the only characters created not just by actors but in the script as well. So when the 20th Maine is moved to the center, where Lee has just announced he will concentrate his attack, the audience is led to believe that they will get to experience the further tribulations of the single unit with whom they have been allowed any intimacy.Nah. We pick up with Daniels and his brother after the battle, just long enough to see them fade to black.True, the earlier defense of Little Round Top has moments of tension and suspense. Good work, Ron. So, that's about ten minutes out of, what, two hundred and fifty? Nice. I think Luc Besson, pretentious Frenchman that he is, was quite cowed when he heard that the director of PARENT TRAP 2 had criticized his work. Sorry? You say your prequel, GODS AND GENERALS, was the biggest selling DVD the week it came out? Good, good. Did it make back any of the $50 million it lost on theatrical rentals?No, I don't think the quality of a movie is measured in receipts.

Ron Maxwell doesn't seem to know anything about movies. Given his inefficiencies in this regard, I kinda doubt he's much of a stage hand either. But I bet he talks a good game.

It's hard to top a string of hits, some of them near masterpieces. If it had been directed by some nonentity who had just graduated from film school it would have been hailed as a momentous debut.The plot. Doctor Tom Cruise is married to Nicole Kidman and they live on Central Park West in New York. After a party they get stoned and Kidman confesses that on their vacation last year, she noticed a naval officer and couldn't get him out of her mind, not even when she and Cruise were making love and developing plans for their life together. She'd have given up her future to be with this other man just for one night.Now these are ugly words for a husband to hear. He winds up walking the night-time streets, brooding about his wife and doubting his own grasp of things in general. He runs into a pal, a pianist, who quietly tells him that he's going to play the piano blindfolded at a secret party at a mansion. Everyone wears costumes. And he lets slip the password. He leaves, warning Cruise to forget everything he just heard.But Cruise is still tortured by Kidman's confession, rents a costume and mask, and attends the party. He's discovered as persona non grata and, surrounded by a hundred weirdos in dark costumes and garish masks, he's told to take off all his clothes.To make a long story short, he is redeemed -- ie., saved -- by a nude woman and he's allowed to leave. The next day Cruise learns that his pianist friend was hustled out of his hotel with a black eye by a couple of well-spoken hoods. And the woman who apparently volunteered to substitute her life for his is found dead of an overdose. Is it all coincidental? Cruise tells Kidman all about his overnight adventure and the two of them agree to believe that it was simply one of those things.It's slow. Mighty slow. Nobody speaks quickly. There are long pauses between utterances while one of the conversants stands open mouthed with expectation. The plot is wispy and filled with adventitious encounters. In all these respects, and more, it's a lot different from Kubrick's earlier stuff that, by comparison, seemed to rocket along propelled by the plots. But it's an obvious culmination of certain trends in Kubrick's later work, which is to say everything after Paths of Glory -- the episodic structure, the looseness of consequence, the introspection.There are, though, some interesting innovations. Kubrick had developed a habit of high key lighting. Everything was a fluorescent white in his late work, maybe with accents of color here and there, mostly apple red. There's unyielding light everywhere, as in a hospital operating room. In 2001 even the floors were translucent and lighted from below. He's reversed himself here, and it works too. It's Christmas time in New York. The streets are decorated with colored lights and interiors often have Christmas trees. The overall tone of the lighting is rosy and golden and warm all over, an ironic contrast to the disturbing goings on we witness.And there is more comedy that we might expect. There's an encounter with an odd hotel clerk, Alan Cumming, that is right out of the Enchanted Hunters scene in Lolita (both novel and film). And another ludic moment in the shop of a Jewish costumier who discovers his daughter, Leelee Sobieski, in flagrant dilecto with two Japanese transvestites, beats them up and locks them away for the police. When Cruise returns the costume the next day, the two Oriental gentleman emerge with Sobieski from a back room, happy as clams, and it becomes clear that the shop owner is pimping his own daughter.Before I run out of space -- and, believe me, this multi-layered effort deserves plenty of space -- I'll add a few asides. The piano theme that dominates the last half of the film is by a Hungarian madman, well, oddity actually, Ligeti, who built that ominous score almost entirely out of only two notes on the keyboard. It's an astonishing feat. Tom Cruise is something of an embarrassment as an actor, at least for me. I'm sure he's a nice guy and gives it everything he's got but I'm always aware that I'm watching some guy from New Jersey trying desperately to enact a role. It can't be the dialog, as elliptical as it sometimes gets, because Nicole Kidman is saddled with the same kinds of lines and she handles them smoothly. (By the way, she sports an exceedingly nubile figure in her skivvies. She's a lot sexier than the naked hookers at the party.) And it's not surprising that she's married to a doctor and lusts after an officer in the Navy. One projects immense wealth and the other power.

It's hard to top a string of hits, some of them near masterpieces. If it had been directed by some nonentity who had just graduated from film school it would have been hailed as a momentous debut.The plot. Doctor Tom Cruise is married to Nicole Kidman and they live on Central Park West in New York. After a party they get stoned and Kidman confesses that on their vacation last year, she noticed a naval officer and couldn't get him out of her mind, not even when she and Cruise were making love and developing plans for their life together. She'd have given up her future to be with this other man just for one night.Now these are ugly words for a husband to hear. He winds up walking the night-time streets, brooding about his wife and doubting his own grasp of things in general. He runs into a pal, a pianist, who quietly tells him that he's going to play the piano blindfolded at a secret party at a mansion. Everyone wears costumes. And he lets slip the password. He leaves, warning Cruise to forget everything he just heard.But Cruise is still tortured by Kidman's confession, rents a costume and mask, and attends the party. He's discovered as persona non grata and, surrounded by a hundred weirdos in dark costumes and garish masks, he's told to take off all his clothes.To make a long story short, he is redeemed -- ie., saved -- by a nude woman and he's allowed to leave. The next day Cruise learns that his pianist friend was hustled out of his hotel with a black eye by a couple of well-spoken hoods. And the woman who apparently volunteered to substitute her life for his is found dead of an overdose. Is it all coincidental? Cruise tells Kidman all about his overnight adventure and the two of them agree to believe that it was simply one of those things.It's slow. Mighty slow. Nobody speaks quickly. There are long pauses between utterances while one of the conversants stands open mouthed with expectation. The plot is wispy and filled with adventitious encounters. In all these respects, and more, it's a lot different from Kubrick's earlier stuff that, by comparison, seemed to rocket along propelled by the plots. But it's an obvious culmination of certain trends in Kubrick's later work, which is to say everything after Paths of Glory -- the episodic structure, the looseness of consequence, the introspection.There are, though, some interesting innovations. Kubrick had developed a habit of high key lighting. Everything was a fluorescent white in his late work, maybe with accents of color here and there, mostly apple red. There's unyielding light everywhere, as in a hospital operating room. In 2001 even the floors were translucent and lighted from below. He's reversed himself here, and it works too. It's Christmas time in New York. The streets are decorated with colored lights and interiors often have Christmas trees. The overall tone of the lighting is rosy and golden and warm all over, an ironic contrast to the disturbing goings on we witness.And there is more comedy that we might expect. There's an encounter with an odd hotel clerk, Alan Cumming, that is right out of the Enchanted Hunters scene in Lolita (both novel and film). And another ludic moment in the shop of a Jewish costumier who discovers his daughter, Leelee Sobieski, in flagrant dilecto with two Japanese transvestites, beats them up and locks them away for the police. When Cruise returns the costume the next day, the two Oriental gentleman emerge with Sobieski from a back room, happy as clams, and it becomes clear that the shop owner is pimping his own daughter.Before I run out of space -- and, believe me, this multi-layered effort deserves plenty of space -- I'll add a few asides. The piano theme that dominates the last half of the film is by a Hungarian madman, well, oddity actually, Ligeti, who built that ominous score almost entirely out of only two notes on the keyboard. It's an astonishing feat. Tom Cruise is something of an embarrassment as an actor, at least for me.

The 'what if' factor of the whole story is really adventurous, and the fact that this story stems from the original is brilliant. Its a story of love,family and identity. All three elements resonate with a lot of audiences. From a visual standpoint Spielberg triumphs again! And i don't understand why people beg to differ! For the purpose of entertaining young audiences, it fulfills the intention and more. I must say however, the film owes 50% of its credit to John Williams. His absolutely stunning score supports the story's tenderness. The flying sequence is so thrilling that it literally makes me get up and want to levitate! The performances are equally stunning and convincing, Robin Williams encompasses both his comedic and dramatic skills towards a full blooded performance. Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins are superb....really really astonishing. This film has to be one of Spielberg's most overlooked and underrated films of all time. It holds so much promise and warmth that every time I sit back and soak up the high-flying adventure it sends shivers down my spine. I recently watched it after so many years of it lost in my memory that I felt like I had visited a historical landmark..its placed within a treasured set of memories on my part. I cant express how moving this film is, its just enthralling in every sense of the word..the construction of the story is very clever and realistic - from a child's point of view.

Director Tony Randel's sequel keeps up the terrifying atmosphere and genuinely infernal creepiness of its predecessor and is even considerably gorier than the (also very gruesome) original. This second entry to the Hellraiser franchise epitomizes pure Horror as its predecessor and takes the viewer on a terrifying journey into the pits of a Hell from the mind of Clive Barker.The film starts off pretty much where the first part ended. After the horrifying events that took place in part one, survivor Kristy Cotton (Ashley Laurence) awakes in a mental hospital. One might think that psychiatrists are not eager to believe stories about Cenobites, demons from a bizarre, sadomasochistic Hell. The head of the institution, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), however, is obsessed with occultism and has his own plans with his new cognitions about cenobites and resurrection from Hell...***Warning! BIG SPOILERS Ahead!*** Kristy's evil stepmother Julia (Clare Higgins) returns from Hell, and she is not the only one. So do the Cenobites. The cenobites, especially the iconic Lead Cenobite (commonly referred to as 'Pinhead', played by Doug Bradley) are some of the most terrifying creatures the World of Horror has ever brought forth. My only slight complaint about Hellbound is the manner of how the cenobites are humanized towards the end. It seems to be a common assumption among makers of Horror-sequels, that they somehow need to explain how monsters became monsters - which is not always a good idea, in my opinion. Ever since I first saw the first two Hellraiser parts many years ago, I have held the view that the Cenobites were most terrifying in the first part, when they were still utterly mysterious and their origin was not yet explained. This minor fault is not yet extreme in this second part, however, and it does not waste its status as a fascinating sequel. The visions of Hell are extremely creepy and terrifying and character actor Kenneth Channard brings in a new type of purely evil villain. The sequel is, once again, filmed excellently, the settings are sublime and the gore-effects are as gruesome as it gets.

I watched it for the first time a couple years ago, knowing John Cleese and Michael Palin, of Monty Python fame, were in it. I hadn't seen Kevin Kline in anything else at the time, though he's also a big part of the comedy here. During my first viewing, it may not have been exactly what I was expecting, but from what I remember, I thought it was pretty good overall. Watching it for a second time two years later, obviously knowing what to expect this time, I think it was a lot like my first viewing, maybe a bit better.Wanda Gershwitz and the Anglophobic Otto West are an American couple who have come to England, posing as siblings, to join two English criminals, George Thomason and Ken Pile (an animal lover who owns several fish, one called Wanda) in a diamond heist. Wanda and Otto call the police and turn George in, so they can have the loot to themselves, but when they go to claim it, and Wanda is about to betray Otto as well, it isn't there! George has already moved the diamonds to another place, and only he knows where they are! To try and find out where they are, Wanda decides to seduce George's lawyer, Archie Leach. As much as Otto hates to be called stupid, he is not very bright, and his temper could make this mission harder to fulfill.Otto, played by Kevin Kline, is one nasty character, and one thing in the film I didn't care much for was certain comments from him about Ken Pile's (Michael Palin) stuttering. However, for the most part, Kline's character is good for laughs, providing such funny moments as his reaction to seeing that the loot is gone, and how much he shows he hates being called stupid. Most of the laughs probably come from him, but the two former Pythons in the cast (Palin as Ken Pile and Cleese as Archie Leach), are also highlights, unsurprisingly. The sub-plot with Ken trying to kill the only witness, an elderly woman named Mrs. Coady, is dark and tasteless (as with much of the rest of the film), but funny. Jamie Lee Curtis' performance as Wanda Gershwitz is shaky at times, but usually isn't a problem.Despite how much of a hit A Fish Called Wanda turned out to be, there are obviously many people who would strongly dislike it. It's certainly not for kids, and could offend some adults as well, with Kevin Kline's nasty character, Ken Pile's stuttering, animals being killed, etc. It's not for those who will only laugh at perfectly clean, inoffensive humour, you can be sure about that! However, if you're willing to laugh at some dark, tasteless, but well done humour, and you're a fan of Monty Python and\/or Kevin Kline, this film could turn out to be a fun romp for you.

This was one of Hollywood's first forays into New Age propaganda, an uncritical mix of Eastern mysticism and Unitarian pacifism. Shangri-La reveals some beautiful Bauhaus architecture. I suppose, being filmed in 1937, it was intended to look futuristic and timeless. We are also presented with free love, easy divorce, and universal day care as important lanes of the highway to Utopia. If you watch this film, notice that the Lama evades and never answers Conway's question about what is to be done if life really is pointless. No one asks how one gets to live in the nice Bauhaus administration building (with imported furniture) instead of working in the valley below carrying water in buckets. As with most other Utopias presented in film and literature, this society has an unusual source of wealth that funds all this happiness. In Shangri-La, gold is laying around like so many rocks, which allows them to trade for upscale furniture with a caravan that comes by every few years. (In _Twenty-One Balloons_, Krakatoa has diamonds to support its economy. The Dem's Utopia would have the rich to support it. I wonder what happens after the rich get soaked -- but I digress.) The acting is not bad for a Capra film. Still, I guess _Lost Horizon_ gets high votes because that many viewers agree with its message. Yes, it would be a much better world if people were just nice. The question is how we can get people to be nice. Moore, Marx, Dewey, Hilton (the author of _Lost Horizon_), and Pol Pot have all tried to answer that question (respectively communism, communism, socialism, just BE nice and let the not-nice people kill off each other, communism), but with poor results. Being nice is a good idea. Relationships are everything--living in communion with God and with one's neighbors is the meaning of life. However, there will always be plenty of not-nice people, no matter how nice other people are to them. _Lost Horizon_ belongs in the Museum of Yesterday's Tomorrows. It's a good way to peek at what intellectuals were presenting as the answer to the world's problems in 1937. The seventy years since then have shown some of the results, but, unfortunately, the learning curve among the cultural leadership seems to be relatively flat. I give LH a 5 mainly for its interest as a cultural artifact. As entertainment, it is pretty boring.
