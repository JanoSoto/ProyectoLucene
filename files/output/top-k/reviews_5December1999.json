But it's hard to compare the two. Though it features alot of the same characters from AMY, and uses the same Kevin Smith elements as in all his movies (Jay and Silent Bob have the longest screen time than in any of the others), DOGMA uses a good chunk of special effects and violence, but surprisingly it doesn't ruin the film, though it comes to the verge.Linda Fiorentino was such a smart choice for her main role as the only one who can stop fallen angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) from re-entering Heaven and thereby proving God fallible and destroying everything living. It's confusing, I know, there's so many other things going on also. But don't fret, it's not MISSION IMPOSSIBLE or CHINATOWN.You'd think you would be sick of seeing Ben Affleck and Matt Damon together again, but they work so well as Bartleby and Loki. Ben Affleck's character is the one that truly changes over the course of events, but I was surprised at how good of an actor Matt Damon is. For a long time he's played the same sort of characters, but here, he plays the sidekick masterfully (somehow his voice sounds different too).There's alot of characters and cameos in this movie, which I think is also different for Kevin Smith. Sure, he's always had a handful of slackers thrown in to keep the comedy flowing, but you were always paying attention to the main characters, which usually consisted of a guy, his oddball friend, and the one or two love interests. But here, due to the much more serious subject matter, we have an epic cast. George Carlin, Salma Hayek, Alan Rickman (seriously, folks!!), and Chris Rock all have important roles. Not to mention Jason Lee, who is menacingly good here, and cameos from Smith alumni Dwight Ewell and Brian O'Halloran.One more thing I would like to mention is Chris Rock. At first I thought he was going to be this hollering apostle using his usual black vs. white schtick comedy routine. Not to mention a bad actor (hopefully this movie will redeem him from CB4 and LETHAL WEAPON 4), but as the movie went on he conquered both hilarious and dramatic obsticles. He even came off as sweet a few times. This is his best appearance on film since the pork rib purchase in I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA!!I didn't know if I was going to like this movie at first. It sounded promising, but the trailers in the movie theater weren't too funny. But I think that was Smith keeping all the good parts behind the curtain (smart move). SEE THIS MOVIE!! The only thing that MIGHT be offensive, I thought, was Carlin's cigarette smoking, sell-out priest, but like the message in the beginning says (among other things) it's all a comedy fantasy!

This plot and script must have played out much better on stage, but in it's film version it just came out so convoluted and silly.  The only good, solid character was Darlene and she ended up looking like queen of sluts through the eyes of Eddie and he was supposed to be in love with her.   I usually love unconventional films where there may or may not be an obvious pro\/antagonist, but to at least have one marginally likable character would have benefited this film greatly.

I'll bet most people who say things like that are either kids or people who think Goodfellas is a bigger feat than the The Godfather because it had more action, thought Titanic was a stupid, mushy love story...or worse, are narrow-minded enough to reduce Godfather to a mere gangster movie.

Sure, if you're not in touch with your feelings and refuse to be overcome with emotion because it's wimpy then the extent of your movie appreciation will be razzle-dazzle action and special effects.

Thus we have to assess not merely whether we have a good or bad Bond film but do we have a good early, mid, or late period Bond. I have to say this latest opus is definitely good late Bond, and average overall Bond. Not as good as Goldeneye (A great Bond film) but infinitely better than the execrable Tomorrow never dies. Brosnan is now number 2 in Bond hierachy IMHO after Connery, and the added depth of expression he is allowed in this vehicle allows him to actually, well, act. The plot is so so, as it concerns a devilish plot to control the Worlds oil supply. Oh yeah? How sixties. The villain (Robert Carlyle) is also so so. The current Bond penchant for weak chinned British thesps as lead villain is as ineffective as it is infuriating. Can't we go back to the old middle European nasties, or is that non-PC? The pre-credits sequence is excellent if a little forced. You do get not one but two stunts so it's worth it. The problem is the PCS in Goldeneye (The best ever?) was SO good you compare all new ones with it. The Women are good and bad. Sophie Marceau is the most complex and well written female character ever in a Bond movie, and allied to her considerable physical gifts (She's drop dead gorgeous) she makes for a refreshing new approach to the standard Bondette. But that I could say the same for Denise Richards. She is positioned in this film (and in life, truth to tell)as a body with brains. She obviously left her brains at home for this role. She is not credible as a nuclear phycisist who isn't interested in men. Yawn. I am not giving anything away when I tell you she finally succumbs to that certain someone. She does a little wiring at one point to show how independent she is, and saves the our heroes life. Apart from that she is a piece of fluff and spends most of the film mewing.Her underwater swimming sequence almost redeems her, however. The script is very sharp (An early jab at the Swiss, and Nazi gold is gets things rolling). Recruiting Apted (A renowned dramatic director) has paid dividends with some of the best interplay ever in a Bond film. The sequences between Marceau and Brosnan are particularly well handled. Judi Dench gets to pay a part in the plot (A good move) and the locations are handled better than any Bond film I can remember. They are actually credible within the context of the plot. So some good and some bad. The reality is that its the central villain and the central premise that fail this film. Not to the detriment of the film, but in comparison with previous Bonds. The rest of the film is undoubtedly superior Bond. I hope Brosnan sticks around and fulfills his promise to recruit Quentin Tarantino to helm a Bond movie.

I have to say this latest opus is definitely good late Bond, and average overall Bond. Not as good as Goldeneye (A great Bond film) but infinitely better than the execrable Tomorrow never dies. Brosnan is now number 2 in Bond hierachy IMHO after Connery, and the added depth of expression he is allowed in this vehicle allows him to actually, well, act. The plot is so so, as it concerns a devilish plot to control the Worlds oil supply. Oh yeah? How sixties. The villain (Robert Carlyle) is also so so. The current Bond penchant for weak chinned British thesps as lead villain is as ineffective as it is infuriating. Can't we go back to the old middle European nasties, or is that non-PC? The pre-credits sequence is excellent if a little forced. You do get not one but two stunts so it's worth it. The problem is the PCS in Goldeneye (The best ever?) was SO good you compare all new ones with it. The Women are good and bad. Sophie Marceau is the most complex and well written female character ever in a Bond movie, and allied to her considerable physical gifts (She's drop dead gorgeous) she makes for a refreshing new approach to the standard Bondette. But that I could say the same for Denise Richards. She is positioned in this film (and in life, truth to tell)as a body with brains. She obviously left her brains at home for this role. She is not credible as a nuclear phycisist who isn't interested in men. Yawn. I am not giving anything away when I tell you she finally succumbs to that certain someone. She does a little wiring at one point to show how independent she is, and saves the our heroes life. Apart from that she is a piece of fluff and spends most of the film mewing.Her underwater swimming sequence almost redeems her, however. The script is very sharp (An early jab at the Swiss, and Nazi gold is gets things rolling). Recruiting Apted (A renowned dramatic director) has paid dividends with some of the best interplay ever in a Bond film. The sequences between Marceau and Brosnan are particularly well handled. Judi Dench gets to pay a part in the plot (A good move) and the locations are handled better than any Bond film I can remember. They are actually credible within the context of the plot. So some good and some bad. The reality is that its the central villain and the central premise that fail this film. Not to the detriment of the film, but in comparison with previous Bonds. The rest of the film is undoubtedly superior Bond. I hope Brosnan sticks around and fulfills his promise to recruit Quentin Tarantino to helm a Bond movie.

One of the most beautiful, complex and moving films I've seen in years. It's about love, faith, hate, obsession and jealousy. And to bring all this to life, there was a Graham Greene's great book, Neil Jordan, a very talented director, and an extraordinary cast. Ralph Fiennes is superb as Maurice Bendrix. We can feel what his character is feeling, see the emptiness in his eyes, sense the despair in his voice. When Sarah leaves him, his face is marked by deep melancholy. We forget there is an actor there. Instead, we see a passionate, tormented man. Julianne Moore is also wonderful. She delivers a deep, delicate performance, showing all her loneliness and love for that man. Stephen Rea has a subtle and intelligent performance. The love scenes are passionate. The chemistry between this beautiful and charming couple is perfect. The cinematography is stunning, creating a lyric atmosphere. A great film, a surreal world where you have never been before. The film and the actors should be nominated to the Oscar. This film should not be compared with The English Patient (which I loved, especially because of Ralph) because it's a diferent story and very different as a film.
