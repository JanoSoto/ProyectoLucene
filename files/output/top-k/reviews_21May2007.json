Steve had a very naive type of personality, where his mother was still telling him what to do at his wedding. He always seemed to be good friend to the other guys, but wasn't s physically or emotionally strong. He always had someone watching out for him, until he got to Vietnam, where Nick and Mike watched over him, but they also had to concentrate on surviving themselves. When he was locked in the trap in the water while the other men played Russian Roulette, he was barely alive, but Mike saved him by getting him to the trail where there was medical help. Steve, however, didn't really merge back into reality when he returned, he hid away from his family and friends at the Veteran Hospital. Although he was ashamed of coming home, and of having no legs, he couldn't face his old friends and family alone, Mike had to come and pick him up to bring him. Without Mike, Steve never would have made it out of Vietnam. Mike's personality enabled him to survive and make it home from Vietnam twice, His attitude and perseverance allowed him to stay alive and outwit his opponents. Whenever anybody needed something, Mike was the person who helped them, the shoulder that they leaned on. For example, Steve all throughout the war, and even when he came home, too. Nick's girlfriend when Nick didn't come home too, she received support from Mike, who never asked for anything in return. Mike was bold, brave and able to adapt to everything that life brought, which is why he wasn't physically or mentally disabled at the end of the movie. Nick always seemed to be the gambler, he always wanted to take bets and chances, even if it meant with his life. He stayed in Vietnam because he couldn't go back to regular life, so he took chances until the end. Even after Mike pleaded with him, even though he didn't recognize him, which showed how mentally unstable and shook up he always was. Furthermore, he went AWOL and just took off from the army to blend with the Vietnamese gambling tournaments of Russian Roulette. Nick had to take chances to keep his mind off of his reality. The movie could of have been different but the character's personalities and decisions prevented any changes in the plot. Of course it is easy to say that they could have made better decisions, but it's hard to speculate, especially when we have no idea of how to react in such a situation.

And Spike, (GOD I love him)still continues to work you. You tend to watch this as you would a horrible accident....you simply cannot turn away but it is entirely too painful to watch. I understand exactly what he was trying to say and agree wholeheartedly. Yet I cannot deny I was squirming in the beginning because it takes a bit of getting used to.First and foremost, forget critics. Your opinion is just as valid. This is another very important film with wonderful performances. While Damon's interpretation is a bit over the top, there is no doubt what perspective he was trying to convey. He is a very troubled black man who has issues. His boss, who has a black wife and half-white children is repugnant, and thinks that this gives him the right to say and think anything about African-Americans he likes which is utter nonsense.Jada Pinkett Smith is wonderful as the conscience after-the-fact and you wish to see her in more controlled, intelligent, roles as this.But the standout, to be sure, is Savion Glover whose dancing is quite simply mesmerizing; it is quite easy to forget the rough ground we are treading and just revel in this man's talent. He also was the film's choreographer and the precision of his dance routines tended to help one endure such painful presentations as black actors in a cotton field in blackface.Paul Mooney who plays Delacroix's father is positively wonderful and his comic routines are hilarious as well as insightful. He has always been a cutting edge comic but sadly has not received his just due.But just as he did in Four Little Girls Spike MAKES YOU CONFRONT IT WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT!!! I am quite satisfied with this DVD; it is a must for any DVD collection. The only complaint I have is that some (as a matter of fact, all) of the deleted scenes should have been rethought because they tended to flesh out the plot a bit more. The ending may have been a bit too violent as a possible consequence to the network's insensitivity but overall, this is a very complicated, mulit-layered, film that will demand certainly more than one viewing. Besides, I have already made up my mind that everything Spike has\/will do will be well worth the controversy he invariably provokes. Hats off again, Spike!!!

Humbert Humbert viciously slashes her with his gibes about her intelligence and education, talking over her head. Fate (thanks, Vladimir) has most unkindly widowed her, leaving her to live a financially secure but otherwise empty life and an urn full of her dead husband's ashes. She was still young enough to want more Romance, love and excitement.As Charlotte Haze, Shelly Winters is brilliant. The same for Kubrick's direction. She garnered my sympathy for the lonely, middle-aged widow as she sat softly crying, alone in her living room after Humbert callously abandons her to go chaperon (read lust after) Lolita at a High School Prom. I stopped sneering and felt really sorry for her. At the film's end, I felt some compassion for the unlucky-at-love Humbert Humbert, even if he got what he deserved for being such a swine and a damn fool to boot.

A movie that has been influenced many times since its incarnation from book to movie in the year 1972, this is a movie that fully deserves a spot in the Top 250.Plot The movie is based on the James Dickey novel of the same name. While I haven't read Deliverance, it is one my list of books to read because this movie's story was great and history has taught us that books have better stories than their movie. This is the movie that has given people the fear of wilderness, stereotypical rednecks and mountain people (no offense), and the idea of rape. This movie is scary without being a horror film and using realistic ideas. That makes it scary.Acting When the Academy Awards came around, Deliverance was definitely overlooked when it came to acting. Yes there was Marlon Brando for The Godfather but it didn't even get nominations. Jon Voight gave a fantastic performance as a man who is going along for the ride and helps his friends. The real show comes from Burt Reynolds who plays a wild adventurous risk taker who can at times be very reckless. This is where the nomination should have come in.Genre\/Quality This fits an adventure film as well as a scary thriller.

One can overlook the fact that Mark can not sing.

However, the impact that the songs convey and the choreography at these points of the movie is incredible! Some of the other songs like, As Long As He Needs Me, I'd Do Anything, and Where is Love?, seem to be overly long or not needed. One may wonder if the same messages could have been conveyed without some of the songs to deliver the meanings being sung by the actors.However, the movie has some flaws. For one, the British accents of many of the actors are VERY STRONG, and you often have to listen closely to understand what is being said or you may miss important dialog.

It takes off the superb biting-edge background that provided a strong subliminal tone in many other portions of the film. The End should have been the scene with Dodger and Fagin.

It is multi-layered and deals with some extremely sensitive issues all the while painting a beautiful tapestry of African-American life in the Louisianna bayou. For those of you who have not seen it, it deals with the awakening of a father and his daughters one summer and the emotions that accompany this learning. The young Eve is brilliantly played by Smollett and Debbi Morgan gives a knockout performance that you crave to see over and over again. Diahann Carroll works you because her character is not at all glamorous but pivotal to the plot as Eve comes to realize the responsibility of her gift and learns the truth of the age-old adage, Be careful what you wish for, for you just might get it. Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as usual and perfectly cast. While his character is not necessarily sympathetic, he is totally understandable and for a little girl who worships her father he is perfectly cast. While some aspects of the father-daughter relationship may be somewhat uncomfortable, the director does a beautiful job bringing the complexity of these issues to the screen and I heartily applaud her. This is one that belongs in any movie collection and one where African-American life is celebrated and treated with the utmost respect and honesty. Hats off to a wonderful production!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Based on Christopher Isherwood's fine collection of novellas, Goodbye Berlin, and the subsequent stage musical based on them, Cabaret takes elements of both sources to create something completely unique. It tells the story of Brian Roberts (Michael York), a British professor who travels to 1931 Berlin to give English lessons to a wealthy heiress of a German Jewish family. He meets the irrepressible Sally Bowles (Liza Minelli, in a dynamite performance), an American and fellow lodger in his boarding house, and the two begin a madcap friendship and sort-of romance, eventually falling in with a wealthy German baron until they all fall out with one another. Meanwhile, revellers come to the Kit Kat Klub, the cabaret where Sally performs, to join the sinister Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey, recreating his Broadway performance) in laughing away the dark cloud of Nazism building on the German horizon.Fosse sharpened his directorial teeth on Sweet Charity three years earlier, and while I greatly admire that film, I can admit how uneven it is as a movie. Cabaret proves Fosse to be a master behind the camera, with a directorial style as unique and instantly recognizable as his choreography. The Kit Kat Klub and its devilish M.C. provide stylized commentary on the world rotting away outside the cabaret's decadent interior; the musical numbers don't advance the plot as much as comment on it. Fosse's way of filming musical numbers is fascinating, using quick edits to capture movement from multiple angles almost simultaneously. But what gives Cabaret its shattering power is the way it depicts the Nazi movement's insidious rise to power even as people were dismissing it as a joke. For all of the film's stylized panache, it provides one of the most realistic documents I've ever seen of just how the Nazis positioned themselves to dominate Germany. It's no coincidence that the film's most disturbing moment comes not in the nightmare, feverish world of the cabaret's stage, but rather in the realistically depicted world of a German beer garden, where the angelic voice of a Nazi youth raised in song becomes a rallying cry and call to arms for the German people. The acting is phenomenal. Liza Minelli gives easily the best performance of her career and one of the best performances in the history of cinema. Joel Grey creates a character who manages to be no one and everyone at the same time. One can't imagine this vampirish imp of a man existing outside of the dark, lurid walls of the cabaret. And Michael York does terrific work as well, even if his role isn't as showy.I think Cabaret has been underrated because people have labeled it as a musical, and musicals never get taken as seriously as other genres. But I would caution anyone against dismissing this film on those grounds. Yes, there is music in it, but what Cabaret is more than anything else is a haunting warning about the dangers in any time and place of ignoring the unpleasantness of the present and near future for the hedonistic pleasures of the moment.Grade A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 May 2007","score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Bob Fosse's most accomplished film is one of the most accomplished films ever made, period.Fosse understood that the days of the old-fashioned Hollywood musical were over, at least as of 1972, so he gave audiences a musical that doesn't feel like a musical.

That remark is what led me to La Cité des Enfants Perdus in the first place. I think Dark City is a great film; but City of Lost Children is a true, spotless, priceless gem. It is valuable, perhaps, beyond normal human comprehension. Yes, that is over-the-top, but it's my opinion and I'm sticking by it!If my French were better, I'd be tempted to write this review in that language. As it is, I very much prefer watching and listening to the film in its original language! It's not that the English dubs are so very bad, but the movie is so much better viewed and heard in French, I believe... I need the English sub-titles, but that's fine.This is a very difficult movie to review for me; even my native English vocabulary feels inadequate to the task! The top adjective to fit this film must be, pour moi, incredible! (Say it, shout it in a really bad fake French accent ON-kray-DEE-bluh!) Yes, we must laugh long and hard about it! This film is so genuinely cute, so horribly evil, so deliciously sweet, so side-splittingly hilarious, so full of heart-wrenching pathos... I just cannot find the correct words. It is self-contradictory in every scene, in the best meaning that phrase conveys. Yet the final entirety is one of the sweetest, most lovely film experiences...Whoever wrote the screenplay (writing credits Gilles Adrien & Jean-Pierre Jeunet & Marc Caro) are geniuses. I can't imagine how their fertile minds ever came up with such a wondrous plot line. The story is quite complicated, and yet weaves together perfectly into a tight, glorious tapestry of imagination! Whoever designed the sets and props (Art Direction Jean Rabasse, Production Design Marc Caro & Jean Rabasse) are geniuses. This is a small rural village, but covering many square kilometres, whose every view is decidedly urban, a miniature-yet-sprawling Paris of over a century ago.The village-city is populated with futuristic (yet stylistically far-outdated) alien folk in rubberized black trench coats, all wearing eyesight and hearing enhancers whose gains are set, always, too high. Like all in this movie a tad scary, and yet oh so very funny! Populated, too, by circus performers of a bygone era, by little self-reliant street urchins who'd be right at home in a Dickens novel... There are modern telephones, creaky old diving suits, huge rusty ships, Edison phonographs playing those big thick records, and enough Rube Goldberg devices to amaze and make you laugh all night long.Whoever wrote the sweetly evocative music (Original Music by Angelo Badalamenti), and whoever matched it to the film's images (Film Editing by Herve Schneid, Music Mixing by Thierry Lebon), are geniuses par excellence.The directors (Marc Caro & Jean-Pierre Jeunet) are geniuses off the top of the IQ scale. How on earth did they get these beautiful young children to cry, to act in such sweet-childish yet professionally adult ways, to look straight at the camera with such amazing aplomb, to exhibit perfectly the emotions needed to make their characters so believable? Jeunet attempts to describe, in his Special Feature commentary (with Ron Pearlman), how he accomplished some of this stuff, but it comes off in such a way that he himself appears genuinely amazed at how well things went, especially with the many scenes including the precious child actors...One of the principal children, Petite Frere Denree (Joseph Lucien), perhaps all of six years old, does absolutely nothing throughout the film but eat a lot of good food and, occasionally, burp. And yet he will steal your heart away, right from his first appearance, guaranteed.Alexis Pivot, as Tadpole, gets special mention from director Jeunet in the DVD's Special Features commentary. Apparently, even at the tender age of eight or so, he gave Jeunet some very effective ideas about filming some scenes. One shows Tadpole walking slowly away from the camera, in a beautiful scene evoking The Little Tramp, but much better, I think... Jeunet's remarks about Alexis Pivot should encourage us to look, in a few years, for that young man as a director of note.The adult actors are truly superb, as well. Judith Vittet (Miette) was nine years old at the time the film was produced, but she must certainly be counted as one the professional adult actors...A good scene for Dominique Pinon involves his playing only four clones at one time on the screen! He is absolutely, wonderfully hilarious.Daniel Emilfork (the monstrously evil Krank) is certainly a remarkably strange vision of a character. He is the archetypical villain in this bizarre melodrama; we all boo him at his every appearance. Yet, at the end, we do feel small pangs of sadness for him. He was a child once, too, before he became so evil. His over-the-top pantomime of Papa Noel, which aims at getting some toddlers not to fear him, fails so spectacularly... The harder he tries, the worse he gets! I think this is the funniest scene in the film, wildly hilarious, even though it ends in half-a-dozen little kids crying, screaming in absolute terror of the horrible Krank apparition. How can such a contradictory scene be so endearing? Well, it surely is!I have seen little of Ron Pearlman, but I want to see more, now!There are so many more actors, too numerous to detail, and yet they all fit so well into this tapestry.I could go on and on, and I have gone on too long.

The top adjective to fit this film must be, pour moi, incredible! (Say it, shout it in a really bad fake French accent ON-kray-DEE-bluh!) Yes, we must laugh long and hard about it! This film is so genuinely cute, so horribly evil, so deliciously sweet, so side-splittingly hilarious, so full of heart-wrenching pathos... I just cannot find the correct words.

Yet the final entirety is one of the sweetest, most lovely film experiences...Whoever wrote the screenplay (writing credits Gilles Adrien & Jean-Pierre Jeunet & Marc Caro) are geniuses.

At the time of its release, it commanded a bit of a stir but quickly went gently into that good night. Unfortunately, I had not had a chance to see it before it came to cable. Upon my first viewing, I immediately fell in love with it.The story, set in the 19th century, centers around an accountant (Depp, wearing this exceedingly horrible suit!) who receives an offer of employment in this real beat-up town only to arrive a month too late to discover they had given his job to someone else. He demands to see the boss, a positively wooooooooonderful, Robert Mitchum, who also quickly frightens him into leaving well enough alone.He then encounters a myriad of off-beat characters in his quest to survive. Johnny's performance is enhanced by the quirky characters that abound in this story and it is fun trying to figure out who is who. Your typical Western, this certainly is not, but the performances all around make this quite a memorable viewing experience. Additionally, the sound track by Neil Young complements the film perfectly.The film is multi-layered and I can assure you that on each viewing, you will undoubtedly discover some nuance you had missed before.Suffice it to say, it is a story that perfectly captures the survival of the fittest theme.
