Tim Robbins plays Griffin Mill, a studio executive who has the uncanny ability to walk through the quicksands of Hollywood studio politics and somehow stay on solid ground. At one point, he explains that over a thousand scripts are submitted to the studio, and he's the guy who has to decide which 12 films will be made that year. That means 12 people are happy with him, and all the rest are not. In fact, one writer whose script was rejected is sending him death threats.Greta Scacchi plays June Gudmundsdottir, the beautiful young woman Griffin meets while trying to find the writer of the death threats. Whoopi Goldberg plays Detective Avery. Goldberg's a fine actor, but she's burdened with a script that involves a scene about her tampons and her assistant's tampons that's degrading and not even funny.Altman made the film with about fifty of the Hollywood greats and near-greats playing cameos. It's a tour de force to round up that many actors to be on screen for just a minute or less. However, using that many cameo actors is a two-edged sword. As a viewer, you're spending all your time looking to see which face you recognize, when you're supposed to be paying attention to the plot.It doesn't help that Altman uses his characteristic technique of having several characters talking at once. Often, the important lines are not being spoken by actors who are filmed in focus. Someone walking behind the main actors may be saying the really important lines. (Of course, that assumes you can hear the actors. Altman likes his characters to mutter and mumble, and sometimes you just can't make out what's being said by anyone.)Because I have no idea of what really goes on in Hollywood--or anyway, what went on in 1992--I have no way of knowing how accurate Altman's portrayal is. Assuming it's accurate, my suggestion to all of us would be to keep our day jobs and don't go near Hollywood. In Hollywood, there are plenty of knives around, and there's a back waiting for every knife. Definitely not my kind of place.However, The Player is pretty much my kind of movie. It's certainly never boring, the acting is good, there's glamor everywhere, and Altman has opened a small window so that we can see how movies get made, or don't get made.We saw this film on DVD and it worked well on the small screen. If you're interested in what goes on in Hollywood--at least according to Altman--then this movie will work for you, as it did for me. Before you see the film, you might want to look at the IMDb cast list to see actors playing herself or himself.

This was probably echoed around the country when Magnum Force was first shown on British television in the early 1980s as it inferred that David Soul from Starsky & Hutch and Robert Urich from Vegas could be vigilante cops.Magnum Force is the first sequel to Dirty Harry. Clint Eastwood reprises his iconic role as the no nonsense San Francisco detective Harry Callahan. Eastwood was mindful of the criticism levelled at his character that he was a vigilante cop and this film was a response that labelling Harry as a vigilante is misconceived. Clint Eastwood always maintained that the Harry was critical of organisations and the bureaucracy that they carried. They simply would not let police to their jobs, possibly reflecting Eastwood's own libertarian views.In fact the plot really can be distilled to two people's views of organisations. Harry and his abrasive boss Lt Briggs (Hal Holbrook) on the face of it the anti-Dirty Harry, the cop who has never pulled a gun in the line of duty. Harry knows the system is broken but works within it. He might edge close to the line, even slightly cross it (which he seemed to have done in Dirty Harry) but respects the rule of law even if its grudgingly. It looks like Briggs also realises that the justice system is broken but has a different solution.Watching Magnum Force again almost three decades later I expected the film to have aged. It certainly has a different depiction of San Francisco than the more tourist friendly picture postcard setting you get these days. Even the crooked segment of Lombard Street does not look like that any-more. What is striking though is the how action packed the film is, its absolutely modernist. I would say that this might be the precursor to the 1980s action thrillers.There was a time in action films where things moved slowly, you established settings, character and there would be a lull in between action scenes where you have quieter moments. Just look at Steve McQueen's Bullitt made a few years earlier and also set in San Francisco.In Magnum Force things are happening all the time. Bad guys getting bumped off by someone dressed up as a cop in a motorcycle. When we see Harry he gets into action pretty quickly as well, dressing up as a pilot to deal with a plane hijacking, later on we see him on a stakeout when a store is held up. The film is very well paced with incidents and action at regular intervals. Credit for that has to go to the writers more than the director Ted Post in my opinion.The film was written by Michael Cimino and John Milius. Both were the new wave of infant terrible of 1970s cinema which also included Scorsese, Spielberg , Coppola and De Palma. John Milius has always been a gun nut with a fascination with the military. He is regarded as the most right wing person in Hollywood. A film critic once said that's like calling someone out for being the tallest player in a professional basketball team!Cimino would go on to work with Eastwood the following year in Thunderbolt & Lightfoot which he wrote and directed. Cimino would achieve acclaim with The Deer Hunter and infamy through his follow up film, Heaven's Gate. He has not directed a feature film since 1996. There have been rumours he now lives life as a woman. What is true is that he has had a lot of bad plastic surgery.The film is called Magnum Force but during the climax notice that Harry dispatches the villains without once resorting to his gun. This is deliberate, Eastwood wanted to show Harry was more than a cop with a big gun that he had guile. It also reinforces the anti- vigilante message of the film.The ending is a little drawn out for my liking.One other thing about Harry in this film was sex appeal. Maybe he should be called X rated Harry as women just keep falling for him. Eastwood in his Dollar trilogy films was never into the ladies. That came in the movies in the 1970s which the star exploited as Eastwood became something of a sex symbol. I am sure it was also an ego thing on the part of Eastwood.

It's not the cleverest or deepest film in the world and it has a few campy moments but it makes for a great Boys' Own adventure as well as a very good paranoid sci-fi thriller. I had completely forgotten that the film was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, who also directed my sixth favourite film Planet of the Apes. I thought that Nicholas and Alexandra was the only other one of his films that I had seen but I was clearly wrong! In one of the oddest cases of casting against type in film history, Gregory Integrity Peck, easily one of my ten favourite actors, plays the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Casting against type can work very well - some of the best examples are seen in the two Roots miniseries where many very likable actors such as Lloyd Bridges, Ralph Waite, Chuck Connors and, most notably, Henry Fonda play racists - but I'm afraid that Peck was miscast in this instance. If I were Schaffner, I would have probably cast someone like Charlton Heston (who later played the role in My Father, Rua Alguem 5555) or George C. Scott, both of whom had worked with him before and could be very creepy when they had to be. Now, Peck is an excellent actor and his performance is most certainly not awful. It is actually quite a good performance but it was not a role that played to his strengths. That said, he is at his best towards the end of the film when he is in his element and has to deliver an impassioned speech but, in stark contrast to his best and best known role, it is pro-racism rather than anti-racism! Incidentally, what was not known, at least for certain, when the film was made was that Mengele was still alive and living in Brazil. He died in February 1979, only five months after the film was released.The film benefits from another very strong cast member in the form of Laurence Olivier, another of my absolute favourite actors. He plays the role of an elderly concentration camp survivor turned Nazi hunter named Ezra Lieberman, a thinly veiled version of Simon Wiesenthal. In one of his last major roles, he is extremely good as Lieberman, playing the Nazi hunter as a man of great courage and principle who no longer has the credibility that he once did. However, Olivier loved accents and had a tendency to go over the top when using one, which happens on several occasions in the film, but it did little to detract from his otherwise great performance. Olivier received the last of ten acting Oscar nominations for the film. He was nominated for Best Actor for the ninth time, tying Spencer Tracy's record. It has yet to be surpassed. I mentioned earlier that there were a few elements of camp in the film and the biggest is probably the fight scene between the 62-year-old Peck and the 71-year-old Olivier. At their age, it was a bit on the silly side.The film has a great cast of superb actors in supporting and small roles such as James Mason, Uta Hagen (in a great cameo appearance as the former concentration guard Frieda Maloney), Denholm Elliott, John Dehner, Michael Gough, Lili Palmer, Walter Gotell, John Rubinstein, Anne Meara (who sadly died in May) and Bruno Ganz, who later played Hitler himself in Der Untergang. I wouldn't call Steve Guttenberg a superb actor but he has a nice early supporting role as Barry Kohler, the young Jewish American man who alerts Lieberman to Mengele's plot. Jeremy Black, who plays the title characters, was not a very good actor and never appeared in another film but he only has a few scenes, all but one of which are very brief, so that's okay. The writing is quite strong. The same is true of Schaffner's direction though the film does get a little too gory towards the end.Overall, this is an extremely fun film which, while best enjoyed if not taken too seriously, does manage to raise some interesting questions.

I mentioned earlier that there were a few elements of camp in the film and the biggest is probably the fight scene between the 62-year-old Peck and the 71-year-old Olivier. At their age, it was a bit on the silly side.The film has a great cast of superb actors in supporting and small roles such as James Mason, Uta Hagen (in a great cameo appearance as the former concentration guard Frieda Maloney), Denholm Elliott, John Dehner, Michael Gough, Lili Palmer, Walter Gotell, John Rubinstein, Anne Meara (who sadly died in May) and Bruno Ganz, who later played Hitler himself in Der Untergang. I wouldn't call Steve Guttenberg a superb actor but he has a nice early supporting role as Barry Kohler, the young Jewish American man who alerts Lieberman to Mengele's plot. Jeremy Black, who plays the title characters, was not a very good actor and never appeared in another film but he only has a few scenes, all but one of which are very brief, so that's okay. The writing is quite strong. The same is true of Schaffner's direction though the film does get a little too gory towards the end.Overall, this is an extremely fun film which, while best enjoyed if not taken too seriously, does manage to raise some interesting questions.

Sorry for trampling on your childhood memories and nostalgia, but this is a bad movie that gets way way overrated because of the iconic status of its lead character, Superman, and because of the good performance by its leading man, Christopher Reeve. But Reeve's performance alone really is no excuse to elevate this movie to its undeserved status as a true classic.The plot I actually have no objection to the villain Lex Luthor's dastardly plot to sink California into the sea. This is a comic-book movie after all and the old Superman comics were no stranger to ridiculously silly plots. What is inexcusable however and, frankly, damages the movie, though, is the utter eye-rolling-stupidity of the events throughout the film showing how this plot is carried out. Lex Luthor is supposed to be a genius criminal mastermind, but it seems the writers' idea of making him appear smart was to make everyone else he interacts with into brain-dead buffoons. Those corny scenes of the cartoony villains effortlessly tricking the mentally-challenged Army soldiers were just insulting to the viewers' intelligence. If they had introduced an additional plot point in which Luthor sprayed the soldiers with some idiocy-inducing gas or something like that, it would at least make some sense.The romance This was painful to watch. Lois is an annoying character. She's supposed to be an experienced and respected reporter, yet she doesn't show the slightest bit of competence or professionalism at anything she does (especially that awkward interview scene... Can you see my underwear? Really?). Clark is given pretty much zero reasons to fall for her, yet he does - I guess because he's the male lead and she's the female lead and that's the only reason. Why would he suddenly fall for the mean lady at work who's a kinda disrespectful to him? The flying scene with the narration was just cringe-worthy. Why didn't they fill that scene with a song, instead of a weirdly inappropriate voice-over?I know it seems like I'm completely trashing this movie, but it's not all bad. As I mentioned, Christopher Reeve was quite good. He looks perfect, he's emotional when he needs to be, he plays the dual personalities well, and he's actually very funny as the bumbling Clark Kent.What was a bit weird though, was Clark's personality. It's normal for a superhero to have two personalities, the superhero persona, and the public civilian self. The bumbling klutz Clark Kent persona is clearly an act, but it seems like the Superman persona is also fake. The good-natured goodie-two-shoes boy scout personality doesn't really resemble Clark when he was a kid, his true self, which this movie unfortunately ignores until we possibly see a bit of it again at the very end.

It's just a drippingly chintzy version of one.

Never has Cassavetes settled for anything less than honest, so it's only fitting that the majority of his films throw his characters into a pit of chaos and sees where they land. In his most famous moment, A Woman Under the Influence, he details the dissolve of a housewife's psyche, taking her marriage down with her; in Love Streams, he throws curveball after curveball at characters so lost in a maze of depression that it's only reasonable to predict that they'll never make their way out.Faces is the movie that first bolded and underlined his filmmaking style, pulling out massive emotional punches and drawing out visceral performances from his stock of actors.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"20 July 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm not going to say it was an entire awful movie, but after the success of the first two Godfather franchises, there was no necessity in making a third sequel. Even director Francis Ford Coppola admitted that the sagas come from Parts I and II and that The Godfather Part III was nothing more than a glorified epilogue. The only purpose as to why he made this third installment was because his bravado was going down plus he was in a financial crunch and was lured in by Paramount to make a third movie as a key to his financial comeback. He could've resisted the temptation, but he decided to give it the old college try. I just wished that he made another flop than to make The Godfather III. At least with the flop it would've been an honest one and less manipulative. The flaws in this movie are by the bundles, where to begin we can say that the plot does not have the same bite that its predecessor's have in their grasp. Even though at 2 hours and 42 minutes long it feels a lot longer and some scenes tend to drag on for too long, especially the scenes that take place in Sicily. Michael and Kay's (Al Pacino and Diane Keaton) quiet time together should have been axed out entirely. This movie is not a romantic tale, so therefore Coppola unless he was trying to get more female audience members to see this film, there was no need for any kind of dragged out romantic interludes to this story. For those who wish to use Sofia Coppola as the main poison to this this film may have crossed the line a bit here. Yes I agree she couldn't act worth a nickel, but she was only on for a very short time and her contribution to the film is quite minimal. Granted if they would've casted either Julia Roberts of Winona Ryder for the part of Mary Corleone, they could've made the character all the more compelling. But Mary is only very minor role so it really would not have made much of a difference. Another key factor to why this film is inferior to the other two Godfathers is the absence of Robert Duvall's character Tom Hagen. Duvall was interested in reprising his role and demanded to Mr. Coppola an equal salary like Pacino, but he was rebuffed at his request and backed out of the project. With that in mind Coppola edited out that Hagen died and that George Hamilton's B.J. Harrison was cast as the new attorney to the Corleone's estate. The only living relative to the Hagen name was Father Andrew Hagen played by John Savage whose role was absolutely useless. If there was any newbie that holds any kind of interest was Andy Garcia's performance as Vincent Corleone, the son of James Caan's character the late Sonny Corleone and Michael's nephew. The first of the trilogy had young Michael trying to take over the family empire after Sonny and Fredo were not eligible for such as task. Michael wanted legitimacy within his family's legacy. It would've been better if Vincent became the successor and to bring the family back to conducting illegal tactics to bring back their old ways again. The script gets within those parameters, but the distractions are way too abundant.Another note to point out is that the change in Michael is way to obvious and at time can be unnatural. After the second film Michael was raging force to be reckoned with, but now a lot older and more gravely ill, he is now begging for forgiveness for all the things he's done. I understand that as you get older you look back and think of all the things you've done. In Michael's case, he's like he's been resurrected from the first film, feeling a bit ashamed he's from a Mafia family and wants no part of it, but in family honour, he'll attack when his family needs him when no one else will intervene. I have no problem with this change, but the process is never fully clarified due to the lacklustre script.

Even director Francis Ford Coppola admitted that the sagas come from Parts I and II and that The Godfather Part III was nothing more than a glorified epilogue. The only purpose as to why he made this third installment was because his bravado was going down plus he was in a financial crunch and was lured in by Paramount to make a third movie as a key to his financial comeback. He could've resisted the temptation, but he decided to give it the old college try. I just wished that he made another flop than to make The Godfather III. At least with the flop it would've been an honest one and less manipulative. The flaws in this movie are by the bundles, where to begin we can say that the plot does not have the same bite that its predecessor's have in their grasp. Even though at 2 hours and 42 minutes long it feels a lot longer and some scenes tend to drag on for too long, especially the scenes that take place in Sicily. Michael and Kay's (Al Pacino and Diane Keaton) quiet time together should have been axed out entirely. This movie is not a romantic tale, so therefore Coppola unless he was trying to get more female audience members to see this film, there was no need for any kind of dragged out romantic interludes to this story. For those who wish to use Sofia Coppola as the main poison to this this film may have crossed the line a bit here. Yes I agree she couldn't act worth a nickel, but she was only on for a very short time and her contribution to the film is quite minimal. Granted if they would've casted either Julia Roberts of Winona Ryder for the part of Mary Corleone, they could've made the character all the more compelling. But Mary is only very minor role so it really would not have made much of a difference. Another key factor to why this film is inferior to the other two Godfathers is the absence of Robert Duvall's character Tom Hagen. Duvall was interested in reprising his role and demanded to Mr. Coppola an equal salary like Pacino, but he was rebuffed at his request and backed out of the project. With that in mind Coppola edited out that Hagen died and that George Hamilton's B.J. Harrison was cast as the new attorney to the Corleone's estate. The only living relative to the Hagen name was Father Andrew Hagen played by John Savage whose role was absolutely useless. If there was any newbie that holds any kind of interest was Andy Garcia's performance as Vincent Corleone, the son of James Caan's character the late Sonny Corleone and Michael's nephew. The first of the trilogy had young Michael trying to take over the family empire after Sonny and Fredo were not eligible for such as task. Michael wanted legitimacy within his family's legacy. It would've been better if Vincent became the successor and to bring the family back to conducting illegal tactics to bring back their old ways again. The script gets within those parameters, but the distractions are way too abundant.Another note to point out is that the change in Michael is way to obvious and at time can be unnatural. After the second film Michael was raging force to be reckoned with, but now a lot older and more gravely ill, he is now begging for forgiveness for all the things he's done. I understand that as you get older you look back and think of all the things you've done. In Michael's case, he's like he's been resurrected from the first film, feeling a bit ashamed he's from a Mafia family and wants no part of it, but in family honour, he'll attack when his family needs him when no one else will intervene. I have no problem with this change, but the process is never fully clarified due to the lacklustre script. It just gives me the impression he's scared of dying and just wants one last breath of redemption before the coffin closes.

The voice actors also did a good job bringing the animated characters to life, especially the British-accented cast of The Wind in the Willows.

The ending, though, is a little funny to watch. The Legend of Sleepy Hallow, on the other hand, is a clever work of uniqueness and charm, where the confident and scuzzy professor Ichabod outwits handsome, scrapping town bully Bram Bones a number of times as the both chase after town beauty Katrina. However, his self-serving attitude might have gotten the best of him as he tangles with the legendary Headless Horseman while on his home through the foreboding woods after a party. This sequence only is fearsome enough to scare the kids, especially on Halloween! ***spoiler ahead*** The downside, though, is that The Legend of Sleepy Hallow left us with a hanging ending. The fate of Ichabod was left ambiguous and the marriage of Katrina and Bram Bones at the end shows Katrina's lack of concern for Ichabod, whom she has courted throughout the story. This revealed her true shallow personality. While I know the ending is more in line with the Irving's story, ending was still a little unsettling and anti-climatic. ***spoiler ends*** It's not too bad of movie to pass the time, but I prefer The Legend of Sleepy Hallow more than The Wind in the Willows for entertainment and suspense.Grade C+ ","genre":null},{"date":"20 July 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is Walt Disney's 11th full-length animated feature film, and one of six package films that combines two short stories, The Wind in the Willows and The Legend of Sleepy Hallow, into one movie.The animation is top-notch for its time and compliments the two tales of American folklore well.

Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart), a scruffy, unshaven American drifter, spends some of his last handout on a lottery ticket sold by a persistent Mexican boy. Meanwhile he is able to latch onto a backbreaking oil-rigging job. Dobbs teams up with Curtin (Tim Holt), another American drifter, after they get cheated out of their hard-earned wages by their shaky boss Pat McCormick (Barton MacLane). The two transients catch up with McCormick and get their money after giving the swindler a well-deserved beating. While staying in El Oso Negro flophouse Dobbs and Curtin meet up with Howard (Walter Huston), a wiry and tooth deficient old man who talks about prospecting for gold. Says Howard Gold in Mexico? Why sure there is. Not ten days from here by rail and pack train there's a mountain waiting' for the right guy to come along . . . Howard though, grizzled but wise, warns the others that gold does make one ravenous, makes one want more and more. Dobbs says, It wouldn't be that way with me. I swear it wouldn't. I'd take only what I set out to get ($5,000), even if there was still a half a million dollars worth lying around waiting' to be picked up. Right after Dobbs is told by the Mexican boy that he holds the wining lottery ticket (200 pesos). Dobbs gives the boy his ten percent cut. Stricken with gold fever, the three then pool their resources to buy provisions and mining materials; Dobbs has provided the larger share. The adventurers then head for the Sierra Madre Mountains to search for gold ore. After hard work they strike it rich. The gold accumulates, but Dobbs cannot adjust to his new wealth as his paranoia begins to manifest itself. He becomes insistent that the three prospectors begin to split their gold three ways. Also, instead of being content with his $25,000 share of the gold, he demands that they continue mining for more. Eventually the total treasure amounts to $100,000. Following the men's campsite from town is an American, Cody (Bruce Bennett), who wants to be part of the small group; he refuses to leave the camp. Weighing their options, the three decide to kill the stranger, but before acting out they are approached by a gang of Mexican bandits, led by Gold Hat (Alfonso Bedoya). Previously Gold Hat was unsuccessful in attempting to hold up the Tampico-Durango train that the prospectors were riding; their bullets helped repel the bandidos. In an exciting shootout at the camp, the bandits sustain additional losses and are again driven off, but Cody is killed. Resuming their trip to Durango, the trio is approached by some local Indians who ask for help in saving the life of a young boy who nearly drowned and remains unconscious. Howard goes along with the Indians; his artificial respiration and wiles indeed revive the boy. Meanwhile Dobbs and Curtin move ahead and plan on meeting with Howard in town. Without Howard's wisdom, the camaraderie breaks down because of Dobbs increasing mistrust he believes that Curtin wants the gold for himself. This happens despite the fact that both Howard and Curtin had helped save Dobb's life on different occasions earlier. Curtin is just trying to hold on while Dobbs, already corrupted, becomes devoured by greed. His self-indulgence turns to madness as he begins to hear noises in the night. Alone as he staggers under the sweltering desert sun, he becomes desperate for a precious drink of water. Feverishly gulping precious liquid at a muddy water hole, Dobbs doesn't notice the ominous shadow of Gold Hat creeping up behind him. Dobbs is truly the tragic performer brought down precisely by his flaws. The ending is truly ironic with gold blowing back into the hills of its origin while we hear the echoing laughter of Howard. Because of his good deed, he will be cared for life by his new Indian friends. Yes, he was certainly the prudent old man, and even more inexplicably, will never have need of the lost gold. Set for life, he generously gives Curtin the proceeds of the sale of the burros, tools, and hides. Maybe Curtin even finds traces of the gold dust around the equipment. Carefully observe that scene near the end, after Hobbs is murdered. Gold Hat and the two survivors of his gang go into town to sell Dobbs' burrows and hides. After someone spots a special brand on one of the animals, a boy notifies the Federales while people in the marketplace stall and surround the thieves. The robbers are quickly rounded up and turned over to the police who summarily execute them on the spot. Note that the entire dialogue is in Spanish, but is so well filmed that we know exactly what is going on. No English need be spoken. John Houston has told his story visually, a high art form.Shooting entirely on location, Huston won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay and Director, while his father Walter won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The feature was nominated for the Oscar for Best Film, but lost out to Hamlet. Huston shows superb character development, especially in the transformation of Dobbs. Before our eyes, Dobbs has changed from a fairly reasonable fellow into a nervous paranoid, and finally into an insanely avaricious madman capable of killing his friend. Note that glint in his eyes while Howard weighs out the gold and again when he lies down next to the campfire determined to stay awake. By the way, that is a very young Robert Blake as the Mexican boy who sells lottery tickets in the beginning.
