In fact, Monsters, Inc. doesn't measure up to any of the last three Disney\/Pixar outings - except maybe in the animation stakes - and even then it isn't a significant leap forward.Sure, the voice acting is great, and there are a couple of funny moments, but the plot is very weak (you'll guess the outcome well before the end of the movie) and the odd bit of great animation isn't going to change that.Kids in the audience were audibly bored of the movie half way through, as was I.Don't expect any jokes to appeal to the older members of the audience, as they did in Toy Story & A Bug's Life, because this one, it seems, is aimed squarely at the kids.I wondered why there was such a frenzied marketing hype surrounding this movie prior to its release, more so than the other Pixar films (which were masterpieces, in my humble opinion).After seeing the movie, I now know why.Rent or buy the other Pixar movies instead!

I rented the DVD and not only did I watch it 3 times but I watched every bit of bonus material on the disc,(highly recommended) including the entire movie over again with the director's commentary.  I am still singing the songs and I can't wait to get my own copy of both the DVD and the CD. I can't explain it, this movie has the ability to have a profound effect on one's life. I find it very inspiring for some reason. I know this sounds ridiculous. On some level, I found myself identifing with Hedwig and even loved her\/him.  By the time you get to the end of the film, you've gone along this incredible journey with Hedwig and somehow grown along with her\/him.  The last song, Midnight Radio, is fabulous! I would put it up there with The Who's See Me Feel Me\/ Listening to You at the end of Tommy, in terms of inspiration. All of the songs are extremely memorable.  The Origin of Love, is a great song and the animation that goes along with it really enhances it.  I loved everything about this movie, especially JCM!  His Hedwig was positively HOT! Dare I say as hot as Tim Curry's Frank? The story is deeply moving and leaves you thinking on many different levels. I only wish I had seen the play. I give this movie 10\/10.  I loved it for so many reasons. I can't wait to see it again. ","genre":null},{"date":"16 February 2002","score":"","review":"  I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!
