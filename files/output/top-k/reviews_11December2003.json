A faerie tale wrought with sarcasm and jaded one-liners.This movie is definitely for the adults in the family. The children should be spared this tired, jaded, and cynical view of the world presented by our hero and his side-kicking ass.While the story is typical, the characters are very well developed and the computer graphics are fantastic. The background textures and skin tones are beautifully realistic and you can tell there were many great talents devoted to this production. The textures of the trees, the characters, and even the facial hair growth of the characters was amazing. Too bad they did not put more into the story to rate this wonderful CGI treatment.Unfortunately, they did not, and it shows. The tritely delivered one liners, the cynical philosophies, and the jaded presentation of love and self esteem should probably not go directly into the minds of America's children. There are enough sources for this negative kind of thinking, in my opinion, and the children do understand what is being said. Never for a moment should you be under the misconception that they are ignorant of the underlying meanings of these adult-based jibes and insults.I love this movie, myself. But, having been a parent, I can safely say that were there small children about, they would not be watching Shrek very often; if at all, until they were old enough to understand that there is a difference between cynicism and sarcasm, and that what is funny is very seldom what is right.All that aside, as an adult, I love this movie. The story, as I have already stated, is a bit recycled, but nevertheless, it is classic. Unfortunately, the fairy tale portion of this production is more of a fairy tail.Though I loved the Donkey. This character (done well by Eddie Murphy) was the comedian, bouncing the one liners off of Shrek's straight-man persona, leaving Eddie Murphy to get all the laughs while Myers's character (working from the murky depths of a horribly muddled accent) must remain in the dark and gloomy mode, as ogres are not known to be very social creatures.The messages here are plain and simple, right from the start love yourself, friends have value, and be true to yourself. Good messages which do come through the sarcastic wit and cynical philosophies, regardless of the strong delivery of these devices, but perhaps a bit watered-down by the time it filters through into children's minds.This is nevertheless, a fun movie with good characters, a classic good vs. evil format, and strong visual effects generated by true artisans in the field of computer graphics interface. I love the inclusion of the Dragon as a non-evil entity. Dragons are far too often the symbol of evil incarnate; an erroneous and unfair convenience generated by the Catholic church of the first millennium. After the Druid priests were converted, their ties with Dragon kind had to be severed in order to fully control the followers of these priests. Thus the link between Dragons and evil was created, established, and used wrongfully in their persecution. I found it philosophically and theologically heartening.But I digress.This is a fun movie, if you can hear the soundtrack over the cheering of the executives behind this production, and can manage to feel uplifted by the love story as it filters past the cold-hearted jibes and cynicism found throughout.If you haven't seen it, do so. It's well worth the 93 minutes invested. Just screen it first, if you plan on allowing your kids to view it. As I said, some of the philosophies are a bit cold and hard to stomach.It rates a 8.1\/10 from...the Fiend .

They (purportedly) re cut it and quietly opened it. To their surprise it was a sizable hit leading to two sequels. I saw it twice when it came out--this movie REALLY delivers the goods to horror fans.It starts off by saying all the events in this movie are true (???). It focuses on 2 warehouse workers played by Thom Mathews and James Karen. It turns out that the movie Night of the Living Dead was based on fact and the dead bodies are stored in the basement in air tight canisters with some gas keeping them asleep. One of the canisters breaks open, the dead guy comes to life and all hell breaks loose. Also, the gas leaks into a graveyard next door and all the dead people come to life...hungry for brains! And how about that group of punk kids hanging out in the graveyard--including Linnea Quigley who spends 99.9% of her screen time nude? Also, unlike Night of... these zombies move FAST and bullets don't hurt them...This movie is strange. It pays homage to old zombie horror flicks and goes of on its own direction. The annoying, constantly swearing bunch of punk kids are only there to be victims--and they inexplicably have an innocent, sweet girl with them--Tina played by Beverly Randolph. The first half is very funny--expertly mixing laughs with some truly scary, gory moments. The laughs disappear completely for the second half. Then on in its a gore show and VERY disturbing. It's moves extremely quick, there are tons of people killed, the number of zombies is incredible, the special effects are great and the blood goes flying. But the change from humor to horror is jarring and some of the stuff at the end is VERY disturbing (Karens and Mathews' slow deaths are very upsetting and painful to watch and hear). This movie is also helped by good acting. The punk kids are by the numbers (except for Randolph who is kind of fun), but Mathews is good and Karen and Gulager are hilarious in their respective roles. They all play it reasonably straight and it helps.Gory, scary, funny--a definite must-see for horror fans. This film deserves more recognition than it's gotten.Best line I think things are getting a little out of hand.

Although the basic set is a high school, this movie appeals to all ages because the main theme is that cliques exist in every aspect of human life business, sports, art, science etc,etc.Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) is the rookie in her school's most powerful clique. Her 3 friends are all called Heather. They are snobbish and dislikeable. Heather Chandler (Kim Walker) is the leader and runs the school. Veronica is the newest member and she has doubts about her new lifestyle and the attitude she has to adopt. She has traces of guilt for abandoning her old best friend Betty Finn (Renee Estevez), a nerdy , geeky, sweet girl with glasses who (surprise!!) is still a virgin! Meanwhile a new student called Jason Dean (Christian Slater) comes to town. J.D. has changed about 5 schools in 3 different states because he can't fit in anywhere and as he says...the only difference in these schools was the combination in my locker. J.D. and Veronica soon hit the sheets. J.D. is a rebel and convinces Veronica to acknowledge her hate for her friends. After a fight with Heather Chandler, Veronica and J.D. set a prank for her but Heather accidentally ends up dead. The couple manages to cover it up as a suicide and gets away. But this is only the beginning for a chain of unusual and surrealistic events which lead to an explosive finale!! Slater and Ryder give arguably the best performances of their careers and this helps. Ryder has a sweet face which is perfect. She is convincing as the disorientated teenager who is searching for her identity and although she has aristocratic looks she finds it hard to fit in with the snobbish manners her friends impose. Slater was also perfect playing his psychotic character with the proper innocence to make him look normal enough. The social subjects the film deals with are tremendous. First of all everyone of us has faced cliques in our schools and not necessarily snobbish rich girls. There are always teams of people who form a mafia-like group, are annoying to the bone, do nothing more than serve and protect their own interests and are on a constant conflict to pull the others down. They are so irritating and antipathetic that all of us have fantasies and dreams of them dying (sometimes preferably by our very own bare hands, namely STRANGLING them). Of course these people don't even remotely like each other but keep coiled up for their common interest. Shannen Doherty (playing an other member of the trio) at Heather's funeral thinks Dear God, I had prayed for Heather to die many times, and although I know it was wrong, I kept doing it. And now that finally Heather is dead I know that...you understood...Pray Jesus! Alleluia!!!  This is a prime example of how rotten these cliques are. After Heather is buried Heather Duke (Doherty) pursues her chief status and becomes even bitchier!!Veronica is an average girl which confronts the psychological dilemmas all of us have. What is the cost of being acceptable in your social environment? What does it take to be popular? Is it worth it when you end up not liking yourself and have to stick with friends you dislike? Actually the allegory is even deeper. Many times we don't show our real face to our friends and have to adopt another attitude. We never want to show our compassionate and sensitive side so our friends don't find us weak. We sometimes don't want to confide our unhappiness in order not to expose our vulnerable traits .This bold satire dares to depict with real power and not pretentious provocation what happens when a teenager's life and behavior is treated with silly Freudian terms and is put under the microscope instead of giving him \/ her what is really necessary; self-esteem and self acceptance.The movie is filled with tragic yet simultaneously hilarious scenes (like the funerals) or lines. One example is after Heather's suicide. The teachers council in her school tries to psychoanalyze her and the most interesting element they find in her suicide note (forged by Veronica) is the word myriads. She failed to write it in a recent dictation test therefore this led her to self-destruction! In one class the teacher asks from her fellow mates to express their feelings over this sad departure. One guy easily says I used to date Heather very briefly once. She left me because she said I was boring. But now...I know it wasn't my fault ...She just wasn't happy from her life. How convenient! Not only can a fact can be interpreted with various silly ways from various silly persons, but the tragic demise of a young individual made another one esteem himself more and overcome his rejection!! There are many other examples but I don't want to give away more spoilers. I will have to warn you that the last 15 minutes are quite lame and disappointing. The plot breaks new limits of over-the-top campiness and we end up with an unnecessary duel scene. It doesn't matter. Heathers is a masterpiece that can be viewed over and over. If you like you may fast forward the last 15 minutes and go to the final ironic line of Veronica to Heather Duke. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

Unfairly chastised by the press on release, and too easy to tar as a weak link in De Palma's ouevre, BOTV is better than Wall Street, Working Girl et al. and is still very relevant.This is an OTT opera where every character is a cynic trying to work an angle, and every action (in a complex story about contacts, smear campaigns, politics and pawns) has an obvious and (most of the time) greedy motivation. BOTV also confronts sex, racism and class clashes with a frankness that most Hollywood movies run a mile from - it is suprisingly frank in it's depiction of these (The exception being that the New York judge had to be, of course, black Morgan Freeman.  This is something dramatists do to make some of their social opinions seem less controversial since they are being spouted by a man of colour in a white forum.)On par with His Girl Friday and The Sweet Smell of Success, and possessing an oddball universe Preston Sturges would've been proud of creating, this film is all the more powerful when you actually live in a world kind of like this (and I meet these kinds of people all the time - this is REAL!).PS - Half an hour was lopped off by the studio after disasterous preview screenings.  This movie deserves a DVD director's cut release.

His success is not always deserved - movies like Weird Science, Curly Sue and The Great Outdoors are definitely sub par - but Planes, Trains & Automobiles has enough funny moments and performances to make it work. It's not a masterpiece of sophisticated wit, but its heart is in the right place. New York City businessman Neal Page (Steve Martin) wants to get home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. However, a snowstorm results in his flight being diverted to Wichita. To add to his woes, he is saddled with an overbearing travelling companion in the shape of Del Griffith (John Candy). In a race against time, the mismatched pair attempt to complete the journey and have various madcap adventures along the way. Comedy highlights include Martin's remarkable four-lettered outburst at a rental car receptionist (frequently toned down for TV, but hilarious in its uncut form), and a terrific scene in which Martin and Candy drive on the wrong side of the highway and can't figure out why other road users are gesticulating at them in sheer panic. The film nearly goes awry at the end with a few sentimental plot twists and sickly sweet scenes, but for the most part it manages to remain on the right side of sentimentality.
