About 5 months ago I was flipping through the channels and saw Titanic was on. It was already in the last hour and a half where the ship was sinking, so I didn't really pay attention when I watched it (I was on the computer at the same time). The next day I turned it on when it was being re-ran, only to find it shortly in the same sinking scene.About a month ago, I was looking through the TV guide and saw that it was going to be on TV. When it came on, I sat and watched it the entire thing. When it was on again the next day, I watched again, left awestruck. How incredibly glad I am that I finally did watch it. Watching Titanic for me isn't just to see a ship sink. It's a way to escape reality, and be taken back to 1912. Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson) and Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater) have chemistry unlike anyone i've ever seen, no lie. Jack and Rose may just be Star Crossed Lovers to some. I however, see them as more. Watching Leo and Kate act makes me forget where I am, what i'm doing, and not notice anyone around me. They're the reason i'm drawn to the movie. They're the reason why Titanic is what it is today, 10 years later.Rose is a 1st class girl being taken over to America to marry Cal Hockley. But, she is also upset with her life and wants to break free of feeling like a slave, and accomplish her own dreams. 3rd class Jack Dawson sketches people and wanders around on the streets, taking life as it comes at him. After Jack convinces Rose not to jump off the back of Titanic, they get closer and closer throughout the movie and fall in love. As you watch the 2 fall in love, it makes me want to jump in the screen, and actually be on Titanic despite it's fate. It makes me want to experience the chaos of a sinking ship or the touch of the icy water.Titanic makes me reflect on how I want to live my life; Of how I want to travel, try new things, meet people like Jack Dawson, and love someone how he and Rose did, even if it is for a brief period of time. I have seen many great movies in my life, but Titanic fits into its own category unlike the others.

Unfortunately there are a couple things that bothered me.First problem I have is with the language. I think this movie would still have gotten their message across if they toned down their use of the F-word. I don't have a problem with it being used sparingly and I can understand it fits a character like Will, but when you have a therapist\/professor constantly using it, that's really going overboard. Unfortunately, that's the one thing I remember the most about GWH.Second, the movie is boring and fairly predictable. They do develop characters fairly well, but the movie moves along very slowly. And worse, you could see the ending from a mile away. There is little suspense throughout. How Will goes from a stubborn, hopeless kid to one that's willing to change his life around is sort of lame. He stumbles upon two of his mentors bickering, shows remorse, gets a tongue lashing from one of his mentors (Maguire), gives in, and all of a sudden he's a changed man.

There is nothing in this jaunra before or after this film that can beat this film , not even Cameron's fine sequel .This film might be getting on to nearly 30 years old but it still looks great . From the first moment in this film where the computer logs on a starts up the movie grips you and does'nt let go . Ridly Scott's vision of a deep space mining ship is truly amazing and still looks plausible today .Scott's masterfull us of lighting and narrow corridors created a situation so intense and chilling that when I first saw this film 20 year's ago it was the best movie experience I think I ever had . You really get a feel for the characters in their dire situation that director's today seem to overlook in favour of gore and special effect's . You really get a feel of how helpless man is if he were to come up against such a creature .And boy what a creature . I don't think the alien has been surpassed in movie history by a more realistic or terrifying creature . Giger broke the mold when he dreamt this one up . The alien in this movie has a more humanoid look about it than any of the sequels which I think give's it a more psychologically menacing aspect to it . It's Scott's sparing use of the creature due to him not having the budget or huge animatronics team behind him Cameron did that works so well leaving the imagination of the cinema goer to run wild . The film builds gradually to a crescendo of and ending with great twist's along the way . The casting for the film was perfect and great array of talent on show scott's went for unknowns with ability rather than the established star root . This worked well as it reinforced the impression ordinary people in an extraordinary situation it probably also cut down on cost .This lead's us to be introduced to the very talented Sigourny Weaver who play's the Riply character to perfection and made her an icon in movie history . In the age of CGI and high wire's some younger viewers may find it all a little dated but for me when the alien became computerised it lost it's magic and realism and you just did'nt find it scary anymore . So if you have'nt seen it yet your missing a real treat .

Sadly it comes off as if he were cut out from another film and pasted into this farce. Seeing it in the theater back in 1994, I was embarrassed for everyone involved except for Branagh, who can share the blame with the producers in making this thing. Grown adults were pointing at the screen and laughing, and not just when John Cleese showed up. His scene was the first unintentionally funny one - Cleese's dour character was straight out of about twenty Python sketches. But the birth scene, dripping not just with melted jello but with shallow, pointless undercurrents of mother and child and homo-eroticism, was made more ridiculous with comically timed editing. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie. You've got to wonder what people are thinking sometimes when making a horror film - did Branagh, or whoever had final cut of this thing, get chills up their spine at any point? Could they feel anything other than blind, empty sensation? Yeah! That does something! Yeah, it makes the movie really suck. This movie is a lot of things, mostly a really good lesson in really bad film-making, but it is not scary, nor does it carry any of the message or subtext of Shelly's book. One would like to think that Branagh approached this as an assignment with a big paycheck, which could cut him off from some of the blame, but from his blustery, overstuffed interviews at the time, he took it, and himself, very, very, very, very seriously, and I'm sure he thought he was adding something profound to the great cannon of the Frankenstein legend. What a pompous fraud.

You knew when you heard the overture with the haunting Ilea's Theme that something special was about to happen, and then suddenly, the Jerry Goldsmith Fanfare and Theme breaks onto the Screen. I remember sitting and watching this film by myself the night before it opened to the public (I was a movie projectionist at the time) and just broke into tears, the emotion of having these beloved characters back in action. Added to that the film was helmed by one of the great directors of all time Robert Wise, who had given the world such great films as The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Haunting among so many others. A lot of people ran this film down because we were not killing off the bad aliens or some such, but that had never been the intention of Gene Roddenberry, who's hopes was that Star Trek would help people to see that we could have a better world. WHile some people claim that the film was too slow, or too boring, I look at it like this. Without this film, we might never have had four more Star Trek Series and the other movies.

The movie really shows how lonely and abandoned someone can be that they have to dream up a family life of their own. Gary Cole plays the boss. He is not likable and a bit too bossy. At one point, Cole tries to bar Williams' from returning to the store after being fired. There was no cause for this at this point. Williams had done nothing yet.

I dare one to show me any film much better than Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Throne Of Blood, Ran, Dreams or Red Beard just to name a small number of his dozen or so true masterpieces of cinema.Back on topic to my review of Seven Samurai.Seven Samurai is something that everyone can relate to and deals with general topics like trying to help your fellow man when he's down.The film may be 3 and a 1\/2 hours in length but it flows with such a pace that you are never left bored even for a moment and when it's all done with you don't think of how long you just sit for, but of how great of a film you just sit through.This is helped by how it blends in some of the most true emotional moments you'll ever see along with some very intense (especially for it's time) battle scenes as the Samurai and the Bandits are battling it out in the climax.You feel each moment and there are quite a few that bring you to the screen like a magnet as well as many that almost bring one to tears thanks to some of the best actors that Japan can offer and the best possible performances that anyone could possibly expect from each, which most notably includes the legendary Toshiro Mifune (whom Kurosawa often worked with) as Kikuchiyo.The script is superb and manages to not be complicated but yet avoid the disaster of becoming too plain or mundane. The acting is some of the finest that one will ever witness. The film is beautifully shot. The action is done as it should be and the emotion feels real and is truly there.

A tribute to the previous masters, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, who died within a mere 3 years before this brutal masterpiece.Eastwood stars as William Munny a retired gunslinger with a guilt-filled past. He lives alone with his two children and grave of his young wife outside. One day a young cowboy, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), comes in need of his service to hunt down some men who cut up a whore. William reluctantly accepts and with the help of Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) they work together to track down the criminals. Meanwhile, the sheriff of the town, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is also looking for them. This then leads to a bloody showdown climax, welcoming back a sort of 'Man With No Name' character to the genre.William Munny is a cold-blooded killer. The Schofield Kid wants to be one. But, all the murders and sins Munny used to commit has affected him in an extraordinary way. He takes no hesitation in killing. In the climax he just walks past a man he shot who didn't die and shoots him dead. It may sound like nothing now, but he just took a life for no apparent reason. When the Kid kills his first man, of which deserved it, he hesitates. This is The Kid who is so eager to kill people as he thinks it will make him a man. But after the assassination, he breaks down. He realized what he had done. He had wiped another man of the earth. And Munny does it with ease. So does Little Bill. He is a violent and brutal cop who uses torture to get what he wants from the prisoners. Logan also finds it hard to take lives.The film studies on how much a life is worth. Sometimes it is worthless (see Tarantino or Scorsese films) and sometimes it is a major feature. Usually a film only does one. Unforgiven does both. A life isn't worth the same amount to each person. When a life is taken, it is the killer who decides how much it is worth by how much it affects him. Whether he just lets it slide (Munny and Little Bill) or kills someone and calls it a day (Kid and Logan), because they can't bring themselves to forgetting it. This is the most thought-provoking thing for me personally, ever.Unforgiven in my opinion is the greatest western. Actually, its the greatest film of all-time. It shows how violent it was back then, and the fact everybody was beaten. It is more realistic than any of Leone's 'Man With No Name' films (though I will admit they were set in a sort of fantasy land). But, Munny is not proud of his violent nature. He blames it on alcohol; which his wife persuaded him to quit to explain why he also gave up being a murderer. The film shows the cowboys as they really are, either cowards or killers. The choice of word 'coward' is to say that they should be killers, as that is apparently what a man is (an exaggeration) as most westerns glorify violence, but the men can't handle it.Clint Eastwood did an amazing job as William Munny. He showed how he regretted his past very well by admitting to it in a shameful way; like when asked if he killed women and children he replied I've killed just about anything that walked or crawled at one time or another, and I'm here to kill you&#x85;. He even admits that he will meet Little Bill in Hell. Gene Hackman delivers one of the greatest performances of the decade, the tension he makes is incredible. Woolvett and Freeman remain in solid above average performances throughout.The script, written by David Webb Peoples, buzzed around Hollywood for nearly 20 years, even being rejected by some of the cast, before Eastwood picked it up. Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar for best direction. The plot flowed fluently with some surprises and memorable lines. An instant classic. The cinematography is much different that of 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' or the others westerns Eastwood appeared in. It is a much cleaner and crisp view, yet also being extremely raw.

Because at first, it seemed like the director was trying to make African Americans seem like drug addicts, troublemakers, and no-good citizens. But as the film evolved, so did my opinions on it and I realized it wasn't a racist movie at all. It wasn't even trying to make French people look hostile or dangerous. Of course, it doesn't symbolize anything, either, but it's still not doing any harm to anybody.The action of The French Connection is breathtaking. The film features what I consider the greatest car chase scene ever as Hackman trails after an assassin hired to take him down. There are also a few gunfights and shootouts throughout the movie, all of which are powerful and amazing. The ending was a bit of a surprise to me and maybe for some people, a bit unsatisfying, but it worked out for the kind of movie that The French Connection is.

Everyone in it is a top-notch actor, because they all seem to be real cheerleaders. The one flaw, or really just something I didn't like, was the racist attitude of the black girls and the way the end of the movie pandered to that - meaning (Possible spoiler coming up) as soon as you find out that the black squad can't afford to go to the finals, I said to myself, Uh-oh, they're not only going to go..... they're going to win. The poor black people routine I've seen in so many TV shows has apparently creeped into movies. As far as their routines went, I honestly think that the Rancho Carne squad WAS just as good or better, so how come, just because they're black, the inner city squad wins? I guess Hollyweird wants to make sure that black people are never disappointed! BS!!!!Still, as I said, the acting is first rate all around, and it's a very enjoyable film.
