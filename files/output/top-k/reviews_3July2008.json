You have romance, suspense and lots of jokes (especially with bartok the bat)! All a child can wish for, but the adults will also be entertained!The songs are sweet (I like journey to the past - great song) and the singers are amazing (the actor Kelsey Grammar, who gives voice to vladimir, sings himself and he has an amazing voice). Meg Ryan and John Cusack made a good job with the main characters' voices. But the actor that deserves a standing ovation with his work in this movie is hank azaria (who gives voice to apu in simpsons, for example), he plays bartok, who is the reason for most of the laughs in this movie. The animation is not bad, but the movie is from 1997, so... Still, there are a few parts where the characters are not well draw, nothing terrible tough.If you want to have a nice time watching an animated classic, this is a must see.

A satire on themedia and the American way of life in the 80's during the Regan era. The violence in this film is so over the top it can hardly be taken serious.

The city is in a state lawlessness as most of the cops are on strike as OCP cut their pay, OCP President (Dan O'Herlihy) watches on as his plan to foreclose on the current administration is working which will let OCP take complete control of Detroit. Out on the street a new addictive drug called Nuke is flooding the city, crime & violence follows it. Robocop & the few remaining cops have their hands full. Meanwhile evil scientist Dr. Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer) has set about creating a successor to Robocop, another cyborg crime prevention unit to protect & serve. However her real motives aren't as noble as they first seem...Directed by Irvin Kershner this sequel to the popular Robocop (1987) was unfairly trashed on it's initial release & has a pretty bad reputation but it's a film that I love & while not quite as good as the original in my opinion it's still a terrific film that is probably more fun to watch than it's predecessor. The script credited to Frank Miller was apparently heavily rewritten & maybe that's why the story is a little choppy at times, for instance the character's are good but what was the comedy relief Mayor all about? Robocop's partner Lewis is relegated to standing around for the majority of the film & only seems there to provide some continuity to the original. Why was the subplot about Murphy's wife so short & dropped as soon as it was brought up? That would have given Robocop 2 a human edge. However the biggest single problem with Robocop 2 I have is why would anyone put the brain of a sadistic killer & drug baron into a heavily armed cyborg? It just doesn't make any sort of sense, what was Dr. Faxx's reasons behind it? It was supposed to be a police unit, right? Why get it addicted to Nuke as well? If you don't think about it too much it probably won't bother you. Now the good stuff, it moves along at a great pace with lots of action & I just love the huge over-the-top Robocop vs. Robocop 2 fight at the end, any serious sci-fi geek will lap it up. While the pitch black biting satire of the original isn't quite here there are still some nice moments including OCP trying to take control of Detroit & use it to make a profit, some funny commercial breaks (the one with the guy who commits suicide is funny) & the sequence where Robocop is reprogrammed to be good & none violent by upper class twits who have never lived in the real world is hilarious. I just think there is so much here to enjoy, plenty of gory violent action, lots of special effects, cool robots, car chases, explosions & some neat action scenes. What's not to like?I really like the look of Robocop 2 & I liked the special effects. I think Robocop 2 was one of the last big budget theatrically released films to predominantly use stop-motion animation for the majority of the effects, over the next couple of years with the likes of Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) & Jurassic Park (1993) in particular stop-motion died out virtually overnight & was replaced by CGI. I personally love stop-motion animation, it gives you the sense that there is actually something three dimensional there & while it can sometimes look a little jerky I seriously doubt if Robocop 2 was CGI it would look significantly any better. The Robocop vs. Robocop 2 fight at the end is just outrageous, from elevator shafts to the top of 100 storey buildings the makers have fun & in turn we, the audience, have fun. Well, I did anyway. Robocop 2 is also a very violent & pretty gory film, from snipers getting shot through their eye to dozens of people getting gorily riddled with bullets, there's a torture scene as someone is sliced open, there's a very gory brain removal sequence as there is a human brain in a tank & the person it used to belong to's hollowed out decapitated head, necks are violently broken, kids are shot & a guy has his eye poked out by a stiletto heel.Technically the film is good with some great special effects in my opinion although some may find them a bit dated.

Also, why does Lewis disappear and reappear randomly? Where is RoboCop for most of the third act?). Some of these flaws have to do with bad editing choices by the studio or so I hear.

It's bigger, faster and louder. Everything you've loved about the original is here, too, only supersized the news snippets (albeit less subtle this time around), the evil robotic opponent and the violence - only this time it's more comical. Whereas the original was a dark satire this one pretty much is a deliberate parody of itself. The whole tone of the movie is much lighter. Even RoboCop himself has gotten a light blue shade on his armor as opposed to the strict gray of part 1. It all adds up to a much lighter feel, which is one of the reasons why many fans of the original unjustly dismiss this sequel.Sure, RoboCop 2 is trashy and silly and some plot points and developments are just plain bad (like having a kid criminal in the story - really when has that ever been a good idea? Also, why does Lewis disappear and reappear randomly? Where is RoboCop for most of the third act?). Some of these flaws have to do with bad editing choices by the studio or so I hear. It would be nice to see a director's cut someday.Anyway, all in all for a RoboCop-sequel this one is pretty close to everything a fan could wish for. The original pretty much told the whole story of RoboCop's creation and this picks up some of the questions that were left open Murphy finally meets his wife again and he also has to deal with his inner conflict of being a machine and a man at the same time. OCP at the same time continue their corrupt business. The makers of this one did a good job exploring the rules set up by the first part, turning the sequel into an entertaining and fun 90 minutes. It didn't surprise me one bit when I just found out that Frank Miller - THE Frank Miller is responsible for the screenplay of RoboCop 2 since the movie very much plays out like a comic book adaptation. Robo gets destroyed, humiliated by kids - which surprisingly doesn't kill the character as one would assume - and he gets to fight his evil brother Cain (what a great broad hint that name is). The final confrontation is really great to watch and they did a hell of a job with the F\/X there.In the end, RoboCop 2 doesn't hold a candle against its predecessor, but I really don't think a sequel to that movie could have been made any better.

I'm not sure if I would ever read it, but it definitely wouldn't be boring. Neither is the movie; if anything, Polanski goes to such dark depths here that it's almost neglectful not to say that there's something old-fashioned stirring in the narrative. A British couple on their way via cruise to India run into a wheelchair bound would-be writer and his wife, who is a knock-out, and the husband hears from the now crippled man the story of his relationship. There's something wholesome that is ripped apart in the story here, and it's at its core a tale of passionate love and desire that becomes like a mind-game.Polanski's flashback narrative works well, and despite some corny bits early on in Oscar's (Peter Cotoye) tale of Mimi (Emmanuele Signer), this is contrasted with scenes that sizzle with great sexuality, the likes of which only so-much seen in 90s cinema. Then it transitions into the 'naughtier' chapter, then going into the section that's most captivating the 'can't-live-with-em-can't-live-without-em' logic of their relationship, and how it then relates to Hugh Grant's Nigel and his flawed marriage to Fiona (Thomas). Will he sleep with Mimi? This question would be the shallow one; Polanski's achievement here is expressing a savage bond that is like a slow-working poison, ready to affect anyone that grows closer to their very human tragedy. Sometimes seeing their past is disturbing, other times even darkly funny. But it's pure, unadulterated Polanski through and through.And special note should be given to Coyote here's a character actor everybody sees from time to time, be it ET or Sphere or Femme Fatale, and this time he's put to a test that any actor would love. He goes through every emotion, sometimes put on and sometimes very raw and wretched bit from his soul, and it's an imperfect but powerful tour-de-force. Everyone else, Grant, Seigner, Thomas, are put in roles that their fit well into (Grant especially as an up-tight yuppie sexually awakened\/confused), but Polanski still uses them wisely from scene to scene. His wife, Seigner, is also sometimes a revelation in a role that should- and is- a possible one-note trap. There's complexity that she finds in her needy-cum-sociopathic mindset, and is sexy as all hell. It's overall and underrated work of minor genius, and may please those looking for a crazy tale of love and revenge.

When he is himself targeted he quickly figures out that he cannot trust anyone and starts trying to piece it all together to find a way out from under.It was by chance that I ended up watching this film and I wasn't sure what it was going to be about or what to expect from it. Unmistakably from the 1970's the film cuts to the chase pretty quickly with a cold-hearted massacre of non-threatening people which leaves the main character on the run. It is a tough opening but sets the stakes high for the remainder of the film. And this does help because after this it is not as urgent and desperate as I would have liked and at times it seems to be doing its best to suck the tension out of it (specifically some of the scenes shared with Dunaway). Mostly though it does keep enough about it to hold the viewer with Turner and I did enjoy the flow even if I didn't totally get it the whole way through.Redford cuts a strong leading man &#150; not totally convincing as a bookish type by any means but he does do the job here if you push that out of your mind. Dunaway I didn't think worked that well as a part of the lasting narrative but her performance is fine. Von Sydow is a dark figure and his calm silence just makes his character more imposing on the story. Support from Robertson and others in key CIA roles help drive the main story alone.

It could have done with more of a kick in the final third and at times it lacks the feel of danger, urgency and desperation that it has in its strongest moments but it is still a good film and worth seeing if you're in the mood for an old-school conspiracy thriller.

It may be my favourite movie of all time and for good reason because it is stone cold brilliant in every way and deserved everything from awards to box office glory that it received. Previously I have stated that JFK is my favourite film and in a complete league of it's own and now I state that Forrest Gump belongs in that category of elite films. The story is infamous and brilliant and touching and disturbing and covers every aspect of genre you can think of. The cast is absolutely brilliant. The direction is stunning and the special effects are unlike anything you will ever see. Director Robert Zemeckis is a brilliant director and has directed his way through many of my personal all time favourites including the Back To The Future Trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and What Lies Beneath. The thing about his story telling is that it's completely unique, there is something completely and utterly different about his films and Forrest Gump is truly the pinnacle of that talent. He seems to know his cast and surrounds himself with the best performances possible.Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor, there is no doubt about it. But he gives the absolute performance of his career as Forrest Gump, a man who is not quite as smart as the average person and yet pure of heart and indeed in many ways smarter than all of us. Hanks makes this character his own, no one could ever play Gump. His tone and body language and everything just embodies the character and it is one of the best performances in film history. Robin Wright Penn plays Forrest's true love and the romance is far beyond just your average romance. Penn is good although I'm not sure she lives up to the rest of the cast. She does do a great job at being versatile and playing her character through the decades and through the different situations in history from Southern girl to Hippie to mother. The chemistry between her and Hanks is undeniable mostly because of the story that makes their love so important to Gump. Gary Sinise is undeniably amazing in his role as Lt Dan Taylor. I don't know who got the Academy Award that year in the category he was nominated for but he was robbed!! His performance is ground breaking and creates one of the best characters in film history. Him and Hanks are just incredible together. Mykelti Williamson, in a bit of a smaller role, is also brilliant as Bubba, Forrest's best good friend in the army. His character is short lived but pivotal and he does an amazing job. I wish I could cover the rest of this amazing cast which includes Sally Field in an amazing role as Forrest's mama.

Beautiful romance, action, drama, laughing, crying, life and death, I mean there isn't anything this movie doesn't give you. It's just this brilliant epic journey that just makes you appreciate life and tells history from a completely different perspective. I've seen this film many, many times and yet for the last half hour of the movie I sat there and watched it bawling my eyes out. It isn't many movies that ever make me cry and it is even less that a movie I have seen so many times can do that. If you haven't seen Forrest Gump you're missing out on a film experience unlike any other and an absolute classic the minute it was released.

I don't know who got the Academy Award that year in the category he was nominated for but he was robbed!! His performance is ground breaking and creates one of the best characters in film history. Him and Hanks are just incredible together. Mykelti Williamson, in a bit of a smaller role, is also brilliant as Bubba, Forrest's best good friend in the army. His character is short lived but pivotal and he does an amazing job. I wish I could cover the rest of this amazing cast which includes Sally Field in an amazing role as Forrest's mama. This cast is truly one of the best ever period.What else can I say about Forrest Gump? Beautiful romance, action, drama, laughing, crying, life and death, I mean there isn't anything this movie doesn't give you. It's just this brilliant epic journey that just makes you appreciate life and tells history from a completely different perspective. I've seen this film many, many times and yet for the last half hour of the movie I sat there and watched it bawling my eyes out. It isn't many movies that ever make me cry and it is even less that a movie I have seen so many times can do that. If you haven't seen Forrest Gump you're missing out on a film experience unlike any other and an absolute classic the minute it was released. I understand they are looking at turning the second novel, a sequel, into a film and because I want to revisit these characters I would love a chance to see it but I don't think it could ever live up to this original classic and if the entire original cast including director Robert Zemeckis won't do it...DON'T DO IT...see this movie now or again. 10+\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"3 July 2008","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" An intriguing, paradoxical and dreamlike movie about...well, that's the question.

Made in 1995, Toy Story was a marking point in movie history not only for its computer animation, but also having a timeless story full of witty characters and adventures.Toy Story is set in a suburban like neighborhood following an ensemble group of toys. Toys have human like abilities and personalities, but are forced to hide them from their human companions for the sake of being a toy. The main group of toys include a cowboy action figure, a piggy bank, a plastic dinosaur, a Mr. Potato Head as well as many more, all of whom live under their owner, Andy. The movie opens with Andy's birthday, which means receiving new toys to accompany old ones. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, is Andy's favorite action figure and also the group's leader. Woody and his fellow toy friends are somewhat threatened but also enthralled by this event. After a short time of announcing what Andy received, the toys are relieved to find that Andy did not receive any new toys. They were in for a surprise. Little did they know that there was a surprise toy on Andy's bed. It was the newest and coolest toy on the market, Buzz Light-year, a space orientated action figure voiced by Tim Allen who turns out to be Andy's next favorite toy. The strange thing about Buzz is that he believes that he is an actual space alien fighter. The toys try to convince Buzz that he is a mere toy only to be favored by Andy. Since Buzz believes he is actually a space fighter this leads into leaving the house and begin his journey to outer space. This ultimately pursues Woody to go and save his rival while getting tied up in a wacky adventure.There is a reason why this film acquired nineteen awards and ten nominations. Both adults and children will be entertained with the concept of living toys. The plot of the movie is really where it shines. There isn't one point in Toy Story where the plot gets boring or dragged out. People at Disney's Pixar developed the characters so well that it makes you understand how characters behave. Also, with a movie with so many diverse characters the audience is bound to find someone relate to. The only downside about seeing this movie is its length. It is around eighty minutes but it seems like the movie is about two hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't a full price movie because it is absolutely worth your time. Toy Story is definitely recommended to all families and especially kids. As for everyone else as an audience, I would recommend the movie if you would like to revisit your child hood or if you just want to see a beautifully animated movie. Whoever the audience may be, Toy Story will put a smile on your face.Toy Story is a classic beyond all means. It has stunning visuals, a crazy plot, deep character development, and most importantly it brings people back to a time when nothing mattered except toys. The most inspiring aspect of the movie is the moral of friendship. It really teaches people that they can't get anywhere in life without companionship. Toy Story also really captured the thought of what if toys were alive and executed it in a witty way. This movie will definitely be playing on family TV screens till Infinity and Beyond!

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"3 July 2008","score":"","review":" Disney and Pixar team up to create Disney's first full-length computer animated cinematic masterpiece, Toy story. Made in 1995, Toy Story was a marking point in movie history not only for its computer animation, but also having a timeless story full of witty characters and adventures.Toy Story is set in a suburban like neighborhood following an ensemble group of toys. Toys have human like abilities and personalities, but are forced to hide them from their human companions for the sake of being a toy. The main group of toys include a cowboy action figure, a piggy bank, a plastic dinosaur, a Mr. Potato Head as well as many more, all of whom live under their owner, Andy. The movie opens with Andy's birthday, which means receiving new toys to accompany old ones. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, is Andy's favorite action figure and also the group's leader. Woody and his fellow toy friends are somewhat threatened but also enthralled by this event. After a short time of announcing what Andy received, the toys are relieved to find that Andy did not receive any new toys. They were in for a surprise. Little did they know that there was a surprise toy on Andy's bed. It was the newest and coolest toy on the market, Buzz Light-year, a space orientated action figure voiced by Tim Allen who turns out to be Andy's next favorite toy. The strange thing about Buzz is that he believes that he is an actual space alien fighter. The toys try to convince Buzz that he is a mere toy only to be favored by Andy. Since Buzz believes he is actually a space fighter this leads into leaving the house and begin his journey to outer space. This ultimately pursues Woody to go and save his rival while getting tied up in a wacky adventure.There is a reason why this film acquired nineteen awards and ten nominations.

This is really funny, a send-up of every crime movie you've ever seen, something about a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth during her visit to Los Angeles. It borrows from every place. There's a scene lifted directly from Don Siegel's Telefon. Some of the first-person narration quotes Raymond Chandler Her hair was the color of gold in old paintings. Most of the jokes are original, though, and half loony. Some don't work -- a car pulls into a parking space at the docks and knocks a screaming man into the water. Others are so outlandish as to be almost surreal.In the opening scene, Detective Nordberg (a depressing but still effective O. J. Simpson) creeps up, gun drawn, to a door behind which a dozen hoodlums are negotiating the purchase of a horde of dope. He takes a deep breath and kicks against the door. The door doesn't swing open. Instead, Simpson's foot crashes through the panel and he must extract it and fiddle with the knob. By the time he gets the door opens and announces that everyone is under arrest, the gang has their own guns loaded, cocked, and aimed at him. They shoot him six times. Instead of slumping to the deck, he caroms around the walls, shouting in pain when he bunks his head against some pipes, when he puts his hand on a red hot wood stove, when he leans against a wall of fresh paint, when a window slams down on his hand, when he steps into a bear trap, and so on.Simpson winds up in the hospital. While preparing to visit him, Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielson) asks how he's doing. Nielson's boss, George Kennedy, tells him solemnly, The doctors say he has a 50\/50 chance of living, though there's only a ten percent chance of that. In other words, there is a ten percent chance that Simpson has a fifty percent chance of living. To put it more simply, that's 1\/20 or p = .05. I'd be happy to clarify this further by using base-8 math but I don't know how.The doctors tending Simpson tell his wife, We think we can save your husband's arm. Where would you like it sent? I don't think I want to go any farther with the plot because it's really insignificant, just a frame to hang a lot of jokes on. And I don't want to give any more of the jokes away.Well, one more.

Nielson makes a harrowing escape across the facade of a tall building, hanging on to decorative human figures as he goes, breaking off the penis of one of the male figures, before he crashes through a window and into the bedroom of a half-dressed shrieking woman, and dizzily brandishes the broken-off tool.

It's impossible for me to watch this film without remembering my own time working such jobs. Sure, one or two scenes in the film are massively exaggerated, but even they have some basis in reality (far too often men will buy porn and sneak off to the toilet). I've encountered many fans of this film, some I would never be proud to count as fellow fans and others who can relate to the film on a very real level. Jay and Silent Bob may just generally be slackers and, let's be honest, losers, but the other main characters are all real people, authentic, 100% real people, not some stupid Hollywood copy, just guys like myself at one point in my life (and at the moment, to a degree). The conversations are authentic- long, rambling, often bizarre. The customers are portrayed not doing what they're actually doing but doing what they appear to be doing to us working these jobs- the egg and milk people may be exaggerations, but that's really how one tends to see these people when you're working such jobs. One need not exaggerate video store customers, though, they really are that bad.Clerks is not a well-directed film at all. At the time they were shooting the cast and crew really did not believe that the movie would even be released, and even Smith's later, more refined efforts as director show a minimum level of competence. With Clerks Smith is really directing at the level one expects from a first year film major who is still studying mainly theory (not that Smith was all that much older than that when he made the film, and he had no more than a month or two training at a film school), but the script is so strong here that one doesn't really feel the need for the film to be sophisticated on a visual level. If it was it may very well have been one of the best films ever made, but as it stands it is a completely average film on a technical level but also hands down one of the best comedy scripts anyone's ever written. I've also decided that the low budget look and feel lends the film even further authenticity and realism, as a glossy look might have made the film feel significantly different (see the $5 million dollar Clerks II for proof of this).I don't know what to say about Clerks except that its script is absolute genius- authentic, hilarious, real, and featuring well-drawn, ultra-realistic characters I can really relate to. I honestly don't think the script is flawed, not for a second. Smith's work here as director, though, is not especially good. This would be a perfect stage play, as a movie I can't quite decide what to rate it. There's something to be admired about this average white kid who made it big on a budget of $27,000 (which includes the rights to music, I believe, so the shooting budget would have been substantially lower) and a script he didn't have a clue was really any good. Good thing he didn't keep the original ending.10\/10 for the script. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 July 2008","score":"","review":" The main feature of Clerks that attracts me to it is its authenticity.

Jay and Silent Bob may just generally be slackers and, let's be honest, losers, but the other main characters are all real people, authentic, 100% real people, not some stupid Hollywood copy, just guys like myself at one point in my life (and at the moment, to a degree). The conversations are authentic- long, rambling, often bizarre. The customers are portrayed not doing what they're actually doing but doing what they appear to be doing to us working these jobs- the egg and milk people may be exaggerations, but that's really how one tends to see these people when you're working such jobs. One need not exaggerate video store customers, though, they really are that bad.Clerks is not a well-directed film at all. At the time they were shooting the cast and crew really did not believe that the movie would even be released, and even Smith's later, more refined efforts as director show a minimum level of competence. With Clerks Smith is really directing at the level one expects from a first year film major who is still studying mainly theory (not that Smith was all that much older than that when he made the film, and he had no more than a month or two training at a film school), but the script is so strong here that one doesn't really feel the need for the film to be sophisticated on a visual level. If it was it may very well have been one of the best films ever made, but as it stands it is a completely average film on a technical level but also hands down one of the best comedy scripts anyone's ever written. I've also decided that the low budget look and feel lends the film even further authenticity and realism, as a glossy look might have made the film feel significantly different (see the $5 million dollar Clerks II for proof of this).I don't know what to say about Clerks except that its script is absolute genius- authentic, hilarious, real, and featuring well-drawn, ultra-realistic characters I can really relate to. I honestly don't think the script is flawed, not for a second. Smith's work here as director, though, is not especially good. This would be a perfect stage play, as a movie I can't quite decide what to rate it. There's something to be admired about this average white kid who made it big on a budget of $27,000 (which includes the rights to music, I believe, so the shooting budget would have been substantially lower) and a script he didn't have a clue was really any good. Good thing he didn't keep the original ending.10\/10 for the script.

I hated this film when I saw it at the pictures and it annoyed the hell out of me that so few people saw the stupid appalling errors that run through this film, from Batman's crap fighting abilities that pale into significance with Robin's to the scene where when the Batcave's security is breached every piece of equipment comes on rather than hides away! What kind of security is that? The performances are terrible and the direction is shockingly bad with Gotham turned into a gay extravaganza with eighty foot naked statues on every street corner. The score is forgettable and its hard to believe that so much work was put into something so shockingly awful, the only saving grace for this film is that it's not Batman and Robin. And that's not saying much!Avoid at all costs!
