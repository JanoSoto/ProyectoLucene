Only one thing stops it from claiming its rightful place among the industry's finest - that makes it a great film rather than a classic film - and that's that it's too damn short! Admittedly, it doesn't cut you off with the same degree of frustrating incompletion that, say, 'Unbreakable' does, but to compare the two films at all would be insulting to the Coens. All the same though, the style and quality of the film just makes its brevity all the worse. Frances McDormand turns in one of the finest acting performances of recent years as the just-too-damn-smart detective, and the whole film is staged superbly - the Coen brothers' creation of a very dark movie in a very white setting is slick to the point of arty, but engaging enough to become too over-indulgently picturesque. The film is neat, clipped and wonderfully aesthetic. The comedy is as dark as it comes, but all the same entertaining - you find yourself laughing out loud at stuff you might feel you really shouldn't; it's more of an atmosphere of set-piece humour at times in the film, rather than anything deliberately comic about the script. So hey, maybe I'm being slightly picky about criticising the abrupt end to the film. Maybe it shouldn't really be any longer - perhaps to be longer would be to be make 'Fargo' less well-formed, and that would be unforgivable. I suppose it's just a personal thing - as a tragic product of the MTV generation I was hoping for a more dramatic ending, though the classic 'disposal' scene certainly added a certain uniqueness to the film, though it would be shame if such a fine work were to be remembered for just a woodchipper. Again coming from an MTV-generation point of view, I suppose the one thing this film lacks is a feeling of suspense, an adrenalin rush of some kind. But then a film doesn't need that sort of thrill factor to be good. This is not a film you see if you want the kind of high-octane entertainment that, say, 'Bad Boys' or 'Terminator' will supply. Having said that, I can think of few people who would crack open the beers and watch 'Schindler's List' with a pizza - this is a film treat, an artistic, phenomenally slick and polished work with a well-picked, select cast that features not a single wooden line, and along with McDormand's masterful performance there are fine roles by Buscemi and Macy as the cuss-filled crook and the chirpy-to-the-point-of-irritating loser car salesman who hires him. A great lesson in how to make a film - the plot is very simple, but the way it unravels, as well as the style of the piece as a whole, make Fargo a winner. Watch with a glass of something warming, while in a contemplative, patient mood for best results.

This reviewer is saddened that the talented, versatile Denzel Washington (and also James Woods) would associate himself with a sub-par film, in this case John Q. (2002).  In the final analysis, John Q. is a forceful political\/social statement on the merits of universal healthcare at least for all children.  We are made to sympathize for universal healthcare because of the unfortunate, albeit tragic case of John Q.'s son, who is likely to die because his family's insurance plan won't cover heart transplant surgery.  So, in summary, the film is a voice for liberalism by virtue of the fact that universal healthcare is part of the liberal agenda. And the film makes efforts to conceal this obvious liberal attempt.  Who do we see at the end?  Mrs. Universal Health Care herself, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton.But what made this film so odious was not its extreme liberalism, but its lack of originality.  Was I the only one flashing back to Dog Day Afternoon as I watched the crowd of people ridiculing the police as they surrounded the hospital?  I was just waiting for John Q. to come through the doors and prance around the sidewalk, screaming Attica!  The rip-off of Dog Day was so obvious that it was absurd and insulting.  I mean, if you're going to copy another film please do it in a less obvious way!Also, there was so little effort put into explaining how the hostages went from fearful to supportive of John Q.'s efforts.  At no point did the man actually sit down and explain to the hostages why he had taken control of the hospital.  We are just made to assume that at some point they are told about his son.  If he had explained his situation, maybe I could buy into the shift of the hostages.  Again, in Dog Day the hostages more or less become supportive, but at least in that fine film we see why and it is well done.Now, let's talk for a second about the car crash scene at the film's beginning.  Was it me or did that give away the whole plot?  Why the director put that scene at the beginning is beyond me.  It's as if we are manipulated in such a way as to proclaim his cleverness when the implication of the crash victim's death (a heart for John Q.'s son) is confirmed at the end.Okay, and I thought the film really painted a picture of a very cruel and heartless society.  Yes, injustice is a part of life and lots of people are left to suffer and even die without help from others, but the film made no effort to show the goodness in society.  Rather, it constructed a bureaucracy that doesn't care whatsoever about anyone (Brazil is a great anti-bureaucrazy film).  It was done in a less-than-believable way.I won't even comment on the end, as John Q. is being driven to jail. Please!  This movie's ending is as cheesy as that of, say, A League of Their Own or The Postman.People say this all the time about a number of films, but I really believe John Q. had tons of potential.  Had they removed the bang-over-your-head political message and stopped short of ripping off Dog Day, and also developed some of the characters, it could've been a great film.  But in the end, there are lots of movies that could've been great that never were because of piss-poor directing.2\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2002","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Contains Spoilers!!!

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.In the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.It is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.It is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.Ocean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.Admittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!This is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.This is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come.

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.In the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.It is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.It is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.Ocean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.Admittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!This is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director.

Louisa May Alcott's novel, after all, offers a fine host of roles, particularly for women--of the March girls alone, there's the eldest sister Meg; the frail but saintly Beth; spoilt baby of the family Amy; and last but most certainly not least, spunky tomboy Jo. (This is not to forget the smaller, but still integral, supporting roles of Laurie, Mr Lawrence, Professor Bhaer, and of course, Marmee March.) The story is an engaging one too, following the lives of the March sisters--in particular Jo--as they grow and deal with change, with love, and even with death. Even though the story itself is tied to a particular setting in the 1860s (and even then the historical setting is almost peripheral), the characters and their relationships with one another--siblings, parent\/children, friends and lovers--are simply timeless. That's probably why the novel has seen as many attempts to have it committed to film as it has.I hate to make a snap judgement, having not seen any more versions of Little Women than the 1994 one, but I believe that this version, made by RKO studios and starring a delightful Katharine Hepburn as Jo March, has every right to be considered the definitive film version of the Alcott novel. The writing, for one thing, is exceptional. Although never quite the novel's substitute, it condenses the book marvellously, sketching the characters and relationships of the girls quickly and efficiently, and never skipping over the best parts of the book (for example, Laurie's profession of love for Jo). Of course the screenplay will never measure up to the book--it is rare that a film could surpass the wealth of detail and beauty of description available from the written word. But nothing's perfect, and this screenplay, by Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman, is as close as an adaptation can get while retaining its own distinct flavour as a film. As for the casting, I have very few complaints about it, since Hepburn--all angles and attitude, all loud-voiced and tomboyish--is perfect as Jo and is ably supported by Frances Dee as Meg, Henry Stephenson as the sweetly paternal Mr. Laurence and Douglass Montgomery as Laurie (though he plays the role a tad too fey for my liking). Special praise must be reserved for both Jean Parker (Beth March) and Paul Lukas (Professor Fritz Bhaer) Parker for bringing an impossibly sweet and lovely character to life, and making the audience genuinely grieve for Beth when she takes her leave of her family; Lukas for managing to avoid making Professor Bhaer a hard, frightening man with whom the audience simply cannot imagine Jo being in love (as is *my* impression from the book). I was rather disappointed with Joan Bennett as Amy, and that is of course partly attributable to the fact that the character isn't particularly sympathetic in the novel either, so it isn't really fair to expect a miracle from Bennett. Still, Bennett seemed to me to be the most lifeless of the sisters--one might think this an unfair judgement, since anyone acting opposite the powder keg that is Katharine Hepburn could easily be deemed lifeless if he or she weren't able to hold his\/her own against her. Still, the arguably less well-known Frances Dee and Jean Parker had no problem with it. In the final analysis though, there is no doubt that this film, however 'ensemble' the cast, belongs only to Hepburn. Her performance, although somewhat mannered and brassy at times (not necessarily simultaneously, thank goodness!), is nothing short of brilliant. She's sad, she's funny, she's touching, and as she does in her best roles, she transcends her own (pretty formidable!) character to breathe life into Jo as only she can. Witness the simple scene in which Jo breaks down, alone, at night, after having sold her hair for her mother's travel expenses... or the scene when Jo truly believes that scarlet fever is going to take Beth from her, and she trudges up into her own attic, the weight of the world on her shoulders, and collapses into tears. There is also nothing more charming than Hepburn as she gallops down the stairs in a frock which she burnt by leaning against the fireplace, or when she runs like a free, untamed spirit through the woods when chased by Laurie. Strange, sweet, funny Jo--this complex combination of jealous child and strong woman, stubbornly refusing to relinquish the familiar while adamantly placing her family above her own interests always... it really is a role that seems to have been written for Hepburn, just as she seems to have been born to play it. It is perhaps for LITTLE WOMEN as much as for MORNING GLORY (released in the same year) that Hepburn won her first Oscar in 1933. Nobody photographs Hepburn as flatteringly as her good friend and director George Cukor either, so some of the close-up shots of her in LITTLE WOMEN are simply breathtaking in having managed to capture her beauty, her youth and her personality all at once.Nothing about this film is perfect; after all, perfection is too high a standard to be applied to adaptations (and most other films!). But LITTLE WOMEN really does have a little something to offer everybody--a sweet, timeless story about love and growing up and family. It's something that everyone can relate to, and that's probably more than enough.

DESTOROYAH, the previous entry, aptly ended the second series.  What else can I say?  Well, let's break it down.I once liked the 2nd series of Godzilla movies (1984-1995), even though I found something annoying about those movies (as either the bad or good guy, Godzilla was so sympathetic that the human characters came off as obnoxious).  Then, in 1995, along came a movie called GAMERA GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE and its two successful sequels, all directed by master filmmaker Shuusuke Kaneko, who singlehandedly changed the face of Japanese monster movies forever.  I was spoiled!!!  The Series 2 Godzilla movies were suddenly looked down as half-hearted, heavy-handed, auto-piloted and lazy attempts at recreating the original Godzilla, and end up being an insult to the memory of genre masters Ishirou Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya.  GAMERA 3 THE AWAKENING OF IRIS, released the same year as this film, was simply incredible.  Once Hollywood moviegoers saw that movie, they would never look at Japanese monster movies the same way again.Then, along came Tri-Star's 1998 GINO (Godzilla In Name Only), which was understandably met with bitter hatred by true Godzilla fans the world over. The worst portrayal of Godzilla seen by the human eye, making Marvel's 70s comics and Hanna-Barbera's cartoon look better.  Then, MOTHRA 3, released later that year, bombed at the box office.  Toho was in deep crap.  They felt as though Godzilla was about to lose his fans, because of this red-blooded American box-office disaster, so to make up for it, they made this movie, GOJIRA NI-SEN MIRENIAMU (Godzilla 2000 Millennium), which was a take that to GINO.  This movie is definitely better than GINO, which isn't saying much.Is it the BEST Godzilla movie?  Nope, not by a long shot.  In fact, it quickly bombed at the box office in Japan (starting out at 4th place, and sinking to 8th in the second week!).  A lot of Godzilla fans in Japan didn't like the movie.  Is it entertaining?  Not if you're spoiled by the Heisei Gamera trilogy, but if you don't take the movie too seriously, yes, it is very entertaining.  In fact, I hadn't been entertained like this since TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA (Toho; 1975), and despite the movie's MAJOR flaws, GODZILLA 2000 MILLENNIUM is still very entertaining.First of all, Godzilla has never looked better!  His design has been in a rut since 1989, where his design was great, but once they stuck to it, he began to look slapped-together in each new film, but finally, a NEW Godzilla design!  As Riverdancer Michael Flatley once said, It's important to change, because if you stagnate, you die.  I think this is a very good change, and one that stays true to Godzilla's spirit.  Godzilla's design is a streamlined version of the Kin-Goji design from KING KONG VS. GODZILLA, with jagged DARK CRYSTAL-style dorsal fins that give him an evil look.  I was neither bothered by the orange-colored Radioactive Heat Beam (most fans are used to blue), nor Godzilla's green tone (this is the first time Toho made Godzilla officially green, whereas he had an ambiguous green-gray tone).  I was very happy with this Godzilla.  For the first time, Godzilla was played by former JAC stuntman Tsutomu Kitagawa (a veteran of Toei's Sentai Series), who just started out in the Toho Monster genre (he played King Ghidorah in MOTHRA 3).The UFO and the Millennian Alien\/Orga were excellent and unique ideas (which the previous movie series wouldn't have allowed, for fear of being over the top, but this was the cleverest portrayal of aliens in a Godzilla film), but half the time, they are poorly handled on film.  That brings us to the story part.  The Millennian, Toho's first CGI monster, is a really bizarre creation, and Orga reminds me of GINO (the intention) as if over-mutated by comic-book artist Todd McFarlane!  Definitely not your average Japanese monster!The story has great ideas, and a more realistic feel than the previous Godzilla movies since the 90s.  However, the main problem is that things were not spelled out for the viewer (mostly because production was rushed in the second half).  As a result, lot of people did not know what was going on.  After reading about the plot\/story and having purchased both the Official Movie Compendium (which has TONS of useful info that Americans don't know about the film) and the manga adaptation by Mondo Takimura (which is a MUCH better version of the film than the film itself!), I've seen critics\/reviewers make up their own conclusion.  Read the plot below so I'll help out.Throughout the film, there are parodies of both GINO and INDEPENDENCE DAY (one scene had a taxi driver in Shinjuku getting out of his taxi, staring dumbfounded at the UFO while his car gets smashed by another!  Part of this was cut out in the US version; It shouldn't have been)!As of 1999, the special effects are probably the best in any Toho Godzilla film since Teruyoshi Nakano's breathtaking work in the 1984 GODZILLA. Kenji Suzuki's FX are a vast improvement over Kouichi Kawakita's work in the films from 1989-1995.  This is his second FX direction job (his first was MOTHRA 3).  Definitely not up to Shinji Higuchi's work in the Heisei Gamera trilogy (which Toho had been trying to keep up with), but definitely not too shabby for a Toho Godzilla film!  The downside is that some of the FX looked rushed (especially in the climactic fight scene between Godzilla and Orga; Toho was definitely behind schedule).As for the human characters, after 1975 (and probably 1984), we FINALLY get characters from all walks of life!  Thus, they may not be the BEST characters, but very amusing ones (and thankfully, not too many of them, whereas previous Godzilla movies had byzantine amounts of important characters you didn't care for).  Takehiro Murata, no stranger to Godzilla films (he appeared in 1992's GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA and 1995's GODZILLA VS. DESTOROYAH), takes his first lead Godzilla film role as Yuuji Shinoda, who runs GPN (Godzilla Prediction Network) with his little daughter Io (Mayu Suzuki), and wants to study Godzilla to discover the secrets to life. Actress Naomi Nishida very well plays the part of O-Parts magazine photographer Yuuki Ichinose, who joins GPN to get pictures of Godzilla for the magazine.  TV & movie heartthrob Hiroshi Abe totally steals the show as the ruthless Mitsuo Katagiri, who runs CCI (Crisis Control Intelligence Agency), the faction that wants Godzilla destroyed, period.  Godzilla's rooftop confrontation with Abe at the film's end is a shining moment!  And there's actor and longtime Godzilla fan Shirou Sano as Shirou Miyasaka, Shinoda's old college buddy\/CCI executive, who provides a conflict between the two factions.The music by Takayuki Hattori is an improvement over his own score for GODZILLA VS. SPACE GODZILLA, but in the film, it was done absolutely no justice.  When one listens to the CD soundtrack, one finds that some of the best tracks aren't even used in the film, thus Toho's music editors do the same slapdash job of cutting & pasting tracks all over the place, but some of the important tracks are left in the right place.  And as much as it livens the film, Toho's throwing in a token stock track of Akira Ifukube's Godzilla Theme (just to tell us that this is a Godzilla film) does detract from the film.  It seems the fogeys over at Toho have a problem with simply doing new arrangements of Ifukube's music (cost-effective, maybe?).Then, there's Takao Ookawara directing his last Godzilla film before quitting the series.  Ookawara doesn't care much for Godzilla, though his work is actually okay.  He's better than Kazuki Oomori (not only the worst Godzilla director, in my opinion, but he is completely embarrassed with monsters and stuff), though.And last, but not least, Tri-Star's US English-language version.  Well, I've seen the Japanese version on tape, and when comparing it with the US version, the Japanese version actually makes more sense.  Some of the US editing patronizes the original material by cutting out some important scenes and changing parts of the dialogue for PC reasons (like changing Organizer G1 to Regenerator G1, and editing out all references to Millennium).  However, the US version makes up for it with tighter pacing and some really fun dialogue, not to mention one bit of profanity (Nice try, a**hole!)!  About time Godzilla movies started growing up!  The US music by J. Peter Robinson is okay, but really cheesy most of the time (noticably, much of the score was recycled from the 1998 TV movie, GARGANTUA, which was made by Fox to one-up GINO).  Hattori's original score is about 50-75% intact, though.  Robinson actually rearranges Ifukube music with two tracks, the best in the scene where Orga makes his appearance, the worst being the scene in the end (after which, said token stock Ifukube track is repeated before cuing the complete original ending credits track). Speaking of which, the worst part of the Americanization was the tacky THE ? END title card at the end of the theatrical version of the film (blessedly removed for TV\/Video\/DVD versions).  I was really embarrassed.Speaking of embarrassing, a lot of people in the US seem to have lost sleep over the closing dialogue, the last part of which is a direct translation in the US version Godzilla is . . . inside all of us!  And yes, Japanese fans were pretty embarrassed with that scene!  I didn't mind it, though. The US version is still fun to sit through, and still manages to have respect for the original film.  I did hear, though, that the US version was put together at the last minute (to meet a tight deadline), which explains a lot.Before I close this review, well, everyone pretty much knows the plot, but here's my version anyway It's basically Godzilla crossed with QUATERMASS AND THE PIT.  This movie is a direct follow-up to the original 1954 GODZILLA, but HOW Godzilla came back is unexplained (a MAJOR weakness for the film).  For what it's worth, GPN (Godzilla Prediction Network) led by Yuuji Shinoda and his daughter Io, try to predict Godzilla's city attacks so that he can evacuate precious lives in advance.  In foggy Nemuro, Godzilla crunches a fishing ship with his powerful jaws in front of a lighthouse, smashes a bar, attacks a city and for some reason, destroys a power station (all this being among the best highlights of the film).  According to Shinoda (in the Japanese version), Does Godzilla hate the energy that mankind produces?  Meanwhile, CCI (Crisis Control Intelligence Agency), led by Mitsuo Katagiri, discovers a HUGE rock fragment beneath the Japan Trench, and try to transport it, but the rock transports ITSELF by floating to the surface of the ocean!  CCI member Shirou Miyasaka suggests that the rock might contain an alien life form, and to their surprise, it does some weird things like stand right side up over the ocean.  At the same time, despite Shinoda's warnings, Katagiri, CCI and the Japan Self Defense Forces prepare to attack Godzilla in Tokaimura (where, at the same time of filming, a nuclear accident happened in real life) with a new set of super-missiles called Full Metal Missiles (Yes, they're called that in the Japanese version!  No doubt a tribute to Stanley Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET).  The weird thing is that when Godzilla appears, he does absolutely nothing!  He just lets the JSDF hit him with everything but the kitchen sink, to no good effect, although the Full Metal Missiles did kinda' do a number on him. Just then, Miyasaka finds that the giant rock follows the sun, so it starts to fly away and heads toward Godzilla, the two titans shoot rays at each other, and in the process, Godzilla is defeated, and the rock is revealed to be a huge, solar-powered metallic UFO!  It flies to Shinjuku, where it lands on a network building (same building as O-Parts Magazine!), and starts draining info from the Internet so that it can find out more about Godzilla (it discovered that Godzilla has quick-regeneration process; Upon further study with Miyasaka, Shinoda calls it Organizer G1).  It also starts transmitting message words such as Millennium, Kingdom, etc.  Come evening, Katagiri even suggested blowing up the building with the UFO still on it (where a crazy mix-up gets Shinoda into DIE HARD-style hijinks), but guess what?  The UFO stands triumphant and destroys the rest of the building!  Shinoda emerges a survivor, and shows everyone why the UFO wants Godzilla The Millennium Aliens (Millennians) want to start an empire on Earth by converting our planet's air to make it more suitable for them. When they crashed on Earth in prehistoric times, they lost their solid composure and were reduced to anti-matter in the process.  They need Godzilla's cells to regenerate their bodies.  Then, Godzilla shows up from Tokyo Bay, and has a fight with the UFO, which overpowers him (telepathically using underground cables to lasso him) and clones Organizer G1 from his body, thus, the Millennians emerge from the UFO, regenerating into their original form, a single giant squidlike alien!  But unfortunately, Godzilla's DNA overtook the alien's shape and causes a painful Hulk-like transformation, thus Orga (named from Organizer G1 - Get it?) was the tragic result.

","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2002","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The first Godzilla movie in the third movie series, whereas GODZILLA VS. DESTOROYAH, the previous entry, aptly ended the second series.  What else can I say?  Well, let's break it down.I once liked the 2nd series of Godzilla movies (1984-1995), even though I found something annoying about those movies (as either the bad or good guy, Godzilla was so sympathetic that the human characters came off as obnoxious).  Then, in 1995, along came a movie called GAMERA GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE and its two successful sequels, all directed by master filmmaker Shuusuke Kaneko, who singlehandedly changed the face of Japanese monster movies forever.  I was spoiled!!!  The Series 2 Godzilla movies were suddenly looked down as half-hearted, heavy-handed, auto-piloted and lazy attempts at recreating the original Godzilla, and end up being an insult to the memory of genre masters Ishirou Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya.  GAMERA 3 THE AWAKENING OF IRIS, released the same year as this film, was simply incredible.  Once Hollywood moviegoers saw that movie, they would never look at Japanese monster movies the same way again.Then, along came Tri-Star's 1998 GINO (Godzilla In Name Only), which was understandably met with bitter hatred by true Godzilla fans the world over. The worst portrayal of Godzilla seen by the human eye, making Marvel's 70s comics and Hanna-Barbera's cartoon look better.  Then, MOTHRA 3, released later that year, bombed at the box office.  Toho was in deep crap.  They felt as though Godzilla was about to lose his fans, because of this red-blooded American box-office disaster, so to make up for it, they made this movie, GOJIRA NI-SEN MIRENIAMU (Godzilla 2000 Millennium), which was a take that to GINO.  This movie is definitely better than GINO, which isn't saying much.Is it the BEST Godzilla movie?  Nope, not by a long shot.  In fact, it quickly bombed at the box office in Japan (starting out at 4th place, and sinking to 8th in the second week!).  A lot of Godzilla fans in Japan didn't like the movie.  Is it entertaining?  Not if you're spoiled by the Heisei Gamera trilogy, but if you don't take the movie too seriously, yes, it is very entertaining.  In fact, I hadn't been entertained like this since TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA (Toho; 1975), and despite the movie's MAJOR flaws, GODZILLA 2000 MILLENNIUM is still very entertaining.First of all, Godzilla has never looked better!  His design has been in a rut since 1989, where his design was great, but once they stuck to it, he began to look slapped-together in each new film, but finally, a NEW Godzilla design!  As Riverdancer Michael Flatley once said, It's important to change, because if you stagnate, you die.  I think this is a very good change, and one that stays true to Godzilla's spirit.  Godzilla's design is a streamlined version of the Kin-Goji design from KING KONG VS. GODZILLA, with jagged DARK CRYSTAL-style dorsal fins that give him an evil look.  I was neither bothered by the orange-colored Radioactive Heat Beam (most fans are used to blue), nor Godzilla's green tone (this is the first time Toho made Godzilla officially green, whereas he had an ambiguous green-gray tone).  I was very happy with this Godzilla.  For the first time, Godzilla was played by former JAC stuntman Tsutomu Kitagawa (a veteran of Toei's Sentai Series), who just started out in the Toho Monster genre (he played King Ghidorah in MOTHRA 3).The UFO and the Millennian Alien\/Orga were excellent and unique ideas (which the previous movie series wouldn't have allowed, for fear of being over the top, but this was the cleverest portrayal of aliens in a Godzilla film), but half the time, they are poorly handled on film.  That brings us to the story part.  The Millennian, Toho's first CGI monster, is a really bizarre creation, and Orga reminds me of GINO (the intention) as if over-mutated by comic-book artist Todd McFarlane!  Definitely not your average Japanese monster!The story has great ideas, and a more realistic feel than the previous Godzilla movies since the 90s.  However, the main problem is that things were not spelled out for the viewer (mostly because production was rushed in the second half).  As a result, lot of people did not know what was going on.  After reading about the plot\/story and having purchased both the Official Movie Compendium (which has TONS of useful info that Americans don't know about the film) and the manga adaptation by Mondo Takimura (which is a MUCH better version of the film than the film itself!), I've seen critics\/reviewers make up their own conclusion.  Read the plot below so I'll help out.Throughout the film, there are parodies of both GINO and INDEPENDENCE DAY (one scene had a taxi driver in Shinjuku getting out of his taxi, staring dumbfounded at the UFO while his car gets smashed by another!  Part of this was cut out in the US version; It shouldn't have been)!As of 1999, the special effects are probably the best in any Toho Godzilla film since Teruyoshi Nakano's breathtaking work in the 1984 GODZILLA. Kenji Suzuki's FX are a vast improvement over Kouichi Kawakita's work in the films from 1989-1995.  This is his second FX direction job (his first was MOTHRA 3).  Definitely not up to Shinji Higuchi's work in the Heisei Gamera trilogy (which Toho had been trying to keep up with), but definitely not too shabby for a Toho Godzilla film!  The downside is that some of the FX looked rushed (especially in the climactic fight scene between Godzilla and Orga; Toho was definitely behind schedule).As for the human characters, after 1975 (and probably 1984), we FINALLY get characters from all walks of life!  Thus, they may not be the BEST characters, but very amusing ones (and thankfully, not too many of them, whereas previous Godzilla movies had byzantine amounts of important characters you didn't care for).  Takehiro Murata, no stranger to Godzilla films (he appeared in 1992's GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA and 1995's GODZILLA VS. DESTOROYAH), takes his first lead Godzilla film role as Yuuji Shinoda, who runs GPN (Godzilla Prediction Network) with his little daughter Io (Mayu Suzuki), and wants to study Godzilla to discover the secrets to life. Actress Naomi Nishida very well plays the part of O-Parts magazine photographer Yuuki Ichinose, who joins GPN to get pictures of Godzilla for the magazine.  TV & movie heartthrob Hiroshi Abe totally steals the show as the ruthless Mitsuo Katagiri, who runs CCI (Crisis Control Intelligence Agency), the faction that wants Godzilla destroyed, period.  Godzilla's rooftop confrontation with Abe at the film's end is a shining moment!  And there's actor and longtime Godzilla fan Shirou Sano as Shirou Miyasaka, Shinoda's old college buddy\/CCI executive, who provides a conflict between the two factions.The music by Takayuki Hattori is an improvement over his own score for GODZILLA VS. SPACE GODZILLA, but in the film, it was done absolutely no justice.  When one listens to the CD soundtrack, one finds that some of the best tracks aren't even used in the film, thus Toho's music editors do the same slapdash job of cutting & pasting tracks all over the place, but some of the important tracks are left in the right place.  And as much as it livens the film, Toho's throwing in a token stock track of Akira Ifukube's Godzilla Theme (just to tell us that this is a Godzilla film) does detract from the film.  It seems the fogeys over at Toho have a problem with simply doing new arrangements of Ifukube's music (cost-effective, maybe?).Then, there's Takao Ookawara directing his last Godzilla film before quitting the series.  Ookawara doesn't care much for Godzilla, though his work is actually okay.  He's better than Kazuki Oomori (not only the worst Godzilla director, in my opinion, but he is completely embarrassed with monsters and stuff), though.And last, but not least, Tri-Star's US English-language version.  Well, I've seen the Japanese version on tape, and when comparing it with the US version, the Japanese version actually makes more sense.  Some of the US editing patronizes the original material by cutting out some important scenes and changing parts of the dialogue for PC reasons (like changing Organizer G1 to Regenerator G1, and editing out all references to Millennium).  However, the US version makes up for it with tighter pacing and some really fun dialogue, not to mention one bit of profanity (Nice try, a**hole!)!  About time Godzilla movies started growing up!  The US music by J. Peter Robinson is okay, but really cheesy most of the time (noticably, much of the score was recycled from the 1998 TV movie, GARGANTUA, which was made by Fox to one-up GINO).  Hattori's original score is about 50-75% intact, though.  Robinson actually rearranges Ifukube music with two tracks, the best in the scene where Orga makes his appearance, the worst being the scene in the end (after which, said token stock Ifukube track is repeated before cuing the complete original ending credits track). Speaking of which, the worst part of the Americanization was the tacky THE ? END title card at the end of the theatrical version of the film (blessedly removed for TV\/Video\/DVD versions).  I was really embarrassed.Speaking of embarrassing, a lot of people in the US seem to have lost sleep over the closing dialogue, the last part of which is a direct translation in the US version Godzilla is . . . inside all of us!  And yes, Japanese fans were pretty embarrassed with that scene!  I didn't mind it, though. The US version is still fun to sit through, and still manages to have respect for the original film.  I did hear, though, that the US version was put together at the last minute (to meet a tight deadline), which explains a lot.Before I close this review, well, everyone pretty much knows the plot, but here's my version anyway It's basically Godzilla crossed with QUATERMASS AND THE PIT.  This movie is a direct follow-up to the original 1954 GODZILLA, but HOW Godzilla came back is unexplained (a MAJOR weakness for the film).  For what it's worth, GPN (Godzilla Prediction Network) led by Yuuji Shinoda and his daughter Io, try to predict Godzilla's city attacks so that he can evacuate precious lives in advance.  In foggy Nemuro, Godzilla crunches a fishing ship with his powerful jaws in front of a lighthouse, smashes a bar, attacks a city and for some reason, destroys a power station (all this being among the best highlights of the film).  According to Shinoda (in the Japanese version), Does Godzilla hate the energy that mankind produces?  Meanwhile, CCI (Crisis Control Intelligence Agency), led by Mitsuo Katagiri, discovers a HUGE rock fragment beneath the Japan Trench, and try to transport it, but the rock transports ITSELF by floating to the surface of the ocean!  CCI member Shirou Miyasaka suggests that the rock might contain an alien life form, and to their surprise, it does some weird things like stand right side up over the ocean.  At the same time, despite Shinoda's warnings, Katagiri, CCI and the Japan Self Defense Forces prepare to attack Godzilla in Tokaimura (where, at the same time of filming, a nuclear accident happened in real life) with a new set of super-missiles called Full Metal Missiles (Yes, they're called that in the Japanese version!  No doubt a tribute to Stanley Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET).  The weird thing is that when Godzilla appears, he does absolutely nothing!  He just lets the JSDF hit him with everything but the kitchen sink, to no good effect, although the Full Metal Missiles did kinda' do a number on him. Just then, Miyasaka finds that the giant rock follows the sun, so it starts to fly away and heads toward Godzilla, the two titans shoot rays at each other, and in the process, Godzilla is defeated, and the rock is revealed to be a huge, solar-powered metallic UFO!  It flies to Shinjuku, where it lands on a network building (same building as O-Parts Magazine!), and starts draining info from the Internet so that it can find out more about Godzilla (it discovered that Godzilla has quick-regeneration process; Upon further study with Miyasaka, Shinoda calls it Organizer G1).  It also starts transmitting message words such as Millennium, Kingdom, etc.  Come evening, Katagiri even suggested blowing up the building with the UFO still on it (where a crazy mix-up gets Shinoda into DIE HARD-style hijinks), but guess what?  The UFO stands triumphant and destroys the rest of the building!  Shinoda emerges a survivor, and shows everyone why the UFO wants Godzilla The Millennium Aliens (Millennians) want to start an empire on Earth by converting our planet's air to make it more suitable for them. When they crashed on Earth in prehistoric times, they lost their solid composure and were reduced to anti-matter in the process.  They need Godzilla's cells to regenerate their bodies.  Then, Godzilla shows up from Tokyo Bay, and has a fight with the UFO, which overpowers him (telepathically using underground cables to lasso him) and clones Organizer G1 from his body, thus, the Millennians emerge from the UFO, regenerating into their original form, a single giant squidlike alien!  But unfortunately, Godzilla's DNA overtook the alien's shape and causes a painful Hulk-like transformation, thus Orga (named from Organizer G1 - Get it?) was the tragic result.  After Godzilla trashes the UFO, Orga proceeds to beat him silly (also telepathically controlling what's left of the UFO to bash him around with it!).  Can Godzilla destroy a giant alien mutant with many times his own healing speed?Whew!  That was a lengthy review!  Well, I still think that the next Godzilla movie, GODZILLA X MEGAGUIRUS THE G ANNIHILATION STRATEGY, is even better, and that it was the type of movie Toho should've made (and the movie that should've been shown in US theaters)!

But the problem I have with the General is it isn't as good as other Keaton stuff not on the top #250 list.  Keaton is a great director\/actor, but I feel this movie simply does not capture his magic.  My favorite Keaton movie, Sherlock Jr., just has this essence to it.  I can't exactly describe it, but it entices you and doesn't let go.  For instance, Sherlock Jr. has a memorable scene in which Keaton's character jumps (You heard right)through an old lady.  Completely through, and without using digital effects.  How it was done is a mystery, and that's what makes the movie so great.  Sure, The General has its moments.  The scene where Keaton lights the upwardly faced cannon, only to have it slowly inch towards him is great, but it doesn't do as much for me.  Another complaint I have with the movie is the length.  Good comedies know when to quit, before they get stale.  Sherlock Jr. is only 44 minutes long and that's perfect.  The movie ends just before the charm wears off.  The General, howeer, is over 70.  Most comedies today have trouble lasting 70 minutes, and they can use both verbal and sight gags to kill time.  The General, being a silent film, must rely on 70 minutes of sight gags.  Most of them a clever, but they get old.  I found myself drifting away from the movie and into my own thoughts quite often during the feature (I saw this, by the way, at the Silent Movie Theatre in Los Angeles, one of two left in the world).  If you are just getting into Keaton, see this first.  If you're into Keaton, but have yet to see the General, don't be expected if you're disappointed.  His other work is much better.

The scene where Keaton lights the upwardly faced cannon, only to have it slowly inch towards him is great, but it doesn't do as much for me.  Another complaint I have with the movie is the length.  Good comedies know when to quit, before they get stale.  Sherlock Jr. is only 44 minutes long and that's perfect.  The movie ends just before the charm wears off.  The General, howeer, is over 70.  Most comedies today have trouble lasting 70 minutes, and they can use both verbal and sight gags to kill time.  The General, being a silent film, must rely on 70 minutes of sight gags.  Most of them a clever, but they get old.  I found myself drifting away from the movie and into my own thoughts quite often during the feature (I saw this, by the way, at the Silent Movie Theatre in Los Angeles, one of two left in the world).  If you are just getting into Keaton, see this first.  If you're into Keaton, but have yet to see the General, don't be expected if you're disappointed.  His other work is much better.

There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about it.  If you forgot for a moment that Buster Keaton has made other movies, than it would be great.  There really is no glaring flaw in the General.  Sure, the storyline revolves around getting the girl, like all other stories of the time.  But if that's my biggest complaint, then the move must be pretty damn good, right?  Well, it is.  But the problem I have with the General is it isn't as good as other Keaton stuff not on the top #250 list.  Keaton is a great director\/actor, but I feel this movie simply does not capture his magic.  My favorite Keaton movie, Sherlock Jr., just has this essence to it.

It fits the form of classical cinema or classical paradigm in that the director, David O. Russell, does not get distracted from telling the story with filmmaking techniques. It is a clear and precise comedy that never leaves the characters in action, and is done so in a way that works unlike many other films of this genre released today. The film is structured narratively, with a clearly defined conflict from the very beginning. Ben Stiller shines in his performance as a neurotic new father who is trying desperately to find his biological parents in order to name his newborn son. At one point in the film the viewer begins to become anxious and wonder if the same problem for the protagonist, Stiller, is going to continue on in the same form as it has in the past half of the movie, but luckily Russell then changes the flow of the film and brings it to a much more comedic finish than the first half.The photography is shot in full and long shots throughout most of the movie. Russell must have used deep-focus shots when filming because the surrounding background is clear around the characters, using a wide-angle or short lens. The characters are never off of the screen except for a few instances when we see a plane flying or a car driving and then we have voice-overs. The dialogue is always continuous- there is never a break in the script which works well because the screenplay is well written and clever on its insights on the little inconveniences of everyday life. Although all of these events are too unbelievable too happen all at once, they are all real life comedic situations that could happen to anyone. When compiled together with this plot line, we have this film before us.Although this is a typical movie in the sense that it does not break any barriers or do anything creatively in its techniques in telling the story, the plot and screenplay do enough justice in making the film entertaining for the audience and one of those films you can just sit down, relax, and have fun viewing because it makes sense and fits together.

To me, his films are always very very complicated (the plot is simple, but I can't tell the story without giving spoilers..so..see how hard is that??). Despite all of that, Me, you and all of you must agree that Shyamalan movies are always great, calm, atmospheric..and brain twister. If you know his habit of making twist in the end of the film (the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable) you will be very surprised wafter watching this one. This movie is undoubtly one of the creepiest movie Hollywood has ever made! The atmosphere is tense, the plot is simple (like every horror pictures), the acting is superb (Mel Gibson is really convincing) and the environment is very very isolated dark..and scary (I don't want to have any crop fields around my house!! No way!). I won't tell the story to you. No. It will ruin everything. You just have to see it and enjoy it. No, don't even think about logic. Because this movie isn't talking about logic, but about faith and scariness behind the trees...and the weird sounds...(in particular scene, Shyamalan uses no music, but natural sounds that really come from the grass and the crops.. so you have to hear every little sounds that came out...and that's creepy I tell you!). This movie is a masterpiece. No, not as great as the Sixth Sense, but it is better than Unbreakable, and darker and creepier than any horror movies I've ever seen. This one is really scary, believe me. Hey, horror fans out there, face your fears here! In the middle of the crops!! (Note Please tell me if any of you saw an UFO in this movie, OK?)

How could a movie with Steve Allen and Jerry Vale be all bad? People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors. But I suspect there are at least three reasons First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women. Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they? Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a scumbag because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing.

Vin Diesel has the biceps and, more importantly, the attitude to be the next really big action hero. In this movie he shows his stuff by portraying a new kind of tough guy, a Gen X rebel who's into anarchy and extreme sports and who can only be brought under control (and barely at that) by someone who's just as tough and has the benefit of far more experience. That someone is Samuel L Jackson, one of the few current major stars with the presence to pull off his role of a top secret NSA agent whose job it is to recruit talented scumbags and get them to work as spies. The tension between these two characters is terrific, and adds greatly to the fun of this movie. The plot of XXX is pretty basic, which is how it should be, since we don't want unnecessary complexity to get in the way of the action, stunts, and dialog. Once he's been recruited, Diesel's character, nicknamed `XXX' in honor of one of his tattoos, heads to Prague to infiltrate a group of, well, for lack of a better term, neo-fascist heavy metal anarchists with a secret plot to bring down governments across the entire planet using a sub to distribute some sort of deadly poison. This premise is, like most action movie plots, entirely ridiculous, but who cares? What makes this film work are the same ingredients that made Stallone and Schwarzenegger worldwide mega-stars, namely, great stunts, non stop high adrenalin energy, and a star who has just the right set of qualities, a combination of attitude, coolness under pressure, and a good sense of humor. Zingy one-liners delivered with just the right tone are, of course, de rigueur. The bottom line is that Diesel delivers the goods on all counts. This movie works for one simple reason &#150; its star is the real deal, a guy with the self-confidence to take what could have been a hokey piece of schlock and turned it into a blockbuster.
