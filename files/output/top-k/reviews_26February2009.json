Kenny and Stan's dad get high and enter the very sexually charged world of HEAVY METAL.I give this movie 3 stars for one reason alone--the music was exceptional, though why they included Journey's Open Arms along with all the harder rock, I'll never know. The tunes, if you love late 70s-early 80s hard rock, are really good. As for the rest of this film, it plays like a teenager's wet dream as animated and directed by a group of not particularly talented teens.The first thing that many viewers will notice will be that the animation makes the worst Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the 1970s look pretty good in some ways. That's because the frame-rate of HEAVY METAL is very, very low--resulting in an even jerkier and less animated style of animation. People who have given the film scores of 10 must either be blind or just could care less about super-cheap animation. Now that doesn't mean the animation is all bad--some of the backgrounds and a few of the scenes are definitely better than Hanna-Barbera--but even the best this film has to offer is light-years worse than anime, such as AKIRA. Although I saw reviews that compared the two, AKIRA is simply a much better product animation-wise or traditional full-length cartoons. Apparently the different segments were the work of different animation teams, though none were particularly good.Another thing you may soon notice is that although this film managed to get an R-rating, it is incredibly explicit--yet somehow this got the R and FRITZ THE CAT got an X. While the language wasn't that of FRITZ, there were tons of naked people featuring not just breasts but crotch shots and sex--lots of sex. Now I could see how a teen might like this, but for anyone wanting porn, they could also do a lot better! Seeing exceptionally explicit cartoons just seems sleazy and kinda gross.So what you have is a long series of short smutty stories that are horribly animated that are set to great tunes. My suggestion is that you watch the Cheesing episode of SOUTH PARK and see their dead-on parody of HEAVY METAL instead--it's actually funny and worth seeing--unlike this rather stupid film. I can't believe I actually watched this dumb movie.

While it is not as exceptional as the 1987 Paul Verhoeven original (which I rate a 9 out of 10), it is nevertheless an above average film and a great film by sequel standards. First let me say that it does an almost perfect job of continuing the tone and balancing the themes of the original, namely the sardonic humor and the over the top R violence. I think I realize why Robocop 2 falls into the pit of a 5.2 rating on this website; on the one hand you have a die-hard group of fan-boys of the original who get so carried away praising the first film that they low-ball the score of the sequel to emphasize their appreciation of the first, and on the other hand you have a group of politically-minded IMDb elitists that refuse to appreciate a film that seems too typical of the shallow 1980's action films that they perceive fetishize law enforcement or other what they consider to be 'low brow themes'. Robocop 2 continues the two main stories of the original; the corporatization of America and the degeneration of society, and the subplot of the inner conflict of Robocop's machine body and human mind. The new element thrown into the mix is the NUKE-epidemic, no doubt a reference to the real world Crack epidemic that was raging in the inner cities at that time. The sequel shifts a little focus away from Robocops personal struggle and places more emphasis on the politics of degenerating Detroit, which accounts for the fact this film has less of a sad and melancholic feel, and has increased the amount of cynical on screen violence. The film got a lot of negative publicity from uptight mainstream reviewers like Roger Ebert for what they considered the irresponsible and exploitive character Hob (played by Gabriel Damon), a 12 year old drug dealing, misogynistic cop killer. For me, it's powerful characters like that that make a film like Robocop 2 memorable almost 20 years later, something that seems so fresh when compared to the politically correct atmosphere that dominates even R- rated films today. Unfortunately Basil Poledouris didn't return to write the score for this sequel, but Peter Weller did return to reprise his role as Murphy\/Robocop here for the last time, as well as a host of supporting cast both in the police force and OCP office which do lend credibility to this sequel. Directed by the same guy that did The Empire Strikes Back is interesting trivia, and having a running time of almost 2 hours, the pace is so fast I never think it drags. The special effects are superb for a 1990 film and hold up very well today, and the sheer amount of automatic gun fire in this film is something to behold when viewing with good speakers.

I am a big movie watcher and I must say that I was able to sit through the movie all the way through and stay pretty interested to see what was going to happen.

This is perhaps largely because Ford was a director who made more of an effort if he liked the material. His technique had earned him the respect of his peers, but by and large his greatest efforts were not Oscar-winning fare. Enter How Green Was My Valley - a sentimental story of family and community, the screenplay of which Ford called nearly as perfect as a script can be, but also Daryl F. Zanuck's attempt to produce a picture with a dramatic sweep to rival Gone with the Wind. The result ticks both boxes - happy John Ford, happy academy.The finished product may be smaller in scope (not to mention runtime) than Selznick's superproduction, but like Gone with the Wind it underwent several changes of cast and crew. The original choice for director was the excellent William Wyler who, just to contrast with Ford, won three Oscars for directing, each time for a best picture. Had he been given the reins we would have seen a somewhat different focus. Wyler was better with actors and intimacy, but Ford was better with places and groups of people. The film is thus short on convincing drama and great performances, but strong in its depiction of a community. Ford brings the mining village to life with tender beauty, and devotes time to giving character to the crowd scenes.Of any of the major productions of this time you might expect this one to be in Technicolor, if nothing else to show just how green that valley was. But Ford, who was actually appalling at colour composition, achieves the contrast with monochrome, thanks to Arthur Miller's Oscar-winning cinematography. You can see the effect best in the opening sequence, when the mottled greys and swathes of black of the village in modern times changes to startling white with crisp black silhouettes for the green of Huw's childhood.What makes this picture especially typical of Ford is its use of space. In the Morgans' home he uses tight framing devices and makes the large family appear to take up every available space. The effect and intention here is of cosiness, not claustrophobia. Ford often made interiors look cramped to emphasise the togetherness of family and community. In this case it also makes the place look all the emptier by contrast when the sons leave home. Ford actuallycontinues this pattern of shot composition for the exteriors, using tree branches for framing or buildings as backdrops to make the making the village appear similarly enveloping and close-knit.Ford must also have relished this chance to make use of music and song as an emotional backdrop. You see this in most of his sound pictures. A piece of diagetic music, usually some kind of community sing-song, begins as a simple transitional group scene, but we then home in on a moment of intimacy as the singing continues in the background. The best example from How Green Was My Valley is when Sara Algood welcomes her sons back into the home after the strike. I think Ford more than any other director knew the value of diagetic music, and was (quite rightly) against excessive background scores. Unfortunately this was 1941, and overstated incidental music was more or less inevitable.While Ford could create beautiful images, he rarely made much effort to motivate his cast. Here we have some disappointing performances from Maureen O'Hara and Walter Pidgeon, both of whom could do much better, and either grating hamminess or downright bad-acting from the bit players. It was also a mistake to have Roddy McDowall play Huw throughout the film. He's fine as a child, but the baby-faced twelve-year old doesn't convince as the young adult he is supposed to be by the end. The one great performance is that of Donald Crisp, an intelligent actor who also had experience as a director. Players like that don't really need coaching, all they need is a role that is worthy of them.Of all the best picture winners of this era, retrospect has not been kind to How Green Was My Valley. It is often unfairly recalled as the film which won over Citizen Kane, not to mention The Maltese Falcon and The Little Foxes. Its sentimentality and its reluctance to delve into the darker elements of the story look particularly dated next to the maturity of post-war Hollywood. I would say it is a slightly unfocused story, with not enough enough emphasis on any one of its strands. However, it's silly to blame members of the academy for being puzzled by pictures that were ahead of their time, and even sillier to condemn a picture for having broad appeal. How Green Was My Valley is not literally the best picture of 1941, but it is that broad appeal that made it a winner.

So I had no idea what to expect when I started watching it.The film follows the story of three incoming freshman at the fictional Columbus University, both plagued by tragedies. Kristen (Kristy Swanson) is nearly raped, loses her useless friends, and questions her sexuality, or so it is implied. Malik (Omar Epps) faces racial tension, tuition woes, and the realization he isn't sure what he wants in life. Remy (Michael Rappaport) deals with loneliness, and his eventual decline into white supremacism. So it's an upbeat film.Director John Singleton had a unique opportunity to show the reality of racial tensions and the struggles of college life. In some ways, he succeeds. In other ways, the film is extremely dishonest. You won't find a single redeemable white male character. Based on the movie, you would have to conclude most white males are either skinheads, frat rapists, or moronic racist campus police. The only truly positive white female character happens to be a lesbian (Jennifer Connelly), whose place in the film is mystifying for me until I read a lot of her relationship with Kristen is cut out (Could it be sexuality is more scary than race? I don't know why they cut it out, just a possibility). I don't count Kristen as a positive character because she is portrayed as being so weak. The film also dumbs itself down at times, as in the scene where Malik rants about Christopher Columbus for example (Malik doesn't know anything about Frederick Douglass, but he's suddenly an expert on colonial history?). And Remy's descent into white supremacy is laughable (He's becoming racist because his black roommates wouldn't turn down their stereo?). The white supremacists are so poorly acted (aside from Cole Hauser) and so much caricatures, it's hard to see why they should be feared (Real skinheads are much more frightening).And yet, there are some superb scenes. The conclusion of Remy's story was powerful. It would have been interesting to hear Malik's thoughts on Remy after that moment. Does he pity Remy? Does he forgive him? Maybe that's just me though, as I've experienced the anger that comes with having a friend murdered.The moments where we see Professor Phipps (Laurence Fishburne) struggling to reach Malik are also gripping. And any scene with Michael Rappaport is powerful. Despite the ridiculous lack of justification for his transformation, he makes it work well.In the end, the performances are what redeems the movie, starting with Rappaport. Fishburne is excellent, and every scene he is in keeps your eyes glued to the screen, despite an accent that disappears at times. Ice Cube is great as a perpetual senior, who is also the smartest character in the movie. It makes you wonder why he isn't getting more serious roles. Regina King, Cole Hauser, Adam Goldberg, Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks round out the honorable mentions. Although part of me felt Goldberg's role was a stereotype. Kristy Swanson does a respectable job, but her storyline is a mess. At the beginning she is shown being nervous around Malik because he's black. Yet she has no issue with Regina King's character? And she's the one the filmmakers chose to organize a unity rally? I suppose it's the scene were King has Ice Cube and his friends rough up the frat boy that tried to rape her that's supposed to represent her transformation, but I think that should have been explored more. They never really showed her coming to terms with the attempted rape. And the lesbian angle remains unresolved. Her story just didn't make much sense.In the end, this film is worth seeing, if only for the excellent cast. It doesn't treat politics, race, or sex with any real honesty.

When a truly original movie is first released, they almost always trash it, then, half a lifetime later finally give it the credit it deserves. This cycle never breaks. If critics were politicians, their first priority would be how pretty America looks in the eyes of the world while ignoring the core issues. So when you see two middle-aged men come on TV and proclaim their critics, then further proclaim that Peeping Tom is an exciting, original, daring film, it's historically proved that there is a good chance they used to hate it. But if they were wrong then, what makes you think they are right now? Critics are a spineless paradox within a spineless paradox. I can't even take them seriously anymore. However, it seems that their influence is the reason Peeping Tom is so well-received by today's audiences. Here is why they're wrong. Again.Think about how many times have you've heard this plot A man is obsessed with studying a certain aspect of human psychology, thus he kills unsuspecting women to further his studies. He is psychologically unstable himself, and the story arcs into a person-vs.-self as he faces his own demons. Then, without spoiling anything, insert the most predictable\/cliché solution to this problem at the generic climax. Suicide. Who would have guessed? I could list a lot of '40s novels that repeated that tired formula, as well as quite a few '50s movies. There is nothing, not a single thing, about Peeping Tom that is even a mildly original idea. Not only that, but even the execution of the film is a copy\/paste rip-off of Hitchcock and some Italian directors such as Dario Argento. It's a generic serial killer movie, with some minor Giallo influence. Maybe this just sounds like pretentious film buff jargon, but what I mean to say is Peeping Tom is a generic serial killer movie with pseudo-originality. I give it some minor credit for not being as cliché as it could have been, but, really, who cares? If you've seen one movie like this, you've seen them all.The other glaring problem Peeping Tom has is the overt lack of any entertainment value whatsoever. The plot plays out predictably, and if you don't know everything that is going to happen after the first 5 minutes, I feel sorry for your lack of intelligence. The plot just chugs along with predictable plot point after predictable plot point, with absolutely nothing interesting happening whatsoever. There is even a hilarious love interest convention added in. It's reminiscent of the absurd romance between King Kong and Ann Darrow. The main difference is, here, the love subplot is just thrown in to move along the predictable plot to get to the predictable ending. Without the love subplot, there would be no reason for the killer to face his demons, and without that there would be no cliché storyline&#151;and how could we live without that? This eventually leads to the unintentional laugh-out-loud scene where the killer says, Don't look afraid! If you don't, I won't kill you! I'm sorry, but that has to be THE single most melodramatic line in cinema history. I don't care how pseudo-creative the idea of a man killing to examine fear is, it's absolutely stupid. I would call Peeping Tom a comedy if it weren't so painfully boring.And, my God, it's boring. The director simply could not think of a more boring way to flesh out this boring plot. Most of the screen time is devoted to a mild-mannered killer staring at his films with an oh-so-dramatic look on his face. The build up for kills almost always lasts close to 15 minutes of pure dead-time where the women do some of the stupidest things imaginable. One of them even dances. It was so embarrassingly stupid I could hardly even look at the screen. In another scene, police stand around and make bad jokes over a dead body until one of them melodramatically says, with pure '30s cheese flair, Let's not forget there's still a maniac on the loose! Really, could the logic in this movie possibly get more stupid? It acts as if every human being has the intelligence level of a cartoon character. And yet we complain Napoleon Dynamite is stupid, but this is fine cinema?Overall, Peeping Tom is a waste of your time. If serial killers entertain you, go watch an episode of CSI. You'll get the same exact plot as you get here, but with infinitely more entertainment value and intelligence. Either way, I really just would like to know how many times the serial killer plot can be repeated, rehashed, remade, repeated, repeated, repeated until people finally get sick of it. In other words Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side.Did you laugh at that? I'm pretty sure you didn't. Why didn't you laugh at that? Because that joke has been repeated so many times it lost all humorous value to us. It's been repeated so many times, a lot of us don't even understand how it's a joke anymore. Peeping Tom is no different. By the year 1960, people had heard the plot so many times they didn't care anymore.

Both that and this film, to me, are very close in relation. They both are films of perfection, while Chinatown captures the pure essence of a very strange time, and in that you can only do so by caging the audience's ability to have open opinion. This film gives no room for anything of that manner. Chinatown catches something very humane that hasn't been perfected yet - the robot side of man. This film tells the story of real humans, and real men. A human isn't someone who is free, or truly happy with what they have, or what they'll be given - everyone is flawed, everything is flawed. Human's are robots - and robots are the true summation of what we describe as the human mind. It is said that us, as people, only use 10% of our true brain functions, abilities, and on and on. This is definitely true.Examples of other films that get what I'm saying, are films like 2001 A Space Odyssey, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Magnolia, Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter, The Shining, Sunset Blvd. and Apocalypse Now. They all pick apart the human anatomy in such a way that is completely mystical - unashamedly mystical.

Why exactly I don't know.It's not horrible or anything like that, there have certainly been worse slashers made. Intentionally or not (I believe the latter) the film does build up a certain amount of mood in the opening 50 minutes or so, with the introduction of the would-be victims. This flick drags on forever without anything really happening in that time, but somehow it goes by pretty nicely. Solid performances by Curtis and Leslie Nielsen could explain part of that.The execution of the all-important final third (i.e. the killings) is awfully poor. The kills are unimaginative, poorly timed and paced and very clumsily done. I did like the fact that the killer here fumbled a bit in trying to off the characters (after all; not everyone has the super powers of Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees) but editing here and lazy direction kill the suspense.Spoilers Also, the red herrings! Talk about cheaply done. Throwing in an employee on the school grounds who's mysteriously present at odd moments and always gives the girls a sinister look and there's no payoff with the dude. He's just there to look suspicious.The maniac who escapes from a mental asylum and nothing happens with that dude either. Every viewer over the age of twelve knows he's not responsible for what's about to happen. And we're not even rewarded with an extra kill scene or something. This is cheap.And what happened to Leslie Nielsen and his wife? Did the ground eat them up? They just disappear and don't even show up for the dramatic finale! I agree with a reviewer who stated this fact and said only lazy film-making.End of spoiler.Prom Night squanders it's potential in a big way. Now, I love good slashers and this film gets high marks for having Jamie Lee Curtis in it and Leslie Nielsen but I think 4 is being quite generous.Although I found it a novelty to have the big showdown in the end accompanied by cheesy disco music.

Why exactly I don't know.It's not horrible or anything like that, there have certainly been worse slashers made. Intentionally or not (I believe the latter) the film does build up a certain amount of mood in the opening 50 minutes or so, with the introduction of the would-be victims. This flick drags on forever without anything really happening in that time, but somehow it goes by pretty nicely. Solid performances by Curtis and Leslie Nielsen could explain part of that.The execution of the all-important final third (i.e. the killings) is awfully poor. The kills are unimaginative, poorly timed and paced and very clumsily done. I did like the fact that the killer here fumbled a bit in trying to off the characters (after all; not everyone has the super powers of Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees) but editing here and lazy direction kill the suspense.Spoilers Also, the red herrings! Talk about cheaply done. Throwing in an employee on the school grounds who's mysteriously present at odd moments and always gives the girls a sinister look and there's no payoff with the dude.
