I was immediately entranced with the main character, Max Fischer, and the movie itself but I just couldn't tell exactly why. I watched it several more times that week and was able to place it. Max speaks like an adult with a teenager's sensibility and judgment. He is completely endearing and wonderful as a character. I'm convinced that no one could have played him better than Jason Schwartzman does.This is not to say that he is the only character that stands out. He is just the one that does so the most. Bill Murray as Mr. Herman Blume is absolutely hysterical. He just plays the part so well, making you believe a man of his age could be friends with a boy of Max's age. Olivia Williams as Ms. Cross adds a certain sensibility and kindness to the role at the beginning but is able to be as harsh as she needs to be later on. I could talk about all of the actors and what wonderful jobs they did but let's just say they all did great and move on (excluding the twins who played Ronnie and Donnie, they acted poorly, but it worked for their characters).The next thing you have to take into account for this movie is the soundtrack. It is absolutely astounding. It captures every moment in the movie perfectly. The songs licensed for the movie were obviously chosen carefully. The score that was recorded for the movie is phenomenal. It's quirky and different and fits the mood like a glove.The last thing I want to talk about is Wes Anderson. Here he proves himself as an excellent filmmaker. This screenplay he produced, with the help of Owen Wilson, is excellent. This movie is infinitely quotable. Not to mention his work as a director. This movie is superb on every level. I guess the only thing left to talk about is the cinematography. It's nothing new or inventive but there are no useless, ugly, or misplaced shots. Some of the shots are quite nice actually.With it's clever wit, loads of heart, and comedic timing this movie is immediately endearing. However, I have found that for some it takes repeat viewings to understand the glory of this film. So if you didn't like it the first time, please I implore you, try it again. One last note, anyone who only cares for normal Hollywood big-budget fodder need not apply. This is more of a thinking man's movie. 10 out of 10.

The guy is so smooth, so, right in just about everything he does, that I wish there were more like him. In Blame it on Rio he plays a married, middle aged man in a marriage that may be on its last legs. He and a wonderful Joe Bologna set off on a trip to Brazil with each other's daughters in tow. When things heat up between Caine and the much younger (and may I say Unbelievably HOT) 18 year old daughter of his best friend, the laughs ensue. The script fires on all cylinders as you laugh out loud at some of the one liners and hilarious situations these people find themselves in. Towards the end the movie becomes slightly serious, but on the whole its a comedy for people that enjoy good comedic writing. (So lost nowadays!) I found myself bursting out in fits of laughter especially when Caine and Bologna are wrestling and the silent maid walks in. Really funny stuff, well played by all. Highly Recommended!

He was obviously a handsome, confident police officer who most women would find attractive..so why was he so insecure..what made him so crazy...I think there should have been some reasons as to why he was that way other than he was just a nut. I mean, even in Fatal Attraction, you had some idea as to why Glenn Close was a wacko..she was a suicidal, insecure woman, and not very attractive. And Anthony Perkins in Psycho was crazy because his mother was overbearing and mean. Jennifer Jason Leigh in Single White Female was very insecure and jealous of her twin sister. So, what was Pete Davis's deal?? Also, I thought Kurt Russell's character was stupid when he told him off in the nightclub. He knew he was a twisted person, so why couldn't he just tell him in a nice way that he didn't want to continue their friendship, instead of telling him to get the f out of here!...he was just asking for trouble.

Many fans and critics believe the musical is one of the best ever; I disagree. But it is quite unusual in several respects, I suggest first because its background is so realistic as a milieu from which to draw appealing characters and opportunities to introduce songs; and second because the film is played on the edge of parody without ever really falling into that error. The three characters at the center of the film are a love triangle. Don Lockwood, played amiably by Gene Kelly, is the on-screen partner of Lina Lamont (Oscar-worthy Jean Hagen); she has mistaken his sincere performance for real interest; he is in love with Kathy Selden, played by too-young but plucky nineteen-year-old Debbie Reynolds, about whom Lina knows nothing. The professional duo are completing one more romantic adventure film as a silent when suddenly sound is introduced into movies. The studio executives panic; and Don and his partner, played by Donald O'Connor, convince the director, craggy-faced and very realistic Douglas Fowley, to get the studio to let them remake the film as a musical--completing the unfinished portion, etc. The problem turns out not to be Don's transition to talkies but Lina's; she has the voice of a screech owl. Coaching becomes necessary; sensational dance numbers are introduced, including Kelly's solo Singin' in the Rain, motivated by his falling in love with Kathy; Donald O'Connor's Make 'Em Laugh acrobatic classic; and the unnecessary but very-well-done Gotta Dance showcase ballet with Cyd Charisse as a gangster's moll, and Kelly as a Broadway hopeful. Then, the film is completed and debuted; of course Lina has found out about Kathy. And of course this intelligent satire works out well for all concerned, after some trials and tribulations. Great fun is gotten I suggest from the actors having to learn to talk into the flowers, where early microphones had to be hidden, etc. Harold Rosson provided the cinematography, with art direction by Randall Duell and Cedric Gibbons. Nacio Herb Brown's songs were intelligently recycled for the film. Arthur Freed, MGM's master musical specialist, had the use of the talents of Betty Comden and Adolph Green for the screenplay and one song, Moses Supposes; he also had then-28- year-old nice guy Stanley Donen as director, soon to add On The Town and Seven Brides For Seven Brothers to this triumph. Walter Plunkett did the period costumes, with complex set decorations being done by Jacques Mapes and Edwin B. Willis. The studio's boss was played by Millard Mitchell, with Rita Moreno and a dozen familiar faces in smaller parts and uncredited appearances such as Joi Lansing, Paul Maxey, Sylvia Lewis, Kathleen freeman, King Donovan, Dawn Addams, Elaine Edwards, Mae Clarke and Snub Pollard. The film was influential, I assert, my criterion for including it among these reviews, because, immediately afterward, other 1920s and period projects were inspired by its success; these included, Has Anybody Seen My Gal, the TV show So This is Hollytwood, and ultimately The Great Race, The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond Story and a hundred others, including a few musicals. I consider it to be genial, a clever period evocation, lightweight, exuberant, youthful, and a very seminal work with a strong central character and unusually-interesting reality background.

The relationship between the four temps never seemed like the Ya-Ya Sisterhood or anything like that, but it was still a shock to see how rapidly things deteriorated between them.

The relationship between the four temps never seemed like the Ya-Ya Sisterhood or anything like that, but it was still a shock to see how rapidly things deteriorated between them. And the brilliance of the kaleidoscope-like script by the Sprecher sisters is evident in how the responsibility for the loss of friendships changes with different viewings. Is it the fault of Margaret, who is too smart to play dumb but might be much more happy if she could learn to try? Of Iris, who at a crucial moment makes a judgment about Margaret, and then doesn't correct it? Or Paula, who is the first person to turn on Margaret and only seems interested in her own life? Or Jane, who is a shell of a person? Maybe it's Cleo the full-time worker, or Barbara the officer Rule Bitch, or---the situation that the company puts them all in, hoping to assign blame, not unlike what I was considering.I related more strongly to this movie having been an office temp worker than I suspect I would have if I'd never taken on such work. The company I worked at was actually a great place, and my boss was a terrific guy who knew mine (and everyone else's) names. Yet the work was mostly repetitive typing and filing, there were times when I simply had nothing to do and ended up scrambling to fill the time, and the thought of doing a job like that for longer than the period I did it (eight weeks) would have been like a prison sentence embedded in free society. I decided to leave because I needed to find a full-time job, and was lucky to do so about a month after my last temp day. CLOCKWATCHERS gets the tone of temp life down pitch-perfectly; no matter how good being a temp can be, it's a lower caste in the office system, period.And the last few scenes, where Iris pulls off a downright brilliant plan to help her friend at last, is a perfect capper here. 9\/10.

The characters of this film are so beautifully played that I feel I do the actors and actresses an injustice by using the expression played. This narcissistic a**hole (Cruise's character) is given a gift that few in human history have had or will ever discover, and rightly so he loses it altogether. That alone would make a riveting and poignant story, but this story has a remarkable and intellectual twist that has been hard-pressed into your face throughout the entire film. This film makes you laugh when it wants you to laugh and it makes you sad the moment you feel content. This film makes you want to feel cheerless and for that you are grateful. To have a few moments to maybe feel closer to a character or feel that you would have done it different, maybe better, maybe said no to Julia, maybe won Sophia after the accident. You might feel that you would never have been in the awkward situation of having an invidious lover that knows you have fallen for another. Just the fact that you suffer these emotions shows how affecting and powerful this film is. I, for one, feel that this film is more touching than the creators or actors can take acknowledgment for unaided. This film delivers you each human emotion in a measure that perhaps some cannot accept. From the undeniable love of a character to the discomfiture and trepidation of that same character only moments later. It spins you and tricks you and leads you on in a way that you cannot trust it, but this film can be trusted to explain everything if only you are capable of understanding. Not capable in an intellectual sense, but capable in an emotional sense. This film has an underlying sensation about it, something that you desire but at the same time something that you have told yourself to avoid all your years, like falling in love. I would give anything to have what Cruise's character had. The most powerful part of this film, for me, was in the elevator when 'Tech support' told Cruise's character about his own memorial when Sophia arrived crying. &#133;.You were missed David&#133;..it was Sophia who never fully recovered; it was she who somehow knew you best, and like you she never forgot that one night when true love seemed possible.....consequences David&#133;..it's the little things. The little things, there's nothing bigger is there?Shakespeare's 'Sweet sorrow' would never scratch the surface of the parting of David and Sophia on that rooftop. Pain, a vacuum of pain and emptiness on a level few can comprehend is more closely in sight of that moment. Knowing full well the real Sophia has been dead for over a century does not help our poor, transformed David. How can we as humans speak of powerful emotion without speaking of true love? What emotion is more powerful? What else is there, really?

The central character, Professor Philip Brainard, is a brilliant inventor who has not only invented a robot that will do the housework for him but has also cracked the artificial intelligence problem by producing Weebo, a computer with its own personality that can not only talk to him but also fly. At present he is working on flubber, a rubbery substance that will allow cars and other objects to fly through the air. For all his intellectual brilliance, however, his private life is so disorganised that he has forgotten to turn up to his own wedding to his attractive sweetheart Sara, not once but three times.The plot turns upon Brainard's attempts to produce his flubber, which he sees as a solution to the financial problems confronting the college at which he teaches and of which Sara is the principal. (Like another reviewer, I found myself wondering why he didn't just try marketing his domestic robot or his talking computer, inventions which I thought would have had just as much commercial potential). Along the way, he has to fight off Wilson, the handsome but too smooth principal of another college who is his rival for Sara's affections, and a corrupt businessman who wants to use the flubber for his own selfish ends.The film was clearly designed as a comedy for children, and works quite well as such, aided by a good deal of slapstick humour, mostly involving Robin Williams as Brainard. Unlike some children's films, however, such as the Harry Potter series, this one does not have much in it to keep adults entertained. Williams is clearly a talented comedian, but strangely enough, with a few exceptions such as Mrs Doubtfire, he has been most successful in films with a serious purpose like Dead Poets Society or Good Morning Vietnam, although even in these he often manages to find a use for his comic talents. In many of his comedies his talents just seem wasted. Club Paradise is an example, and Flubber is another. All the other characters, with one exception, just seem like stock figures with little individuality about them.The one exception is Weebo the computer. The British computer pioneer Alan Turing devised what has since become known as the Turing Test for deciding whether a machine can be said to be intelligent. A human judge engages in a conversation with two other parties, one a human and the other a machine; if the judge cannot tell which is which, the machine is said to pass the test. Unfortunately, if the human involved were one of those in this film, Weebo would fail the test. She (Weebo has a female voice and personality) is smart, funny, sensitive and lovable, much more so than anyone else in the film, so it would be easy to tell them apart. And when your most interesting character is an electronic rather than a flesh-and-blood one, your film has got problems. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2005","score":"14 out of 29 people found the following review useful","review":" Flubber is based upon that old comedy cliché, the absent-minded scientific genius.

The entire cast is well chosen and the chemistry between John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John is perfect. The choreography is excellent, especially in Greased Lightning and the dance-off contest. Some viewers have commented that they don't like the fact that Sandy changes her image at the end of the movie. I didn't think this was a big deal, but I guess one could interpret this as a result of peer pressure. I think Sandy was waiting until she was confident enough to deal with the consequences of an adult relationship with Danny. Sandy sings that she's scared and unsure of herself shortly before her transformation.

If we all waited for the acceptance of other people before pursuing something, most of us would still be waiting around 20 years later.I'm glad casting decided to choose 2 leads who can sing instead of picking non-singers to lip sync.

It is an idea that probably derives from memories of classics lessons at school and that quip from Juvenal's satires about Roman emperors providing their subjects with panem et circenses (bread and circuses), although it is not one that has been generally borne out by modern totalitarian regimes. The Soviet Union and its satellites preferred a mixture of state-sponsored high culture and propaganda to rollerball-type violence. Had the Nazi regime, by some evil mischance, survived into modern times, a typical evening for the German viewer would be speeches by Party leaders, a Wagner opera live from Bayreuth and a soap opera about the happy lives of an Aryan family under National Socialism, probably followed by a documentary inviting Germans to sneer at the cheap, tacky game shows dished up as entertainment in decadent democracies like America.By the year 2017, according to this film, America is no longer a democracy, but it is certainly decadent, and the game shows are cheaper and tackier than ever. The country has become a poverty-stricken dictatorship, reliant on violent and thuggish security forces to maintain order. Unable to provide its citizens with a regular supply of panem (food riots are commonplace), the government is forced to rely heavily on circenses. Each dictatorship has its own style of circus. Hitler had the Nuremberg rallies, Stalin had the May Day parades and America's future fascists have The Running Man, a television game show complete with showbiz razzamatazz, scantily-dressed showgirls and an obnoxiously smug, self-satisfied host, Damon Killian. This is, however, a game show with a difference. The contestants are criminals who are forced to run for their lives pursued by a gallery of hired assassins. The winners are theoretically rewarded with their freedom, although in practice nobody ever wins. The main character is Ben Richards, a policeman framed for a crime he did not commit. After escaping from jail and being recaptured, he is sentenced to take part in the show along with two members of an underground resistance movement and Amber, a young woman who initially betrayed him to the security forces but who has herself aroused the suspicion of the authorities after staring to doubt Richards's guilt.The film was clearly made with satirical intent, aimed particularly at the way entertainment was developing in the late eighties. Its predictions about the way things might go in the future often seem uncomfortably close to home when seen from the vantage-point of 2005. The popular mid-nineties game show Gladiators, for example, looks suspiciously like a version of The Running Man without the bloodshed, and the reality programmes which are unfortunately so much in vogue today pander to milder versions of the sadism and voyeurism which motivate the spectators seen in the film.The danger, however, of satirising this sort of entertainment is that one will become the thing one is attacking. There was doubtless an element of conscious hypocrisy here; the film is a satire on violent and exploitative entertainment, and also violent and exploitative entertainment itself. The spectators of the fictitious game show start out supporting the assassins, but as Richards turns the tables on his adversaries they begin to root for him, and the film's audience are encouraged to root for him too as he turns into a futuristic Rambo. High-minded satire will only take you so far in the cinema, and the film-makers evidently felt that there was more commercial mileage in combining a standard good-guy-against-bad-guys plot with a certain amount of low-minded satire.Another element in the film is sardonic humour reminiscent of the James Bond films. Whenever Richards dispatches one of his enemies he does so with a deadpan quip a la Roger Moore. (If you can imagine Roger Moore speaking with a heavy Germanic accent). I have never been Arnold Schwarzenegger's greatest admirer, but I have to admit that he can do deadpan well. Unfortunately, it is about the only thing he does well. Indeed, in this film it's about the only thing he does at all. Arnie's lack of emotional versatility , however, is not fatal. He certainly looks physically right as an action hero, and his ability to project a physical presence was clearly an important element in his success as an actor in this sort of film. (This is a more important element than is sometimes realised; I was never able to believe in Michael Keaton's Batman, for example, precisely because he lacked that ability).

Edward Norton, which gained about 30 pounds of muscle for this movie was astonishingly, with his roll and how he played it. Edward Furlong also played a good role. Here is a review of the movie. The story follows an intelligent young man named Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and his decline into the world of disillusion and hate known as White Supremacy. Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) buffed up to 190 pounds, with a shaved head, swastika tattoo, biker goatee and a feral, angry gaze, he is one scary image. Once a thoughtful and easy-going teen, he soon begins his change when his casually racist firefighter father is killed while trying to put out a fire in a black neighborhood. Falling under the wind of a neo-Nazi (Stacy Keach), Derek becomes a recruiting agent for local white kids. While the local movement grows, Derek gets deeper and deeper in, polluted more and more by hate. This all comes together when Derek kills two black gang members who tried to steal his truck. He is caught and sent to jail, where he is shown the error of his ways. The hard way. With the help of one of his former teachers (Avery Brooks), Derek begins to reform. However, it may be too little too late. While Derek was in prison, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is starting to head down the same path. Now, aside from trying to leave the world he created he has to save his little brother from it too.

The love triangle between Penny Lane, William and Russell was brilliantly done, especially the part she learns she has been sold to another band for beer. What kind of beer? she smiles with tears streaming down her face. The film is full of fantastic scenes like that, brought to life by the fantastic performances especially Kate Hudson's.Its also very funny and contains a lot more laughs then so called dedicated comedies but such is the excellence of the drama and relationships its often overlooked. The speech Russell is giving to the drunk kid at the party, the drummers revelation on the plane, not only funny but impeccably timed to raise the spirits just when things may start getting too heavy.And thats why its so great I think. Its just a film that makes you feel good. Its a film that leaves you thinking about the characters and what lies in store for them long after the story is over.

His parents were both killed in a car crash when he was very young and he has always been quite strange ever since. Lately, he has been feeling a little stranger than usual. His cousin Dudley has been attacked by a snake when Harry wanted to hurt him and mysterious letters for Harry have been showing up that The Dursleys have UN-mistakenly been trying to hide form him. Harry soon finds out the reason for all of these incidents He is a wizard. Not only that, he also finds out that he will be attending Hogwarts (Wizarding school for Wizards and Witches) and that his parents were murdered by the most evil of all wizards, Voldemort, who was mysteriously destroyed by Harry.On his journey to Hogwarts, Harry makes two friends in Ron Weasely (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) along with a rival in Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Harry quickly learns of life in the wizard world and finds himself to be quite the celebrity due to his Quidditch (A popular wizard sport played on brooms) skills and his encounter with Voldemort. The movie also stars Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape.This is the first of seven beloved movies adapted from the books by J.K. Rowling. In general, the book is usually better than the movie, and this is no exception, although it is a wonderful adaptation. The acting of the kids was made the movie incredibly entertaining and the effects were done brilliantly. This comes as no surprise, due to the massive book sales that created such a large budget for the film. But one of the greatest things about this movie is that they didn't go for star actors. Yes, you do have Richard Harris and Alan Rickman but they very well-known. Even the biggest star in the movie John Cleese played the very minor role of Nearly Headless Nick. This was a great opportunity to make another great saga of film and they made a wonderful start by not using big names. Overall, this is a great beginning to what hopes to be incredible chronicles and is a wonderful adaptation of the book.I recommend this film ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin Dudley AKA the Dursleys.

And with that said people already have expectations   and hopes for the film and then are probably let down because it does   not live up to the hype .

On the   whole it one of those leave your brain at the door movies that provides   to be good fast paced entertainment which has 2 other major film   elements and they are Resivour Dogs and Dog Day Afternoon but in its   own way is a wacky piece of work with a lot of hardcore drug taking ,   joking about and a bank heist in which everything could go wrong, did   go wrong ! There is not much Chracther development in here so don't   expect much and the movie starts of really quickly and ends really   abruptly as well .

Both men are apprehended and condemned to die as punishment for their actions. The way to die is beheading by guillotine, or the widow in the vernacular.Thus begins this story that director Patrice Leconte directed, based on the screen play by Claude Faraldo. The story is set in the remote island of Saint Pierre, off the coast of Newfoundland. This is a hostile environment settled by the French. Saint Pierre boasts a lot of widows who have survived the rigors of the climate and the hard lives their husbands led.Into this milieu we find a military captain and his wife. Both are Parisians and appear to be compassionate, at heart. When Neel, the surviving drunk is brought to be kept in a cell within the military quarters of the island, the wife, Madame La, takes an interest in the man. With her husband's consent, she asks for his help in tending a green house in the premises and other errands.Neel and Madame La are at simple view, just opposites. The kindness Neel sees in her, transforms him. Madame La even goes to help him learn to read. All these actions don't sit well with the rest of the inhabitants and the people in the government who demand a guillotine is sent over and have him execute the prisoner.The film works because the brilliant performance of Juliette Binoche, who as Madame La, makes her mark in the picture. Her compassion for Neel is genuine; in her heart she believes this man, a product of the environment in which he was born, shows qualities that no one has seen in him.Emir Kusturica, a noted film director himself, is also one of the assets of the movie. Mr. Kusturica is a large man with unkempt looks, who is totally believable as Neel. His interaction with Madame La turns from gratitude into a noble love that is not meant to be.The other principal is Daniel Auteuil who is perfect as the captain, the husband of Madame La, who is outraged by what he perceives to be the wrong punishment for the accused Neel. In spite of the menacing presence of Neel next to his wife, he trusts her as he knows her kind heart belongs to him only.La veuve de Saint Pierre is a great movie that will satisfy viewers in search of a different story. Patrice Leconte has directed with panache as he takes us to see the beauty of Saint Pierre, something that is so bleak, yet it's a place that has a magnetic attraction as we watch the film unfold.
