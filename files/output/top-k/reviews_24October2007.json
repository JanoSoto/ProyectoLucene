So I was glad to see these people and this family in a movie.

Still, she wrote a very heartfelt and charming movie about an experience neglected by movies generally, so it's hard to fault her too much. Film is rarely so corny as it might have been, another tribute to Vardalos. Her voice-over narration didn't work, however- it played like a bad stand-up act on the subject- and I was glad it wasn't in much of the movie.

The sorts of films I'm referring to are things like the American Pie and Scary Movie series', respectively.Plains, Trains & Automobiles is a no nonsense, out and out farce of a film that constantly remains very, very real and toys with the notion that 'everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.'

It's that bad. The late 1980s saw a period of lazy film-making, and Creepshow 2 is the epitome of such artistic malaise. Usually when so many years pass between an original and a sequel, it means that the filmmakers are really trying to outdo themselves. Terminator 2 would come to mind. But with Stephen King and George Romero again behind the creative process, this film is a huge disappointment. Perhaps it was the no-name director that doomed things, but its Romero's name on the stale script.Creepshow 2 is divided into three short segments as opposed to five in the original. All three have an interesting premise to start with, but the execution is very pedestrian. The first story deals with a wooden Indian statue coming to life to avenge the robbery and murder of an elderly couple who run a small general store. The Indian looks pretty neat, but he comes alive too late to help the couple. Why did he wait until they were dead? Maybe it was the red pain that got spilled on him that finally woke him up. Anyway, the segment is horribly written and wastes the talents of George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour. The second segment deals with four teenagers who swim out to a wooden raft at a secluded lake, only to be devoured by what looks like a bunch of trash bags sewn together. The acting is the worst part about this one, though. All four characters are not likable. Actor Daniel Beer who plays one of the kids gives the worst performance in the film. You could not give less life to lines in a script if you were in a coma. How bad were his first takes, I wonder? Anyway, this segment does have a nice and ironic ending. The final segment is the most memorable by far. A wealthy wife sneaking home from a roll in the sack with a gigolo hits a hitchhiker with her car and kills him. She then drives away before helping him since nobody saw her. Trouble is, he doesn't seem to want to stay dead. He keeps popping up wherever she drives and getting run over or shot repeatedly as she tries to escape. The gore is pretty heavy here as the guy gets turned into pulp while he keeps repeating, Thanks for the ride, lady! It's kind of a neat idea. Just not scary enough. And Stephen King makes what amounts to a throwaway cameo as a truck driver.Missing from the original is the great cast, humor, and above all the scares! Nothing in this one is scary at all. Nothing! In between the three segments is a poorly drawn animated bit about a kid getting revenge on the bullies in his neighborhood. This animation is so weak that it would have looked antiquated in the 1960s. Tom Savini seems wasted in this film as well. He has a worthless role as a masked man who throws a bunch of comic books out of a truck at the end. (trust me) He is listed as a makeup effects consultant in the credits. Here's a thought. Why not let him actually DO the effects? That way they might not have looked so cheap.If you see this film come on, don't bother with it. And from what I'm told, Creepshow 3 is even worse.

By the way, he was great; the acting, the directing was awesome and it's amazing how he, by the age of 26, had made such a big name for himself, being nominated for Best Actor and Best Director and winning one for Best Writing, Original Screenplay.

While I was watching it I kept imagining Billy Bob Thornton in the role of Louka, the lead character of the film. In fact, Zdenek Sverák, the actor who plays Louka, actually resembles slightly the Hollywood actor.All kidding aside, Kolya is actually pleasant viewing, the kind of sentimental middle-of-the-road, life-affirming fare that Hollywood seems to embrace when it comes time to pick out the Best Foreign Language Film nominees (See France's The Choir and Joyeux Noel as examples). This is not to denigrate its modest virtues, but really, this is the kind of film your grandmother would love.Kolya is about a 55-year old confirmed bachelor who despite his age, can still score hot chicks half his age that look like they came from the pages of Playboy Czech Republic edition (probably not surprising since Sverák also wrote the screenplay of the movie). Denied a place in the national philharmonic orchestra for not being politically correct enough, he makes ends meet with a variety of odd jobs, including playing for cremations and restoring headstones. Still, Louka is heavily in debt, he needs a car and his mother is nagging him for money to repair the family house.A gravedigger friend of his offers him the chance to make some serious money by entering into an arranged marriage with a Russian woman who wants to stay in Czechoslovakia longer. But the deal goes wrong when the wife defects to West Germany, leaving him in charge of little Kolya (played by cute but not too cute Andrei Chalimon), a kid he can't even talk to since he's not conversant in Russian.One of the most notable things about this film is its subtlety. Unlike a Hollywood movie, it does not rely on too-obvious characterizations to show the transformation in Louka. In fact, Louka does not have that far to go in his character arc from commitment-phobic bachelor to potential family man material; he's not a mean man, he simply does not want the responsibility of taking care of a child, in the same way that he has avoided getting married to avoid commitment.This subtlety extends to the ending, which follows its premise to its logical end. I won't tell you what happens, but you can probably figure it out. There are no big surprises at the end. But the filmmakers also allow for a happy ending for Louka, in a brief shot that you may miss if you blink.My irreverence toward Kolya does not mean that I didn't like the film. It's pleasant enough viewing, not great but not bad either. Its probably most notable for the pitfalls it avoids, rather than what it actually achieves. Perhaps it's good that the film was never remade by Hollywood after all. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 October 2007","score":"","review":" I'm puzzled why Hollywood never attempted a remake of Kolya.

But there's beauty and wit here, just the same. The music is well worth remembering. Still, there are nagging feelings- while everything in the movie WORKS, I get the feeling I didn't experience as much beauty here as the brothers intended me to.

This review sounds much more negative than it should, I rather liked the movie. I liked the Babyface Nelson stuff, the joke on local politics, the sirens, the toad, John Goodman beating people with a tree branch- there's plenty to like! But everything is at a distance, or else seems air-light and inconsequential,- for instance even allowing that it's a comedy and, being a Coen Bros film, is a play on style and stereotypes, does the viewer care if Clooney gets his wife and children back? I didn't. Nor do we mind much when it seems Pete has become a toad, nor when we find out he's been put back in a chain gang- nor, more importantly, does the movie seem to care. The only time one feels anything like concern for the characters is when they're about to be hung after having been pardoned- and even then my interest and my thoughts of How unfair! only lasted a second or two. Then I remembered what movie I was watching and thought, Oh, it's all so damn lackadaisical. Anyway, seven points for style.

Tarantino does a masterful job here in what I believe is his finest bit of work. The script is almost flawless, flowing exceptionally well throughout the movie. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue between Jackson and Travolta, with reference to arguments about the so called 'miracle' which takes place as in one scene when they are shot at close range but neither one is hit.

No unflappable hero like Cary Grant, no cool blonds to accompany the hero like Madeleine Carroll, or Grace Kelly, no McGuffin as Hitchcock always describes the object everyone is after in his films.The object our protagonist, in this case Henry Fonda, is after is to clear his good name. And The Wrong Man is based on the true story of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero who apart from working odd hours due to his job is your average normal family man. Fonda is a bass fiddle player in the orchestra at the famous swanky Stork Club in Manhattan.Fonda's Kafkaesque nightmare starts when wife Vera Miles needs some ready cash so he goes to borrow on his insurance policy. His dumb luck to walk into the insurance office and look like a man who had held the place up before. Fonda's even wearing the same type clothes.The insurance company calls the police and Detective Harold J. Stone is assigned. Remember this was the days before Miranda warnings were mandatory, otherwise had Fonda called a lawyer right then and there, he might not have gotten in this mess. Stone convinces himself he's got the right man and Fonda is arrested. When the police think they are on the right track it's mighty hard to dissuade them. Back when I was a working person as an investigator for the NYS Crime Victims Board, I handled a couple of claims arising out of the break-in murder of a lesbian woman in Brooklyn in 1995. The woman's partner was also injured by the same man who broke in. However the police were absolutely convinced that the partner herself had a hand in the killing. They told that to one and all who would listen including me in my official capacity. The partner's claim was held up as a result of this.As it turned out the police on a totally different case arrested a man who confessed to the break-in murder\/robbery. Now the partner was never arrested as Henry Fonda was, but she was under suspicion by all because the police investigating went on a totally different track. The surviving partner eventually got all that was due her by my agency. So I'm here to tell you that these things can and do happen in real life and the case of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero was no aberration.Actually though, as good as Fonda is in the part, the best work in the film is done by Vera Miles. She blamed herself and her mismanaging of the household finances as the reason for her husband's troubles. She suffers a complete mental breakdown as a result. Vera's performance was Oscar caliber stuff, it should have been considered by the Academy.Although it would seem a most odd choice for the role, British actor Anthony Quayle played Frank D. O'Connor, former State Senator, who defended Balestrero. O'Connor later worked the other side of the courtroom when he became District Attorney of Queens County, President of the New York City Council and Democratic candidate for Governor in 1966 against Nelson Rockefeller. O'Connor later went to the New York State Supreme Court where he was well respected. I'm sure O'Connor in real life was pleased with the way Anthony Quayle played him.Though a film like this would be more identified with someone like Jules Dassin, Alfred Hitchcock did a fine job. Pity the film was not better received because the movie going public expected certain things from a Hitchcock film.

As for the affair, I can't say I ever saw one shaping up. Grant gave Debbie a kiss on a flight of stairs, but all we saw of it was from the waist down so even that took place outside our view. In fact, the obvious consummation of their supposed deep romantic love did not seem to occur, even given the moral strictures of the late fifties when the movie was made. Since the word affair is in the title, however, I suppose we must surmise that the pair had sex somewhere along the line if only because they were reasonably sophisticated adults who'd never been married before. Setting that question aside for the moment, there WERE three or four nice scenes in the film. One was when Deborah invited Cary into her cabin but rejected his advances, then upon his retreat, suddenly suggested they go out to dinner. Another was when the ship made port in the Mediterranean and they visited his grandma, discovering that each of them were more or less devout Catholics and that grandma had given her spontaneous blessing to their potential union. We sensed the old woman would not be alive much longer, adding a poignant touch as she accompanied Kerr's singing on the piano and heard Grant speak French fluently. Another good scene was when the ship landed in New York and the pair critically assessed one another's steady flames. Finally, there is the last scene, in which Grant discovered that Kerr is the wheelchair-bound woman to whom his agent gave his painting and thus he suddenly understands all. Unfortunately, in between these interesting moments was a lot of silliness which at times was painful to watch. For example, why all of a sudden did Deborah decide that she couldn't be seen with Cary during most of the voyage, even though everyone on board the ship was well aware of their budding romance? It didn't make sense. And why was she playing music teacher to a bunch of cloying brats just because she couldn't walk? Quite obviously, it constituted a failed attempt to reprise her previous role as teacher at the royal Siamese court in The King and I, where her youthful charges were rather endearing, and more to the point, central to the plot of the story.Others have commented at length upon the silliness of the plot line, so I won't bother to belabor the point.

He just seems too arrogant and full of himself.Anyway, A Beautiful Mind begins with Nash's early years at Princeton University, and follows him to the time he was awarded the Nobel Prize. It charts his decline into schizophrenia very well, including a whopper of a twist that I did not see coming in a million years. Like John's friends and associates, I believed every word, no matter how far-fetched it all seemed after a while.I applaud any film that deals with mental illness in a serious way and doesn't poke fun at it. Aside from the fact that every Hollywood movie (and this one is NO exception) seems to feel the need to show at least one person gently rocking back and forth whenever we are shown a mental institution. I find it so bizarre that the gentle rocker seems to show up all the time...what condition is it that they think this guy has? Too much LSD while head banging to a Slayer concert? HERE COMIN'THE BIG SPOILS people That aside, A Beautiful Mind is a very well made film. Guaranteed if you enjoy it you'll want to see it a second time to spot all the William Parcher moments (my two favourites are when he first appears to talk to John outside the University dorm, and he just appears at the top of the stairs, you never see him actually open the door and walk through, nor do you hear it close behind him, because of course, he's not really there. And my other favourite is passing the security gate, where the guard doesn't notice Archer at all. I kicked myself for not picking that up the first time around!) The Paul Bettany character of Charles, Nash's imaginary roommate, is so awesome and such a great character that I found myself wishing he WAS real, and I genuinely felt sorry for him when Nash finally tells him he's not going to acknowledge him any more. I was feeling sorry for a figment of someone's imagination! Bettany is a legend, a great actor in my opinion (he's also terrific in another Crowe film, Master and Commander, and is even very good in the crappy rom-com Wimbledon).Jennifer Connelly plays Nash's wife, Alicia, who stuck by him all through his worst years, when his delusions were basically controlling his entire existence. Connelly never gets too teary-eyed or melodramatic, and has a strength in her eyes that compliments her picturesque beauty.Crowe's shuffling John Nash is great, a far-cry from Hando in Romper Stomper, let me tell you! He plays the sort of messed-up yet-still-smugly-intellectual character that should be worthy of derision but ends up being the exact opposite.
