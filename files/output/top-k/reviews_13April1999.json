The acting is incredible, Alec Guinness won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Colonel Nicholson.  The Cinematography, which also won an Academy Award, is beautiful (If you purchase this video, buy the widescreen. The formatted version does not capture the Cinematography as well.)  The musical score by Malcolm Arnold is great (Malcolm Arnold received an Oscar for his score).  The Screenplay is wonderful, and an amazing achievement considering two blacklisted writers were responsible for it.  Both Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson won an Academy Award for their screenplay.OK, so much for awards, but the little things make this movie great.  There are so many great lines and scenes throughout the movie.  The movie never tries to show the Japanese as the bad guys (just the enemy in war), but shows their constant fight to maintain their code of honor.  This is the ultimate struggle of the movie, can honor exist in war?  The British fight to maintain their honor, and the Japanese try to force their code of honor onto the British prisoners.  The movie has a message that should last through the ages.The final scene of the movie must be one of the greatest of all time.

Many old-fashioned movies which are said to be classic 'must see' pictures seem goofy and obvious to me. Movies like Casablanca are said to be filled with Nostalgic Charm but I simply disagree, as the acting is absolutely awful.Harvey's main character is Elwood.P.Dowd - a man who is so cheerful and polite everyone likes him until they meet Harvey, his friend. Now, Harvey isn't a rude fellow. In fact he never says anything that anyone can hear except Elwood (James Stewart). The problem with Harvey  is that he is invisible to everyone apart from Elwood!. Elwood tells us that Harvey is a big white rabbit. In fact, so big the rabbit is 6 foot 3 and a half inches tall. People immediately think Elwood is nutty when he tries to introduce them to Harvey. And the people who hate dealing with this the most are his sister Veta (Josephine Hull) and his sister's daughter Mertal May who are constantly made to endure Elwood's antics. Many parties and social gatherings are either ruined or canceled because of Elwood.The character Elwood.P.Dowd is one of the most likable characters I've ever met in a movie. He's so gentle to everyone and he is polite and never has a nasty word to say. He always has some great philosophies on life and some great little stories to tell. This character is so likable due to two factors.  The first factor is the movie's script. This is easily the best script I've seen in a comedy movie. Every joke just seems to work - even the most obvious ones for which there are very little. And the 2nd factor is the actor James Stewart. This is easily the best performance of his career. How he did not win best actor in the Oscars is something I'll never understand.There are some many delightful scenes in this movie which get better with every passing viewing. This is the sort of film which you could watch 4 times in one year and still enjoy it the next time you watch it. This film has a lot to say. It offers many kind philosophies and little words of wisdom which I will not give away and nearly all of its humor is original and heavily smile inducing.

In fact, it's not even the best film of '97. But it's a great movie. The visual effects are amazing, but some of the acting is awful (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and especially Billy Zane). The last 1 1\/2 hours of it are an emotional powerhouse, but a LOT of the dialogue is cheesy. Also, it made me angry that Leo, Kate, and Gloria Stuart (she was good, but not great) got all the acting spotlight shined on them, when it was Kathy Bates' finely tuned performance that stole every scene and showed that she can truly do everything an actress can do and more. The Billy Zane character was poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly conceived. All he was missing was a pencil-thin mustache and an evil laugh. There was a lot of talk about how bad the script was. The script was great. Sure, the dialogue sucked, but dialogue is about 10% of a screenplay. And storytelling is the other 90%. James Cameron's storytelling abilities are, today, only matched by Spielberg's.Something I really hated about it was when everyone compared it to Gone With the Wind. What is up with that?!?!?!?! Sure, there are some similarities in the plot, but Gone with the Wind is regarded by many as the best movie ever and a classic. There is no awful dialogue. There are no awful , one-dimensional characters. There are no bad performances. It's just full of good old-fashioned Hollywood storytelling at its best. It is more entertaining than Titanic, too. It is a half an hour longer, but holds your attention even better than Titanic ever could. Plus, if you take into account inflation, Gone With the Wind made twice as much as Titanic in America alone.

Unfortunately, what starts out promising ends up as just a ho-hum by the time the film creaks to a close.The movie uses a single scene in the lobby of a supermarket as its core from which to sprout three different stories using alternative points of view. All are tied together neatly at the end, but ultimately the film leaves the viewer with a huh?  wha- happened? and who cares?The first tale, the best one, has Ronna (Sarah Polley) in a big bind.  Rent is past due and she's looking at eviction.  When the opportunity to sell some hits of the drug ecstacy presents itself to her, she goes for it.  What follows is a harrowing scene in a  drug dealer's apartment; another well shot sequence in a hotel room with some small-time actors in way over their heads; and an exhilarating rave party where a showdown of sorts occurs. It's all well done and had me interested.  The acting here was superb, especially Polley, Katie Holmes as Claire and Timothy Olyphant as the drug dealer Todd Gaines.This story blends into the second tale and, alas, this is where things start to come apart.  A group of buddies hit Las Vegas ready to party.  But things quickly go bad when two of them lay in the hotel room doubled up with food poisoning.  The other two, Marcus (Taye Diggs) and Simon (Desmond Askew) head downstairs for some gambling.  But things really start to go wrong when the two boost a car and then shoot their way out of a strip club.  Soon, killers are after all four of them.  I was interested in this story, but it lacked the inventiveness and mood of the first.  Diggs and Askew are fine here, but the story itself lacked creativity and an original vision (yep, that's right, another car chase...oh goodie).Finally, like a bad rollercoaster ride (all the fun at the front, kiddie time the rest of the way), we get to the film's third act.  Not that it is so bad (I liked the bit in the cop's apartment with the wife and two guys wondering what the heck they've gotten themselves into).  But it DRAGGED. By the time it sputters to a conclusion, we've tied up all the loose ends, but that's all that's been done.Director Liman certainly has an eye for details and technically the movie is fine.  I liked the vision of a person who's on extasy and how they view a rave.  Liman, in two of his films, shows us a different type of Los Angeles than what we've seen before, and I'd like to see if he can develop a better project next time out.In a movie like this, though, the third tale should be the strongest.  It has to wrap everything up cleanly and leave the viewer with a WOW!  We didn't get that in this one.

Unfortunately, what starts out promising ends up as just a ho-hum by the time the film creaks to a close.The movie uses a single scene in the lobby of a supermarket as its core from which to sprout three different stories using alternative points of view. All are tied together neatly at the end, but ultimately the film leaves the viewer with a huh?  wha- happened? and who cares?The first tale, the best one, has Ronna (Sarah Polley) in a big bind.  Rent is past due and she's looking at eviction.  When the opportunity to sell some hits of the drug ecstacy presents itself to her, she goes for it.  What follows is a harrowing scene in a  drug dealer's apartment; another well shot sequence in a hotel room with some small-time actors in way over their heads; and an exhilarating rave party where a showdown of sorts occurs. It's all well done and had me interested.  The acting here was superb, especially Polley, Katie Holmes as Claire and Timothy Olyphant as the drug dealer Todd Gaines.This story blends into the second tale and, alas, this is where things start to come apart.  A group of buddies hit Las Vegas ready to party.  But things quickly go bad when two of them lay in the hotel room doubled up with food poisoning.  The other two, Marcus (Taye Diggs) and Simon (Desmond Askew) head downstairs for some gambling.  But things really start to go wrong when the two boost a car and then shoot their way out of a strip club.  Soon, killers are after all four of them.  I was interested in this story, but it lacked the inventiveness and mood of the first.  Diggs and Askew are fine here, but the story itself lacked creativity and an original vision (yep, that's right, another car chase...oh goodie).Finally, like a bad rollercoaster ride (all the fun at the front, kiddie time the rest of the way), we get to the film's third act.  Not that it is so bad (I liked the bit in the cop's apartment with the wife and two guys wondering what the heck they've gotten themselves into).  But it DRAGGED. By the time it sputters to a conclusion, we've tied up all the loose ends, but that's all that's been done.Director Liman certainly has an eye for details and technically the movie is fine.  I liked the vision of a person who's on extasy and how they view a rave.  Liman, in two of his films, shows us a different type of Los Angeles than what we've seen before, and I'd like to see if he can develop a better project next time out.In a movie like this, though, the third tale should be the strongest.  It has to wrap everything up cleanly and leave the viewer with a WOW!  We didn't get that in this one.

See my review of Dark City for another example of IMDB reviewers missing the boat.Cube is indie sci-fi psychological thriller based on the Hugo award winning, 1967, Harlan Ellison story, I Have No Mouth, And I Must scream. This book has been translated into 16 languages and has also been adapted into a graphic novel, Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor and a computer video game. (Before I get a thousand emails disagreeing with me; you might actually spend a moment with one of these three sources.)Clearly some changes have been made from the book which ultimately serve to better adapt it to film. For one, the novel is much more perverse than this movie which in itself has some amazingly graphic moments. The mood of both is the same with the book being darker and more nihilistic. (I know that's hard to believe) Additionally the books antagonist, the computer A.M., has been replaced with this unthinking, corporate, 'Cube.'The book like the film, places an unlikely group of people into this impossible situation and allows group dynamics and human behavior to take over. While A.M. actively sought to torture these humans we are lead to believe that the Cube was created by 'a failed human society' and that its killing of humans is more an act of committee rather than one of malice. In the book A.M. sought to keep these trapped humans alive even to the point of resurrecting them from suicide. The book focuses more on the interpersonal relationships as death would have been salvation to these poor souls. This change in direction for the film is key in that it allows for the generation of suspense (and thus excitement) through fear of death.Overall the simplification of the novel and the scenery are necessary, both for budget and time constraints. The excellent use of colored cube rooms undoubtedly affects our minds as much as the unwilling participants. The designs and traps seemingly inspired by Clive Barker bring a terrific sense of dread with wonderfully understated special effects. Some of the dialogue and characters are a bit over-acted but overall this is a terrific film. I am glad someone finally made this into a film and they did what they needed to in order to make it thrilling and thought provoking.I have not yet heard any directors commentary on this film but I imagine, like Dark City, the directors will deny any inspiration. This is likely a result of our lawsuit happy society rather than lack of character but I only wish they could credit the inspiration that made it happen or at the very least ask permission.Regardless it's a great film that I highly recommend - See it NOW!

I expected to see an entertaining movie, high on special effects and low on plot (a la Godzilla, but not as pathetic).  But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie, not only on the eye-candy level, but more importantly because the directors actually assumed that the majority of the movie-going public has some brains and likes to be intellectually stimulated.  What is really surprising is that the Wachowski brothers managed to do this using an action picture as the backdrop.  I was totally blown away during and after the film (a very rare occurrence), and I can't wait to see it again.  With only a couple of exceptions, I have never before wanted to see any movie more than once.  The Matrix is an exception. Beautiful to watch as he is, Keanu Reeves was totally believable as Neo. Naysayers claim that he can't act and that he wasn't the best person for the role, but I beg to differ.  Reeves was able to pull the leading role off, not only because of his acting ability, but also because of the fact that he's been out of the public eye for awhile.  His long absence makes the viewer want\/have to reacquaint themselves with Reeves as they simultaneously get acquainted with Neo, which helps to make the storyline more buyable and digestible.  Can you imagine, say, the over-exposed Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt or Will Smith in the part of Neo? I can't, even though each was supposedly an early contender for the Neo role. In the cases of Leo, Brad and Will, their big Hollywood personas would have only distracted the audience from a rather inventive plot and story arc.  Reeves' participation allowed the audience to absorb the more complicated aspects of the story line and to pick up on the oh, so that's what that means nuances discovered in the second half of the movie.  Carrie-Anne Moss holds her own as Trinity's I'm-a-woman-but-if-you-mess-with-me-I'll-kick-your-butt persona. Secondly, it was very refreshing to see at least four ethnic actors take on important (starring and co-starring) roles in a film that tried to take a peek into the future, particularly for a science fiction film where viewers are typically hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't look like Leonardo (a la Starship Troopers, and for the most part Star Wars, Billy Dee Williams and Samuel L. Jackson not withstanding).  It was also impressive to know that the directors\/producers decided to cast Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, the pivotal, totally authoritative, new millennium prophet who really drives the story.  Marcus Chong (Tank) and Julian Arahanga? (Apoc), put in rare, non-stereotypical performances as tech-savvy, anti-Matrix rebels, while the influential part of the Oracle is played by veteran actress Gloria Foster. Finally, a Hollywood film that doesn't resort to the usual ethnic drug dealer-criminal stereotypes, and finally a sci-fi film that actively promotes the idea that people of color will actually have a presence in the future. Lastly, the special effects were just mind-blowing.  I was totally freaked- out (in a good way) by Trinity's mid-air preying mantis kick, Neo's back- bending bullet-time sequence and Neo and Morpheus's balletic judo match.  Other people in the theater actually oohhed, and aahhed along with me during these breath-taking visuals.  Sure The Matrix has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  I can't wait to see this again.

Any of this sound familiar????Speaking of the architecture, Somnopolis and the Dark City are basically identical towering-monolithic-dark-film-noir-gotham style buildings. Additionally the citizens, vehicles, and landmarks are styled in the same retro-futuristic-deco designs. Huge clocks loom all over Somnopolis much like the clock in the underground lair of the strangers. Any of this sound familiar?As far as the plot goes they diverge a bit but ultimately are the same. They both seek the same thing which is 'to save the city and their own souls.' There is no telekinesis in Mister X but rather lots of psychosis as drug use in prevalent as Mister X strives not to fall asleep so that he can complete is goal of fixing the city. His motto is, So much work, so little time. I think one of the Strangers in Dark City actually uses this line or something very similar. Mister X is pale, bald and wears a long black trench coat, too. Sound Familiar??Anyway there are a lot more similarities but I think you can see pretty clearly that this work is NOT his own and this movie is NOT original. Don't get me wrong I love this movie - but I also loved it the first time I read it in the pages for Mister X. People should be credited for their work and others should not be able to capitalize on it. I normally wouldn't say anything but for the brash statements made by Mr Proyas on the end of the disc...

There are a lot of people who consider this to be a lesbian film--to them i say-i do not think so, my friend!  This is a movie that explores female relationships and those bonds between them. Yes, there is female nudity, but it is not sexual--in fact it is a beautiful scene.  The scene between Maddy and Legs on the roof is just so perfect! My only problem with this movie is it left out a lot of really good stuff from the book by Joyce Carol Oates.  There were scenes that would have worked very well in this movie.  i feel that they left a lot of crucial information out of the movie to allow for time.  They left a lot unsaid.  i feel that they could have explored the relationships between all of the girls a lot better and should have shown the delevelopments of them. To the comments about this being far-fetched (the knives and such) the book was written about a 1950's girl gang and it does make a lot of sense.  I think it is safe to say that girls that age do not want to go to a principal about a teacher like buttinger due to the fact that 9 times out of 10 nothing will be done.

Yes, black people make up the largest minority in that land - I believe about 10% of the population - but U.S. film-makers are becoming a little more awake, beginning to touch upon the lives of other races. For example, another 1998 film, Smoke Signals dealt with two Native people. American History X, thoughtfully touches - though in a low-key way - upon other races, like the Koreans who took over ownership of the grocery store.When I was in the most racially diverse region of the world (the Caribbean), I observed how interracial marriage both preserves that diversity while creating unity. When a black person marries a white person, one child will come out completely black, one completely white, and one a beautiful mixture between the two. (Blondes and brunettes intermarry and we have not eradicated these hair colours creating an exclusively brown-haired society!)RACISTS CANNOT BE REFORMED BY LOGICSome people were understandably upset that the film failed to rebut many of the arguments in favour of the Neo-Nazis. I thought that the brilliance of the film was that it subtly argued that this was futile. Rebuttals on one side are only met with rebuttals on the other and so the argument goes on back and forth endlessly. The arguments at the dinner table with the Elliot Gould character confirmed this. The film showed that reforming a racist is done not through appealing to his mind, his logic, his reason, but through his heart. Those that marvelled in wonderment over Derek's black laundry co-worker befriending him with humour about sex, thinking that it would have been more reasonable for him to argue racial issues failed to see this point I think.The film pointed out how self-defeating the ideals of white supremacy (or supremacy of any race) are by showing how illogical the beliefs are. At one point, the younger brother states that it is best to steer clear away from anyone who is not a White Protestant in the midst of his insisting on doing away with Jews. Of course, the founder of Christianity, a faction of which is Protestantism, was a Jew! Another point that shows how self-defeating their beliefs are is that they want to do away with immigration. But their ancestors, themselves, were immigrants. All whites immigrated to the Americas from Europe. They never asked for permission from the Native people. The characters do take up this point and try to argue that the whites were good immigrants because they built up a great civilisation. But it is crystal clear how weak that argument is.American History X shows us that it is nearly futile to try to reform a racist by appealing to his faculty of reason, because his beliefs are not based upon reason, they are based upon emotional hatred. Derek's laundry co-worker began joking about an unrelated issue, an issue which Derek could not argue against and set up defences against his own point of view. The wall of hatred around his heart was penetrated. Blacks and whites actually had something in common that they could laugh about!  The mind can only be righted through appealing to the heart. This is the central message of American History X.NOT INTENDED TO BE A PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDYAnother criticism given to the film was that it was unclear how Derek was led down the path of racism. It was commented that it was initiated by his father using the 'n' word at the dinner table and by the fact that he was murdered by black people. It didn't seem to me that the film was saying that these were the exclusive reasons for Derek's embrace of racist views. It was just pointing out a few of the many fragments off of which he fed along this dark path. American History X was not aspiring to be a psychological study of how people become racists. It was simply revealing the darkness of racial hatred. I'm sure that such a psychological study could not be satisfactorily concluded in a two-hour non-documentary film; it is a complex issue. There is no one cause, and outside incidents are just a pat on the back, because everyone has free will to embrace whatever beliefs he chooses.CONFUSION OF ECONOMIC VERSUS HUMAN ISSUESMany people, also, seem to confuse economic issues with human ones. Racism is not a right-wing issue. Right-wing vs. left-wing are policies of economics. They have to do with such issues of public versus private ownership. A person can embrace the economic theory of capitalism and be a strong proponent of racial equality; while, another can side-with socialism and be a racist.HOW DO YOU REMOVE DARKNESS FROM A ROOM?The film's ending has its pro's and con's. One the one hand, yes, it is conventional, but on the other, it allows the film to leave an emotional impression on the viewer which helps him to reflect on all that he has seen.In conclusion, American History X pointed out to me that hatred (hate is the verb, hatred is the noun, please), like darkness, hatred cannot be depleted by attacking it. You can't remove darkness out of a room by shovelling it out, only by turning up the light of love which automatically dispels the darkness away.The films advises that one should always end a piece of writing with a quote, so here's one. It is paraphrased from the sayings of GandhiIf you simply take an eye for an eye, it won't be long before the whole world goes blind.

Rebuttals on one side are only met with rebuttals on the other and so the argument goes on back and forth endlessly. The arguments at the dinner table with the Elliot Gould character confirmed this. The film showed that reforming a racist is done not through appealing to his mind, his logic, his reason, but through his heart. Those that marvelled in wonderment over Derek's black laundry co-worker befriending him with humour about sex, thinking that it would have been more reasonable for him to argue racial issues failed to see this point I think.The film pointed out how self-defeating the ideals of white supremacy (or supremacy of any race) are by showing how illogical the beliefs are. At one point, the younger brother states that it is best to steer clear away from anyone who is not a White Protestant in the midst of his insisting on doing away with Jews. Of course, the founder of Christianity, a faction of which is Protestantism, was a Jew! Another point that shows how self-defeating their beliefs are is that they want to do away with immigration. But their ancestors, themselves, were immigrants. All whites immigrated to the Americas from Europe. They never asked for permission from the Native people. The characters do take up this point and try to argue that the whites were good immigrants because they built up a great civilisation. But it is crystal clear how weak that argument is.American History X shows us that it is nearly futile to try to reform a racist by appealing to his faculty of reason, because his beliefs are not based upon reason, they are based upon emotional hatred. Derek's laundry co-worker began joking about an unrelated issue, an issue which Derek could not argue against and set up defences against his own point of view. The wall of hatred around his heart was penetrated. Blacks and whites actually had something in common that they could laugh about!  The mind can only be righted through appealing to the heart. This is the central message of American History X.NOT INTENDED TO BE A PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDYAnother criticism given to the film was that it was unclear how Derek was led down the path of racism. It was commented that it was initiated by his father using the 'n' word at the dinner table and by the fact that he was murdered by black people. It didn't seem to me that the film was saying that these were the exclusive reasons for Derek's embrace of racist views. It was just pointing out a few of the many fragments off of which he fed along this dark path. American History X was not aspiring to be a psychological study of how people become racists. It was simply revealing the darkness of racial hatred. I'm sure that such a psychological study could not be satisfactorily concluded in a two-hour non-documentary film; it is a complex issue. There is no one cause, and outside incidents are just a pat on the back, because everyone has free will to embrace whatever beliefs he chooses.CONFUSION OF ECONOMIC VERSUS HUMAN ISSUESMany people, also, seem to confuse economic issues with human ones. Racism is not a right-wing issue. Right-wing vs. left-wing are policies of economics. They have to do with such issues of public versus private ownership. A person can embrace the economic theory of capitalism and be a strong proponent of racial equality; while, another can side-with socialism and be a racist.HOW DO YOU REMOVE DARKNESS FROM A ROOM?The film's ending has its pro's and con's. One the one hand, yes, it is conventional, but on the other, it allows the film to leave an emotional impression on the viewer which helps him to reflect on all that he has seen.In conclusion, American History X pointed out to me that hatred (hate is the verb, hatred is the noun, please), like darkness, hatred cannot be depleted by attacking it. You can't remove darkness out of a room by shovelling it out, only by turning up the light of love which automatically dispels the darkness away.The films advises that one should always end a piece of writing with a quote, so here's one. It is paraphrased from the sayings of GandhiIf you simply take an eye for an eye, it won't be long before the whole world goes blind.

Yes, black people make up the largest minority in that land - I believe about 10% of the population - but U.S. film-makers are becoming a little more awake, beginning to touch upon the lives of other races. For example, another 1998 film, Smoke Signals dealt with two Native people. American History X, thoughtfully touches - though in a low-key way - upon other races, like the Koreans who took over ownership of the grocery store.When I was in the most racially diverse region of the world (the Caribbean), I observed how interracial marriage both preserves that diversity while creating unity. When a black person marries a white person, one child will come out completely black, one completely white, and one a beautiful mixture between the two.

Everybody should see this picture, no matter how old, or what color, race, or creed.  AMERICAN HISTORY X is not profound, is not symbolic, and does not have a hero who lets us know at the end that this is all wrong.  In fact, Ed Norton is quite the anti-hero, even after release from prison.  You see he killed two African-Americans who were robbing his car on his own property.  It was certainly NOT self-defense.AMERICAN HISTORY X is a message movie, no doubt about it.  But the message is not told in words or speeches by the actors.  Experiences tell the story of some very small-minded people who believe they have the temerity to rid a portion of California of unwanted, inferior races.  A racial basketball game punches what the opening sequence pulled off right home.  Norton is a 'lieutenant' in the D.O.C., a neo-Nazi organization.  He is the leader while a sinister Stacey Keach recruits and brainwashes from a headquarters somewhere in the city (Venice Beach, CA).  If the whites win, the blacks must leave the court, forever.  I can only imagine the cheers or jeers this scene brought about in audiences who saw the picture during its brief theater run.  In fact, it was probably in the public's best interest not to keep it out too long.  This is sad, but a point is presented here.  Smart, open-minded people will see the senselessness of it all and see racism for what it is sheer stupidity and ignorance.The film is presented in an interesting narrative method, with flashbacks in black and white before Norton's incarceration.  After his release, we see in living, breathing color the scary gangland that is the racial atmosphere in this section of Cali.  The tragedy of it all is Norton's little brother, played by Edward Furlong (TERMINATOR II), who is clearly headed down the same swasticized path Norton went down.  In prison, Norton's status in the neo-Nazi underworld was heightened to God-like and Furlong, young and impressionable, looks to carry the torch.  Throughout, we see scenes of demeaning race relations and brutal dialogue and ideas put forth blatantly by the skinheads.  Ed Norton, one of the best actors of his generation, bulked up considerably to look the part of the sick skinhead, but after some waking up in jail, he has had enough.Rumors spread rampantly that Norton and director Tony Kaye fought while filming and that a disagreement ensued.  Whoever's vision won out is the correct one, because this film never steps wrong.  It may be headed down a predictable path, but there are multiple ways this picture could end.  Doom and tragedy are in the air and you just know someone is going to die for no other reason than learned racism and philosophy on different creeds.  It's a shame that the ideas come from someone who should've been the most responsible person in these kid's lives.  He was incapable of shielding them from these idiotic thoughts of single-minded bigotry.  Catholics, Jews, Prodestines, African-Americans, and most importantly, skinhead Nazis should see this important work of art and think about the shame of it all.RATING 10 of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 1999","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The third best film of 1998 is a tenacious, overwhelming depiction of hate for no reason and stupidity that is learned.
