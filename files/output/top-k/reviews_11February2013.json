The acting is great with Tom Hanks pulling off another blinder of a performance! The rest of the cast all do a great job. The writing is great, often being witty and clever and Spielberg's direction is almost perfect! What do I mean almost perfect? This scene is everyone's favorite scene when dealing with the movie and is regardedas a great scene but this is one scene that I do NOT hate but do NOT enjoy much either. That is the Omaha Beach scene that drags on for 20 minutes. 20 minutes of depicting what war feels like. I can understand it being 10 minutes, that would be a blast of a start but the scene really pulled me out of the movie early on but thankfully recovered after the quest had begun with such amazing scenery, brilliant cinematography and superb special effects along with some great action scenes and very emotional scenes as the movie progressed. Another thing that adds to the greatness of the movie is definitely the characters as all soldiers who were focused on in the movie were very interesting, especially Capt. Miller. Another part I enjoyed was the ending scene, though it may feel a bit cheesy and corny, I found it reasonably emotional and the scene does make you feel its worth sitting through a 170 minute movie.I can say in conclusion that this is a movie that I would easily recommend to anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a classic and that it will live forever. The reason I had to drop one point off my rating is simply the 20 minute beach scene at the start of the movie which dragged on and threw me out of the movie, but I can easily tell that everyone else will love that scene. So, go ahead...Watch the movie! Great film, a classic and perhaps the best war movie ever.

Paul Newman gives a really great performance. Without him, Cool Hand Luke would have fallen apart for me.

First off, I don't particularly like whimsical pre-seventies prison films. I tend to like more the exploitative sub-genres of prison films like Female Prisoner Scorpion over the classier stuff. In other words, Cool Hand Luke is too tame for my taste and lacks a real punch to the gut feeling the 70's films offer.Another element that doesn't work for me is the rest of the cast. I did like Harry Dean Stanton in the film, the rest of the cast were just boring and lacking anything memorable about them. Most of the just acted like mentally handicapped people instead of acting like convicted criminals or real people.And last element that didn't work was the direction.

On one hand, the premise warrants some interest and does have some complexity to it. Also, the film does its part when it comes to having Sharon Stone flaunt her body. On the other hand, it's seriously cheesy and over-the-top at times as well as truly dull in others. So if you think that this picture has an inconsistent feel to it, you'd probably be right. Basic Instinct follows a police detective (Michael Douglas) with a troubling past who is trying to solve the recent murder of a rock and roll star. The only eligible suspect so far is a book writer (Sharon Stone) who tells stories about women murdering men and was the last person to see him. One of her own stories seemed to play out in the same way that this victim was murdered. Naturally, the police suspects that she did it. The plot thickens however when the detective falls in love with the writer and learns some new developments about the case. In case I haven't mentioned it yet, let me get this off my chest. With a few exceptions, I normally can't stand films centered on police detectives, cops or characters involved in similar professions since I find them to be boring, forgettable, and formulaic. They just don't do a thing for me in terms of story, characters, and dialogue. And while I found that whatever took place in the police department was fairly formulaic, it wasn't as much torture to sit or listen to as I thought it was going to be. I thought it would be too difficult to understand what was being said like other films in the genre. But luckily, it was easy to follow what was being said. So that must count for something. On top of that, the story had a reasonably intriguing complexity to it as did the two main characters. The hero and villain weren't clear cut, which is fairly authentic of real life. In reality, it's not crystal clear who the heroes and villains are, one culture may consider certain heroes villains, and vice versa. If you go see this film solely for looking at Sharon Stone's physique, you won't be disappointed since she looks very good here. I wouldn't be surprised if some viewers were reminded of Kim Novak, since I know I detected some similarities between the two in terms of looks and wardrobe. So given my personal tastes, it would sound like this would be a good movie for me. But sadly, Basic Instinct was one of those films in which the premise is better than the execution. One big issue I had with Basic Instinct was the quality of the acting. I found the acting to be poorly done. While the characters of the two leads are fascinating, the performances don't do justice to the written characters. The two lead actors (especially Douglas) overdid their delivery to the point that they never felt subtle or natural. The performance by Jeanne Tripplehorn as a psychiatrist helping out Douglas' character was especially unconvincing. I never believed that her character had enough experience in studying psychology to the point were she would become a professional one at such a young age. I simply didn't buy it at all. The only point to her character existing in this film was solely for a plot twist that was used later in the film. That was it.Because of the disappointing acting quality, I never bought whatever ludicrous events took place in the plot. As a result, I couldn't take the film as seriously as it wanted me to. While the screenplay had its fair share of intriguing elements, there were also some elements (namely the cheesy and implausible dialogue) that ruined it. And that was how the film became inconsistent in terms of its delivery. In a nutshell, Basic Instinct is a mixed bag. While it had a good idea of what it wanted to be, it seldom delivered on the promises it made mainly because the acting was so mediocre to the point where it interfered with my ability to believe what happened on screen.

(I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly.

It's much more than that and consequently slower &#x96; it's a touching drama with action scenes, and so we can forgive, just about, the pace through the middle of the film.

Directed by William Friedkin, it's the story of two men, Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), a 30-year Marine veteran and decorated officer; and Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), now an attorney, a man with whom he fought and whose life he saved in Vietnam and has retired.Childers is sent on a rescue mission in Yemen that goes awry when the protesting crowd outside the embassy starts shooting at the Marines. Childers, who already has men down, orders his soldiers to fire into the crowd. He is able to evacuate the embassy but finds himself in trouble due to the fact that no one believes the protesters had weapons. He is put on trial and asks Hodges to defend him. Hodges doesn't feel he's a good enough attorney, but he agrees to take the case.There is a tape of what happened, but the head of security (Bruce Greenwood) who doesn't want the United States to take the rap for killing civilians and would rather have it fall on a soldier, burns it. And Childers gets no support from the Ambassador (Ben Kingsley) or his wife (Anne Archer), and the attorney on the other side (Guy Pearce) is out for blood.We've seen this film in various guises before, and the good versus evil is typical Hollywood. The acting is good but I have difficulty understanding the casting of Ben Kingsley, a great Oscar-winning actor, who is completely wasted in what is not even really a supporting role. Anne Archer plays his wife. The two have a small son and have been married for ten years. May I suggest that though it's entirely feasible that Archer at 43 had a child, the casting seems a little off. Often, when directors want a certain actor, the agency representing them agrees on the condition that the director take other people on his roster. I suspect this is what happened here; the casting is not quite right for these distinguished actors.Tommy Lee Jones in particular is good as Hodges, though he has the showier role. Samuel Jackson is always very good and gives a strong performance as well, but there's something very stereotypical about both parts. Bruce Greenwood at least is interesting casting - he seems pretty mild-mannered as the Head of Security, but there's a treachery underneath.All in all, this is an okay film, one where you know how it's going to end and basically what's going to happen while it's going on. We see two stars who have done their roles before in other circumstances. So in the end, while it has its moments, it's somewhat routine. One of those if you've seen one, you've seen them all type films.

I suspect this is what happened here; the casting is not quite right for these distinguished actors.Tommy Lee Jones in particular is good as Hodges, though he has the showier role. Samuel Jackson is always very good and gives a strong performance as well, but there's something very stereotypical about both parts. Bruce Greenwood at least is interesting casting - he seems pretty mild-mannered as the Head of Security, but there's a treachery underneath.All in all, this is an okay film, one where you know how it's going to end and basically what's going to happen while it's going on. We see two stars who have done their roles before in other circumstances. So in the end, while it has its moments, it's somewhat routine.

Directed by William Friedkin, it's the story of two men, Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), a 30-year Marine veteran and decorated officer; and Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), now an attorney, a man with whom he fought and whose life he saved in Vietnam and has retired.Childers is sent on a rescue mission in Yemen that goes awry when the protesting crowd outside the embassy starts shooting at the Marines. Childers, who already has men down, orders his soldiers to fire into the crowd. He is able to evacuate the embassy but finds himself in trouble due to the fact that no one believes the protesters had weapons. He is put on trial and asks Hodges to defend him. Hodges doesn't feel he's a good enough attorney, but he agrees to take the case.There is a tape of what happened, but the head of security (Bruce Greenwood) who doesn't want the United States to take the rap for killing civilians and would rather have it fall on a soldier, burns it. And Childers gets no support from the Ambassador (Ben Kingsley) or his wife (Anne Archer), and the attorney on the other side (Guy Pearce) is out for blood.We've seen this film in various guises before, and the good versus evil is typical Hollywood. The acting is good but I have difficulty understanding the casting of Ben Kingsley, a great Oscar-winning actor, who is completely wasted in what is not even really a supporting role. Anne Archer plays his wife. The two have a small son and have been married for ten years.

They are mind breaking.The first time I saw that film, I didn't know what I was going to see, and it felt like a punch in the guts. I consider myself lucky, because that is a rare thing. Still, it is a piece to catch anyone's breath.The soundtrack is one of the best ever, bar only The Crow (review upcoming). The costume are perfectly tailored and adapted to the tone of each environments. The mood is excellent, at all time. They even applied a greenish tinge when they are in the matrix, a blueish one in the cold real world, and you'll see only normal colors when they are in the training programs.The action and suspense will keep you wanting more, the story will light up your mind, and the fight scenes will push you to the edge of your seat.Some special effects, mainly the CGI, are not aging very well, but the work is still acceptable today.This is probably one of Keanu Reeves' best performance. He's not a great actor, but the role fits him well. His performance as well as Carrie-Anne Moss' are not as good in the following installments.

His life is changed forever when two robots come into his possession, one of them carrying a message for someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke is then swept into an adventure with the robots, Obi-Wan and two smugglers to rescue a princess from the evil Empire and join the rebellion to destroy their ultimate weapon, the Death Star.Taking inspiration from classic Wild West and samurai movies and combining it with science fiction and fantasy elements, 'Star Wars' is a must-see for, well, anyone really.

Chevy utilizes his usual cynical wit and comedic timing like he did in the first Fletch movie and the various disguises he puts on are equally impressive and the impersonations are pure genius. The best disguise was when he was pretending to be a faith healer, in which you can't recognize him and that was one of the few scenes that offered a lot of humour.Sadly, Chase's ability to keep the storyline funny aren't enough mainly due to the poorly constructed script and the ultra-complex plot. And while the jokes and the gags were very uplifting, they also tend to fade out and fall to the lowest degree. In fact, Fletch Lives loses its audience by doing the most ungodly thing by resorting to hair-brained jokes. The plot I found to be overwhelming which did not seem to work this time around for Fletch to wear disguises and deliver his comical wit. I believe too much emphasis was on the complex plot that make the funny moments seem swallowed up and not very visible to keep one intrigued.I really don't think it is necessary to see this movie due largely to the uncaring characters, the awkward comical timing and the the overly complex script.

Whlie residing from the south, Fletch goes through the same formulaic clichés and routines that you've seen in most comedies that emanate from the South like the murder, the spiritual leader, the gorgeous girl, a heavy-set thug and the narrow-minded antagonist.Okay, Fletch Lives does succeed in providing some laughs to the viewers from time to time, but other times it just fizzles and doesn't have enough energy to keep it running. And that's not to say that Chevy Chase is to blame at all. In fact Chase carries the most laughs and gives it his all, but it's the pancake screenplay that's to blame for this poor sequel. Chevy utilizes his usual cynical wit and comedic timing like he did in the first Fletch movie and the various disguises he puts on are equally impressive and the impersonations are pure genius. The best disguise was when he was pretending to be a faith healer, in which you can't recognize him and that was one of the few scenes that offered a lot of humour.Sadly, Chase's ability to keep the storyline funny aren't enough mainly due to the poorly constructed script and the ultra-complex plot. And while the jokes and the gags were very uplifting, they also tend to fade out and fall to the lowest degree. In fact, Fletch Lives loses its audience by doing the most ungodly thing by resorting to hair-brained jokes. The plot I found to be overwhelming which did not seem to work this time around for Fletch to wear disguises and deliver his comical wit. I believe too much emphasis was on the complex plot that make the funny moments seem swallowed up and not very visible to keep one intrigued.I really don't think it is necessary to see this movie due largely to the uncaring characters, the awkward comical timing and the the overly complex script.

The camera work offered the viewer many different perspectives, such as following beside a villager carrying his child or watching the monster being lifted from the ground and raised to the lightening storm. The perspective allowed the audience to get the feeling that they were right there in the middle of all of it. I also thought the lack of music throughout actually worked very well. The sounds throughout proved to be enough.I really enjoyed the monster character. During the scene where the monster is interacting with the little girl, you can tell that it touched him that she acknowledged him in a calm manner, not judging or anything. I actually a felt a bit of sympathy for the monster. It's easy to tell that he only did what he did because he did not know any better. He can't entirely differentiate right from wrong. Boris Karloff was a phenomenal monster. The camera angles and lighting helped accentuate his rough features, which made him an even more believable monster.
