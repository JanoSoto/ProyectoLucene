The Apartment is the film that reopened my eyes to the glory that classic films can bring. Not only was the story and dialog excellent, the film is timeless I could easily see someone remaking this soon, and not much would have to be changed. Sure, they'd be using computers instead of typewriters and cell phones instead of pay phones, but human nature remains the same today as it did in the sixties.The story is pretty simple a man named C.C. Baxter (played by the always great Jack Lemmon) is desperately seeking a promotion in his job. His job consumes him, probably because he has nothing else to fill his life with. Baxter lives alone in a rather nice apartment. He has no life, no wife, and, on most nights, not even a bed to sleep in. This is because, in order to climb the corporate ladder, Baxter has agreed to let his various bosses use his apartment as a place to take their mistresses. Baxter is about to call it quits, when the big boss calls him in for a favor. He agrees to promote Baxter if gives him the use of his apartment. Meanwhile, Baxter is continually flirting with the elevator girl (a good performance by a young Shirley MacLaine), who does not return his affection. When he finds out that his boss's mistress IS the elevator girl, drama ensues. The question is whether or not she will see past the man who will never leave his wife and see Baxter for the guy that he is.It's a simple drama with a lot of clever dialog. The characters are very real. You can almost feel for Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine's characters; you can almost hate Fred MacMurray. It's easy to get tied into these people's lives. The film runs over two hours, but it does not seem long or tedious. Every performance is on key and everything is believable. It's not all serious, though. There are many comedic moments in the film. Word play is important and situations take on a humorous tone due to the clever Shirley MacClaine and the good natured Jack Lemmon.The Apartment is a gem of a movie if I've ever seen one. It's yet another reason to declare Billy Wilder a genius of a filmmaker. Even to those who do not appreciate the classics try this one. You won't regret it. And if you do.. well, that's the way it crumbles, cookie wise.10\/10 A, Eleven Dollars Reviews 2008 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 July 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Apartment (1960) | Directed by Billy Wilder | Starring Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray | Score 10\/10 AUntil recently, I had declared most classic films, with the exception of a few, to be overrated.

No surprise here, it IS based after all on the Raymond Chandler novel by the same name, Chandler as iconic a figure in the noir realm as you're likely to get and responsible for some of the most distinctly classic moments of the genre (Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, also Strangers on a Train for Hitchcock). But instead of rehashing styles and themes from a bygone era of film-making, slaving them in the service of a hip or serviceable crime flick that passes the time, Altman instead takes Chandler's film-noir exoskeleton, strips it of all fat and hangs on it his own unique take.Elliot Gould is Phillip Marlowe. Scruffy, sardonic and alienated private dick with a smart mouth and a cigarette eternally glued to his lips. He's cool alright but not the suave kind of cool that would impress dames in the 40's. He seems constantly out of place, doomed to observe and comment in his witty repartee on what's going on around him or just let the chips fall where they may. And they do.Chandler's story is as good as one would expect from such a patriarch of hardboiled hijinks and the screenplay matches it every step of the way. All the staples of a noir film are present, simultaneously fulfilling the genre promise of a Phillip Marlowe film and in the same time preparing the ground for Altman's take on it; murder, missing money, unhappy marriages, a private eye hired to investigate, twists and turns. The works. Sprawling and convoluted like the best of noirs usually are. The dialogue crackling with inventiveness, shedding toughguy lingo for a sense of playfulness, rolling in and out of the picture in a stream-of-consciousness way. Some of the twists and characters seem to carry a sense of seething malice, a fleeting glimpse on the seemy underbelly of the Great American Beast, the scars and ugliness of Hollywood showing behind a faded facade of glamour, an escalating creepiness factor that recalls the later works of David Lynch, predating him by a good number of years as it does. The mousey Dr. Verringe and the whole clinic subplot reminded me of Lost Highway for example.What really elevates The Long Goodbye in another level is Altman's direction and Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography. This is only my second Altman picture (after the very good McCabe and Mrs. Miller) but 2 hours in his presence were enough to leave an indelible sense that I'm watching the work of a director on top of his craft. Altman's camera is always on the move, slowly panning and zooming in and out of the frame, picking up details, guiding the eye but never getting in the middle of the story or screaming for attention. The whole thing has a naturalistic, subdued feel to it, what with the unobtrusive lighting and bleached-out, hazy look; no glitz or glamour here. Only the faded, long-gone impression of it. The Long Goodbye is both a fantastic and somewhat hidden gem of 70's crime cinema and also one of the missing links in the evolution of noir, all the way from Sunset Blvd. to Mullholland Drive.

Rocky is about going after your dreams when the opportunity arises. Everyone can relate to being the underdog, to being the down and out guy without a chance of actually being the one to come out on top. Rocky Balboa uses boxing as a metaphor to just capitalize on the great opportunities that come by in life.The whole premise of the movie is an unknown getting a shot at the heavyweight champion. Carl Weathers, (played by Apollo Creed) the heavyweight champion of the world gives Rocky a chance because he likes his nickname, The Italian Stallion because he knows it's marketable. Apollo doesn't take Rocky with any seriousness. Why should he? He belittles him during the televised press conference, doesn't train for the fight, and degrades and humiliates Rocky when he ever gets the chance to (Before the start of the fight). What makes Rocky so unique and wonderful is that they don't cookie-cutter anyone as the main villain. Apollo can be seen as a generous man, and although he talks down to Rocky he certainly isn't the bad guy. And it's not even like Rocky wants to beat Apollo, it's almost like Rocky wants to beat himself, do the best he can by going the distance and Apollo is just the best fighter in his way for him to try to achieve his goal. One of my favorite scenes that I feel makes Rocky so special is the night before the fight. Rocky wonders around the stadium, and then goes back home to Adrian to say he can't beat him. This is a moment where Rocky sort of admits defeat; it's a gripping, captivating scene that displays the more gritty realism of Rocky. Everyone from time to time has those moments of doubt, where they realize that it just ain't realistic and feasible. This shows the depth and character of Rocky, almost as if he has sort of been broken down. At this time, Rocky just decides that All he wants to do is go the distance. Nobodies ever gone the distance with Creed, and if the bell rings and I'm still standing... maybe I'll realize I wasn't just another bum for the neighborhood. This scene is so pivotal in marking a fairy-tale movie like Rocky so much more gritty and realistic. The training montage with Gonna Fly Now blasting through the screen while Rocky runs up the steps is easily one of the most memorable, recognizable, and inspirational scenes of all time. It's like a metaphor for somebodies triumph; Rocky runs from the lower class section of town to the more intellectual area. He runs from the bottom to the top. He turns around to the face the city in which he came in and he raises his arms higher than the skyscrapers. The symbolic nature of the shot is astounding, and it is probably the most inspirational image from any film ever. Rocky is just such a magical, emotional, powerful film. You feel like your in it with Rocky, and during the fight scene your standing up screaming for Rocky. It's such an incredible experience. It's sentimentalism at its best. The acting is terrific all across the board. Burgess Meredith is perfect as Rocky's trainer. Burt Young is great as the drunk, jealous, irritated friend. Taili Shire is great as the shy pet shop worker. And Sylvester Stallone was born to play the down and out, lovable boxer. At the time, Roger Ebert said Sly would be the next Brando. Well, that didn't quite work out for Sly, but he delivered an excellent performance in Rocky. The score is one of the essentials for fueling the film, and is easily one of the best fitting scores of all time. And the cinematography make for some of the most memorable scenes in movie history. Everything is just so great about Rocky, which is what makes it what you love so much about movies. 10\/10 I recommend it for everyone.

Wealthy landowners in Mexico, they travel around the country, in their spare moments, and rescue the downtrodden from the clutches of evil forces, like a triplets version of Zorro. Lucky is very adept at rope tricks and the others have their shooting skills, too. Their films are one heroic feat after another and very popular. But, in real life, these three actors are studio property and make very little money, depending on the movie moguls for food, lodging, and clothing. When Lucky decides that they should ask for a boost in salary, the unlucky threesome is stripped down to their underwear and tossed out of the set on their ears. But, wait. From Mexico comes a telegram requesting their services, as a small town is being menaced by El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and company. However, due to the truncated nature of the telegram, the amigos believe that there are being asked only to star in a film and do their usual fake heroism. What a surprise when they land in Mexico and find out they are expected to save the village from a gang with loaded guns! With everyone in town pitting their entire existence on the amigos, can they deliver? This is a very funny film, with wonderful performances, writing and direction. Not only are the three stars terrific, but Arau is side-splittingly humorous, as are the other hispanic cast members. The scenery in Mexico is both lovely and barren while the costuming is first rate, too. As a co-writer, Martin deserves much praise, also, for there are many memorable lines and laugh-out-loud episodes. From Dusty requesting something other than Mexican food from his hosts to an accidental shooting of the invisible horseman and more, most viewers will be transported far away from life's daily routine with any showing. So, three cheers for the Amigos and get ready to laugh up a storm when you get this one into the DVD player.

Not only are the three stars terrific, but Arau is side-splittingly humorous, as are the other hispanic cast members. The scenery in Mexico is both lovely and barren while the costuming is first rate, too. As a co-writer, Martin deserves much praise, also, for there are many memorable lines and laugh-out-loud episodes. From Dusty requesting something other than Mexican food from his hosts to an accidental shooting of the invisible horseman and more, most viewers will be transported far away from life's daily routine with any showing.

After leaving a war torn Peru, they return to the U.S. to continue their experiments, only this time they want to make life & decide to construct a human being taken from spare parts they steal from the morgue, which is quiet easy for them to have access to, since they both have internships at the Miskatonic hospital. They assemble a series of body parts & the heart of Dan's former girlfriend (Meg from the first film) included for good measure. But when the evil Dr. Hill is resurrected by another doctor, curious about the re-animating formula he has found, he seeks revenge on the pair of doctors, aided by several messy corpses & soon the boys good intentions & keeping things under control this time, naturally get well out of hand in true Re-Animator fashion. BRIDE OF THE RE-ANIMATOR is a wild, gruesome, hilarious, scary & thought provoking black comedy\/horror film sequel, that comes close to matching the originals outrageous style! The film is really a modern day remake of THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, since there's way to much here to make it so. Herbert West's work is to similar to that of Dr. Frankenstien's in the black & white classic & like in that film, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN, the Bride is not unveiled or let loose until the end, in an ending which despite some outrageous touches, mirrors that films ending almost exactly, as well as repeating the very same climax almost scene for scene, of the original 1985 RE-ANIMATOR. The special effects are very well done, if not messy (but in a good way) in fact BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR has some of the best special effects artists on hand, that most horror movie film-makers would kill for, K.N.B.\/SCREAMING MAD GEORGE with some pretty impressive stop motion animation by the late David Allen. The special effects are really highlight here, with mismatched (& re-attached) severed fingers, arms & legs combinations, severed heads attached to bat wings & at it's most outrageous, an eye & finger attachment that roams all over the house the men are staying at. Not to mention a dead poodle with a severed human arm attached where it's missing paw should be & in my all time favourite sequence, Dr. West tickling the severed foot of a woman thats attached to a man's hand at the end of it, only for it to turn savage & attack him! Of course the remaining surviving zombies at the end of the first film & a whole cemetery of corpses that come to life crash the mansion the doctors are staying at to take part in the gory goods at the climax, roaming all over the place. The Brides dissected body is also shown in amazing detail. With Herbert pulling on the tendons, like one would with a pair of puppet strings, to get the fingers on the arm to work & Herbert severing the chest open in bloody detail in order to remove the heart of the now dead patient, who's body will be used for the grisly experiment. The acting is again a major helping hand to the films production & the direction by BRIAN YUZNA (who produced the first film) is superb. That said I did have a few things to pick on here. I think my main problem is with the late David Gale returning as the sinister mind controlling DR. HILL, having been rescued from a side show (ironically enough that's where Dr. West told his re-animated corpse that that would be a more fitting place for him in the first film) & his plot to destroy Dr. West for doing what he did to him in the first. I just thought the film could have done without him. Now don't get me wrong, I loved Gale's performance, he was a fantastic actor & is sorely missed, but this plot point is poorly fleshed out & could so easily have been written out of the script, simply because Gale is seen in the film very little & is mostly confined to a table before letting loose to confront West in two very brief sequences at the climax. The confrontation between the two is a major letdown & certainly not what the film was building it up to be. In fact, it's almost as if the film-makers had no idea where to take this plot thread & just quickly wrote down a couple of poorly done confrontations in the hopes that fans wouldn't notice. I was expecting something so much better than what we got here & the film never does answer as to how Dr. Hills severed head is now intact, considering it was squashed to pieces at the end of the last movie (here there's only a small crush at the side of the head), in fact they could have written this little subplot out of the movie & they would still have a movie! & the film never does answer the question to how West survived, when the corpses swarmed around him & looks to have killed him at the climax of the first film. The set design is good & eerie, but in truth the film never really does come alive (no pun intended) until the climax, which is where the film serves it's over the top gory goods. The film also has plenty of off the wall moments to satisfy horror movie geeks & those who enjoyed (& could stomach) the original blood fest should definitely check this out. It's not as over the top as it's predecessor, but this is an absolute must see!

Viola mistakenly thinks brother Sebastian has drowned. She goes to Illyria alone; and, she assumes the identity of a young man, Cesario. In Illyria, Cesario (Viola) gets a job as gentleman (dresser) for the duke Orsino. Male (female) Cesario (Viola) falls in love with (male) Orsino. But, he loves another woman, Olivia. Meanwhile, Olivia falls in love with the female twin Cesario (Viola), thinking she is a male. Then, real male twin Sebastian returns, undead! Then, all's well that ends well.The supporting characters in director Trevor Nunn's cinematic version are all right (actually, they come off better, due to the overall execution of the film). But, mainly, it's about Imogen Stubbs (as Viola aka Cesario), and her interaction with Toby Stephens (as Orsino) and Helena Bonham Carter (as Olivia). This Twelfth Night is very well produced. It seems much more dramatic than comic, which is most obvious in the tone-setting opening. The supporting characters and subplots retain the more comic flavor, though. This portends a promising adaptation.But, the film doesn't really end up as you like it.Ms. Stubbs becomes an endearing Viola. Both Stubbs and Mr. Stephens, and Stubbs and Ms. Bonham Carter are fun to watch fall in love. The sexual dynamics work; interestingly, each of the performers add some subtleties. Film, of course, picks up its own (different than stage) nuances. The already shaky premise falls apart, however, when Sebastian returns; and, the performers lose credibility very quickly. Originally, a male would more convincingly play BOTH twins. It would have been better to have Stubbs (or even Steven Mackintosh) play both roles. This film points in the right direction; but, next time, either go all the way, or leave Twelfth Night on the stage.****** Twelfth Night (1996) Trevor Nunn ~ Imogen Stubbs, Toby Stephens, Helena Bonham Carter ","genre":null},{"date":"26 July 2008","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" In William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (or, What You Will), brother and sister twins Viola and Sebastian are shipwrecked off the shores of Illyria.

It concerns an illicit love affair and a lot of sitting around doing nothing for two hours. Humphrey Bogart wears a mac and smokes while various characters mooch around trying to look war torn. I fell asleep several times during watching this cheese fest and was told I never missed a thing ( except for a few characters smoking cigarettes). Also, the ending is very contrived as Bogart is dragged to the electric chair screaming and begging. The only interesting moment is the airport departure where Bogart is hanging on to the wing of the plane as it takes off shouting Here's looking at you, kid! through the window in a vain attempt to stop her leaving. The only truly enjoyable scene in the movie.Very, very overrated, Sam.

Finally, anyone who played D&D know that beholders are rare and deadly. We hero Boy whatsisname comes out of the cave there like 3 floating in the background? Then nothing? Why even have then, didn't waste enough man hours on this masterpiece? Long story short, pretend that this movie doesn't exist, the sequel is much better. Its actually pretty entertaining.
