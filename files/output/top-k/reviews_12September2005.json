Basically Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) gets a message and photo evidence that an angel is staying with an old woman at her house in Iowa. The boss Vartan Malt (Bob Hoskins) is excited about this story, and says that he'll fire Frank, along with Huey Driscoll (Eraser's Robert Pastorelli) and dog trainer Dorothy Winters (Four Weddings and a Funeral's Andie MacDowell), and get their dog, if they do not get the goods. So they travel to the house to meet the woman, and the angel, Michael (John Travolta). Michael seems like a sloppy, lousy and almost childish guy with large feather wings on his back. He agrees to start a road trip (instead of plane) to their Chicago tabloid place, and along the way they begin to believe the angel claim. Along the way they have some giggly stops, but also (apparently the key element to the story), Frank and Dorothy start to fall in love. It has quite a sad end for Michael, when after bringing the dog back to life, he dies, as he knew he would, but Frnak and Dorothy are still together. The best moments are those where Travolta is dancing. Worth watching!

Artificial Intelligence, and this one followed a year later, and it also followed the darker feel brought from his war films. Set in the year 2054, the crime in Washington D.C. has been virtually eliminated (by 90%) with the help of the squad Precrime, using three genetically altered humans known as Precogs with powers to see into the future and predict crimes before they happen. Unfortunately for Precrime head Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), he is seen to be committing a murder, and he is now on the run trying both to escape identification and capture, and prove his innocence, as he does no know the future victim. He decides that he will need help from the key Precog Agatha (Samantha Morton), especially for his minority report, i.e. what happens to him after the murder, so he kidnaps her. She knows quite a lot about future events, and when John finally gets to the man he is meant to murder, it becomes apparent that he may actually have a reason to. After he has sealed his future, John decides to trace the start of the Precrime program, and that means exposing Director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) for how it actually came to be, and in the end saving both himself and the Precogs. Also starring Colin Farrell as Danny Witwer, Lois Smith as Dr. Iris Hineman, Peter Stormare as Dr. Solomon Eddie, Tim Blake Nelson as Gideon, Steve Harris as Jad, Kathryn Morris as Lara Clarke and Mike Binder as Leo Crow.

She is having flashes from her past life, and soon enough people are trying to kill her. Now she, along with her enlisted cheap detective Mitch Henessey (Samuel L.

Eventually, Dr. Nathan Waldman (Brian Cox) explains that she is an assassin working for the government, and her real name is Charly Baltimore. It takes her a while to get used to this fact, but she eventually realises her true self, and gets back into the role of the person she used to be, aggressive, quite rude, sassy, and able to handle threat and weapons. She is now hunting those who hunt her, including the evil father of Caitlan, Timothy (Scary Movie 4's Craig Bierko), and more importantly getting her daughter back, while doing what she can about a bomb.

Basically train passengers are stuck in Mandrika delayed by deep snow on the track, and they are all crammed into the near small village hotel until the next morning. While there socialite Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) meets kindly old governess Miss Froy (Dame May Witty), as well as musician Gilbert (Sir Michael Redgrave, Vanessa's father), she and the governess meet again when they get back on the train travelling through Europe. They have tea together where cricket fans Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) and Charters (Basil Radford) pass the sugar, and back to their cabin they pass Eric Todhunter (The Ladykillers' Cecil Parker) and 'Mrs.' Todhunter (Linden Travers), and they sit in a cabin together. Being encouraged to by Miss Froy, Iris falls asleep, and after waking up she is surprised to see her friend has vanished, and the people in the compartment including the Baroness (Mary Clare) and her Italian manservant (Philip Leaver) claim that they have never seen her. As Iris asks and looks around for the lady none of the other passengers are saying they do not remember ever seeing her with another woman, Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas) tries to convince her that a bump she got on the head earlier caused a hallucination. She is reunited with Gilbert on the train, and she tries to convince him that something sinister is going on where all the train passengers are purposely lying and hiding her somewhere for some reason. After on or two points where she is convinced that maybe she did imagine the earlier events with Miss Froy, Iris is definitely convinced she has been taken, and remembers the possibility of evidence, including her name on the window and a tea box. Gilbert sees a piece of evidence himself and knows that she is indeed telling the truth that the old woman really does exist, and they explore further into the train carriages to try and find her. Eventually they find Miss Froy bandaged up to look like a broken bodied patient for Dr. Hartz, and she reveals herself as a British spy assigned to deliver vital information to the Foreign Office in London. The end of the film sees all the characters truly in on the conspiracy and kidnap, the train stops and is shot at by troops, but the characters survive and return to England, where Iris and Gilbert are engaged, and Miss Froy is alive and well. Also starring Emile Boreo as Hotel Manager, Googie Withers as Blanche, Sally Stewart as Julie, Catherine Lacey as The Nun, and Hitchcock's cameo is a man walking on Victoria Station wearing a black coat smoking a cigarette. Lockwood is really good as the panicky woman, Redgrave is also appealing as her charming accomplice, and Witty is alright with her time as the dotty old woman, more than anything it is a gripping conspiracy story that keeps you hooked because you know all the characters are lying and you wonder how and where the vanishing lady is going to turn up, a great classic thriller. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

Basically train passengers are stuck in Mandrika delayed by deep snow on the track, and they are all crammed into the near small village hotel until the next morning. While there socialite Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) meets kindly old governess Miss Froy (Dame May Witty), as well as musician Gilbert (Sir Michael Redgrave, Vanessa's father), she and the governess meet again when they get back on the train travelling through Europe. They have tea together where cricket fans Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) and Charters (Basil Radford) pass the sugar, and back to their cabin they pass Eric Todhunter (The Ladykillers' Cecil Parker) and 'Mrs.' Todhunter (Linden Travers), and they sit in a cabin together. Being encouraged to by Miss Froy, Iris falls asleep, and after waking up she is surprised to see her friend has vanished, and the people in the compartment including the Baroness (Mary Clare) and her Italian manservant (Philip Leaver) claim that they have never seen her. As Iris asks and looks around for the lady none of the other passengers are saying they do not remember ever seeing her with another woman, Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas) tries to convince her that a bump she got on the head earlier caused a hallucination. She is reunited with Gilbert on the train, and she tries to convince him that something sinister is going on where all the train passengers are purposely lying and hiding her somewhere for some reason. After on or two points where she is convinced that maybe she did imagine the earlier events with Miss Froy, Iris is definitely convinced she has been taken, and remembers the possibility of evidence, including her name on the window and a tea box. Gilbert sees a piece of evidence himself and knows that she is indeed telling the truth that the old woman really does exist, and they explore further into the train carriages to try and find her. Eventually they find Miss Froy bandaged up to look like a broken bodied patient for Dr. Hartz, and she reveals herself as a British spy assigned to deliver vital information to the Foreign Office in London. The end of the film sees all the characters truly in on the conspiracy and kidnap, the train stops and is shot at by troops, but the characters survive and return to England, where Iris and Gilbert are engaged, and Miss Froy is alive and well. Also starring Emile Boreo as Hotel Manager, Googie Withers as Blanche, Sally Stewart as Julie, Catherine Lacey as The Nun, and Hitchcock's cameo is a man walking on Victoria Station wearing a black coat smoking a cigarette. Lockwood is really good as the panicky woman, Redgrave is also appealing as her charming accomplice, and Witty is alright with her time as the dotty old woman, more than anything it is a gripping conspiracy story that keeps you hooked because you know all the characters are lying and you wonder how and where the vanishing lady is going to turn up, a great classic thriller.

With a combination like Stephen Spielberg and Tom Cruise, you know it's going to be awesome without even hearing what the movie is about. But of course, it is my job to tell you these kind of things, so here I go.Minority Report takes place in the near future of 2054. Now before you scoff at some of the seemingly too-advanced technology they seem to have, you should know that before production, Spielberg gathered some of the world's greatest scientists and had them brainstorm on what the world would be like in fifty years and he mostly used what they came up with. Of course he did add some stuff, but they're cool additions so I'll let it slide.The plot revolves around John Anderton (Tom Cruise). He is the chief of an experimental program called Pre-Crime. Pre-Crime uses the Pre-Cogs' ability to see when and who is going to commit murder to stop them from ever happening. The Pre-Cogs are three people actually, who can precict the aforementioned murders. They keep them drugged and isolated so they can predict these murders better. This is really my only big problem with Minority Report, the Pre-Cogs. For some reason I just can't buy the fact that they gained this ability from a combination of different drugs and medicines. That really is the only part of the plot that is a little too far-fetched. Anyway, eventually the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton himself will kill a man named Leo Crow, whom John has never heard of before.This leads Anderton into a wild flight for his life as he tries to discover whether he had been set up, or the system is imperfect, contrary to what everyone believes. Or, worst of all, maybe he really is destined to kill Leo Crow. The chase leads him to many different places and people, which leads us to what I think is the best part of Minority Report, the diverse characters. The Supporting Cast that you rarely see at all are fantastic in themselves. From the peculiar Dr. Iris Heneman (Louis Smith), to the shady Dr. Solomon Eddie (Peter Stormare), to the eccentric Rufu T Riley (Jason Anton), all of these characters are fascinating in themselves and it's a shame we don't get to see more of them.With a great supporting cast, the main cast is even better. Colin Farrell plays Danny Witwer, an FBI agent who is trying to take control of PreCrime and leads the hunt for John. He does a very impressive job and I was amazed to later find out he was Irish! Everyone should definitely keep an eye on him. Max von Sydow plays Lamar Burgess, the Director and creator of PreCrime. He is something of a father figure to John and will do anything to keep PreCrime alive. Kathryn Morris also plays Lara, Anderton's ex-wife. They all perform spectacularly as they interact with each other and move the plot along at a good pace.Then there is John himself. Although appearing successful at first, you quickly realize he is a shell of a man. His life has fallen apart following the kidnapping of his son. His wife left him and he is reduced to getting high and watching home videos during the evenings.The film is filled with a very gritty feel to it and the coloring is filled with the cooler colors of the spectrum, especially blues and whites. It's also surprisingly packed with questions that most sci-fi movies don't bother with. It's filled with questions like Are the lives saved by PreCrime worth it if the system is imperfect and some innocent people are imprisoned for murders they actually wouldn't have committed? It's surprisingly deep for it's genre and leaves you thinking after the movie. As for the action sequences, they are all top-notch. Especially this one very impressive scene in which John is fleeing his former squad who are armed with all kinds of cool thins, most notably jet packs. I bet that was a pain to shoot.Minority report is a high quality sci-fi thriller.

Basically set four years after the events at Jurassic Park on Isla Sorna, a wealthy family are on the island of Isla Nubla, the daughter wanders off and is attacked by a pack of Compsognathus, she survives, but following this John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow (Full Metal Jacket's Arliss Howard), gains control of his uncle's company, InGen. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is invited to meet John Hammond (Lord Sir Richard Attenborough) at his mansion, he explains that Isla Sorna is where the dinosaurs were engineered and nurtured before moving to Isla Nubla, he also explains that after the park was shut down, a hurricane allowed the dinosaurs to break free, they have been living wild ever since. Hammond requests Ian to join a team travelling to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs living naturally in their environment, this will also work as a way to rally public support to stop Ludlow exploiting the site, Ian initially declines, but then he learns his paleontologist girlfriend, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is one of the team, and already on the island, he sees it now as a rescue operation. Ian meets his teammates, equipment specialist and engineer Eddie Carr (Deep Impact's Richard Schiff) and video documentarian Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn), they arrive on the island and find Sarah, they also discover Ian's daughter Kelly Curtis (A Little Princess's Vanessa Lee Chester) has stowed away in the trailer. Soon after they see helicopters carrying vehicles, it is a second InGen team of mercenaries, hunters and paleontologists led by Ludlow, sent to capture several dinosaurs, these are to be taken to a newly-proposed theme park in San Diego, meanwhile tracker and team leader Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite) wants to capture a male Tyrannosaurus Rex, he uses its crying and injured offspring as bate. Hearing this Nick and Sarah release the caged dinosaurs to wreak havoc on InGen camp, Nick also frees the infant T. Rex, he and Sarah mend its broken leg in the trailer, Kelly is taken to shelter in the high hide, Ian rushes to the trailer knowing that its parents will be searching for it, moments later the two T. Rex arrive, so they release the infant. However the adult T. Rex return to attack the trailer, pushing it over the nearby cliff, while Kelly is safe Eddie arrives and saves the others with a rope tied to a tree, however whilst in the SUV he is devoured by the T. Rex, sending the trailer, the SUV and all their equipment to fall and be destroyed, Ian, Sarah and Nick are found by the InGen team. Both groups now have no communication or vehicles, so they team up to reach the radio station on foot, on the journey, Roland's second-in- command Dieter Stark (Fargo's Peter Stormare) goes missing and is killed by a pack of Compsognathus, and during the next night the camp is panicked and flee when the female adult T. Rex arrives, Roland meanwhile manages to tranquilise the male adult. The hunters disband into the thick trees and go through a field of long grass, there the troop are attacked by Velociraptors; Ian, Sarah, Nick and Kelly continue toward the compound alone, Nick is able to find the radio, communicate and calls for help, the other three encounter a trio of Velociraptors, but manage to escape to the rescue helicopter to take them off the island, in mid-air they spot the male adult T. Rex is unconscious in a cage and ready for transport. In San Diego the freighter carrying the male adult Tyrannosaurus Rex heads for the mainland, but crashes into the dock, the entire crew are dead, the conscious T. Rex escapes and rampages the city, but Ian and Sarah get the T. Rex infant from an InGen facility and eventually lure the adult back to the ship, Ludlow trying to intervene is killed the cargo, before it can escape again the adult is tranquilised by Sarah, and Ian closes the hold. The film ends with Ian, Sarah and Kelly watching the ship carrying the adult and infant T. Rex on the news as it is escorted back to Isla Sorna, Hammond appears in a recorded interview explaining that the American and Costa Rican governments have agreed to declare the island a nature preserve, he ends by saying life will find a way.

Duffy as Dr. Robert Burke, Joseph Mazzello as Tim, Ariana Richards as Lex, Thomas Rosales Jr. as Carter, Mousehunt's Ian Abercrombie as Butler, Hostages' Billy Brown as InGen Worker, David Koepp as Unlucky Bastard and Eli Roth as Subway Man. Goldblum is still likeably awkward, Attenborough has his good short stint, and supporting stars Moore, Vaughn and Postlethwaite do fine as well, but once again the real stars are the dinosaurs, brought to life by great special effects and models, the story is not compelling, it feels predictable, and the T. Rex crashing through San Diego is an obvious small send up of Godzilla, but there are some engaging action moments, especially the trailer over the cliff, and T. Rex and raptor encounters, it's not a bad science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!

Duffy as Dr. Robert Burke, Joseph Mazzello as Tim, Ariana Richards as Lex, Thomas Rosales Jr. as Carter, Mousehunt's Ian Abercrombie as Butler, Hostages' Billy Brown as InGen Worker, David Koepp as Unlucky Bastard and Eli Roth as Subway Man. Goldblum is still likeably awkward, Attenborough has his good short stint, and supporting stars Moore, Vaughn and Postlethwaite do fine as well, but once again the real stars are the dinosaurs, brought to life by great special effects and models, the story is not compelling, it feels predictable, and the T. Rex crashing through San Diego is an obvious small send up of Godzilla, but there are some engaging action moments, especially the trailer over the cliff, and T. Rex and raptor encounters, it's not a bad science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!

Basically it is year 2058, and soon Earth will be uninhabitable after irreversible effects of pollution and global warming, therefore Professor John Robinson (William Hurt) is leading the Jupiter 2 Mission travelling into outer space to the further planet called Alpha Prime where life can continue. The lead scientist is taking his whole family along too, wife Dr. Maureen Robinson (Mimi Rogers), and the children, eldest Dr. Judy Robinson (Heather Graham), and the youngsters Penny (Mean Girls' Lacey Chabert, also voiced Meg Griffin in Family Guy, before Mila Kunis) and Will (Jack Johnson). Also joining the mission is fighter pilot Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc) who helped with the hypergate defence force, the gate will eventually be used to transport space crafts to the new planet instantly. The mission begins and the ship takes off, with everybody being cryogenically frozen for the ten year journey, however sinister Dr. Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) sabotages the mission by having the ship robot try and kill the family. They manage to wake up and stop him, but when the destroyed parts of the ship stop them navigating, and they are forced to go into hyperspace being pulled into the sun, they end up lost in space. They come across a spaceship wreck, and hope to find salvation and co-ordinates of where they are and how to get to Alpha Prime, but it seems to be a deserted ship from the future. On the ship they pick up an alien monkey like creature Penny calls Blarp, and a swarm of deadly space spiders nearly attack them, and Will loses the robot in the process. Soon after they crash land on a near planet, and they are stuck there until the stuff on top of the ship is moved, and there is time to investigate a giant bubble which appears to be able to propel them into a further future. So John and Don go into the bubble, and they seem to be transported to a future where the ship crashed, an older Will (Jared Harris), and with Smith and young Will following behind Smith sees that the rest of the family are dead. After escaping this bubble future world, and a mutated spider creature Smith (also Goldman), John and the family are reunited, John obviously shows his love for his young son, and they got off the planet, and use the co-ordinates they collected to speed to Alpha Prime. Also starring Mark Goddard as General, Lennie James as Jeb Walker, June Lockhart as Principal Cartwright and Edward Fox as Businessman. The performances are all daft accompanied by a daft script with too many cheesy and predictable moments, the special effects are modest, but they don't change anything about how terrible and annoying it is, a silly family science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel. Adequate!

It seems like a movie from a young filmmaker who is out to prove herself. And in my mind, she did. She's really interested in everything going on behind the scenes. She's not afraid to take on subjects which some might find inappropriate, but which are a part of film-making. Of course the director is always central, but there is so much more going on and the other parts are hardly ever touched in a movie like this.I'm personally interested in film-making beyond the glamor, so this is a movie for me.

Here, director Ron Howard takes the classic story and, with the help of an energetic Jim Carrey performance, transforms it into a diverting film experience. However, considering Howard's track record as a maker of excellent and moving films (e.g Apollo 13, Cocoon, EdTv, etc.) this is rather lightweight stuff. While it is fun to watch, and energetic, and diverting as mentioned, it is not a film that lingers in one's mind long after watching it. Rather like Christmas wrapping paper, it looks pretty and you have a fun time tearing into it, but ultimately it's something to be disposed of without much afterthought.In the town of Whoville, the Whos (residents) are preparing for Christmas. It is a time of year they love, going to extreme lengths to buy mountains of presents and trim their houses. One little girl who questions if all the hullabaloo surrounding Christmas might be a bit superfluous is Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), daughter of the local postal worker Lou Lou Who (Bill Irwin). Cindy Lou figures that Christmas shouldn't be about who buys the most gifts or who trims their house most spectacularly.... somewhere deep down inside she senses that Christmas should be about love, family and community. Overlooking Whoville is a large mountain which is home to a grumpy, hate-filled green creature called the Grinch (Jim Carrey). The Grinch famously hates everyone, but more than that he hates Christmas (since it was a Christmas-event-gone-wrong which drove him to turn his back on Who-kind). Condy Lou decides that the time has come to give the Grinch a chance to make amends with the Whos - and vice versa - but her friendly gesture backfires and the enraged Grinch plots to ruin the festivities by stealing everyones' presents.Carrey's performance as the Grinch is amazing, both for his manic physical energy and for the skill with which he conveys numerous emotions from beneath so many layers of make-up. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins uses his lovely Weslh lilt to provide the film with a classy narration. While the remaining performances are competent enough, none of them really stand out in a spectacular way. The set design by Meredith Boswell is also noteworthy, bringing the town of Whoville vibrantly to life. There seem to me to be two principal flaws with the film. First is the fact that the story is incredibly thin, with little to sustain a running time just short of two hours. Second (and most damaging) flaw is the heavy-handed, sickly-sweet preachiness. It's a sad thing if people have really become so self-centered that they've forgotten the honourable values associated with Christmas. But this film lays on the sentiment too thickly to convert those people into a better way of thinking. People who DO hold traditional values don't need a message like this ramming down their throat; and people who DON'T hold traditional values won't buy into this kind of sugary preaching.
