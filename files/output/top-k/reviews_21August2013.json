Up until recently, the Star Trek franchise in general was like a foreign language to me, and I knew just about nothing about it. When Star Trek Into Darkness was coming out, I decided to give this movie a watch, since the time felt right for me to do so. And 2 hours and 20 minutes later, I was a Star Trek fan.Now granted, this is not a perfect movie by any means. A lot of the effects shots can drag out for quite a while, and some things can even get confusing as a result of that. But I was able to get past that, and I was rewarded with a satisfying Star Trek experience as a result. The plot was compelling and interesting, and it felt right for something with the Star Trek name on it. The characters took a while to get used to for me, but by the end I knew who they all were. The special effects, though very slow moving and primitive by today's standards, still look good for their time. I know it was trying to be like 2001 A Space Odyssey, but even so, some of the effects shots that tried to mimic that still look good now. (And no, I didn't see the enhanced director's cut, I saw the original version).I think that my favorite aspect of Star Trek The Motion Picture though, is the philosophies that is was conveying. I think Spock said it best when he said, Logic is never alone, implying that there is a God, and he plays a part in everything that involves the unexplained. I never expected to find such elements to a Star Trek film, and there are others around the movie as well. One other one involves the never ending search for knowledge, and plenty of others that I can't remember at the moment. So as a whole, Star Trek The Motion Picture, while being a slow paced and sometimes dragging film, is still a good work of art. It was an interesting introduction to the Star Trek franchise, and as of now I still like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Trek, or to anyone who want to get into Stat Trek. On the other hand, I still love Star Wars better.8\/10.

In order to make some more money, he decides to apply for a job working nights as a Taxi Driver. He attends dodgy porn theatres in the day and works long nights meeting all of New York's 'scum' as he calls them. Lots of shady characters litter the story along with a cameo from the director, Martin Scorsese in the back of his taxi cap. Travis' one desire is to be with the woman he sees so very often at the Charles Palantine building, Betsy (Cybill Shepard.) As the movie progresses, you feel an awful as you witness him reach out to people and constantly get rejected, both angering and saddening him. His mind slowly descends into madness and you get the feeling that he soon will be violently out-lashing against the society in general. He begins collecting guns and isolating himself from others; watching boring shows on television and obsessing about a twelve year old prostitute (Jodie Foster) he feels it is his duty to save. He shaves his head into the now iconic mohawk and goes on a gruesome killing spree, murdering several pimps and business men within the whore house. Travis is hailed as a hero which is an attempt to talk about society and the way in some cases, it will justify violence for the greater good. To me, Travis is not a hero but at the same time he isn't your average villain. The character is very carefully crafted, giving the illusion that he is just a lonely man that wants compassion just like everybody else. The problem is, many people can see a bit of themselves within him, as Scorsese has said himself, there are real life Travis' all over the world; he is not some made up character. Robert De Niro's portrayal of a madman slowly going insane, day by day is astounding and highly convincing. This is followed by some extremely strong leads, especially notable is Iris (Jodie Foster), Betsy (Cybill Shepard) and the pimp, Sport or Matthew (Harvey Keitel.) Along with a lot of improvising throughout the scenes, the actors and actresses hold their ground very well and all portray their characters as they would appear in real life. One constantly overlooked scene is in fact very significant. The scene I am talking about is the one where he brakes his television, right before, Travis is looking at a show on TV. It flashes images on couples dancing and having fun while the song 'Late For The Sky' by Jackson Browne plays. The television is actually depicting the life he can never have, on one side, teenagers and youth are out having fun and partying, living like a youthful person should. On the other side, you have a very disturbed man who is loading up on guns and ammunition, isolating himself from people and attempting to for-fill his 'final mission.' Even Wizard, Travis' friend (Peter Boyle) states this when he talks to Bickle outside while they are at the diner. The themes and undertones of this movie is what really makes it something special. Not many films at the time were about alienation, depression, mental illness and anti-heroes. This was one of the first and still holds an impact to this day. The score by Bernard Herrmann captures the feeling and loneliness of New York City. In one part of the score, it has drums that build up suspense, almost like a horror film. Then all of a sudden, it transforms into a calm jazz song played by the saxophone. Variations of this one saxophone piece play throughout the movie. Another cool feature I've noticed, whether intentional or not is during the credits. The camera switches to Travis' point of view as he drives around the streets of New York, looking at many of the interesting sites and buildings around the city. The same slow jazz song plays, it is all quite relaxing. Around halfway through the credits, the music suddenly changes into the suspense part of the piece. Travis then switches his viewpoint from the buildings to people. He is not fixed after the end, he can still descend into the spiral of madness he fought so hard to get out of. He is still alienated and he is still sick.

But, I'm glad I did. It's not a GREAT movie, but it's a very good movie.I know. Some of you are upset that I don't think it's great. I'm not totally into what I'll refer to as episodic movies. I like a movie that flows. And this one really didn't. Various episodes were punctuated by old couples briefly telling how they met. I enjoyed those little vignettes between episodes...but I just don't like episodicness (and yes, I know that's not a word).Now, aside from that, it's a good movie. Boy meets girl. Boy and girl grate on each other. Boy and girl keep running into each other every few years. Eventually boy and girl fall in love, but not until they've annoyed the hell out of each other every once in a while. And every once in a while along the way, there's a heckuva funny line.There are really only 4 actors worth mentioning here. To begin with, Billy Crystal as the male lead. I'd forgotten he was once young; like back when he was on Soap. But what I found interesting about his performance was that in terms of phrasing, he's still sorta the same. Meg Ryan...well, I've come to like her as an actress, but I never really noticed her until 4 years later in Sleepless In Seattle. Here...well, she's an actress...but not quite Meg Ryan, yet. Here, I was not overly impressed with her as the female lead. Carrie Fisher is her best friend, and does nicely. She's pleasant enough, but not good enough to have maintained her star status from Star Wars. Bruno Kirby was pretty good as the best friend's husband and pal to Crystal. He had a period of playing this sort of role rather well.It's interesting to watch this Rob Reiner film in what would have been his formative years.So for me, this film doesn't set the world on fire, but it's pretty good.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"21 August 2013","score":"","review":" 'The Stepfather' is a solid thriller that slides into schlock at times but maintains an atmosphere of credible horror. The first sequel cranks ups the schlock factor and dials down the credibility, damaging the attempts to create tension by housing them in a plot so lacking in common sense it constantly trips over itself.Step one in the film's plan to undermine itself is reversing the ostensibly fatal stab to the heart sustained by Terry O'Quinn's demented stepfather at the end of the original film. He has a couple of scars but otherwise has recovered astonishingly well and should trade survival tips with Robert G. Durant. Next is a breakout from a mental hospital that cheekily leaves out a couple of key details, and from there it's one bit of silliness after another.How does O'Quinn rent a house using just the contents of one victim's wallet? How does he keep up this lifestyle when his phony counselling practice has about five clients, all apparently his neighbours? Why does he whistle his signature tune when he leaves a murder scene in the middle of the night? Why is there a picture of him in the newspaper for us to see but not one on the news when his fiancée Meg Foster watches a report about his previous victims?Foster's character is maddeningly gullible and it doesn't help that the romance moves far too quickly to be convincing. After all these contrivances the movie ends in an uncomfortably nasty (if visually impressive) way for Foster and her son, but as there's another sequel there isn't much finality in O'Quinn's apparent fate. It's all kind of rubbish and inferior to the original in pretty much every way.That said, I have to admit it's trashily compelling and does have a few scenes of genuine tension, like Foster's mailwoman friend checking O'Quinn's mail as she tries to catch him out. And O'Quinn is very good, as before. It's tat, then, but it does have a certain drive that gets it through its idiotic plot.

Five years later, in the year of 2002, British director Christopher Nolan adapted the material into a way bigger production, brought in A-listers Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank, re-located for a small town in Alaska, while keeping the original title. The plot stayed the same as well a long-time LAPD detective and his younger colleague are sent to The Last Frontier to assist in a homicide investigation. Before long, Insomnia veers away from the typical crime thriller when Pacino's character suffers from the eponymous illness and the delinquent suddenly crops up &#x96; having an ace up his sleeve.As an adorer of David Fincher's Se7en, I was instantly hooked by the John-Doe-esque suspense, but contrary to Kevin Spacey's intriguing psychopath, Insomnia's bad guy doesn't provide us with a spellbindingly intense finale, but merely a clichéd TV movie showdown. As fascinating as psychological thrill can be, omitting any other suspense rarely works. Two sub-par action sequences and brief glimpses of Pacino's insomniac hallucinations are all we get in these two hours and in this case, less isn't more. Such perpetual lack of intense scenes or violence could only be excused if it were a PG-13 film, which it is not! All of this is only slightly spiced up by what is most definitely Al Pacino's best acting performance in this century.Even though Nolan has several good approaches, Insomnia is nothing more than generic, unspectacular, and forgettable in the long run. Hillary Seitz's adapted screenplay is laden with crime show stereotypes and gratuitous dialogue but lacks real character development or any unique elements. The best example for this is Hilary Swank who obviously has the most unfavourable role as an aspiring assistant detective that wants nothing more than to get advise from the old-established cop. Due to all of that, remarkable achievements in terms of visuals can't help the film anymore than Pacino's dedicated acting and Insomnia is best watched on a weekday evening while eating lunch and conversing with your partner.
