No one is better than Kruger at what he does, but he faces his toughest challenge yet when he's assigned to protect Lee Cullen (Williams), a woman on the run. After working with the FBI on a sting operation involving illegal gunrunning - especially as it relates to a high-tech new EMP gun - now all sorts of bad guys are after her, from corrupt U.S. bureaucrats to the Russian Mafia. (Not to be confused with Roma Maffia, who's in the movie). Kruger's rival is his former compatriot DeGuerin (Caan), who is a formidable nemesis, but Kruger's got plenty of tricks up his sleeve besides erasing people, as we'll clearly see. Will DeGuerin and the other baddies get ERASED...permanently? Eraser is probably one of the last, best Arnold movies. It's a fitting way to unofficially wrap up the Golden Age of his career of the 80's and 90's, because the movie is pure Hollywood ridiculous action in true Schwarzenegger style. It truly is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, a genre unto itself, if that makes any sense. You pretty much have to love it. It's nice to see a younger, thinner, more agile Arnie, along with his unmistakable voice. Of course, he gets many classic one-liners to cap off many sequences. The fact that Kruger is supposed to be a U.S. Marshal, but becomes an unkillable superhero who for all intents and purposes can fly and survive grievous injuries with ease, is an oversight of the best kind, something the audience has to go with and couldn't do without, unless they wanted a much less entertaining movie.The whole thing is very 90's, with classic computers, including the very-new Internet, and some now-vintage cell phones. The technology even helps Kruger with his job, stating on the screen Prepare to Erase. But whether tiny budget or huge budget, action movies of the day had one thing in common people after the disc, in this case what appears to be some more hot technology, Minidisc. Someone always wants that darn disc. But you KNOW the action isn't taking place in the present time because James Caan smokes indoors in government buildings. That's the ultimate no-no. Only a true bad guy would do that.Besides Caan, we also have Vanessa Williams, who confronts James Cromwell, stating to him that at the Cyrez Corporation, treason is part of the corporate strategy! - which sounds like a perfect ad tagline for them. Williams has had a long and storied career, but is only really relevant to fans of this site as co-star of Under the Gun (1988) with Sam Jones. So, between this and that, her action pedigree is surprising and pretty respectable. While we often joke about the star singing the end credits song (like we've done for Jerry Trimble, etc.), in this case, Williams actually does, because this is a Hollywood production, after all, and they can get high-caliber talent. There is another rockin' tune that plays after the movie, which we suspect is Trevor Rabin's Caught a Train, but we're not sure. As far as the soundtrack itself, there are those wailin' guitar squeals heard often, which we liked because we thought it was a throwback to the 80's.Watch out for a cameo from Sven-Ole Thorsen towards the end of the movie, uncredited, as a Russian thug. Evidently, he and Arnie are buddies. Arnie should have advised him against being in Fatal Combat (1997). Another familiar face for us who turned up briefly was Patrick Kilpatrick, which helped to seal Eraser's connection to other action movies of the day. We also liked seeing James Coburn, if it was a pretty small role, but in a movie filled with actors with distinctive voices (i.e. Arnold and Caan), he stood out. Pastorelli added energy as Arnold's sidekick, and full marks go to one Andy Romano, who played Undersecretary of Defense Daniel Harper. Romano is one of those character actors that has been in tons of stuff, but gets little acclaim or recognition. We try to celebrate these people, especially when they shine, and here he certainly does as one of DeGuerin's partners in crime.If what we've read is true, Eraser was a troubled production with many problems along the road to completion. It's one of those situations where there are many writers and people have to be brought in to do tons of rewrites. Maybe it's because some Law & Order people started the script, or heavyweights like Frank Darabont and even John Milius came in to polish things up, but, from a viewer's perspective, you really can't tell.

The core can be seen when Elwood accedes to Harvey remaining behind with the self absorbed Dr. Chumley and his boring dreams of Akron. As Elwood turns away from Harvey watch all the happiness drain from his face. His walk even changes to a depressed shuffle. As he walks morosely away, watch when the gate re-opens behind him. What, well thank you, I prefer you too. His happiness floods back all over him. This is what Harvey means; yes, it is an allegorical fairy tale that can stray a bit into mawkishness but, really, that love makes all the difference between pain and happiness, this is why I love it so. The world takes place outside of the solipsistic bubble of love between Elwood and Harvey. Their love forms an impenetrable shield about Dowd that even when he is being committed by his sister, at the end of her wits with him, he is joyously oblivious. The director waits until about halfway through before showing us that Dowd is not crazy; listen to Wilson read the dictionary definition of Pooka. At the end, he reads,And how are you today Mr. Wilson? Wilson is so startled he starts turning the book every which way but loose trying to see how an inanimate book just spoke to him.By the end of this classic, Dr. Chumley can see him now and doors open by unseen hands or paws, as the case may be. I read so much acid poured over this classic. The first half can tend to be a little slapstick but it grows more serious as it progresses. By the end, it is deathly serious; we hear the fate of other patients who took Dr. Chumley's normal injection from the cab driver. Veda quickly stops Elwood from losing his most endearing feature his universal love for everyone. Since he is loved, he gives only love and acceptance to all about him. I understand young viewers may not pick up on the allegory but, truly, it was never written to be taken literally. The movie's first half has some of the funniest scenes committed to film. How about when Wilson takes Veda to the mental home,Hi there honey, you want to come inside and pick some flowers off the wallpaper? I am very hard, as a reviewer, on movies that glorify ignoring reality or living in a delusion, as you find in most musicals. Here, Elwood's Being There is so utterly alien to everyone around him. Little existential acts like cheerfully accepting the mail, thanking the mailman and then tearing all the letters up without even glancing at them. Yes, detractors, the bar scene with Sanderson and the nurse drags a bit. This is not a perfect movie but it is the best movie Jimmy Stewart ever made. The lesson that Love transforms people beyond their animal passions is not a silly or pedestrian lesson. Also, that being loved makes all the difference I will not bore you with psychological studies but suffice to say it is not inaccurate to distill the differential between the criminal and the social worker to this tiny word Love. He basks in Harvey's love; they walk together oblivious of all about them. Sitting at the bar, trying to give what most humans desire above all things someone to listen to them. This is why it resonates and concomitantly is reviled. Those who detest the movie miss the allegory completely. To them, it is some nut job who has an invisible bunny for a friend. Those who understand its lesson adore the movie.The last shot of them walking into the sunrise together is exactly the ontological point of the consanguinity Into The Light.

Watching thisrecently, I was struck by how simple and straightforward a watch it is. It really is the most simple fairytale you can get, and it seemed so much bigger when I was little. But nonetheless it still tells a great story of good and evil, wonder, and of course the happy ending, that's such a joy to get into. It looks like a storybook come to life and has such a charming quaintness to it that gets right in your heart and stays there! I can't help but marvel at all the endless rich small details there are in everything, there's such magnificent artistry on display here. The lush outdoor scenes, and the incredible realistic use of light and shadows. The animators took everything they learned from the wonderful training ground that was the Silly Symphonies and poured all of the best elements and techniques into this, and you can feel the spirit of what they were trying to express in animated form and it's beautiful and quite amazing. It's simplistic but it was their very first film. The next one though has a great complexity of emotions and dark undertones to it. Not by any means that this doesn't have its grim touches. Words such as dead kill death and blood are spoken, the excellent early scene where Snow White gets overwhelmed by her own fear and sees the woods as monstrous faces feels like a bit of a homage to the early more twisted animations of the Fleisher Brothers to me. There's the macabre prospect of an actual heart the Queen holds in an ornate box that's left to the imagination, and the climactic scene where the Dwarfs charge after the Queen - my goodness, they clearly mean to kill her! And finally when through her own doing she falls to her death very ominously. Snow White herself is so impossibly lovely and adorable that it's like she represents happiness and innocence. She's just a sweet singing girl in the woods with apparently a superpower to command the animals! You ask me if a person can watch Whistle While You Work without smiling or feeling lightened at all then they ain't got no heart... She has the voice of an angel and children have loved her for generations. Not to criticise too harshly, but I noticed that apart from supplying many cute and funny sight gags, the animals also serve the purpose of making Snow White seem larger as a character. And when it's not them it's the Dwarfs. And in my opinion it's actually the Prince who's the real cardboard cutout character, but that's not his fault! And ah, the Queen, if nothing else you couldn't say that she's not a proactive woman! I love her, she's so ice cold and commanding. Her malicious intentions to Snow White alone make her one of the scariest Disney villains ever, for she plain old wants her dead, simply for being too pretty! My favourite scene is the exquisitely animated sequence that skillfully builds the malevolence where the evil Queen concocts a potion comprised of the most menacing of ingredients to transform into a cackling old crone. Her disorienting transformation from second fairest in the land to hideous hag is like a formula created by Alfred Hitchcock. And as she turns around and reveals her new face, every child in the theatre was compelled to jump in horror. Very witch-like, right down to the wart on the nose. From an adult's perspective however, the before and after makeover is truly a trick and a treat. It makes me laugh every time when the crow is in the skull! The Dwarfs are what most people always remembered. It's in the collective consciousness because of them. In Gremlins, everybody knows what Hi-Ho! is! My favourite one is Grumpy because he pretends not to care, but he cares very much. It means something to me when he secretly blushes at Snow White's kiss, when he warns her not to let anyone in the cottage, when he cries out We gotta save her!, and at that sad scene that's like a wake he sobs more than any of them at her supposed death. Good character, gruff and mean on the outside, kind on the inside. At the time before it came out they said that a feature length 'cartoon' couldn't work, that no one could emotionally connect to a character that was hand-drawn. How wrong they were. This film's true impact on popular culture is untold, I mean for one thing there wouldn't have been a Wizard of Oz movie without it, and that picture is a whole phenomenon in itself, nor would there have been a Disney legacy as we know it without the success of this film. It's certainly archaic, but to me it doesn't particularly feel like something that's pushing one hundred years, which is something that truly makes it, as Disney would say, timeless. The greatest folly, ended up being the greatest triumph. I always love watching this, I feel the same way about it that I do about all the Disney films that I love, watching them is like 'going home...'

But nonetheless it still tells a great story of good and evil, wonder, and of course the happy ending, that's such a joy to get into. It looks like a storybook come to life and has such a charming quaintness to it that gets right in your heart and stays there! I can't help but marvel at all the endless rich small details there are in everything, there's such magnificent artistry on display here. The lush outdoor scenes, and the incredible realistic use of light and shadows. The animators took everything they learned from the wonderful training ground that was the Silly Symphonies and poured all of the best elements and techniques into this, and you can feel the spirit of what they were trying to express in animated form and it's beautiful and quite amazing. It's simplistic but it was their very first film. The next one though has a great complexity of emotions and dark undertones to it. Not by any means that this doesn't have its grim touches. Words such as dead kill death and blood are spoken, the excellent early scene where Snow White gets overwhelmed by her own fear and sees the woods as monstrous faces feels like a bit of a homage to the early more twisted animations of the Fleisher Brothers to me. There's the macabre prospect of an actual heart the Queen holds in an ornate box that's left to the imagination, and the climactic scene where the Dwarfs charge after the Queen - my goodness, they clearly mean to kill her! And finally when through her own doing she falls to her death very ominously. Snow White herself is so impossibly lovely and adorable that it's like she represents happiness and innocence. She's just a sweet singing girl in the woods with apparently a superpower to command the animals! You ask me if a person can watch Whistle While You Work without smiling or feeling lightened at all then they ain't got no heart... She has the voice of an angel and children have loved her for generations. Not to criticise too harshly, but I noticed that apart from supplying many cute and funny sight gags, the animals also serve the purpose of making Snow White seem larger as a character. And when it's not them it's the Dwarfs. And in my opinion it's actually the Prince who's the real cardboard cutout character, but that's not his fault! And ah, the Queen, if nothing else you couldn't say that she's not a proactive woman! I love her, she's so ice cold and commanding. Her malicious intentions to Snow White alone make her one of the scariest Disney villains ever, for she plain old wants her dead, simply for being too pretty! My favourite scene is the exquisitely animated sequence that skillfully builds the malevolence where the evil Queen concocts a potion comprised of the most menacing of ingredients to transform into a cackling old crone. Her disorienting transformation from second fairest in the land to hideous hag is like a formula created by Alfred Hitchcock. And as she turns around and reveals her new face, every child in the theatre was compelled to jump in horror. Very witch-like, right down to the wart on the nose. From an adult's perspective however, the before and after makeover is truly a trick and a treat. It makes me laugh every time when the crow is in the skull! The Dwarfs are what most people always remembered. It's in the collective consciousness because of them. In Gremlins, everybody knows what Hi-Ho! is! My favourite one is Grumpy because he pretends not to care, but he cares very much. It means something to me when he secretly blushes at Snow White's kiss, when he warns her not to let anyone in the cottage, when he cries out We gotta save her!, and at that sad scene that's like a wake he sobs more than any of them at her supposed death. Good character, gruff and mean on the outside, kind on the inside. At the time before it came out they said that a feature length 'cartoon' couldn't work, that no one could emotionally connect to a character that was hand-drawn. How wrong they were. This film's true impact on popular culture is untold, I mean for one thing there wouldn't have been a Wizard of Oz movie without it, and that picture is a whole phenomenon in itself, nor would there have been a Disney legacy as we know it without the success of this film. It's certainly archaic, but to me it doesn't particularly feel like something that's pushing one hundred years, which is something that truly makes it, as Disney would say, timeless. The greatest folly, ended up being the greatest triumph. I always love watching this, I feel the same way about it that I do about all the Disney films that I love, watching them is like 'going home...'

It took bravery to play a lowly bank clerk completely subjugated to his wife. We have constant scenes of her berating him with the picture of her first husband openly displayed for existential contrast which she does incessantly. He rescues a prostitute who worships her abusive pimp boyfriend. Robinson paints as a hobby completely oblivious to its monetary value. Well, you can guess what the prostitute and the pimp decide to do with this one. Robinson's role, for the bulk of the movie, is so self-effacing and humiliating while providing the moral basis for what comes later, it shows you the actor the man was. Bennett and Duryea are both excellent in not exactly typical roles for 1940's movies. Lang always returns to this theme as in Secret Behind The Door. The monster inside of seemingly ordinary 'civilized' people. The transformation is quite sudden here; there is a growing suspicion in Robinson's mind which crescendos with one of his paintings being spotted in a art dealer's window. Even here, Bennett deftly manipulates him despite when he discovers that she is signing his paintings. His adoration of a woman way above his physical appearance's station is the key to understanding the obsession. Indeed, spend some time with his wife and the fixation becomes quite believable.Lang has a moral quandary on his hands given the Code of the day. The cruel murder of Bennett is off-screen. He then frames the pimp for the murder. Here is where Lang twists the film so cleverly. It starts so well showing a ride with Robinson listening to two cops discussing crime. One of them says the ones that didn't get caught are the real losers for their consciences will torment them forever. Sure enough, the movie crosses out of an empirical Noir and adds supernatural touches of the two of them haunting him to insanity. This has always been the point of attack upon this film; admittedly, it is quite a break from traditional Noir. Yet, it gives the movie its unique, dark status as one of the bleakest of all Noirs even Kiss Of Death which doesn't exactly end well. There, Mature pays with his life for the protection of his loved ones. Here, the Code had to be met without making the usual hackneyed cops are prescient, omniscient geniuses which is so typical in bad Noir. I recommend it to you as a singular Noir that will stay with you for quite a while. The blending of Noir with a supernatural Twilight Zone type ending gives it a needed darkness. Of course, sociologically, you get Big Brother's point, don't you? Even if you get away with it, 'they' will come to haunt you.

Computer animation has since become the dominant form of animation. Dreamworks, Warner Brothers, and Universal (and maybe some other companies I have forgotten) have created their own computer animation studios to rival Pixar. Pixar themselves would continue to push just how far animation could go, both in animation quality and in storytelling ambition. So one may wonder, 20 years after this all got started, is the one that started it all still excellent by today's standards? The answer is an emphatic YES.The story is fairly well known by now, but I'll repeat it anyway for those who are unfamiliar. This Toy Story centers around the toy cowboy Woody (wonderfully voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of the young boy Andy (John Morris), who has several other toys, including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (the late Jim Varney), and Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberg, whose consistent appearances in Pixar films has become a running gag of sorts - and was acknowledged as such in Cars). The film starts on Andy's birthday party, a time when all of his toys get nervous, because Andy might get a toy that he likes more than the others. Sure enough, he's received the latest cool toy, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen, an inspired choice). This results in Woody being demoted to second best, something he doesn't take well at all. Woody attempts to push Buzz out of the way so he can get back to being Andy's favorite toy, but through a series of mistakes (and misadventures), he winds up making both he and Buzz separated from their owner Andy. Worse, they end up in the possession of their neighbor, Sid (Erik von Detten), who prefers to blow up his toys instead of play with them. Now Woody and Buzz have to make peace and work together if they are to return to Andy (oh, and did I mention that Andy is moving away soon?).The premise is simple enough, but it's in the execution where things get very inspired. Take, for example, how the toys attempt to learn what presents Andy is receiving. They send several Army Men Toy Soldiers down for a Code Red mission, and how these soldiers pull this off always puts a smile on my face. I still remember being inspired by watching the soldiers move that radio into that small leafy plant on the bottom floor (I was seven when I first saw this). I was so inspired, in fact, that a year later, I was teaching my toys how to hide in the Christmas tree during Christmas. Director John Lasseter and the Pixar team have deeply considered how a world of toys would work. How would a toy feel about getting relegated to second best when a new toy comes around? And it's pretty fun to see how the toys have to consistently make sure the human world never knows about their awareness.And the strength of this script goes beyond its consideration of a world of toys. Its tight and to the point. There are no wasted moments in the film's (short) 81-minute runtime. Pixar is not satisfied with simply showing what computer animation can do. They are interested in guiding along through a story that provides laughs, thrills, an occasional scare, and something valuable to learn at the end.Obviously, the quality of computer animation has improved greatly since this film first came out (watch how they animate a dog here, and compare it to how Pixar would animate Sullivan's fur in Monster's Inc., for example). But let's remember, at the time, this was considered to be massively advanced animation. Many adult critics wondered if kids would realize just how big of a breakthrough this was in the history of animation, but I can reassure them, I may have been only 7 years old, but even I realized an entirely computer animated film was a very big deal indeed! Looking back now, I do think we should consider some of the things the animators did in this film that further emphasized what computer animation should be going for. Gene Siskel pointed out that you could see a reflection off of Buzz's helmet (and even stated, as a compliment, They didn't have to do that!). The toys, the settings, everything was beautifully rendered and still looks good today. Even if one just reduced this picture to its visual qualities (inadvisable), they would still come out quite satisfied.Today officially marks the 20 year anniversary of when I saw this film (December 22nd, 1995), and it's high time I got to writing a review of it. Toy Story absolutely changed movies, and that is not a hyperbole. It's popularity made others realize the financial potential in computer animation. It's quality made everyone realize just what computer animation could (and should) pull off, both in visuals and storytelling. Pixar themselves would start a very long winning streak of highly acclaimed pictures, with many seemingly getting even more glowing reviews then the picture before it (heck we've gotten two great Toy Story sequels to boot). That this film still holds up even though many envelope pushing animated pictures have been released since is impressive indeed.20 years later, Toy Story still rocks!

Pixar themselves would start a very long winning streak of highly acclaimed pictures, with many seemingly getting even more glowing reviews then the picture before it (heck we've gotten two great Toy Story sequels to boot). That this film still holds up even though many envelope pushing animated pictures have been released since is impressive indeed.20 years later, Toy Story still rocks!

I thought it was good but not amazing. I had different expectations back then, I wanted the ghouls to be more monstrous and the characters more heroic. But as time went on this movie grew on me and I now appreciate that it didn't meet my expectations. Having the characters portrayed as humans instead of able heroes made the movie more believable and that makes the movie much more dreadful to watch. The ghouls as they are is frightening enough by the mere thought of the dead refusing to be dead, also that they eat human flesh is even more terrifying. Now to be honest if I had continued to have the same view on movies as I did as a teenager, I would have that thought movies like 'World War Z' and the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' are better movies. But since I have matured and I lean more towards originality I have started to regard 'Night of the Living Dead' as a horror masterpiece. Sure it is low budget, sure it is not as gory as modern movies, sure the ghouls\/zombies are not those hyper monsters that defies gravity and make scary pig sounds but only few movies can fill its audience with such dread as 'Night of the Living' did.Horror is not only about violence and gore, it is not only about cheap jump scares, it is only about ghosts, demons and God. No. Horror is much more than that, horror is also a certain mood, but more correctly an atmosphere. As time goes on I am more and more into atmosphere and 'Night of the Living Dead' is full of that dreadful and heavy feeling of eventual doom. The degradation of human civilization, life slowly fading away with no salvation in sight just to walk the earth as a cannibalistic living dead. With the only hope being the fake promise from the Bible. Death is a really fascinating and it is used as one of the main themes in this movie. One of the themes the movie also has is corruption. Shortly explained look at how the characters behave. Logic dictates the chances to survive is bigger when there is cooperation, but although the characters want to survive they were still more concerned about themselves instead of coming to an agreement that eventually lead to their doom.

The plot wasn't the best, the characters could've been more fleshed out, but this movie has everything. It's one of those that are absolutely perfect. The acting, the effects, directing, plot, everything was just perfect. The acting is great and these characters were already likable in the previous movie, but here there is much more chemistry between them, they feel like they are real and you care about them much, much more. George Lucas isn't directing this time, but Irvin Kershner did a great job and directed the best Star Wars movie of all time! About the effects, I mostly think the same I thought about the previous movie. They are ahead of it's time, they aged well, and it was all practical, but it's so hard to believe. John Williams made a perfect score to the movie and here we are introduced to a theme of the Empire. There is especially that one unforgettable scene when that music plays and it fits perfectly. The plot is emotional, intense and that twist at the end will stick with you for a long time (of course, if someone didn't already spoil it to you). It's foreshadowing the next movie and sets it up in such a good way that it's impossible to top it. While the other movies have their flaws, this one is flawless and watchable over and over again.

Who would have thought when this was released 30 years ago back in 1985 that it would forever remain etched in everyone's memories and in movie history as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time. With its cleverly intelligent story and the perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, adventure, and romance, director Robert Zemeckis struck gold with this one of a kind movie that can never be duplicated. It also goes without saying that nobody can go past Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown. Mention any of those actors and without a doubt Back to the Future will always pop up as one of their most memorable movies.Back to the Future takes place in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an aspiring musician who is dating Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and lives with his dysfunctional family. His weak willed father George McFly (Crispin Glover) is bullied mercilessly by his boss Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and his mother Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) is an unhappy alcoholic. While she disapproves of Marty's relationship with Jennifer, Lorraine recounts how she met George when her father hit him with his car. On 26 October 1985, Marty meets his friend the eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in one of his most memorable roles) at a shopping mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. When the Libyan terrorists track down Doc Brown, Marty manages to escape however inadvertently finds himself transported back to 5 November 1955. Marty finds himself in a time where his parents George and Lorraine are teenagers and are yet to meet, Biff is still a bully, and Doc Brown is still developing the very early stages of a time displacement machine but is still the same eccentric scientist only 30 years younger. Not only must Marty find a way back to 1985, but he must also not tamper with history otherwise he may never be born.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are tailor made for their respective roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown. Both of them will forever be remembered for this movie. They are just fantastic! Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have put in a lot of attention to detail with the comparisons between 1985 and 1955 as well as how the timeline may be affected for the McFly family and Hill Valley. With its quirky take on the time travel genre, the whole thing is cleverly written. The special effects for its era are top notch and Alan Silvestri's score is very memorable. Huey Lewis' theme song for the movie The Power of Love fits perfectly with the movie.I could go on forever how Back to the Future is one of the best movies of all time. What more can I say? 30 years on Back to the Future has not lost its timeless appeal and audiences everywhere get a thrill out of watching the movie. Even whenever people approach Michael J.

Equal lines, equal top billing....yes you heard it all before. The great rivals of the 70's (especially McQueen) was apparently sick of ego, and didn't allow the other part to have an inch of attention, or a second more of limelight than the opponent. Today this movie is only remembered by many as a cult flick of the (first) disaster era; some will rank it the as the best, the most successful. Patterns are all there the love stories, the struggling family relations, the other template people you get to know briefly before the tragic sets in. The bad ones who gets theirs.I still like this one pretty lot, and will pick it up again, maybe this x-mas?

Based on the memoir of the same name that I'm sure had an embellishment or two, about a tale of survival and escape and perseverance, and headed by a genuine movie star in McQueen. In spots, it can be great. There is a moment right after the trio escape the prison, that Dega falls down in agony while Papillon discovers that the boat they had been promised is rotten and no good. McQueen bursts into an uncharacteristic rage at the man he has just spent 2 years in solitary confinement for, and it could have been a visceral moment of pure emotion, having been foiled after the escape they had planned for so long, but it loses its power because McQueen chooses to put on this overwhelming sneer, which feels petty rather than being born of desperation and fear of once again being a prisoner. Both of them are convincing enough. Hoffman's Dega wears a pair of spectacles that balloon his pupils and give him this distinctly endearing geekiness. He frequently slips into his past persona as if he was once more selling counterfeit war bonds, and appealing to men and their patriotic pride and generosity. These sort of conniving salesmen are easy to befriend and to gain trust, but does it ever go beyond that? Papillon may be a better man than I, because it was hard to identify anything in their friendship that was worth those two torturous years in a dark cell. He tears up upon the end of that sacrifice, and as he makes his final leap to freedom, but is there really any substance to warrant it? It has trouble deciding what sort of film it should be. There's humour when Dega's intentions of luxury are foiled and we cut suddenly to the backbreaking Kilo 40, and when they encounter a crocodile and banter over who removes it. When Papillon is abused by the prison guards, the soundtrack balloons and exaggerates the hit and zooms in eagerly just to make sure we understand the impact. And there are several hallucination\/dream sequences, which seem to belong to another film altogether, but speak so plainly and vaguely of themes that could apply to almost anything. These are much less effective than McQueen himself. In the most haunting scene, he mutters a wish to confess, but painstakingly resists the urge. He holds back tears, his lips tremble, and we can see every ounce of pain and sheer will in the bloodshot eyes of a man who so diligently values and chases his freedom, and chooses to forgo it for a friend. Later, as he leaves his second spell of confinement, this one 5 years, we see its effects via makeup that have made his body weak, his hair white, and his speech haggard, but it does not seem as bad as before. This is an issue of pacing; we spend entirely too much time in the first prison, and little after it. It seems to be a 2 hour film that has somehow conjured an extra half an hour in excess. There is an wordless sequence where Papillon stumbles upon a native colony, and somehow manages to befriend them and even find romance, and it is the most clichéd, insufferable and unnecessary segment of them all. Similarly, they also stumble upon a leper colony, and Papillon is once again a hit, treating them with empathy as if they were human beings too and gaining their assistance, but at least this is done with sincerity. Schaffner's biggest triumph is that it feels epic in scale. The focus stretches into infinity and shows just how isolated the prisoners are from the modern and civilised world, but also how beautiful and crazy the wild is. As they talk of escape with desire in their eyes, the endless sea's horizon bobbles in the background. Silvers of light in the cramped boat hold reveal the shiny sheen of the prisoner's sweaty bodies. They work in the forests, rain, hail or sun. As Papillon is dragged to confinement, they pass a idyllic beach-front, which is swapped for the grimy grey walls that he loses sanity in. Koenekamp silhouettes characters at golden hour paddling upstream, on pure white Hawaiian-style beaches drinking coconut juice, and atop the cliffs of Devil's Island, which contrary to its name, is covered in palm trees, piglets and streams full of crayfish. It seems like paradise, at least according to Dega, but is is not freedom. And in the final shot, we glide over and reveal the triumphant Papillon, who shouts jubilantly even as he has miles and miles of deep blue ocean still to traverse. This could have felt magnificent, but it is merely satisfying.

We see her current lover is John (David Bowie), a young and attractive cellist. The two comfortably live within their own means, sucking blood from unsuspecting people at the nightclubs they frequently venture and assimilate to New York life quite nicely. Feeding on young souls is what keeps Miriam and John eternally young and attractive, and presumably have an incorruptible youthfulness in terms of appearance and state-of-mind.It isn't until John begins to suffer from chronic insomnia that robs him of his youthful looks and makes him show his age, roughly over two-hundred-years-old, meaning that while he has inherited eternal life, he will never inherit eternal youth. John seeks the help and companionship of Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), a veteran gerontologist (age specialist) who has researched the aging effects in primates for many years. As John tries to decide whether to fight or come to terms with his aging, which has rendered him lethargic and hideous, Sarah tries to find comfort and answers with her sexuality and her own mortality. Her boyfriend Tom (Cliff De Young) notices her spending more time with Miriam, leading him to question her intentions as she becomes dangerously drawn to the lifestyle Miriam lives by.Tony Scott's directorial debut The Hunger is one of the damnedest films I've seen in quite sometime, and certainly one of the more interesting vampire films, and directorial debuts for that matter, I've seen, as well. It's a combination of an exercise in modern Gothic style and the elaboration on vampire life in a way that's serious and believable. The Hunger plays like a devilishly sleek and visual soap opera that never so much as scares, but entrances, as it moves with the grace and elegance of a femme fatale, but hulks and lingers like Nosferatu in terms of the presence it reveals.Simply put, this is an experience more-so than it is a film to find yourself attached to. I found myself rather alienated by the characters in the film, and more concerned with Scott's approach to style and filmmaking craft. The dichotomy of filmmaking brothers Ridley and Tony Scott always fascinates me because where Ridley lacks in craft and detail, Tony always seems to excel, even in his later action pictures like Unstoppable, which have now become grounds for vulgar auteurism. Tony gets the details of The Hunger down to a tee, be them in an aesthetic perspective that allows the bright color of red to pulsate through the screen at various points in the film, or in a narrative perspective, which has Sarandon's Sarah the main subject of serious commentary on sexual awakening, particularly lesbianism and whether or not her story is a parable of coming to terms with one's own sexuality.The Hunger is less a film defined by the strength of its acting, but by the sheer presences and personalities its performers exist as, particularly Catherine Deneuve, who radiates enigma throughout the entire film. A beautiful soul in the film, yet undeniably troubled and weighed down by circumstance, Deneuve's Miriam manages to be one of the film's most fascinating characters, despite most of the crucial events of the film happening to David Bowie's John, largely because of her ominous presence throughout the course of the film.The Hunger's most prominent shortcoming comes in the regard of its editing, which juxtaposes the story of Dr. Roberts with Miriam and John's, causing a rather tumultuous and unpolished editing scheme that has Scott at a quandary in terms of maintaining narrative cohesion. Because of this, Scott can't focus on one particular character or situation and fully develop them, and instead, tries to balance out the playing field by throwing in another story when, in reality, bot need separate developments. It's a classic device many use on their directorial debut to try and prevent monotony and give the audiences a lot to digest, though it backfires here largely because of its strange and carefully plotted story.With that, the aura of The Hunger and the cast itself, are worth the price of admission. This is a vampire film as original and immersive as it is perplexing, and the style of the film mimics that of Gothic\/Victorian-era decor without being too overbearing or reliant on setpieces. Scott and company have, in turn, crafted a vampire film not guaranteed to live forever, but one that will not die quickly thanks to all it lays out on the table.Starring Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie, Susan Sarandon, and Cliff De Young.

You might think that to be too much, but even though it never slows down or backs down, you are in for some good fun and good entertainment.The story is about Joey (played by Robin Williams), a car salesman pressed hard on his luck. Things are stacked up above his head, and everything comes tumbling down when his coworker Donna's disgruntled boyfriend Larry (played by Tim Robbins) show up at the car lot with guns and explosives.While this comedy is not one that will leave you in tears from laughing, the comedy used is straight to the point and it matches the outrageous feel there is to the entire movie.Robin Williams and Tim Robbins are performing quite well in this movie, and they do compliment one another acting side by side. I had seen this movie before, but I didn't remember that Fran Drescher was in the movie too, and she did a good job with her role as well.If you enjoy the Robin Williams movies and comedy then Cadillac Man should be watched. It is fast paced fun and is filled with great characters and good dialogue. Well-worth spending about an hour and a half on watching.

Admittedly not as good a movie, mainly for its breathtaking ignorance of planetary physics. Yes, please tides are not just oceanic but geological; the earth's crust would have been ripped apart by such a close pass of a Mars size body. The other factor was its Cold War bluntness about Human Nature while epistemologically accurate it was not well received by movie viewers. Wheelchair bound Hoyt predicts misanthropically the havoc to come when Bellus approaches. I still recommend it to you for its unique story of leaving the earth for an unknown planet; it is part Noah's Ark mixed in with the rush for completion before our world is destroyed. The lottery held adds a touch of Fate to the outcome though the director bends this a bit for romantic reasons to take the edge off of chance's cruelty. What will surprise young viewers is that the effects are on the level of War Of The Worlds. We have a lesser cast here with the exception of Hoyt and the head scientist whom nobody, in typical fashion, listens to until it is almost too late. As in Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea, he is labeled a crackpot and only the cynical, crippled, business magnate will heed his warning.Even here, he is not convinced but is just reserving himself a spot, just in case. What is interesting about the movie is the cultural contrast between the optimism of human nature shown in 2012 where they open up the Arks for the poor and here where the predicted bedlam ensues just as Hoyt asserted it would to the optimistic, disbelieving scientists. The Cold War was such an antithetical time to our present Zeitgeist. You will never see a starker view of humanity in an old classic science fiction than here. It is evocative of the scene in the War Of The Worlds where the martians heat ray a priest right in the middle of the 23rd Psalm. This is because the aliens or, in this case, the threat is magnified to the Red Scare proportions. This sense of ominous foreboding was what it was like to live under MAD Mutually Assured Destruction. The terror buried in millions' unconsciousness is why you see the left out turn to murderous rioters at the end. The ship barely escapes the people who built it making them as great a danger as the natural one.If you collect old science fictions, I would start with The Day The Earth Stood Still, War Of The Worlds and Forbidden Planet before I bought this. I have it in my collection but it is still a lesser work. It has moments of SDD Science Deficit Disorder that even prompted audiences in the 80's to speak Oh, give me a break, come on! I know, try not to notice. It still is a well made science fiction from the Cold War whose dark misanthropy has always made it second shelf for most people. Still Worth Owning.
