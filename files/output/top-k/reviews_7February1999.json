Karen Croner's screenplay, on the other hand, emphasized the fact that the daughter learns not to take her mother for granted, and I have to say that disappointed me a little.  Not just because it reduced the part that involved me in the novel, but because this is how tear-jerkers are born.However, director Carl Franklin and the actors still make this a great movie.  Part of the reason is we still see the effects of cancer, unlike many other dying movies where the actor's vanity, or maybe the studio's, prevents it.  Streep also isn't afraid to show the psychological effects of cancer, either.  We also see the family dynamic explored very well, so instead of a simplistic Gee mom was right after all feeling, we see how Ellen, the daughter, struggles under the weight of her father while neglecting her mother, and learns that her mother did pass some qualities on to her.Zellweger and Streep are both outstanding, refusing to go for easy pathos, which is another trap of tear-jerker movies.  The overlooked(and most essential) performance of the movie, however, is William Hurt as the father. I can't believe they originally wanted Nick Nolte (a fine actor) for this movie, because Hurt is so perfect as the academic who obviously loves both his wife and daughter but cuts himself off from them because he can't quite express himself there.  The character here is actually more fleshed out than in the book, because we see some of his ambitions thwarted.

After all, who among audiences really gave a damn about Private Ryan? That was the problem with Spielberg's film.We often don't even learn who the Private Ryans in The Thin Red Line are before they die, but it still seems to matter a lot more. The soldiers in The Thin Red Line are to a large extent anonymous, grimy and nameless, but they're human. They're us.The Unknown Soldier is after all a most powerful image, because he or she could be any one of us. But to have this perspective we need to be encouraged to focus beyond the bullets and the blood, the screams of terror and pain and this is what Malick has achieved. And that's in spite of absolutely riveting battle scenes.The Thin Red Line was filmed in The Port Douglas area near Cairns and this area is painted very prettily indeed. This is a small problem for locals in the early section of the film because it's hard to accept that the movie is set in Guadalcanal instead of North Queensland. Guadalcanal was the site of a vicious battle between the Japanese and the Americans which occurred a year after Pearl Harbour.Malick muses beyond the conflict though, often deadening the sounds, swinging the camera away from the terror in a man's eyes onto the beauty of nature; a passing beautiful butterfly. Or he'll have a soldier in the midst of carnage, nose in the dirt, hiding from death, concentrating on the way dew or blood drips down grass stalks. And that's what must have happened. And that seems much more important than the bullets ricocheting by, as long as the bullets miss.We can easily see the point. This is Malick's preoccupation. Why kill? Why fight? Why why, when our Earth (and our North Queensland) is so beautiful. Basic stuff, but we humans so often miss the point don't we.The film has a big name cast although some like John Travolta and George Clooney are only on screen for a few moments. Travolta is important though playing a hateful Captain, pulling rank on an older, smarting Lt Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) setting up Nolte's character beautifully. Tall's a career soldier who is willing to sacrifice men for his own advancement and glory within the army.But there's little else in The Thin Red Line in the way of rounded characters. The soldiers are only trying to survive, and win (stop) the battle. Soldiers in the film begin to assert their individuality and then often Malick drops them. Sometimes he has them killed.There are relationships that mean little in the context of the movie and they should have been cut. Sean Penn although interesting could have been left out altogether. The film needs to be half an hour shorter, and that's its only fault.But still The Thin Red Line is a terrific film. Malick is a thoughtful director. He adds voice overs and asides about how stupid the battle process is even though it's doubtful that any of these soldiers would have had the time or the inclination to muse on the human condition. It's an unusual tactic by a director but effective.He often shifts the view away  from the obvious and that gets us thinking. War sometimes must be like that. Extreme fear will cause the brain to disengage; to self protect; to shut down sensory input. The Thin Red Line emphases this and also the opposite.

SPR would be different, so I expected. In this movie Spielberg really would show his audience that war is horrific, not heroic.The first half hour of the movie really was shattering. People who still believe war is an exciting event for young would-be heroes (think Tom Cruise in Top Gun) should be obligated to watch the Omaha Beach landing-scenes. Because it really makes you experience that war is hell, a sickening, horrible hell.Of course you can't fill a three hour movie solely with scenes like that of the Omaha Beach landing. To make a good movie, you need more, like good actors, a capable crew, convincing special effects and, the most important, an interesting story. Well, no one will dispute the fact that SPR technically is a masterpiece. The camerawork, the special effects, the sound, they are all overwhelmingly good.In spite of all these plusses, I really was disappointed by at least two hours of SPR. Because it missed the most important thing a movie needs an interesting story! The characters weren't convincing. I don't blame the actors for that, they all did a good job. It was the script that I blame, I never forgot I was watching a movie with made-up characters. When a movie is really good, I tend to get so absorbed by the characters that they become real to me, that I start to symphatize deeply with them. This never happened while I was watching SPR. I never felt anything more for Captain Miller and his men then I felt for all the other, anonymous soldiers you see in this movie. And the story, the search for Private Ryan, even bored me sometimes. There were just a few scenes, like the one in which the men were reading the name-tags of the fallen soldiers, that were really compelling.Three things about SPR I really disliked. First there is the way the German soldier known as Steamboat Willie was portrayed. Why is the only German we got to know a little bit such an awkward, silly guy? I'm pretty sure lots of German soldiers were ordinary men who didn't want this war any more then anyone else did. They must have been just as afraid as the American soldiers, they must have felt the same pain and horror. But that's not the way if feels like in SPR. The overall feeling you get is Americans are good and Germans are bad. Second, there is the fight for the bridge. This kind of stuff, the brave heroes who, against all odds, succeed in defeating the enemy, well, this has been done so many times before. This kind of cliche was exactly what I expected SPR to avoid. Third, there is the 'point of view'. You are made to believe that the Omaha Beach-scenes are seen as the memories of the old man on the graveyard. Then, in the last scene, you learn that this man never set foot on Omaha Beach. I felt manipulated in a negative way!It was very hard for me to grade SPR. Technically, it's an absolute 10. The Omaha Beach-scene was extremely good, and I think it's a real homage to the veterans who were there. But there were too many things I did not like. I decided to give this movie a 7 out of 10.

When I heard Jim Carrey was starring in another film, I was a little disappointed-I'd always found him to be a little obnoxious. But as I watched the trailers, I began to think that Carrey has been holding out on us. Perhaps he was just preparing himself for this role. Here it is. Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank is my nomination for one of the finest (if the the finest) of all movie characterizations. Believe me. I know of ALL the movies. I know of Jimmy Stewart in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, of Cary Grant in BRINGING UP BABY, and of the other great performances. My knowledge of films is not just of the past 20 years, so believe me when I say Carrey has, with this one film, earned himself a place in the history books.He works on several levels.First of all there is the comedy. He makes us laugh. And at funny things-not just a lot of crude silliness! This is talent unseen since the days of the great comics. Carrey could, if he continued making intelligent comedies like this one, be ranked alongside Chaplin and Buster Keaton in his use of pathos. Most comics, no, ALL comics of the last thirty-some years have been afraid to use pathos in their routines. Pathos is basically mixing something sentimental with something funny, making it touchingly funny. This is real skill. Jim Carrey has that talent, and will hopefully realize that he is capable of acting not obtained since Charlie Chaplin! This is an honor. Hopefully, he will select other intelligent projects like this one. He has the talent to become the greatest actor, not just funnyman, in the cinema of the future! Everyone I know shares this opinion. I saw the film on its theatrical run twice, and yet, I don't want to run to the video store to get the latest copy of it and lounge in front of the TV with it on. Why? Because THE TRUMAN SHOW is so brilliant and SO intelligent, that it must be viewed with intelligence itself. Somehow, you are much more inclined to sit up and pay attention, and think, in a cinema, than you would be popping the video in the VCR and lounging back with a bowl of chips. The film has a wonderful musical score. Although it has now been some 8 months sine I saw the film, the incidental music themes still pop in to my head every so often. And again, although it has been 4 months short of a year since I saw the film, it seems like it was just last week. That is how timeless and meaningful it really is. You just don't forget this one. It is incredible and unbelievable. I was intrigued from the first time I saw the trailer on television. The film has stayed with me like no other. A local cinema that runs nothing but the best films, old and new, ran a print of this film for a week. It is such a magnificent experience to see THE TRUMAN SHOW that both times I saw it, I left the theatre truly feeling glad to be able to see the film. I hope that it earns its proper place in the cinema history books, and that is as the greatest film in the latter half of the 20th Century!

She's got an accent that won't quit, but as the film goes on that accent begins to fascinate the viewer; she's a really good actress, which surprised me. Even when she turns herself into a seagull. It's the outlandish creatures, scenes, and settings that a Harryhausen movie always has that are its great charms, and this film is one of the most inventive of his career. Don't expect rocket science when you watch this, just expect to be royally entertained.
