The topic turns to sex and he asks her Do you think that you would sleep with a man if he offered you a million pounds? After some consideration she replies Yes, I think I would. So would you sleep with me for a fiver?Certainly not. What sort of girl do you think I am?We've already established that. All we're doing now is haggling over the price. Indecent Proposal is a film loosely based upon that old joke. David and Diana Murphy are a married couple, the sort of people who at the time would have been described as yuppies. He is an architect, she a real estate broker, and both are living the Californian yuppie dream until the early nineties recession hits them hard. Hoping to recoup their finances they travel to Las Vegas, only to lose all of their savings. And here comes that joke. They meet a billionaire named John Gage who is attracted to the lovely Diana (hardly surprising, given that she is played by Demi Moore) and offers David one million dollars to spend a night with her. After much consideration, and after hiring their lawyer to draw up a contract, David and Diana decide to accept the offer, and Gage flies Diana to a private yacht where the dirty deed is consummated. Gage is as good as his word, and the money is duly paid into David's bank account, but the couple gradually realise that the arrangement has placed an intolerable strain on their relationship. This was one of a number of erotic dramas which came out in the late eighties and early nineties. (Fatal Attraction, also directed by Adrian Lyne, and Basic Instinct are others of the same kind). I call them erotic not in the sense that they are pornographic- Indecent Proposal only contains one, not very explicit, love scene- but in the sense that they deal frankly with sexual topics. In some respects the film can also be seen as a variation on the standard romantic comedy theme. Most romantic comedies tell the story of how a couple fall in love and of they overcome any obstacles to that love. Indecent Proposal tells the story of a couple who start off in love, of how they fall out of love, and of how their love is rekindled. The film was a box office success, but received mostly negative reviews from critics, and even won the Worst Picture Razzie award for 1993. This surprised me Indecent Proposal is far from being a great film, but I cannot for the life of me see how it could be regarded as worse than Madonna's execrable semi-pornographic vanity project Body of Evidence. (Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how any film not directed by Ed Wood could have been worse than Body of Evidence). Of the film's three main stars, Moore is probably the best; although she is not as good as she had been in some of her other films from the early nineties such as Ghost and A Few Good Men she still succeeds in making Diana an attractive heroine. (There is also an amusing cameo from Oliver Platt as the Murphy's grasping lawyer). Woody Harrelson, however, is too stiff and awkward as David, not giving much expression to the emotional turmoil which a character in his position would have faced. My only objection to Harrelson's Worst Supporting Actor Razzie was that, as the film's principal male character, his was a leading role and he should have been nominated for Worst Actor instead. if Harrelson had been nominated for Worst Actor, he would have had to compete for this dubious honour with his co-star Robert Redford. (In the event, Redford lost out to Burt Reynolds). Still displaying, in a slightly ravaged form, the good looks which had made him a matin√©e idol in the earlier part of his career, Redford's casting in the role of Gage drew numerous comments from women of a certain age along the lines of I would sleep with him for free, never mind a million dollars. Unfortunately, this is one of his films in which Redford seems content to coast along on looks and smooth charm alone without putting much effort into his role. We never really find out what motivates Gage- love for Diana, lust for her or simply the desire to test, as an intellectual proposition, his theory that, the Beatles and popular opinion notwithstanding, money can indeed buy me love- although this may be as much the fault of the scriptwriter as of Redford. Although Indecent Proposal was intended as a serious treatment of its theme rather than a humorous one, the plot bears a certain resemblance to that of a comedy from the previous year, Honeymoon in Vegas in which an unsuccessful Las Vegas gambler loses his girl to a wealthy high roller and then has to win her back. This is, in fact, the sort of story which would have worked better as a comedy, its central idea being too improbable to be credible in the context of a serious drama. In real life billionaires, however eccentric, do not generally offer happily married women, however attractive, a million dollars for sex. It is not, in my view, an outstandingly bad film; Lyne is a reasonably competent director and tells his story efficiently enough. It is just not a very good one. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2012","score":"","review":" A man goes into a bar and gets into a conversation with a woman.

Creature from the Black Lagoon is one of the best-known examples from the fifties. It was filmed in 3-D, one of a number of such films produced during the brief 3-D craze of 1952-54. The plot is a simple one. A group of scientists are taking part in a fossil-hunting expedition to the Amazon jungle. While there they are menaced by an amphibian humanoid creature. Several members of the expedition are killed by the creature and the only female member, Kay Lawrence, is abducted. (Many critter movies, most famously King Kong, were based on the assumption that monstrous creatures are romantically or sexually attracted to human females, especially young and beautiful ones). Of course, Kay's fianc√© David has to be on hand to save the day. This film has become something of a cult movie, although it is admittedly no classic. Its main fault is that it takes itself too seriously. To modern audiences, looking back at the fifties though spectacles tinted by twenty-first century postmodern irony, its over- the-top style can look very much like a deliberately camp and cheesy affectation for the sake of comedy, but I suspect that in 1954 we were all supposed to take this sort of thing at face value. Although the film is not otherwise religious in tone, it opens with the Biblical line In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and to film- makers from the fifties taking the name of the Deity in vain for the sake of cheap laughs would have seemed uncomfortably close to blasphemy. The opening section of the film is a brief (and none too accurate) lecture on the geological history of the Earth and the evolution of life. (The scriptwriters could have done with a bit more information on these subjects, otherwise they might have avoided the embarrassing goof of having a supposedly expert palaeontologist suggest of a fossil from a Devonian rock formation that it might be a Pleistocene man. Only some 350 million years out, but what's 350 million years between friends?). The film's musical score is exaggeratedly dramatic and portentous, as is most of the acting, with the most banal lines being spoken in a tone of voice more appropriate for a recitation of a Shakespearean soliloquy or the Gettysburg Address. The monster is reasonably convincing during the underwater scenes, but on land he is all too obviously a man in a rubber suit. And yet the film has some good points which raise it above the level of most critter movies of this period. Despite the over-dramatic style of acting, the characterisation goes deeper than in most films of this type. Admittedly, the lovely Julie Adams as Kay has little to do beyond what is normally expected of the heroine of a critter movie, namely to stand around looking sexy in a swimsuit or pair of minuscule shorts, to scream loudly whenever the script requires her to and to be rescued at the end by her handsome, hunky boyfriend. Some of the characters, however, are more developed, such as Lucas, the crusty old captain of the steamer on which the expedition is travelling, and the expedition's leader, Dr. Mark Williams. Williams is in some way an unsympathetic character, willing to put his colleagues' lives at risk in his quest for scientific glory, but he does finally redeem himself. Even the monster is made more sympathetic than the average critter, with a suggestion that the humans are as much to blame for the fatal confrontation as it is, and that it only kills in self-defence.Many critter films have become famous simply for being bad. There are too many to list them all, but any film buff will have his or her favourite so bad it's funny example; mine is the British-made The Blood Beast Terror from the sixties, a prime candidate for any list of the worst films ever made.

There's never that nod to the audience, but instead the film trusts that the audience is smart enough to get it and thus everything becomes hilarious instead of tired and trying.Peter Sellers is a work of art here, practically deserves a medal for his seamless ability to portray three different characters (in three different accents no less) with full believability.

Granted some of them are bad, but for every bad one we get a good one. Look at The Shawshank Redemption or The Shining, both brilliant. Misery will have a bad Stephen King adaptation out there because it is one of the good ones, and probably one of the most frightening.Misery is about an author named Paul Sheldon (Caan). He is famous for his books about the lead heroine Misery Chastain. The only thing is he is bored of her and wants to write more darker and deeper stories. The Misery novel just about to be released, will be his last. He has made sure of this by killing her off at the end of the book. Determined to upgrade his writing credentials, he works on and finishes a new novel up in a secluded cabin where he writes all his novels. On his way to taking the finished novel to his agent he crashes during a freak blizzard. As he lays dying he is rescued by a random woman who happens to find him in the middle of nowhere. When Paul wakes a few days later he finds himself in a strange house with his arm in a sling and his legs boarded together. He then meets his rescuer, Annie Wilkes (Bates), 'his number one fan'. Annie is a former nurse and begins to nurse him back to health, even giving him criticism on his new book which hasn't been read by anyone but her. She deems his new book as garbage and tells him to stick to his Misery novels. The following day the new Misery novel is released and Annie heads out to buy and read, although when she finishes it and realises her favourite heroine is dead she loses control, blaming Paul for her murder. With Paul unable to walk, he finds himself forced to write the next novel, bringing Misery back to life with the threat of his life if he doesn't. Paul must find a way of getting himself out of this house before Annie's temper becomes worse and worse. The premise is very simple but it works so well. It does start off quite slow, with Annie's mental state slowly being revealed. It is really the last half an hour where the film really grips you and becomes horrifying. One scene towards the end had me clutching my fists together in pain and one had me yelping out loud. It brings a strange horror to the screen as there are no aliens or monsters, just this woman obsessed. Any of us could be this woman's victim and it is scary.The acting in the film is brilliant. Caan spends most of his time bed ridden or in a wheel chair but still manages to show pain and fear through his eyes. You will be clutching your legs throughout this film, he is someone you highly sympathise with. Strangely you do with Annie Wilkes, at the start that is. Kathy Bates manages to bring a calmness to the character at the beginning and you genuinely feel she is there to help. Slowly though she begins to turn and Bates manages to show Annie's psychotic behaviour spot on and all sympathy is quickly removed from her. At first she is a disillusioned fan but becomes a psychotic monster. She really is two characters in one, and when she is angry she really is scary. She may seem like someone we all believe we can beat in strength but she is more clever than us and has already beat us to that thought. You will see what I mean at the one scene that had me squirming. I really can't get that part out my mind. There isn't many negatives in the film. Perhaps the first hour is a little slow, but it is all worth it when the final half kicks in. The beginning shows you her layers slowly unravel and the crazier she begins to become. Bates plays the character with such believability.It is a very good film and will have you on edge throughout. The tension is filmed brilliantly.

Watching ANNIE HALL again was marvelous; it was only my second time with it, and the first one was years ago, when I was a kid. I didn't fully appreciate it and I even thought of it as probably Allen's most over-rated film. Last Saturday night was pretty much incredible there's a new drive-in theater in my city (first one in many years) and I went for the very first time, with my girlfriend to see ANNIE HALL on the big screen (for the very first time). It blew my mind. It has everything. It is Allen's masterpiece, by far. And I have to thank my girlfriend since without her almost new love for Allen I would have not been re-watching this or watching for the very first time minor works like ANOTHER WOMAN. Anyway, like with any other real classic I ask myself what else can I write about it? Maybe I will just share how I was blown anyway with some moments. I recalled some classic stuff, like Allen (as character Alvy) suffering in the line for THE SORROW AND THE PITY thanks to an annoying and supposedly clever guy! I mean, when you are in a similar situation, that IS the scene you always recall! But I had forgotten other elements, and I was completely marveled by it (and I had forgotten also some jokes &#x96; everybody always recall the opening of the film or some lines, but no one goes for the thing with the African American maid! I laughed my head off!); for instance, I recently watched WHATEVER WORKS (Allen's 2008 picture) and pointed out how things like having the main character talking to the audience and stuff felt pretty much like a pointless element. Here, on the contrary, everything that is in that same vein feels -in a word- brilliant. And yes, ANNIE HALL features a quite beautiful take on relationships; obviously at this point in my life, I thought of it in a much different way than years ago. There are some really touching moments, and certainly there's nothing better than this when it comes to thinking in Allen and Diane Keaton together. But the greatest thing about this film is how it feels just like an example of Allen's genius. Certainly what's in his mind is always present, like his not very kind opinion of Hollywood (I didn't remember, by the way, that Paul Simon, from Simon & Garfunkel, is here&#x85; pretty damn cool!), but sometimes we even have a visual representation of it. He is doing whatever he wanted to; he is bringing Marshall McLuhan to the screen and he is not caring too much about Bob Dylan!

The music,I have to say, destroyed the little impact that could've come from the actors by overplaying in important scenes. The sets, so complex in construction, almost upstaged the actors themselves. In short, such radical arrangements were unnecessary.The story, in spite of it's run length, was not enough to be contained in one part. Much of the time went into unnecessary scenes that could've been edited out, especially when Caesar and Antony's lives had many important events. The performances were campy and dreadful, coming from actors of such high caliber. Harrison as Caesar resorted to cheap tricks with an affected speech plentiful of intonations; it is shocking that this same man was the best thing about My Fair Lady. Even Meryl Streep would've played Caesar with more authority and conviction that he did. Elizabeth Taylor gave a repulsive Cleopatra, radiating none of the passion and wisdom that her charter required. She committed the crime of killing passion. She was neither convincing as Caesar's nor Antony's lover, apart from butchering her character. She spoils the otherwise well shot scene of Caesar's murder with her overacting. Richard Burton was minced meat compared to Russell Crowe's valiant Maximus while Martin Landau was equally theatrical, swinging his arms in an unnatural manner. Richard O'Sullivan was embarrassing as Ptolemy; only god knows what happened to his character. I was neither impressed with Roddy McDowell. In fact, most of the cast had that theater hangover, forgetting that they have to act suitably for the cameras. Only Gwen Walford created an impression in her tiny role as Calpunria¬†I really hoped that Cleopatra was as impressive as the DVD cover with Taylor and Burton on it. All I got was messy schlock.¬†My Rating 3 out of 10 ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"15 February 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I recently rewatched this film.

In this film he portrays Peter Parker very well but in the sequels the character becomes him. Out of the trilogy this one is my favourite. Number 2 was good but was too corny for my liking.I am in support of the reboot but this is a film I will always love deep down inside.

This is an excellent movie which expects something of its viewers and gives much to those willing and able to meet the challenge.This film explores what it means to be a person in a post-cyberpunk near future where people and technology have begun to meld. For the most part, this is done with esoteric, fast-paced dialogue between the main character (the Major) and her companion (Batou). It may feel to some as though these conversations were inserted not for the betterment of the work, but rather the reception thereof. At times characters give somewhat long philosophical and\/or expository speeches; one should keep in mind the difficulties of explaining a universe and expressing thoughts so complex as those in this film -- contrived monologues are often necessary.There are brief sequences containing nudity and\/or violence. These are spaced out and well-done, with no scene featuring either being at all gratuitous and an in-universe explanation of why what nudity there is is present.There is much artistry in the film's presentation. Even the beginning credits are beautiful just as they serve a purpose. Not only was the visual style thoroughly enjoyable, but so too was there the mark of a great craftsman on Ghost in the Shell's audio; during the climax there is beautiful audio-visual dissonance which uses the uncanny valley to great effect. The score lends itself to the piece's mood etc and could stand apart from GITS and still be regarded as good. One would be hard-pressed to find unnecessary material in this film, though this may contribute to a vague feeling of the story being rushed and, perhaps, unfinished.The main characters are somewhat angst-ridden, a fact evident in their questioning of their own humanity along with their other musings. This is likely because the director attempted to establish a very particular mood, using dialogue to that end. Some viewers will become lost in the rapidly shifting world set twenty minutes into the future in which the story takes place; references are often made to concepts from advanced sociology and philosophy. Nietzche was not unknown to the writers, this much is clear.Western audiences may be bothered by the ending of this film. In American cinema it is considered bad form to leave any loose ends or major questions at a piece's close. This is a Japanese film and their different opinion on the matter is evident. Some criticize Ghost in the Shell for its ending not expressly answering the existential questions posed throughout the film. However, this movie was not meant to answer, but rather ask. The ending of GITS leaves an emptiness meant to be filled by the viewer's ruminations on what was said and, more importantly, what wasn't.One should watch the subbed version rather than the dubbed one.

There are a few exceptions; Moonraker is not one of them. James Bond (Roger Moore) is on the last leg of a mission, introduced with the first of many genuinely funny puns in this movie. Naturally, the unnamed villains plan to eradicate Bond, leading to an action scene in free fall with one parachute too few. It is nonsensical, but genuinely entertaining, thanks partly to composer John Barry's music. This scene is not fitting in a James Bond movie, yet, like the rest of the movie, it is great fun to watch.Goofiness has decimated more than a fair share of Bond movies. Moonraker does not fall victim itself because the filmmakers did not try to mix silly with serious, and never made a mockery of their characters. That is the reason I was pleasantly surprised on my first viewing. I responded negatively after my second because I started to analyze it. I should not have been so serious. The enjoyment I felt the first time gave me all the information I need. Just because I did not understand why I enjoyed it the first time does not mean I have to hate it.Moonraker is one of the two least popular Bond movies among the series' hardcore fans. It also made the most money until GoldenEye, and drew the most viewers and repeat viewers of all the Bond movies between Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. No matter how different the movie's tone is from the James Bond standard, it has enough positives to stand on its own. That is why both critics and audiences in 1979 voiced approval with their money and keyboards.Its production set at least three world records that are still unbroken most break-away glass in one fight, largest sound stage ever used in France, and the greatest number of actors in simulated weighlessness. Ken Adam became a legendary production designer with his work on the James Bond movies. Moonarker is his final, and he saved his best for last. The fact that the two-time Oscar winner was not even nominated for his work in Moonraker is a sad example of how political the Academy is. Like the movie or not, the Venice, Amazon, and space station sets are more than likely to impress even the most skeptical Bond fan.After reporting to his boss's secretary (Lois Maxwell) that he fell out of a plane without a parachute, Bond is tasked with investigating the loss of an American space shuttle that disappeared en route to England. He first visits Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), the shuttle's owner. When informed that the shuttle itself was not destroyed, Drax offers full co- operation, then orders Bond's elimination as soon as the latter leaves the room. I have either discussed or viewed this movie with a number of people. Even though this twist occurs less than 20 minutes in, the movie conceals Drax's villainy so well that none of these people suspected him.Drax's plot takes implausibility to its highest level. I will give no details except to say that it makes Karl Stromberg's grand scheme from the previous movie look sophisticated and sane. As advertised, the story boldly takes 007 where no British spy has gone before. Drax's space station remains the coolest set in the series. The simulated weightlessness remains impressive to watch more than 30 years later.In tune with the movie's comical nature, Drax is often unwilling to harm Bond unless he can amuse himself with the creativity of it. Drax has more off-beat lines than the next two or thee Bond villains combined. I am not sure there is anybody who would seriously say, you appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season or greet a stranger with, you have arrived at a propitious moment, but Drax has at least a dozen such lines. Lonsdale adds surreal humor to his role by speaking them with an almost bored somberness. A majority of actors work a whole career without having to say anything so weird. If Lonsdale realized that back in 1979, he certainly was not going to let anybody know.In the meantime, Jaws (Richard Kiel) from the previous movie is back. Jaws' outrageous physical power and invulnerability made him a liability in the previous movie. Moonraker stretches it and uses it as a reliable comic device. In one scene, he stops a gondola wheel with his bare hands. The wheel starts to move again, but one look from Jaws makes it think twice about being rebellious.The gadgets feature not one, but two special made boats. The first can convert to a hovercraft. Of course, Bond takes advantage of it, just in time for Victor Tourjansky to make another appearance as The Man with the Bottle in arguably the best running joke in the series. Q (Desmond Llewelyn) tops off his contribution by ending the movie with one of the cleverest double entendres in history.Does all of this lavish praise equal a recommendation? Perhaps it does. My girlfriend condemned For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore's most serious Bond movie, as too cheesy. Moonraker joined Tomorrow Never Dies and From Russia with Love as her favorites. That told a lot to me about how the casual Bond fan views Moonraker. It does not deserve elite status because it does not deliver the excitement a Bond movie should, neither is it an example of great movie-making even with numerous strengths. That noted, it sells out completely to its premise and is not reluctant to take the extra effort to entertain. I disagree with the filmmakers' comedic approach, but they did aim to entertain. In that area, they succeeded. For that, I give Moonraker seven out of ten stars.

Even though this twist occurs less than 20 minutes in, the movie conceals Drax's villainy so well that none of these people suspected him.Drax's plot takes implausibility to its highest level. I will give no details except to say that it makes Karl Stromberg's grand scheme from the previous movie look sophisticated and sane. As advertised, the story boldly takes 007 where no British spy has gone before. Drax's space station remains the coolest set in the series. The simulated weightlessness remains impressive to watch more than 30 years later.In tune with the movie's comical nature, Drax is often unwilling to harm Bond unless he can amuse himself with the creativity of it. Drax has more off-beat lines than the next two or thee Bond villains combined. I am not sure there is anybody who would seriously say, you appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season or greet a stranger with, you have arrived at a propitious moment, but Drax has at least a dozen such lines. Lonsdale adds surreal humor to his role by speaking them with an almost bored somberness. A majority of actors work a whole career without having to say anything so weird. If Lonsdale realized that back in 1979, he certainly was not going to let anybody know.In the meantime, Jaws (Richard Kiel) from the previous movie is back. Jaws' outrageous physical power and invulnerability made him a liability in the previous movie. Moonraker stretches it and uses it as a reliable comic device. In one scene, he stops a gondola wheel with his bare hands. The wheel starts to move again, but one look from Jaws makes it think twice about being rebellious.The gadgets feature not one, but two special made boats. The first can convert to a hovercraft. Of course, Bond takes advantage of it, just in time for Victor Tourjansky to make another appearance as The Man with the Bottle in arguably the best running joke in the series. Q (Desmond Llewelyn) tops off his contribution by ending the movie with one of the cleverest double entendres in history.Does all of this lavish praise equal a recommendation? Perhaps it does. My girlfriend condemned For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore's most serious Bond movie, as too cheesy. Moonraker joined Tomorrow Never Dies and From Russia with Love as her favorites. That told a lot to me about how the casual Bond fan views Moonraker. It does not deserve elite status because it does not deliver the excitement a Bond movie should, neither is it an example of great movie-making even with numerous strengths. That noted, it sells out completely to its premise and is not reluctant to take the extra effort to entertain. I disagree with the filmmakers' comedic approach, but they did aim to entertain. In that area, they succeeded. For that, I give Moonraker seven out of ten stars.

So I would say it was more a movie less a documentary. I wouldn't say great but all the actors have done justice to their parts. It was really nice to see acting skills of a great film maker Richard Attenborough as the Master Mind of the plan. Steve McQueen as a notorious American prisoner who made several escape attempts did a good job. Charles Bronson was as usual calm and composed I doubted whether he would panic during the escape but yes did justice to his role as THE TUNNEL KING.

It is by rage, and by rage alone, that drives the great fighter. Look at his ring rejoinder after his second wife Vickie states that a particular fighter (Tony Janiro) is good-looking. Wham! There was another, external quandary the rackets. They controlled who fought whom. And boxing decisions are often problematic. In Raging Bull's first fight scene, we see the undefeated Jake LaMotta crushing Jimmy Reeves in the ring but not getting the decision, apparently because of a fix (1941). In a subsequent fight he would knock out Reeves (1943). Nevertheless Jake LaMotta had to relax his own ring moral standards (!) and play ball with the mob as urged by his brother. Only after he throws a fight to Billy Fox in 1947 (TKO in the 4th) and paid some cash, was he given a shot at the Middleweight title. He made the most of it when he defeated Marcel Cerdan (1949). But then again, a new problem arose Would he have the hunger to maintain the belt? By the way, LaMotta's career did not end with his last loss to Sugar Ray Robinson (1951), as he had ten more fights. When he did retire in 1954, he had lost his title, wives, and money, although he had his jokes (and there would be more wives).

To LaMotta, women always seem to be either nuns or whores, and there was little middle ground for an equal marriage partner. Thus there is domestic violence. Then we see LaMotta morph from a tough lean and mean boxer to an overweight joker, still missing a few principles (DeNiro actually gained 60 pounds for the role). What is amazing is that LaMotta is alive and well in his 90th year as of this writing. Maybe he has finally outlived his old demons. One tough dude indeed!

Compared to others, the smoothness of the camera movement when filming longer shots seamed to be right on key. It also seamed to have a lot more movement with the camera rather than having it sit still with one background.

James Stewart for once, doesn't play an exaggeratedly strong or flawed character, he's at his best as the middle-aged man who wants to spend a nice time with his family, and becomes more and more anxious and dangerous when the lives of his beloved ones are at stakes. Still, as a doctor, he's rational and wise enough to know how to keep his cool in critical situations but he also finds himself victim of his temper like in the famous wild-goose chase scene, when he meets the wrong Ambrose Chappel, a man whose name was meant to be a place. .While Stewart is great as usual, I concede it wasn't the most difficult role he had to portray, somewhat all the merit belongs to Doris Day as the loving mother and the caring and daring wife. Doris Day, as Jo, a singer, perfectly embodies the dutiful qualities of 50's wives with a sense of dignity that prevents the role to fall into an involuntary sexist trap. Interestingly, she's the most distrustful one during the first trip in Marrakech as she finds quite inconvenient that they always meet the same French person (Daniel Gelin), and gets more and more certain that they're followed, something that Ben doesn't buy. Despite the typically Hitchcockian paranoid undertones, the couple provides a nice feeling of harmony that puts more in an emotional mindset while following it.This is because the film is less about the classic conspiracy story than about feelings, and this very aspect relies on the character of Hank, played in a remarkable child performance by. The highlight of this emotion is reached in an unforgettable scene where Doris Day outshines James Stewart when he tells her about the kidnapping, she has the perfect reaction as a mother who misses her son, and the tone is not melodramatic or over the top. It's one of these rare occasions where Family plays a significant role in a Hitchcock plot, after Shadow of Doubt and the solidarity and complicity between Stewart and Day, contributes to what is probably the best partnership in a Hitchcock film. Which leads me to the second pillar to the film the music, what precisely embodied this very complicity through one my all-time favorite movie songs Que Sera Sera, What Will be Will be, that Jo used to sing with Hank as a sort of code of mutual love, Hank would hum or whistle the song back.This is one of the rare movies that knew how to use music so powerfully it became like a character. Its omnipresence probably caused the score to sink into oblivion, although the talented Bernard Herrmann, who makes a fitting cameo as the opera conductor, composed it. I guess too much music would have killed the effect, and Hitchcock who built suspense with the precision of a crafted watchmaker and the delicacy of a pastry cook, left the best part for one hell of a climax, when a simple cymbal crash would allow a killer to shoot the British Prime Minister. Inspired from a comic-strip story and presented in the opening credits, the using of the cymbal crash is the little extra-spice without which, the movie wouldn't have been as remembered.Like the killer, we had the chance to hear twice the part during which the cymbals crash, enough to remember it, but not enough to be sure when it will come. This way, Hitchcock transforms a whole musical sequence in an extraordinary suspenseful sequence where we simply wait for something to happen while we don't know when it will happen, we only wait for the hints, which is a long silence, and we expect the protagonists to know it too, which doubles the thrilling effect of the build-up. This scene works so much because we enjoy both the mesmerizing beauty of the music and the heart-pounding intensity of the story waiting for the climactic moment when they will combine, in a sort of cathartic attempt to let us finally breath, when Doris Day screams and the killer misses his shot.Hitchcock did the perfect dosage between thrills, music and emotions and while it would have been great enough with the opera sequence, it brought another classic moment in the Embassy when Jo, sings the song Que Sera Sera a Capella so loudly she expects to hear her son reply, which he does, through a whistling that would ultimately save his life. A few movie songs play such a powerful role, some are just fillers, some convey a message, and some simply define the film and beyond the clever use of this song for the plot, if only for having permitted to write such a beautiful melody and simple yet touching lyrics, The Man Who Knew Too Much deserves its popularity. The movie is not without its flaws and I suspect some microscopic plot holes at some places, I could tell that the people were not speaking the local dialect, maybe the killer was too hideous in an almost caricatured way, but all these considerations hardly matter. Why? Because even though While The Man Who Knew Too Much might not be the best of Hitchcock, which is not saying much anyway, it's certainly the most emotional and the Master's greatest tribute to the irreplaceable power of music.
