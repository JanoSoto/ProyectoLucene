[{"date":"17 October 2012","score":"","review":" I prefer to call a movie intelligent, if it keeps us glued till its end, as well as if it keeps us thinking after. With a running time of just over 75 minutes, Run Lola Run accomplishes exactly that! I will not go into the plot here, rather try to point out what I interpreted from the movie.You meet people in your life, whose life you have no influence on. You rarely matter in their life, and what happens to them is not at all related to your interaction with them. This is portrayed by at least 2 characters Lola meets in the movie, the lady with the baby, and the cyclist. In each of the 3 run's, the story of the lady (shown as snapshots), and the story of the cyclist is different, and bears no relation to her interaction with them. No matter what our interaction with the person, their life is not influenced by us! You meet people in your life, whom you certainly have a lot of influence on. The watchman in the bank is set as a classic example. In the 1st run, he teases Lola initially, and later on he is shown as a person with a good heart, when he says everyone has a bad day. In the 3rd run, after Lola's stare, he suffers a cardiac arrest, and while in the ambulance, when the doctors try to restore his heartbeat, she gets in, and she could help it make normal. Lola's father is set as another example, as in each of the run, his interaction with her is different, and is influenced by what she does to him.Now, to the two main themes covered, first one, the importance of chaos and random events in daily life. One such example is what happens to Meier in the 3 runs. In the 1st run, because he turns and looks Lola, he is a bit slow, and his car is being hit by another car. In the 2nd run, he does not look at Lola, and the other car comes and hit his car. In the 3rd run, he sees the running person is Lola, and he asks her if anything is wrong. Because of that delay, no accident takes place at that point, however, later in the movie; there is another accident which turns out to be fatal for Meier. Another character who is shown affected by random event is the man who takes the bag from the train. In the 1st 2 runs, he takes the bag and goes away. In the 3rd run, he buys the cycle, but Manni meets him in his bicycle, confronts him and takes the bag back. There are many more events in the movie attributed to chaos, like Lola spotting the casino, Manni seeing the homeless man on cycle etc etc.Now, to what I think was the main message behind the movie. The movie deals about how we can control the chaos or randomness that happens in our life. It illustrates that if we have enough motivating factors (here, it is love), we can, at least up to an extent, control what is going to happen. There are scenes in the movie where Lola asks Manni if he really loves her, and Manni asks what she will do if he is dead. They both want to be with each other, and when they realize that, they change their approaches, and decide to change what happens to them. The 3rd run, which ends on a happy note, is after both of them are shown realizing that they love each other, and after they decide to control what happens to them.On a lighter note, you can even think that the movie talks about relations, when Lola is ready to do anything to save her boyfriend; her parents are involved in extramarital relations. Ideally, it is a movie, left to the viewer's interpretation like any other. Watch it and see it for yourself.

For most of the viewers, it is an unsolved crime told in an interesting yet different fashion, and he\/she can try to arrange the puzzles to form a solution. For movie freaks, it is much more than that; in addition to being a fine work of art, it conveys beautifully a simple message through a complex movie.One can easily gather from the movie, that the main idea conveyed was that there is no absolute truth. We see 4 different people narrating a story, in completely different ways. While each of them tells their version of the story, the idea expressed is simply how much one's perspective can distort reality. Or in the deeper sense, that there is no absolute reality. Reality is relative. We could relate it to the story of the blind men and an elephant, where 6 different blind men touch different parts of an elephant and each of them assume, interpret and argue that elephant looks like the part they touched.Now, probably to what was mainly conveyed through the movie - the rationale behind the different stories. None of them were lying to protect themselves, as one can notice from the bandit's and the lady's story, they say they might have killed the samurai. Obviously, protection from law is not what mattered. In the bandit's story, he glorified himself; he portrayed himself as a brave and a great warrior, who easily lures the lady. In the lady's story, she portrayed herself as a helpless victim, trying to stand in dignity. In the samurai's version, he was portrayed as being noble, brave, and the best thing he could do was committing suicide. In the woodcutter's version, he is portraying each of the 3 characters equally culpable, which makes his act of stealing the dagger a trivial one. Even though, we tend to go with the woodcutter's story because he is a neutral person, we cannot believe his as well, as he was the only person who admitted that he was lying (earlier).In each of the version, we see that the person is glorifying themselves. It is not protection from law that mattered, but protecting one's own ego. In every one's story, we see the story-teller polishing his character so as to suit his ego. It portrays the insecurity in humans, the fact that no humans can survive without lying to themselves and creating a make-belief world where they seem to be a better person than they actually are. A simple message that no human is completely honest with himself! Other than the message conveyed in the movie, the way in which the movie unfolds, the way the characters are molded, the way the 3 characters differ in the different versions, the acting, the sensuality of the woman, all plays a great role in shaping the movie into a masterpiece. For instance, the initial scene in which the woodcutter walks through the forest till he finds the dead body is breathtaking. We walk with him, and when he stands still seeing the body, we also freeze. Even such a trivial scene, shot with amazing beauty and intelligence, is what makes Kurosawa one among the best! Usually, when a movie ends without a climax, or when no solutions are provided to the crime, I end up a bit frustrated (exception being Nolan's inception). Have to admit though, this one left me fascinated!

Romeo and Juliet tried everything they could to be together even though it led to loved ones being killed. The death of Juliet's cousin Tybalt was the one that led to Romeo having to leave from Verona forever. Romeo tries to marry Juliet, but is told that Juliet died, when really she drunk a poison that made it seem like she died. This led Romeo to go back to Verona and take his own life. When Juliet woke to see Romeo dead she took her own life. In Romeo and Juliet director Franco Zeffirelli makes this tragic love story come to life, but by using the cast and props he used, he made this film a well-known film of centuries. The movie is an astonishing film that nearly every person knows of; it's the love story that was not able to have a happily ever after ending. Any one who knows the film would say it is a classic that shows not every story can have a happy ending. The movie is a story of two teens who have to take their own lives so they can have some chance of being together which has made this film to be known everywhere. The film consisted of great color; there was always a lot of color while watching the film. The colors were not always bright, but they always went with the setting so if it was bright out the colors would be matching but not super bright. Also the costumes matched the characters and their personalities. One example is the dress Juliet wore in the scene of the ball, the dress is a very bright red that consisted of sequences that matched her personality while seeing her where the dress I got the feeling she was joyful but also a passionate girl.

His extensive and vivid use of colour is gorgeous. More than 10 years before he directed his modern-classics, Hero and House of Flying Daggers, Raise the Red Lantern was there. The film has a simple storyline, a restricted location and a great cinematography. Oh, and it also employs beautiful use of colour. Sometimes I think Zhang Yimou is a product of an explosion in a colour factory. Raise the Red Lantern quite literally pits 4 women against each other and the film observes enviness, jealousy, hatred, anger, love & sorrow. Also, to some extend, Totalitarianism. Every woman wants to be the top mistress in front of the master and wants the red lanterns hung in front of their house. The 4th Mistress quickly catches the eye of her personal maid, Ya'ver, the 3rd Mistress & the 2nd Mistress. One thing leads to another and the 3rd Mistress ends up dead, the maid ends up dead, and the 4th Mistress goes insane, causing The Master to marry once more. Enter 5th Mistress, but thank goodness the film ends there, because another 2 hours would've been hectic. Not that I would've minded it, but enough is enough! I think the appropriate title should've been Personality Clash or This is how Women silently kill each other, or something like that.The pacing of the film is good. The slow and smooth camera movements did the trick. Red Lantern also employs repetition and I think it was a good move. It kept reminding us of what we're watching and what the film's story is all about. Unlike Hero or House of Flying Daggers which were clearly story-driven, this film was more character-and-music driven. The heavy metal? background music was awesome and I think it perfectly matches the mood and characteristics of the film and the women, respectively. From the performances, Gong-Li had the upper-hand, while He Caifi was just a rung below, but both were amazing in their characters.

It's a character's driven series and although I'm not implying that the mere presence of Eastwood is enough but let's think about that Dirty Harry was perceived as a sort of fascist fantasy, it lead to the questioning of Harry Callahan's position as judge, jury and executioner in Magnum Force, and it was intelligently done. Now, what new thing could even be brought up to enrich the character?The surprise could have come from the villains but for the film's defense, how could you make characters as impacting as the psychopathic Scorpio and the Special Police unity that was exercising its own Justice in Magnum Force? Apparently, the screenwriter thought of a combination of both, a terrorist organization constituted by a bunch of young lunatics who happen to be politically oriented since they called themselves People Strike Revolutionary Force, but who can buy their repeated to the people when they kill in the most cold- blooded way a poor old security guard, or a poor worker in a bridge, or the two van-driving guys from the gas company? Are their fight worthy of such collateral damages, aren't their victims 'of the little people' too? Anyway, the way they deliver their slogans is too laconic to be believed, and the film rightfully respect the viewer's intelligence by revealing that the PSRF is just a facade for criminals mostly motivated by greed and money. That's fine but that doesn't make them any less interesting.To go straight to the point, The Enforcer sins in the 'antagonist' department; the terrorist leader with his blonde hair is hardly credible as a psychopath, let alone to be a match for Callahan. And this underdevelopment is quite a shame because the Dirty Harry series essentially depend on the villain. Granted Harry Callahan is a great character and never disappoints since Clint Eastwood incorporates him with total confidence, there have to be worthy villains that would justify his ruthlessness. The film follows the pattern of the first two opuses, by opening with a memorable confrontation with a group of thugs who took hostages in a liquor store. They order Harry to lie down on the floor to be frisked, Harry dryly replies this is my best sport jacket, they ask for a car and leaving Harry, the leader kicks him in the bottom (bad, very bad move). The next scene displays exactly what he expects from Harry, he gives them the car 'his way', then handles them one by one, hitting one of them in a very indistinct place, I hope it was the buttocks but the man's reaction implies that another part was hit. Well, those goons were more interesting than the main villains.And one more thing about the opening sequence, if not as iconic as the first confrontation that provided the famous Do you feel lucky? speech, The Enforcer surpasses the forgettable plane hi-jack from Magnum Force with a very clever use of humor. The exchange between Harry and the thugs are hilarious and it culminates with the following scene when naturally, Harry is criticized for his extreme methods, and is assigned by his incompetent superior Captain McKay to personnel, personnel, it's for a-holes retorts Harry, the I worked in personnel for ten years is funny enough but the icing on the cake is Clint's stoical yeah uttered between his clenched teeth. The humor displayed in The Enforcer demonstrates that the film is much smarter than what it appears, and transcends some predictable elements of the plot and the one-dimensionality of the villains. Yet, Harry's assignment to personnel is not just the typical 'temporary' sanction before he would get back to Homicide, it's also a plot device allowing him to meet the future Inspector Moore during her examination.The Enforcer features one of the most interesting twists of the series by assigning a new partner to Clint Eastwood, inspector Kate Moore played by a young Tyne Daly, who steals every scene she is, which is saying a lot, considering Harry's charisma. Moore spent ten years working as a clerk, and proved to be ready for a promotion. Through Moore, the film denounces the political interferences between Police and some sort of lobbying, many women are assigned inspectors just to fill quotas, and Harry's position on the question is obvious. But it's not misogyny, The Enforcer avoids all the clichés that would have damaged its credibility, Inspector Moore is competent, apart from one or two scenes, she doesn't act as a woman but rather as an inexperienced rookie, and what's more, she's a woman who's confronted to a bunch of villains who can kill a weak old man, or anyone for the sake of it. She follows Harry because she believes that both can make a great partnership but Harry knows he's a fighter, and that's something you got to learn through experienceThe interaction between Harry and Kate, provide the other elements of comedy in the film, in a much more subtle way, and it also permits to point out, the eternal (and real) antagonist which is the Police system and its incompetence when it interferes with lobbying and politics. That's certainly more interesting than the group of hippies who kill everything, and that's also why the climactic confrontation doesn't provide a cheerful satisfaction, we really didn't care of them and the point was not to get them killed. The film ends in a more dramatic note that is ironically one of the highlights of the film, on the field of storytelling, revealing a poignant, human side in Harry Callahan.

In the film Rear Window (1954), the main character, L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) tries to determine if he has witnessed a murder or not. Times like these are where making quick decisions are crucial. The plot of this film introduced itself after a wheelchair bound photographer spots unusual actions going on across from his apartment. During his confined stay in his apartment, L.B. watched the lives of his courtyard neighbors outside of his rear window. What L.B. possibly discovers later is a man murdering his wife. Certain clues keep arising that may lead to a definite murder, but nothing exact can prove the man culpable of murder. Throughout the movie, L.B. uses different resources to find the truth since he is unable to leave his apartment. Once Jefferies finds out the real truth, he could not have been more surprised. The intention that the director (Alfred Hitchcock) was trying to prove was that it was impossible to know everything about someone. L.B. had occasionally seen his neighbors, but did not really stop to think what they were really about. I'm sure he even walked passed them on the street, but never thought what happened behind closed doors in their homes. As soon as L.B. became bound to his apartment due to an accident, he began to learn new things about all of them.

Some precise parallels1. The extremely choppy, episodic nature of the filmic (Jarmusch) and written (Marechera) texts. This speaks to the way the mind sleeps, then wakes up and continues on its narrative. It's the shamanistic movement between the rational daytime awareness and irrational sleep, a dialectic necessary to keep life going. This is faithful to the way we actually experience our lives by going to sleep and the next day necessarily recreating the original narrative of the path on which we're bound. This pertains to the functions of our deep subjectivity and to natural bodily rhythms.2. The encounters with extreme violence and death as a poignant and mesmerizing aspect of life. Society is changing order and there is violence all around. In Marechera's narrative anti-colonial riots, anarchy and war relentlessly assault the psyche as expressions of violence and resistance.3. To be blind or without normal vision is represented as a different way of seeing more clearly. Lacking vision, one is dependent on the visceral senses. Instinct then predominates, after it has learned how to exert its intrinsic force. In Black Sunlight, Marie's blindness represents a shamanic way of seeing. Death presses in more viscerally, in that it reaches on through the faculty of smell, rather than knowledge or visual perception. In Dead Man, the Indian guide Nobody suggests that his charge would see better without spectacles. This turns out to be true, in that he can use his pistol more effectively without clear vision.4. The episodes show nothing more than several consecutive plunges into a state of greater proximity to death, matched with a greater awareness of the immediacy, strangeness and fragility of life. This polarization of the distinctive elements of life, highlighted the contrasts between life and death, is a key feature of shamanistic doubling.5. One moves from a world of logic and violence to a world of flowing organic unity. In the Jarmusch movie, one moves from a failed attempt to integrate with socially-defined reality in a town called Machine. Since one cannot become part of The Machine, one is compelled to die. In Marechera's novel, Chris joins with other social drop-outs at Devil's End. Jarmusch's protagonist, William Blake, meets his Indian protector, Nobody, only after receiving a bullet close to his heart. Thus, a shamanic wound sets the protagonist apart from the rest of society in each case. He starts to see reality differently, above all historical reality, through his wound.6. In Jarmusch's film, Nobody gives Blake the initiatory drug, Peyote. After this, Blake sees the effects of the colonial war against the Indians all around him, but the violence cannot touch him as he is impermeable. In Black Sunlight, apocalyptic shamanic visions at the climax of the novel. They are later explained, as if denied, by the protagonist, who had become the double of himself, Christian, having taken Chris' psychiatric drugs.7. Marechera's protagonist is represented early in the book as a court jester, hanging upside down in a chicken-coup due to having offended the Great Chief. This is political satire, but is also a way of depicting the state of the uninitiated soul with his own superego. The author views himself as being condemned to be tortured and the source of this condemnation is political. The refrain of stupid white man expresses the political irony of Dead Man.8. In Marechera's novel, the protagonist-author, reunited with himself finally, as one, ends up showing the whiteness of his bones by effectively releasing all the words out of his body through his wrists. Rain pours down as overabundant meaning. Everything is liquefied This is indicative of shamanic ritual in facing death and finding unity with oneself through resignation. In Dead Man, Indians dress up Blake's dying body after he has been shot a second time, so that he can complete his journey on the other side of the mirror image of reality he has entered. This signifies that he can become one with himself again, on the surface of liquid (unconscious) (mental) processes.9. Both texts suggest solutions to political and social problems (colonial domination and machine-like attitudes) by going more deeply into death. This is a means for detachment and shamanistic dissociation, by virtue of which, one sees historical reality more clearly.10. In both texts, transgression of the normal social law is a result of accident, not deliberate. Blake's killing of a member of the Town of Machine (a mechanistic world) is an act of self-defense. In addition, his being framed for the murder of another member of the town gave him an outlaw identity that was incongruous with his inner attitude or intent. Marechera similarly shows how his protagonist becomes a revolutionary despite himself, because he has been driven mad by social norms. Shamanism is thus shown to be a state of primeval (but not historical) innocence, in the face of attributed social and political guilt.

The episodes show nothing more than several consecutive plunges into a state of greater proximity to death, matched with a greater awareness of the immediacy, strangeness and fragility of life. This polarization of the distinctive elements of life, highlighted the contrasts between life and death, is a key feature of shamanistic doubling.5. One moves from a world of logic and violence to a world of flowing organic unity. In the Jarmusch movie, one moves from a failed attempt to integrate with socially-defined reality in a town called Machine. Since one cannot become part of The Machine, one is compelled to die. In Marechera's novel, Chris joins with other social drop-outs at Devil's End. Jarmusch's protagonist, William Blake, meets his Indian protector, Nobody, only after receiving a bullet close to his heart. Thus, a shamanic wound sets the protagonist apart from the rest of society in each case. He starts to see reality differently, above all historical reality, through his wound.6. In Jarmusch's film, Nobody gives Blake the initiatory drug, Peyote. After this, Blake sees the effects of the colonial war against the Indians all around him, but the violence cannot touch him as he is impermeable. In Black Sunlight, apocalyptic shamanic visions at the climax of the novel. They are later explained, as if denied, by the protagonist, who had become the double of himself, Christian, having taken Chris' psychiatric drugs.7. Marechera's protagonist is represented early in the book as a court jester, hanging upside down in a chicken-coup due to having offended the Great Chief. This is political satire, but is also a way of depicting the state of the uninitiated soul with his own superego. The author views himself as being condemned to be tortured and the source of this condemnation is political. The refrain of stupid white man expresses the political irony of Dead Man.8. In Marechera's novel, the protagonist-author, reunited with himself finally, as one, ends up showing the whiteness of his bones by effectively releasing all the words out of his body through his wrists. Rain pours down as overabundant meaning. Everything is liquefied This is indicative of shamanic ritual in facing death and finding unity with oneself through resignation. In Dead Man, Indians dress up Blake's dying body after he has been shot a second time, so that he can complete his journey on the other side of the mirror image of reality he has entered. This signifies that he can become one with himself again, on the surface of liquid (unconscious) (mental) processes.9. Both texts suggest solutions to political and social problems (colonial domination and machine-like attitudes) by going more deeply into death. This is a means for detachment and shamanistic dissociation, by virtue of which, one sees historical reality more clearly.10. In both texts, transgression of the normal social law is a result of accident, not deliberate. Blake's killing of a member of the Town of Machine (a mechanistic world) is an act of self-defense. In addition, his being framed for the murder of another member of the town gave him an outlaw identity that was incongruous with his inner attitude or intent. Marechera similarly shows how his protagonist becomes a revolutionary despite himself, because he has been driven mad by social norms. Shamanism is thus shown to be a state of primeval (but not historical) innocence, in the face of attributed social and political guilt. ","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Western"},{"date":"17 October 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The more I go into this movie, Dead Man, the more I understand that its shamanism parallels that of Marechera's short, episodic book, Black Sunlight. Some precise parallels1. The extremely choppy, episodic nature of the filmic (Jarmusch) and written (Marechera) texts. This speaks to the way the mind sleeps, then wakes up and continues on its narrative. It's the shamanistic movement between the rational daytime awareness and irrational sleep, a dialectic necessary to keep life going. This is faithful to the way we actually experience our lives by going to sleep and the next day necessarily recreating the original narrative of the path on which we're bound. This pertains to the functions of our deep subjectivity and to natural bodily rhythms.2. The encounters with extreme violence and death as a poignant and mesmerizing aspect of life. Society is changing order and there is violence all around. In Marechera's narrative anti-colonial riots, anarchy and war relentlessly assault the psyche as expressions of violence and resistance.3. To be blind or without normal vision is represented as a different way of seeing more clearly. Lacking vision, one is dependent on the visceral senses. Instinct then predominates, after it has learned how to exert its intrinsic force. In Black Sunlight, Marie's blindness represents a shamanic way of seeing. Death presses in more viscerally, in that it reaches on through the faculty of smell, rather than knowledge or visual perception. In Dead Man, the Indian guide Nobody suggests that his charge would see better without spectacles. This turns out to be true, in that he can use his pistol more effectively without clear vision.4.

I've seen the Matrix a few times and mainly seen the action dozens of times. Today, I re-watched the movie and was more than blown away by the movie. The Matrix is just groundbreaking and jaw dropping in pretty much every aspect. The acting is fantastic, even Keanue Reeves did a splendid job in this movie, the visual effects are revolutionary, the plot behind it is so unique and nothing but masterfully directed, written in amazing style with brilliant dialogue and action, containing great stunt work. A mix of CGI with practical effects certainly makes this movie all the more realistic and groundbreakingThe Matrix is about a young man who experiences that he lives in two different worlds; one he is a computer hacker, the other he is an employee at a computer software company. He is taken by a mysterious man named Morpheus and is shown the truth about humanity and that something called the 'matrix' is concealing the truth away from ordinary citizens. The world, in the present year of 2099, is covered in ruins after incidents that happened long before. This movie is pretty much all about Neo becoming the One to fulfill the prophecy and becoming the One.The plot in this movie can be so confusing at times if you do not pay attention, much like Inception. When the comparison does come, I always will say that the Matrix is a more amazing piece of art and is actually regarded as amazing by some and the most overrated movie by others. Calling this the most overrated movie ever is like calling Avatar the greatest. It doesn't work like that. No movie in my Top 10 of all time do I have a single issue with expect this movie, which turns out to be a minor issue under great directing, writing, acting, characters, story and action as well as breathtaking visuals. That is the music which could've been done better. That is easily forgotten when an action scene I've seen dozens of times before still intensifies me so all is forgiven. 'The Matrix' is easily one of the most memorable movies of all time and those who trash this movie should go back to watching Batman and Robin. Truly one of the best movies ever made Groundbreaking, Epic, Visually Stunning, Masterpiece. Belongs in my Top 10 list.

Of course there have been great, even legendary, films with lycanthrope antagonists, but that particular sub-genre is rather limited in scope. However, despite the admitted paucity of competition, I can still say with absolute certainty that The Howling is the best movie about werewolves ever made.It makes sense that the film heavily references The Wolf Man, the eternal Lon Chaney Jr.\/Universal Monsters staple, because The Howling is executed in a way that clearly reveals its acknowledgment of its roots in the traditions of classic horror. The pace is restrained and meticulous, the atmosphere is a character in itself, and despite the film's utilization of creature effects that weren't even dreamed of in Universal's genre heyday, good old-fashioned ensemble acting is what truly drives the action in the piece. If this description makes The Howling sound like a dry production more suited for the theater stage, don't misunderstand me; this is bloody and ferocious fare that will greatly please fans of visceral horror. But it is the taut and well-crafted story, not merely the FX, that make this such a gem, and director Joe Dante is seasoned enough here to allow a gradual and steady immersion into the film's world before bowling us over with Rob Bottin's peerless set-pieces, which have all the more impact when they take command because of how effectively the movie has teased us with tantalizing glimpses throughout.Though the creatures are understandably a feature attraction here, the main focus of the plot is on news anchor Karen White, who has become the fixation of deranged serial killer Eddie Quist and agrees to be used as bait as part of a police operation to capture him. Quist is seemingly killed during her harrowing and macabre encounter, and Karen is subsequently haunted by bizarre dreams and fuzzy, repressed recollections of what actually occurred that night. When she heeds a pop psychologist's suggestion that she and her husband should attend a therapy retreat he oversees at a secluded commune, the getaway does anything but assuage her trauma. Instead, Karen encounters odd and subtly menacing locals and the titular unholy moans emanating from the fog-shrouded forests. It doesn't take long for us to learn that the commune is located at the nucleus of the hunting grounds prowled by a pack of malevolent predatory beasts, and after Karen's husband is seduced and transformed by a sultry lady wolf, her and her visiting reporter friend begin to uncover the sinister secret of the commune.I'll refrain from stepping up on my soapbox to deliver an impassioned soliloquy about how CGI has ruined the art of special make-up FX, but those who appreciate the magic of the wizards who revolutionized the art-form in the late '70s and early '80s will find the work of Rob Bottin here absolutely awe-inspiring. The climactic transformation scene is delivered unflinchingly and in real time, step by grotesque step, and the result is an indelible sequence that remains far more impressive and enthralling than anything modern film-makers handling the same material could ever cook up on a computer. The gore is used sparingly for maximum impact, but whenever it arrives, the results are stunning and gruesome. Perhaps most importantly, the werewolves themselves are a thing of fearsome beauty to behold, monsters that resonate as wholly believable extensions of the established mythology while still maintaining an innovative stroke of originality that makes them belong to this film alone. These creatures aren't merely big wolves, they are eight-foot tall bipedal killing machines with fangs and claws capable of tearing people to shreds, a skill that they demonstrate with acute proficiency during the course of the movie.The performances are all excellent even when the roles veer into the melodramatic, and the presence of one of the power couples of '80s horror, Christopher Stone and Dee Wallace (later Dee Wallace Stone), as well as a marvelous extended cameo from beloved genre vet Dick Miller, will delight fans of the era. Both the gritty, sleazy streets that open the movie and the isolated location housing the commune complex are perfectly presented and utilized, the clues to the greater mystery are unfolded with the taut grace of a top-notch thriller, and the film as a whole feels like an entirely plausible representation of ancient folk lore-based creatures existing in a modern world.The denouement falters slightly since Bottin's best tricks have already been displayed, but the sentiment of the finale is striking enough to end the saga on a dark and tragic note. If your love of the genre goes back to its natal days, be sure to stick around after the credits too, where you'll find a nice coda that bookends the homage to The Wolf Man present throughout these reels.The Howling is, in my estimation, not only the finest and most enduring lycanthropy fable in the canon, it's also quite simply one of the best horror films of all time.

In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie. ","genre":null},{"date":"17 October 2012","score":"","review":" Now here's a movie that surprised me.

It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"17 October 2012","score":"","review":" Now here's a movie that surprised me. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected.

It was a huge hit in 1940, and soon it was turn into a movie directed by John Ford. The film stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joads, the incredible Jane Darwell as his mother. The film stands today as one of the finest examples of sensitive American cinema. It is an incredible combination of gut-wrenching scenes threaded through feel-good scenes that make you laugh and then sob. The movie is about The Joads family. They were destitute by faceless, corporative banks that seized their lands just when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) got out of prison. Forced out of their farm, the Joads are heading from the dust towns of Oklahoma to California for hope of a job. As aggressively coaxing is needed to acquire Grandpa Joad (Charley Grapewin) from leaving his abode, while the family meek existence is depended on the nurturing of Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who's strong upbringing sturdily holds them together. When the family arrives upon destination, they harbor terrible living conditions and given low wages in the migrant-worker camps. Hot tempered Tom Joad eventually collides with the wrong side of the law, as he is cornered to leave his family behind. A documented-style production in which seasoned pioneer John Ford received an Academy Award for his appraised directing. The Joads suffers much, and struggle in times of adversity. The visuals of the film, was outstanding. The desolation of the land and the desperation of the people were depicted very well. It does have an uplifting message despite its gloom. A black and white cinematography that would inspire Ansel Adams. Tom Joad's speech is very powerful, and makes you appreciate every meal you have. The idea of the interpretation of the film is that despite being in hard times, the Joads gave to others. Letting others stay with them, helping out others, giving away their food. The faults of the film are these&#x85; it's really heavy, slow tempo, long, and the Okie accent and dialect is hard to understand. Some harsh language in the book that wouldn't have been allowed in mainstream movies of that time is left out from the movie. The production codes did not allow for the shocking scene of a woman breast feeding a starving man that ends the book. In the book more detail is given about Tom Joad's older brother Noah. In the movie he's hardly featured at all, and in fact completely disappears from the latter part of the film with no explanation given as to where he went. The big difference between the movie and the novel is that the movie goes uphill while the novel goes entirely downhill. This makes all the difference. The uphill fashion of the film version fails to provide closure. For example, it lacks the powerful ending of the book, which I will not spoil. Anyways, this film and book should be read and view in EVERY school to show how lucky we are today and don't appreciated it with our many luxuries our money buys today. It doesn't belong 2 a particular era or country. It's the story of the struggles of humanity.

It seems the Chamberlain is a crook and they have warned the Superintendent. But when they are suddenly attacked by the Superintendent's men and the nameless ronin comes to their defence, it appears they have things the wrong way around and must now go into hiding, with only their mysterious benefactor to help them ...If you have heard of Kurosawa but avoided his movies because of their heavy reputation I urge you to see this terrific action adventure film, as it has all of his visual style but is easily one of his most laid-back and accessible films. Everything about it is great - the story is a wonderfully woven criss-cross of subterfuge and plots within plots, it's shot through with a wry sense of humour (the scenes with the captured guard are particularly funny), all the performances are terrific, the visuals are dynamic and it has an absolutely unmissable shock ending. What I like most of all about it though is the tone - it's a macho man's action picture with a super-tough-guy but it delights in subverting the conventions of the genre at every possible moment. Our hero is a scruffy opportunist, the fellowship of nine samurai are fairly dumb and cowardly (there's a great midway scene where they argue about whether they can trust Mifune), the Lady Mutsuta character (beautifully played by Irie) keeps admonishing the men with too-perceptive remarks, the bravado plan revolves around picking flowers, and our heroes win through more by luck than skill. Muroto, the chief villain (Nakadai), acts with more honour and principle than anyone, despite being on the wrong side, and so his violent death is all the more ignoble and a tremendous juxtaposition with the events which have come before it. Whilst Mifune's character is nameless, he is clearly repeating his role from Yojimbo - he even has the same theme music - and the movie is a sequel of sorts, scripted by Kurosawa and his regular writers Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni, but with a lighter tone and a more conventional narrative than its influential predecessor. Mifune even went on to reprise the role a couple of times, once in one of the Zatoichi series and again in an obscure 1970 film entitled Machibuse. A solid, well-written, thinking man's action film, made by a master of the craft.
