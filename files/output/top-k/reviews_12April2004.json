Based on Ray Bradbury's classic story of the same name, Something Wicked This Way Comes is the story of Jim and Will and the small town in the Midwest which is their home in the early half of the 20th century. Will is a quiet, thoughtful boy, son of the town librarian, an obedient child who is very uncomfortable with the subject of his fathers failing health and the limitations it brings. Jim, on the other hand, is a bit of a wild child; his father ran off some time ago and his mother, a sweet but not terribly bright woman, has become something of a town tramp. Into this quiet and rather stereotypical small town comes a carnival, arriving at midnight on an abandoned train with a whistle like tortured souls screaming. This is Dark's Pandemonium Carnival, owned and operated by Mr. Dark (Jonathan Price, recently of Pirates of the Caribbean fame) and his odd assortment of eerie employees. From the beginning, Will senses that something is terribly wrong with this carnival; a carnival which erects itself within seconds. So too Will's father has a sense of foreboding. But stubborn Jim is determined to explore every shadowy corner no matter what the cost. By the time they all realize how truly ancient and evil the carnival is, it is almost too late. Can Will and his father save Jim? More importantly, can any of them save themselves?Modern horror fans may find this boring and talky, which is a shame as most of the action is within the words spoken here; revelations of guilt and unspoken desires that will come back to haunt each and every character weighed down by both. The atmosphere of the film is a character all its own; a cold, pumpkin- colored autumn filled with wind and dead leaves and frost which seems almost to aid and abet the carnival as Mr. Dark scatters flyers in the town square at twilight, or leads his mournful parade through the streets, the band playing a funeral dirge. The visual effects are quite nice considering that this was made before the days of CGI; there's a nasty horde of tarantulas, a bright white mirror maze, an evil green fog chasing the boys through the woods, creepy tattoos of the boys' faces imprinted upon the hands of Mr. Dark, which bleed when he clenches his fists...and lets not forget the cursed carousel, which can turn you into a child or into a shriveled corpse depending upon if you ride it backwards or forwards. Everyone in the cast does a flawless job with their given roles; Jonathan Price is indeed wicked as Mr. Dark and Jason Robards is strong and sympathetic as Will's father. Pam Grier, in a role quite unlike any other she has played, is smoky and seductive and very dangerous in her role as the Dust Witch, who wears the mask of the Most Beautiful Woman in the World. Royal Dano is here too as the strange Cassandra-like seller of lightening rods, who seems always to be one step ahead of the carnival, warning everyone in it's path of its arrival. The boys too are quite convincing and likable and their mothers very believable as kind and caring mothers. This is a classic story come to life, both innocent and horrifying all at once. Watching it is like watching a fairy tale come to life. They just don't make 'em like this anymore, which is truly a shame. 10 stars.

His name is Lebowski, but he is known by his friends as The Dude, and he prefers that moniker rather than his birth name.Every evening Dude goes bowling with his best buddies, Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi). Walter is a Vietnam veteran, and in his perception, all incidents relate to the war. What does the Vietnam War have to do with anything? Dude asks him at a fragile moment in both their lives. Instead of disputing, Walter gives him a big bear hug.The story begins with a humorous and self-aware voice-over by the narrator, played by Sam Elliot in a few recurring cameos. He informs us that Dude's adventure started on an eventful night not very long ago, when a duo of criminals broke into his house in search of The Big Lebowski, a local millionaire who happens to share Dude's last name. After dunking Dude's face into a toilet bowl and realizing that they've attacked the incorrect individual, the pair of idiots urinate on Dude's rug and flee the apartment.Dude figures that the only man truly responsible for the incident is Lebowski himself, so he makes a trip out to his mansion and is informed by Lebowski's assistant (portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman with the perfect amount of nervousness) that Lebowski's wife has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom. Suspecting that she is in the custody of the two men who attacked Dude, Lebowski offers the slacker a chance to be the courier of his ransom fee. Her life is in your hands, Lebowski tells him. He promises him some cash to transport a briefcase containing the money, and Lebowski agrees to help him out.Unfortunately, the kidnappers never receive their ransom, and Dude's car is stolen, along with Lebowski's money. It just so happens that Lebowski's unfaithful wife owed some money to a trio of German nihilists, as well as an adult filmmaker and an assortment of other odd creatures, and now Lebowski is being targeted for the cash. Everyone seems to think that the briefcase is in his possession, and he is threatened that he will lose his Johnson unless it is returned. Fearing for his life (and more importantly, his Johnson) Dude takes comfort in Walter, who tracks down the 15-year-old teenager who stole the car and the briefcase and has apparently bought a sports car with a small portion of the briefcase's contents. See this Tommy? This is what happens when you mess with a stranger! Walter yells at the boy as he single-handedly demolishes the sports car. We all anticipate the obvious punch line far ahead of time, but the result is nevertheless extremely funny.The Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, are extremely gifted filmmakers. They burst onto screens across the nation in 1984 with their indie classic Blood Simple, which starred Frances McDormand and Dan Hedaya, the former of whom would later star in Fargo as the bumbling police officer Marge Gunderson.As usual, the Coens fall back on their quirky characters for comic relief and enjoyable antics, particularly Buscemi, who is one of the best character actors in Hollywood, and who also manages to be funny in whichever role he chooses - despite having to say anything funny at all. In Fargo he was the blundering kidnapper, Carl, and in The Big Lebowski, he lets his hair part across his head and hang low across his face, completely changing his entire pattern of speech. He's the goofy little squirt who tags along with Dude and Walter, and manages to repeat everything they say and ask questions about discussions long after they have ended. You're like a child who has wandered into the middle of a movie and wants to know what's going on! Walter tells him. What's your point, Walter? he asks. But it's the innocent nature of his tone that leads us to like him, and it's Walter's crazy antics that makes us feel attached to him, and it's The Dude's trademark humor that makes us enjoy watching him. The Coens have succeeded at making a great comedy with characters that actually have their own characteristics. But it is the Coens' eloquent use of proverbial language that is really what elevates the film above all else. The script is wonderful and witty. This has some of the best dialogue I have ever heard, ranking up there with Pulp Fiction and the work of Elmore Leonard. Walter's rants consume much of the dialogue, which I think is fine.The Big Lebowski is a movie with considerably large structural flaws and weaknesses. Yet the film seems to know this, letting the audience in on the secret during the introductory voice-over narration. Aw, I've lost my train of thought, we're told, as The Stranger mumbles on about the movie's plot. And towards the end, we're all told by The Stranger that he sincerely hopes we enjoyed the story, even if it's nothing special. Yup, that about sums it all up. The Big Lebowski is a movie with a lot of joy, wit, and wicked humor three reasons you've got to see one of the most enjoyable films of the past decade.

He promises him some cash to transport a briefcase containing the money, and Lebowski agrees to help him out.Unfortunately, the kidnappers never receive their ransom, and Dude's car is stolen, along with Lebowski's money. It just so happens that Lebowski's unfaithful wife owed some money to a trio of German nihilists, as well as an adult filmmaker and an assortment of other odd creatures, and now Lebowski is being targeted for the cash. Everyone seems to think that the briefcase is in his possession, and he is threatened that he will lose his Johnson unless it is returned. Fearing for his life (and more importantly, his Johnson) Dude takes comfort in Walter, who tracks down the 15-year-old teenager who stole the car and the briefcase and has apparently bought a sports car with a small portion of the briefcase's contents. See this Tommy? This is what happens when you mess with a stranger! Walter yells at the boy as he single-handedly demolishes the sports car. We all anticipate the obvious punch line far ahead of time, but the result is nevertheless extremely funny.The Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, are extremely gifted filmmakers. They burst onto screens across the nation in 1984 with their indie classic Blood Simple, which starred Frances McDormand and Dan Hedaya, the former of whom would later star in Fargo as the bumbling police officer Marge Gunderson.As usual, the Coens fall back on their quirky characters for comic relief and enjoyable antics, particularly Buscemi, who is one of the best character actors in Hollywood, and who also manages to be funny in whichever role he chooses - despite having to say anything funny at all. In Fargo he was the blundering kidnapper, Carl, and in The Big Lebowski, he lets his hair part across his head and hang low across his face, completely changing his entire pattern of speech. He's the goofy little squirt who tags along with Dude and Walter, and manages to repeat everything they say and ask questions about discussions long after they have ended. You're like a child who has wandered into the middle of a movie and wants to know what's going on! Walter tells him. What's your point, Walter? he asks. But it's the innocent nature of his tone that leads us to like him, and it's Walter's crazy antics that makes us feel attached to him, and it's The Dude's trademark humor that makes us enjoy watching him. The Coens have succeeded at making a great comedy with characters that actually have their own characteristics. But it is the Coens' eloquent use of proverbial language that is really what elevates the film above all else. The script is wonderful and witty. This has some of the best dialogue I have ever heard, ranking up there with Pulp Fiction and the work of Elmore Leonard. Walter's rants consume much of the dialogue, which I think is fine.The Big Lebowski is a movie with considerably large structural flaws and weaknesses. Yet the film seems to know this, letting the audience in on the secret during the introductory voice-over narration. Aw, I've lost my train of thought, we're told, as The Stranger mumbles on about the movie's plot. And towards the end, we're all told by The Stranger that he sincerely hopes we enjoyed the story, even if it's nothing special. Yup, that about sums it all up. The Big Lebowski is a movie with a lot of joy, wit, and wicked humor three reasons you've got to see one of the most enjoyable films of the past decade.

But visually, this film has no movement. It just sits there; and it seems eons before anyone thinks of camera movement. Naturally, it could be argued that the makers preferred a conservative style of filming, and (like John Ford) only moved the camera when there was a good reason. Well, there was reason enough in South Pacific--a case of stylistic atrophy. Even the actors seem enervated. Like professional, dependable stage performers, they all hit their chalk marks. And then--like the film--they just sit there too.A movie script consisting of one static camera set-up after another is NOT symptomatic of Fifties film-making. By 1958, sound and re-recording technology had made it possible for directors to give motion to the term motion picture. But in Joshua Logan's case, the Proscenium Arch rules all. Occasionally, there have been stage-trained directors who have adapted their talents to the screen D. W. Griffith certainly comes to mind first. (He's credited with having invented film language.) And more recently, there is the late Bob Fosse (Cabaret, Lenny, All That Jazz), a hard-core stylist in the truest sense. But here, Joshua Logan uses the tropical backdrop as one would in a staged play. And sure enough, there's good old Bali Hai, rising up behind the performers, just like the fake, painted plaster-of-Paris mountains used in bad stage productions. Some scenes in South Pacific are artificially tinted red or blue or purple--whatever color matches whichever mood, I suppose. This really is taking film-making back decades; even the sepia-tinted portions of Michael Curtiz's The Sea Hawk (1940) were a distraction. But Logan's invention is more than that; it's like some bit of style an amateur director might use to beef up a boring scene--mounting colored gels over spotlights and then aiming them at the performers. The whole movie is merely bad filmed theatre.About the only items that keep this lumbering dinosaur plodding along are the songs, which (mostly speaking) are real classics and well worth hearing again, even for the thousandth time There Is Nothing Like A Dame, Bali Hai, Some Enchanted Evening, Happy Talk, Younger Than Springtime, etc. Mitzi Gaynor (as Nurse Forbush) is an actress who was born 15 years too late. As her quirky performance as the independent, free-spirited Adelaide Swanson in Take Care of My Little Girl (1951) had proved seven years earlier, she would have felt right at home on screen during the Thirties or Forties with all those other wise-cracking dames--Ginger Roger's Roxie Hart or Rosalind Russell's Hildy Johnson, for example. Here, she is merely adequate, even if she does do her own singing. Gaynor simply isn't square enough, though she tries--boy, does she try. Her prancing around during the I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair number is just so much busy-work--like watching a stage actress doing an uninspired set of calisthenics from one side of the stage to the other. She does manage to inject some life into the Honey Bun set. But by then, it's too late; the movie has almost completely withered away.The night South Pacific first arrived in Denton, Texas--where my Mom (a big fan of Rodgers & Hammerstein) was a business teacher at North Texas State College (since re-named The University of North Texas)--she couldn't find a baby-sitter to tend to me (age 6) or my little brother. So we were dragged along to the downtown theatre to see South Pacific with her and a small audience of college students, all of whom seemed as anesthetized as we were. Mom needn't have bothered with the baby-sitter; I fell asleep in my seat shortly after the Dame number and woke up toward the film's end, just in time to witness Miss Forbush informing Bloody Mary and her daughter of Lieutenant Cable's death.

","genre":"Musical, Romance, War"},{"date":"12 April 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The genre of the Western is seen as holding a single basic form. A lonely town on the edge of the North American frontier falls victim to an evil, black-clothed, murdering desperado who can only be stopped by the good-natured, clean-cut, well-groomed sheriff or local hero. Although these basic elements of the classic Western all exist in `High Noon', the story is arranged so that the journey the film sends its viewers on is far more interesting than the preconceived outcome. The story that engulfs the town of Hadleyville is told not only with the relevant dialogue but also with excellent camera work that establishes characters and moods. Accompanied only by the church bell, the gang enters the town. Little is said by the townspeople, and the camera is used to establish the gang's character and their relationship with the town. The lack of verbal exposition is replaced with pictures of people grimacing and fleeing as the gang passes. Inventive camera angles are used to look at the dusty town in new ways. For one shot, the camera is placed below the front of a wagon between the footboard and the horses, and the audience gets a new low - angled view with the spinning wheel in the foreground. While many scenes use conversations that consist of intercut close - ups and medium shots, only one long shot is used as the judge packs up his things as he gives Cain his explanation for leaving in the time of crisis. This is used to create a feeling of deliberate decision making on the part of the judge, and to assert his character as a thoughtful man with practical reasons for leaving town before noon. Perhaps the most effective shot faces Cain as he moves into the street and then zooms out as it is carried upward on a crane to reveal Cain is totally alone in the dusty street. This simply reinforces Cain's lonely and desperate situation and the pressure of a whole town weighing on his shoulders. Utilizing both the camera and dialogue to create a classic story enables the meaning of the small town to extend beyond that of a simple western. Art enables people to discuss current problems in a context that can address the universal concepts of the situation without raising the specifics of a dilemma which people so often become caught up in. This ability of art to transcend circumstances through metaphor is what makes `High Noon' relevant as a cold war film in spite of its untimely setting. In the film, a single man faces a threat for an entire community. Similarly, during the 1950's, a single lawyer stood up to the fear spread by McCarthyism in the United States. Although each citizen has their own practical reasons for not joining Cain's stand, none of them will join Cain. Those people who ducked McCarthy's so - called hearings, backed out of the legal fight fearing the blacklists just as the townspeople locked themselves in at home to hide from the bullets of Miller's gang. The film leaves people with the choice of leaving freedom to be decided by others while remaining safely locked up or risking the consequences by facing those who would threaten freedom.On the whole, the film is very enjoyable. The story line is exciting as it includes all the traditional elements of westerns, but it arranges them in such a way that all the odds are piled against the reluctant hero. The women in the film stand apart, and in the occasion of Mrs. Ramirez, above the men as they bargain and separate their choices from the men they love. The film delivers its message not only in the hero of Cain, but with the very practical reasons that the townspeople give for not fighting. These reasons are so legitimate that they force the audience to truly wonder how they would behave in similar circumstances. During the varied visuals and pointed dialogue, the only element that can detract from the film is the repeated use of the song, Do Not Forsake Me. While the song is quite appropriate for the film, its many renditions cross into redundancy. Director Fred Zinneman drives home his point both clearly and artistically. Using a variety of techniques, the film brings the audience into the life of the town. The script and actors create very real characters. The challenge is finding the message in the metaphors, so the next time a gang rides into town, fate does not rest on one man alone.9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 April 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The genre of the Western is seen as holding a single basic form.

His first victims are a small American family who have a house in between the tracks and the head of the family refuses to give in to politics so the best way to rid Frank and the bosses is to deal with it themselves and kill the family.  Here we meet Jill who is the new wife of Mcbain the father of the family that has been killed and on her arrival she finds nothing but a family massacred including a young boy.    Here she decides that what has happened is unlawful and this is where Harmonica comes in.   Also on the trail for his own fortune is Cheyenne.  The film as a whole is about relationships between pacific characters and that's where the strength of the film lies.   I couldn't find a single problem with Once Upon a Time in the West.   I wasn't looking for any problems with it though but it's rare to see a film that is perfect like this one and this is the best Western Sergio Leone has ever done.   I hate to admit that it's between than the spaghetti Western trilogy but it is and there's nothing wrong with that.   When Leone's first trilogy came out the people probably thought he could never surpass what he had already achieved but he did and did it with flying colours.   Sergio Leone is proof to the world that there is no such thing as a one hit wonder when it comes to inventing new stories and ways to make the genre you have already created even better than it was.

De Palma uses some brilliant crane shots in particular - they're really intriging to watch.The editing allows us to see Tony work his way from small time imigrant up to big time crime lord.  The thing is that what he really wants to be - legitimate - is never going to happen.From the moment he murders a political prisoner for a green card we know that he is a right c*nt!  Some viewers would root for him as an anti-hero; I would say that he is an idiot - because I know that he's going to get himself killed from the beggining.By the end of the flick (spoilers!) he has managed to become a crack head, a public drunk, a drug pusher, killed his best mate ever, destroyed his sister and mother, failed in his marriage and never fathered a child.  Well done son - what a loser!To his merit he finally realises that everything he has was worthless, and the opposites of the previous list are what its all about; but by this stage his house is under siege and he's about to get his bum blown out with a double barelled shotgun.  Good!Pacino is allowed to overact with so much charm its infectious, the action scenes are top notch and the sense of danger is perfick!  A great crime-does-not-pay film.Check out the DefJam documentary on the DVD to see how idiotic some rapper are (Puff I've seen it 63 times Daddy still doesn't get it?!!! Come on lads, get with the plot!).In the words of myself ; bloody marvellous little film.  Put it on your to see list.

This isolation has kept the accent there mostly unaltered since the 17th century days when it was inhabited by British seamen. The Ocracoke accent sounds like a mixture of Brit and Yank, so what you hear Demi Moore doing in this movie is really quite accurate.I also enjoyed the cozy portrayal of the Manhattan (NYC) side street neighborhood life. The NYC avenues tend to be wide, impersonal and busy, but the narrower, townhouse and small shop filled side streets can be quite friendly. It gives me some nice, childhood nostalgic memories to see the happier, day-to-day aspect of NYC life shown in this film.I watch this romantic comedy whenever it is on TV, and I have no complaints about it at all. I find it to be a sweet, feel-good film with occasional hints at magic realism, but without plunging too far into that iffy genre.I feel that all the players did good jobs, and that the locations and settings felt very true. Nice production values too.If you like Moonstruck, then you will probably like The Butcher's Wife too.
