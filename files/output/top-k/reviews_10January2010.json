[{"date":"10 January 2010","score":"","review":" Rushmore is the best movie of that long ago decade known as the 1990s. I love the overall style of this movie, a style that has since become the standard for Wes Anderson movies.The visual style is brilliant deliberate tracking shots, centered wide angle shots. The musical style classic pop\/rock music from the 1960s and 1970s. The acting style quirky and understated.I have watched Rushmore many times and am never bored. Rushmore is like its main characters, Max Fisher and Herman Blume, in that it is equal parts genius, melancholy, lonely, and, ultimately, sweet.Rushmore is highly recommended.
