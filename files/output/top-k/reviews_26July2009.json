They had done Vietnam movies to death at this point (DEER HUNTER, COMING HOME, APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON, FULL METAL JACKET, BOYS OF COMPANY C, HAMBURGER HILL). All those prior films, except for COMING HOME and DEER HUNTER in parts are about the actual Vietnam experience, whereas BORN is virtually about the effects on the soldier upon returning home. You'd think that by the time of BORN (1989), a film about anything related to Vietnam would seem like retread. Thankfully, due to Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise, it is anything but that. An amazingly involving film that stands out amongst the great Vietnam films, BORN quite possibly cracks the top 5 Vietnam movies! It catches your attention from the opening when our hero Ron Kovic (portrayed brilliantly by Mr. Cruise) briefly narrates how he came to be infatuated with war and his country as a boy. Such an innocent scene of little Ronny playing war with his friends on his birthday, the 4th of July. Then sitting on his father's back during the 4th of July parade and admiring the veteran soldiers passing by. Soon after we see a teenage Ron working in the grocery store afterschool with all the enthusiasm and energy a young teen should have. Amazing that at this point in his career (I think Cruise was actually in his late 20s) that he could so perfectly make us believe him as a teen! Then Ron enlists in the Marines and goes off to Vietnam to be badly wounded (permanent paralysis). The brief Vietnam scenes are incredibly authentic and the VA hospital scenes are some of the most disgusting and gruesome ever filmed. Ron and other vets are treated like utter crap by the VA employees and he has to endure this treatment while being devastated that he has lost permanent use of his legs. Ron returns home and THIS scene that occurs around the midway point of the film is the one that I most remember. Watching this once energetic, full-of-life young man now permanently disabled and having to return to his family in this condition chokes me up to this day, especially that brief moment with his mother. As time passes, Ron realizes that his idealism may have been misplaced and that war, in particular this war, may not have been the right one to fight. His own family turns against him, the very ones who encouraged him in the first place...Sad...So Ron leaves and moves to Mexico to get away from his troubles and hooks up with similar vets who live a life of booze and sexual pleasure (as best these men could experience). He soon realizes that these people are no more his friends than perfect strangers and that he must battle and defeat his inner demons to become a complete man again.I'm not a big fan of biopics, but Stone's film seems to capture the essence of the pre, during, and post Vietnam experience from one brave, great man's viewpoint, but never devolves into pontification or tedium. And frankly, generally films like this can easily become tedious. The cinematography, sound, and editing is brilliant. Mostly, the film benefits from Mr. Cruise, a truly GREAT actor who proved that he could play with the big boys! Really, one of the best portrayals of a real-life person in film ever!

I didn't pay much attention to most of the movies shown on that trip (which is why I could only remember a little bit of this one), and didn't know this one was called A Night at the Roxbury at the time. A few years later (2005 or 2006), I saw some of it on TV (knowing about one of its two stars, Will Ferrell, by this time), and recognized the part where the two main characters are thrown out of a building. It took many years for me to get around to actually sitting down and watching the entire film, but it has finally happened. However, aware of its rating here, it wasn't surprising when I found the film a bit bland.Steve and Doug Butabi are two dimwitted brothers who often go to nightclubs and attempt to score with women, but never succeed. During the day, they work at their father's fake plant store. The brothers dream of getting into the Roxbury, the best club in town, but since they're not on the guest list, they are always denied entrance. They also dream of opening their own nightclub. One night, when they go out in the fake plant store's delivery van for another attempt to get into the Roxbury, the vehicle is hit from behind. The one who hit it turns out to be the famous Richard Grieco. Knowing he can get the two into the club with his celebrity status, he does just that in order to avoid a lawsuit. Inside, the Butabi brothers meet the club's owner, Mr. Zadir. They also meet two young women, Vivica and Cambi, and actually score this time! It appears things are starting to work out for the brothers, until they are denied permission to enter Mr. Zadir's office for their meeting, then it all goes wrong! Even though I didn't laugh very hard for most of the film, quite a few parts made me at least snicker. I can't think of too many great highlights, but there are some notable gags, such as scenes involving the main characters pathetically trying to score with any attractive young woman they see (whether they're in a club, on the street, or on the beach), Steve (played by Ferrell) flirting with a female police officer, Steve getting emotional while describing silk flowers to a customer at the fake plant store (this may be the funniest part), and eventually some of the conflict between the brothers (most notably the part where they're on the road). Some of the gags are kind of lame, though none of them are memorably disgusting, unlike gags I've seen in a number of other crude modern comedies. For much of the time, I was fairly bored, and I get the feeling even my 6\/10 rating just might be a TAD too generous, but probably not.Like Dumb & Dumber and Dude, Where's My Car?, A Night at the Roxbury is a raunchy comedy about two stupid guys on an adventure that involves a lot of sexuality. It was made in between those two films, and I would say it also comes somewhere in between them in quality. I think Dumb & Dumber is definitely a funny movie. It's one of those comedies which show that films can be silly and immature but funny at the same time. I've never cared much for Dude, Where's My Car? This 1998 comedy is basically a mixed bag. Comedies like this are really funny to some viewers and strongly hated by others, but with this particular film, I come in between those two crowds.

His archenemy Arnold Schwarzenegger made (Red Heat) and also the comedy (Twins). The third, yet less rich, brother Van Damme gave us (Black Eagle) & (Bloodsport). The family's black sheep Chuck Norris gave us his Horror of an action (Hero and the Terror) & (Braddock Missing in Action III)! The funny cousin of Hong Kong Jackie Chan released both (Police Story 2) & (Dragons Forever). The godfather Eastwood presented (The Dead Pool). And the family's old uncles Danny Glover and Gene Hackman made (Bat 21). Boy! That brings back a whole lot of memories! Also there was room for newcomers who dazzled us to frustrate us sometimes later Bruce Willis in (Die Hard), or dazzled us to frustrate us very  Steven Seagal in (Above the Law), or ones didn't dazzle us at all  Mark Harmon (The Presidio)!During 15 years after (Shaft - 1973) we didn't run into badass black action hero much. Eddie Murphy was a revival in (Beverly Hills Cop) but sorry, he was just Axel Foley (or Folly!). In1988 we had Sonny Spoon a TV show starring Mario Van Peebles. Yet, it was No Shaft either. Till Action Jackson came. Yes, (Carl Weathers) isn't one of the luckiest action heroes. But here he assured that he's one of the finest. And this movie itself makes us lucky to watch it. It's not the top of the top, but surely the top of the elite B-movies of the 1980s.It got the case's usual  The man's man police detective, inspector, lieutenant,.. whatever (did it ever really matter ?!!) + His cooperative or uncooperative, mostly black, chief + A relief of a sidekick (sometimes) + One violent totally crazy bad guy (every time !) + 2 sexy chicks (one dies, one stays; like all the Bond movies) + the action, the swearing, ALL the good old stereotypes and the must BIG finish = the good cop-in-mad-city movie; dirty Harry's next level; the modern maverick cowboy in the new wild west.You'd be so dumb if you waited for deep characterization, arguable moral choices, or serious issues (racism maybe!). As that's the ultimate blah in the great nonsense that these movies are. Frankly you won't read a book while being in a roller-coaster; however a few movie makers can make you do it. (Action Jackson)'s makers aren't ones of them, delivering pure brainless Hollywood fare and in above-average way.It is classic at being formulaic, episodic, and so HOT also. Wickedly it gives you no time to rest by making (or making up!) situation after another where the hero got to face a problem and hit some enemies anyway. Look at this series of unfortunate events and characters  a huge bodyguard, exploded flat, humans' cutters, noisy drug dealer, idiot police officers, jumping off a window, then threatening a girl by speeding a car to a wall, and ending this second act's sequence with  a sultry kiss! Do you want more? I know that I don't !(Weathers) not only got muscles but charisma and wit.

George Segal is a self-styled intellectual author who doesn't write well. He ekes out a living as a clerk in Doubleday's Book Store in New York. When he espies neighbor Barbra Streisand making love and accepting some cash in exchange, he calls the building superintendent. The super throws Streisand out and she invades -- that's the word -- invades Segal's shabby digs. She's a vulgar, would-be actress, model, and occasional girl for hire.She raises such a fuss in Segal's apartment that the super throws both of them out. Segal takes her to the apartment of a friend, Robert Klein, but their loud arguments and queer garb (don't ask) arouse and disturb Klein and he leaves the apartment. Segal winds up in the lethal embrace of the raptorous Streisand.They separate unamicably for a few weeks but the encounter has taught each of them something and they have another date at the apartment of Segal's rich fiancée, a pianist. She and her family happen to be in Boston, where the fiancée is giving a performance with the Boston Symphony. In the sybaritic apartment, Streisand produces some marijuana which the bookish Segal smokes on a dare and they end up in the bath tub together. The apartment doesn't remain empty of others for long.It's really a familiar story of two nutty, idiosyncratic, mismatched New Yorkers, each of whom teaches the other to overcome pretensions. But it's so slickly done, adapted by Buck Henry from somebody's play, that it succeeds in a wild and uneven fashion.I think it might help a viewer to be at least a little familiar with the geographic and chronological milieu. I mean -- this is New York City in the late 1960s. Times Square is filled with porno shops and sleazy clothing outlets and beggars. And there is the conflict of subcultures -- the bourgeois on the one hand (Segal) and the iconoclastic on the other (Streisand). The use of grass was a daring enterprise for the middle class.But you don't really need to have been there to enjoy the gags. They come thick and fast, both verbal and physical. I'll give an example. During their separation, Segal is passing a dirty movie theater in Times Square (this was pre-video tape) and notices that the movie playing -- the pornographic Cycle Sluts -- stars Streisand. Writhing with disgust and curiosity, Segal buys a ticket and as he's passing through the lobby, an attendant asks, Raincoat? Segal I don't have a raincoat. Attendant You want to RENT one? I don't particularly like Barbra Streisand's personality. She has an ego the size of Greenland. But she's phenomenal in this comic role and looks utterly pinchable too, despite that prominent proboscis. Segal is even better as the put-upon author who's work has been turned down by every publisher in New York. His role is the more difficult because he's basically the straight man, but he does wonders with it. Watch his expression when he's stoned and naked in the tub with Streisand and they hear the doors open and close as his fiancée and her family arrive unexpectedly. His face turns crimson. You're about to meet Miss Weyderhaus, he says with a mischievous smile, as if they were two kids about to be discovered playing hookey from the third grade.The movie collapses on itself in the last ten minutes or so, trying to turn serious, but only managing to achieve off-putting.

As was the case with the latter film, Grand Canyon is wonderfully done.Steve Martin is fabulous as Kline's friend, shot during a mugging and whose views on violent films temporarily changes only to revert back to the way of making money at any cost.
