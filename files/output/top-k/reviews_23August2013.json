And, I'm happy to report today that the memories of the anger and disappointment that I experienced that day has diminished enough now that I can provide a unbiased and objective review of this movie for what it was, instead of what I thought the movie ought to be. I can finally put behind me, once and for all, my first summer movie blockbuster disappointment that left me permanently cynical of the movie industry, and temporarily sunburned at a very early age.(I was 9 years old at the time)First, allow me to demonstrate just how far I've come since then by admitting that JAWS 2 was probably the best of the JAWS sequels. Which admittedly is like saying that a kick in the rear is a lot better than a punch in the face. Or, as in the case of JAWS 4, a hammer to the head for that matter. Not much of a compliment to heal the pains of yesteryear, but it's a start anyways.Unlike the future sequels, JAWS 2 at least started out promisingly enough by continuing the storyline of Chief Brody and his family. And, even made a decent attempt (early in the film) of recapturing a sense of terror from the unseen ocean depths that the original movie magnificently accomplished.However, JAWS 2 started going horribly wrong when the audience first sees the shark far too early in the movie. Maybe it was impossible for the sequel to recreate that first big scream moment when we first see the shark? But, to show the shark so early, without much build up either, leaves the audience feeling that this isn't the movie they paid to watch.This idea to show the shark so early proves to be such a major failure for the movie, that it makes you grateful (truly grateful) that the shark in the original JAWS broke down, forcing Spielberg to use the eye of the camera, and by proxy the imagination of the audience as the substitute for the actual shark. Big difference.Eventually, Chief Brody becomes the lone person attempting to prove that the mystery of the sudden strange deaths and disappearances on the island is the result of another giant shark in the area. Strangely, no one believes Brody that another giant shark is terrorizing the islanders again, and the town counsel becomes convinced that Brody is suffering from some type of giant great white PTSD, or something. Despite the fact that the island was terrorized by a giant great white just three years ago.The final resolution to the story eventually develops into a teenagers-in-jeopardy movie.

Is the shark just biding his time, cruelly toying with its intended victims until he makes his final move? What ever the case maybe, the sudden uncharacteristic behavior of the mass murdering giant shark towards the teenagers destroys any sense of suspense and intrigue for the audience.

","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"23 August 2013","score":"","review":" Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita was hugely controversial when first published in 1955. It was banned for a time in both Britain and France, although (rather surprisingly, given the often hysterical moral climate during the Eisenhower years) not in the United States. The reason is that the central character, Humbert Humbert, is not only a murderer but also a paedophile, sexually obsessed with girls between the ages of nine and fourteen or, as he calls them, 'nymphets'. He moves from Europe (he is French in the novel, British in the film) to Ramsdale, a small New England town, where he becomes infatuated with Dolores (Lolita), the young daughter of his widowed landlady, Charlotte Haze. After her mother's death in a road accident he seduces her, takes her out of school and sets off with her on a lengthy car journey around America. Given the controversy which the novel had aroused, it was a brave move on the part of Stanley Kubrick to adapt it for the screen only seven years later. Mind you, it would probably be an even braver move to adapt it today. The most common modern reaction to many books, films and popular songs which fell foul either of the censors or of conservative public opinion during the fifties is to ask What was all the fuss about?, but Lolita retains its power to shock even today. Adrian Lyne's 1997 film version was even more controversial than Kubrick's, and attitudes towards under-age sex have, if anything, hardened over the last sixteen years. As the Production Code was still in force in 1962, Kubrick had to agree to many changes to Nabokov's original story to make his film acceptable to the American censors. There is not enough space in this review to detail all these changes, but the overall effect was to make the story less sexually explicit and to make Humbert more sympathetic. In the film it is never expressly stated that Humbert and Lolita sleep together, although it is implied. In the book Lolita is only twelve when Humbert first meets her; in the film her age is never given, although she appears to be about sixteen. (Sue Lyon was fourteen when filming took place, but looked older). The weakest part of the book is the sub-plot involving Clare Quilty, Humbert's rival for Lolita's affections, who pursues them across America. For most of the book Quilty is a vague, shadowy presence, and when he- despite the feminine-sounding Christian name he is male- finally appears near the end he emerges as a bizarre and eccentric character whom I found it difficult to believe in. Quilty is given a much larger role in the film than in the book, but remains bizarre and eccentric, and Peter Sellers (as one might expect from that particular actor) does everything he can to accentuate this aspect of his character. The episode in which he pretends to be a German psychiatrist seems particularly out-of-place. Sellers, who was to give a far better performance for Kubrick two years later in Dr Strangelove, seemed to have a fetish about German psychiatrists; he was equally weird playing one in What's New, Pussycat?It is sometimes said that there are no great female parts in Kubrick, and certainly some of his films (notably Paths of Glory, Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket) are very male-dominated. Lolita, however, is the exception that proves the rule, as there are two great female performances, from Lyon and from Shelley Winters as Charlotte. Both work perfectly in the context of this particular interpretation of the novel. Lyon's Lolita, older than in the novel, has a sort of provocative innocence; that shot of her in her bikini on the lawn- the first time we see her- is unforgettable. Winters's blowsy, garrulous, sexually frustrated and emotionally incontinent widow is a lot more unpleasant than the Charlotte of the novel, who only seems unpleasant to Humbert himself. The character of Humbert is also changed. In the book he was in his mid- thirties, here he is considerably older. (James Mason was over 50). The film omits any reference to his lifelong obsession with nymphets and, indeed, makes virtually no reference to his life before his arrival in Ramsdale. Also omitted are many of Humbert's more despicable actions, such as the scene where he drugs Lolita with intent to rape her. Nabokov's unreliable narrator (the book is told by Humbert in the first person) is often a creepy, sinister individual whose attempts at self- justification never quite ring true. Mason's performance also works well in this interpretation, playing Humbert as a suave, debonair intellectual, a courtly gentleman of the Old World who is a fish out of water in the vulgar cultural wasteland of the New. (Kubrick was American by birth but spent most of his adult life in Britain and could be critical of his native country). Mason's Humbert is less a seedy sexual predator than a distinguished middle-aged man undone by a foolish infatuation with a much younger girl. The novel can be seen as a pervert's progress in which Humbert condemns himself out of his own mouth. The film is more of a classical tragedy in which Humbert is brought down by a flaw in his character. Lyne, by all accounts, was no great admirer of Kubrick's film and hoped that his own would be more faithful to the book. It is that, but it is also rather dull and pedestrian by comparison. The changes Kubrick made to the story may have been forced upon him by the demands of the censors, yet it is a tribute to his skill as a film-maker that his version, with the exception of some of the Quilty scenes, reads so fluently as a work of art in its own right. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 August 2013","score":"","review":" Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita was hugely controversial when first published in 1955.

Nabokov's unreliable narrator (the book is told by Humbert in the first person) is often a creepy, sinister individual whose attempts at self- justification never quite ring true. Mason's performance also works well in this interpretation, playing Humbert as a suave, debonair intellectual, a courtly gentleman of the Old World who is a fish out of water in the vulgar cultural wasteland of the New. (Kubrick was American by birth but spent most of his adult life in Britain and could be critical of his native country). Mason's Humbert is less a seedy sexual predator than a distinguished middle-aged man undone by a foolish infatuation with a much younger girl. The novel can be seen as a pervert's progress in which Humbert condemns himself out of his own mouth. The film is more of a classical tragedy in which Humbert is brought down by a flaw in his character. Lyne, by all accounts, was no great admirer of Kubrick's film and hoped that his own would be more faithful to the book. It is that, but it is also rather dull and pedestrian by comparison. The changes Kubrick made to the story may have been forced upon him by the demands of the censors, yet it is a tribute to his skill as a film-maker that his version, with the exception of some of the Quilty scenes, reads so fluently as a work of art in its own right. 8\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"23 August 2013","score":"","review":" Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita was hugely controversial when first published in 1955. It was banned for a time in both Britain and France, although (rather surprisingly, given the often hysterical moral climate during the Eisenhower years) not in the United States. The reason is that the central character, Humbert Humbert, is not only a murderer but also a paedophile, sexually obsessed with girls between the ages of nine and fourteen or, as he calls them, 'nymphets'. He moves from Europe (he is French in the novel, British in the film) to Ramsdale, a small New England town, where he becomes infatuated with Dolores (Lolita), the young daughter of his widowed landlady, Charlotte Haze. After her mother's death in a road accident he seduces her, takes her out of school and sets off with her on a lengthy car journey around America. Given the controversy which the novel had aroused, it was a brave move on the part of Stanley Kubrick to adapt it for the screen only seven years later. Mind you, it would probably be an even braver move to adapt it today. The most common modern reaction to many books, films and popular songs which fell foul either of the censors or of conservative public opinion during the fifties is to ask What was all the fuss about?, but Lolita retains its power to shock even today. Adrian Lyne's 1997 film version was even more controversial than Kubrick's, and attitudes towards under-age sex have, if anything, hardened over the last sixteen years. As the Production Code was still in force in 1962, Kubrick had to agree to many changes to Nabokov's original story to make his film acceptable to the American censors. There is not enough space in this review to detail all these changes, but the overall effect was to make the story less sexually explicit and to make Humbert more sympathetic. In the film it is never expressly stated that Humbert and Lolita sleep together, although it is implied. In the book Lolita is only twelve when Humbert first meets her; in the film her age is never given, although she appears to be about sixteen. (Sue Lyon was fourteen when filming took place, but looked older). The weakest part of the book is the sub-plot involving Clare Quilty, Humbert's rival for Lolita's affections, who pursues them across America. For most of the book Quilty is a vague, shadowy presence, and when he- despite the feminine-sounding Christian name he is male- finally appears near the end he emerges as a bizarre and eccentric character whom I found it difficult to believe in. Quilty is given a much larger role in the film than in the book, but remains bizarre and eccentric, and Peter Sellers (as one might expect from that particular actor) does everything he can to accentuate this aspect of his character. The episode in which he pretends to be a German psychiatrist seems particularly out-of-place. Sellers, who was to give a far better performance for Kubrick two years later in Dr Strangelove, seemed to have a fetish about German psychiatrists; he was equally weird playing one in What's New, Pussycat?It is sometimes said that there are no great female parts in Kubrick, and certainly some of his films (notably Paths of Glory, Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket) are very male-dominated. Lolita, however, is the exception that proves the rule, as there are two great female performances, from Lyon and from Shelley Winters as Charlotte. Both work perfectly in the context of this particular interpretation of the novel. Lyon's Lolita, older than in the novel, has a sort of provocative innocence; that shot of her in her bikini on the lawn- the first time we see her- is unforgettable. Winters's blowsy, garrulous, sexually frustrated and emotionally incontinent widow is a lot more unpleasant than the Charlotte of the novel, who only seems unpleasant to Humbert himself. The character of Humbert is also changed. In the book he was in his mid- thirties, here he is considerably older. (James Mason was over 50). The film omits any reference to his lifelong obsession with nymphets and, indeed, makes virtually no reference to his life before his arrival in Ramsdale. Also omitted are many of Humbert's more despicable actions, such as the scene where he drugs Lolita with intent to rape her. Nabokov's unreliable narrator (the book is told by Humbert in the first person) is often a creepy, sinister individual whose attempts at self- justification never quite ring true.

I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well.The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

How can anyone not love this movie? It is easy to see why it did so well, why its considered a cult comedy classic and why it launched an unlikely comedic career for Schwarzenegger. Of course the film isn't brilliant...it is what it is. It is meant to be fun and sweet and funny and it nails everything that it tries to be. If you go in expecting some sort of feat of cinematic brilliance then you will be disappointed.

His action is timeless but his comedy proves how big his personality and on screen charisma is. He is adorable, endearing and very nearly brilliant as the perfect physical specimen who is as naive as they come. He almost immediately makes you love him and its truly a great performance. Danny Devito was the perfect match for him. They are twins like you would not believe...and you won't believe it. Their chemistry together is near perfect and absolutely makes this film what it is.

Although they play in different leagues, both screenplays bear interesting similarities through the implicit statements they make about the limits of the American Dream and the ideals that supposedly forged it. Indeed, no matter how charismatic they are, there's something rotten in a country that allows such figures as Michael Corleone and Bill McKay to succeed.My judgment might be severe but it's a credit to Robert Redford's extraordinary performance. Sometimes, we're put in the electors' shoes and see him like a handsome and idealistic patriot, eager to raise the voice of American social outcasts and sometimes we remember, as parts of the sideshow, that these are the very reasons he was picked by his friend, Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle) to represent the Democrat party despite his blatant lack of experience. And what's the catch for McKay? The film reveals its cynical and interesting premise when Boyle writes in a matchbox his only guarantee you will lose. The point of his candidature is not to undermine a Democrat potential leader's career and yet provide a realistic opponent to the Republican, the much popular Crocker Jarmon. The certitude of the defeat is compensated by a symbolical victory McKay has all freedom to spread his values, share his vision and gain some publicity. Seems like a win-win situation.McKay accepts, not without reluctance and more driven by the surrounding enthusiasm, starting with his wife who enjoys her new 'first lady' etiquette. But there's something we know about the American political machine, once you put your foot in, there's no way getting back. And the irony with McKay is that his political carelessness and lack of true ambitious will catch the eyes and ears of Democrats, by inspiring a more genuine and less generic form of political expression, precisely what the public needed. The Candidate brilliantly points out the effect of good merchandising in politics. Like a product, McKay has the looks, the message &#x85; and also, the brand.The name is in fact the film's subplot, involving McKay's father, a not-so popular veteran politician played by Melvyn Douglas. The reporters notice that the father never endorses his son's candidature, but McKay pretends it's a way to assess his independence. However, after a severe drop in polls that would have foreshadowed a total humiliation, McKay wins a debate against Jarmon at the last minute thanks to a genuine reaction rejecting the hypocritical aspect of a confrontation that dodged the real issues. Jarmon is upset, McKay wins, then McKay Sr. blesses him with the greatest compliment he could ever give him son, you're a politician.Jeremy Larner, who was a speech writer for the Democrat Eugene McCarthy and then can be trusted in terms of accuracy, wrote the script.

Still, what a relief when we finally 'get' him! I remember a few years ago, my first intended immersion into Fellini's universe was through his groundbreaking 8½. As a result, I waited one year and half before giving a second chance to Fellini. This is how disappointed I was, maybe less by the film than by my inability to claim that Fellini was an avant-garde genius. I guess I dived too brutally in cold water, while I should have approached it step by step. I started then with his neo-realist period, and after Nights of Cabiria and La Strada, my heart was conquered and the rest of his oeuvre, including 8½, confirmed my feelings that Fellini was on the field of emotions what Ingmar Bergman was on human psychology, essential to Cinema and complementary like libido and psyche for humans. And through the most libidinous Satyricon, Fellini signs the most defining of all his films. And defining is the right word, because from our perspective, it means that Fellini's detractors would certainly pick Satyricon as a proof of Fellini's self-importance, while his adulators will consecrate it as the quintessential artistic expression of a genius, who was the mirror of human's most pervert yet fascinating sides. But let me be the devil's advocate, when talent can allow such magnificent deviations, it can afford pretentiousness, which in Fellini's case, is never a posture, but a risk-taking dynamic tunneling us into our most repressed sensations. Still, all through Satyricon, I kept wondering how much time I would have waited before giving the 'second chance' had I seen it first. The film is a hyperbolic depiction of whatever Fellini stood for, a universe made of freaks, weird, funny-looking characters, debauchery, boredom, sexuality, amorality, poetry, blood, gluttony, feast and fantasy, as nonsensical and unsettling as they could get in the mind of the most twisted of us all. But it takes Fellini's genius to transcend the inner ugliness of humans and make such a cinematically significant movie. As I said for La Dolce Vita, the morally worst can bring the aesthetically best.Satirycon was loosely based on a poem from Petronius, a writer who lived under the reign of the lunatic Emperor Nero. The poem, discovered a few centuries ago, was made of disjointed fragments, the perfect format for the director who, since La Dolce Vita and before Amarcord cherished movies' structure made of independent little vignettes. The Fellinian experience is like a trip in a dream-like universe, when episodes don't need a connection to have relevance, where characters are defined by their mythological, mystical and sometimes physical attributes rather than any psychological notions or plot devices. And like a perfect dream-like escapism, the dazzling cinematography made of purple skies and splendid combinations of lights and shadows, reinvents the settings of Antic Roma in its most decadent days, before Christianity would set a new tone, when lifestyle was made of weird and bizarre distractions meant to conceal life's suffocating boredom. The film is made of one stunning sequence after another, and will probably be most remembered for the unforgettable orgy in Trimalchione's house, a sort of trip in an Antic world that never seemed as modern. And we hypnotically follow him as if we sensed a cathartic effect in this orgy of excesses, succumbing to devilish voyeurism to better expiate from our lowest impulses, just as Peckinpah's use of excessive violence in The Wild Bunch. Satyricon is a journey in a world where normality is meaningless, where beauty is asexual, and sex is ugly, but both so appealing. A world where everything is corrupted and even poetry is traded for honors, food and fun. Satyricon is moral corruption is like a form of salvation as if it extrapolated Fellini's own impulses, own desire to dare such shots for the sake of digression. And it works because Fellini is pretentious but not self-important, his excesses create a coherence that makes the calmer and ordinary moments more awkward. Two men marry together, a beautiful black woman ignites fire from her vagina, a slave has his hand cut-off to entertain a hysterical audience in a theater, and we have no choice but to plunge in the lowest parts of humanity, like the abysmal depths of Pompeii before its imminent explosion.Satirycon is beyond any explanations, and a real challenge for criticism. It is an Odyssey in a Roma that probably never existed, but had all the predispositions to allow Fellini to project his inner demons and most pervert fantasies into it, the universe created is unsettling but had it tried to be normal, it would have been a disaster just like Visconti 's The Damned, released the same year. The film was as bizarre, as unsettling, but its realistic setting made the experience confusing by trying to battle in too many fronts of our perceptions. What a year for filmmaking anyway, released in the summer of love, Satyricon is the exaltation of freedom, it embraces the total zaniness of its project and therefore belongs to the category of 'films victims of their own greatness'. I used the same terms for Stanley Kubrick's A Space Odyssey and John Cassavetes' Husbands, the movies convey the very feelings that inhabit the director's heart, illustrating in the form the point made by the content and transmitting it to the audience, at a time where cinematic creativity was at its peak. Watching Satyricon made me regret the crowd-pleasing aspect of today's cinema. And Fellini didn't give a damn about pleasing crowds as a true author, he created immortal classics. Not that I'm planning to watch the film again, not that I believe it's a masterpiece, but it's a film of guts, of images and entertainment, sitting majestically on the throne of its ugliness, above our boring prudishness.

The film is a hyperbolic depiction of whatever Fellini stood for, a universe made of freaks, weird, funny-looking characters, debauchery, boredom, sexuality, amorality, poetry, blood, gluttony, feast and fantasy, as nonsensical and unsettling as they could get in the mind of the most twisted of us all. But it takes Fellini's genius to transcend the inner ugliness of humans and make such a cinematically significant movie. As I said for La Dolce Vita, the morally worst can bring the aesthetically best.Satirycon was loosely based on a poem from Petronius, a writer who lived under the reign of the lunatic Emperor Nero. The poem, discovered a few centuries ago, was made of disjointed fragments, the perfect format for the director who, since La Dolce Vita and before Amarcord cherished movies' structure made of independent little vignettes. The Fellinian experience is like a trip in a dream-like universe, when episodes don't need a connection to have relevance, where characters are defined by their mythological, mystical and sometimes physical attributes rather than any psychological notions or plot devices. And like a perfect dream-like escapism, the dazzling cinematography made of purple skies and splendid combinations of lights and shadows, reinvents the settings of Antic Roma in its most decadent days, before Christianity would set a new tone, when lifestyle was made of weird and bizarre distractions meant to conceal life's suffocating boredom. The film is made of one stunning sequence after another, and will probably be most remembered for the unforgettable orgy in Trimalchione's house, a sort of trip in an Antic world that never seemed as modern. And we hypnotically follow him as if we sensed a cathartic effect in this orgy of excesses, succumbing to devilish voyeurism to better expiate from our lowest impulses, just as Peckinpah's use of excessive violence in The Wild Bunch. Satyricon is a journey in a world where normality is meaningless, where beauty is asexual, and sex is ugly, but both so appealing. A world where everything is corrupted and even poetry is traded for honors, food and fun. Satyricon is moral corruption is like a form of salvation as if it extrapolated Fellini's own impulses, own desire to dare such shots for the sake of digression. And it works because Fellini is pretentious but not self-important, his excesses create a coherence that makes the calmer and ordinary moments more awkward. Two men marry together, a beautiful black woman ignites fire from her vagina, a slave has his hand cut-off to entertain a hysterical audience in a theater, and we have no choice but to plunge in the lowest parts of humanity, like the abysmal depths of Pompeii before its imminent explosion.Satirycon is beyond any explanations, and a real challenge for criticism. It is an Odyssey in a Roma that probably never existed, but had all the predispositions to allow Fellini to project his inner demons and most pervert fantasies into it, the universe created is unsettling but had it tried to be normal, it would have been a disaster just like Visconti 's The Damned, released the same year. The film was as bizarre, as unsettling, but its realistic setting made the experience confusing by trying to battle in too many fronts of our perceptions. What a year for filmmaking anyway, released in the summer of love, Satyricon is the exaltation of freedom, it embraces the total zaniness of its project and therefore belongs to the category of 'films victims of their own greatness'. I used the same terms for Stanley Kubrick's A Space Odyssey and John Cassavetes' Husbands, the movies convey the very feelings that inhabit the director's heart, illustrating in the form the point made by the content and transmitting it to the audience, at a time where cinematic creativity was at its peak. Watching Satyricon made me regret the crowd-pleasing aspect of today's cinema. And Fellini didn't give a damn about pleasing crowds as a true author, he created immortal classics. Not that I'm planning to watch the film again, not that I believe it's a masterpiece, but it's a film of guts, of images and entertainment, sitting majestically on the throne of its ugliness, above our boring prudishness.

Still, what a relief when we finally 'get' him! I remember a few years ago, my first intended immersion into Fellini's universe was through his groundbreaking 8½. As a result, I waited one year and half before giving a second chance to Fellini. This is how disappointed I was, maybe less by the film than by my inability to claim that Fellini was an avant-garde genius. I guess I dived too brutally in cold water, while I should have approached it step by step. I started then with his neo-realist period, and after Nights of Cabiria and La Strada, my heart was conquered and the rest of his oeuvre, including 8½, confirmed my feelings that Fellini was on the field of emotions what Ingmar Bergman was on human psychology, essential to Cinema and complementary like libido and psyche for humans. And through the most libidinous Satyricon, Fellini signs the most defining of all his films. And defining is the right word, because from our perspective, it means that Fellini's detractors would certainly pick Satyricon as a proof of Fellini's self-importance, while his adulators will consecrate it as the quintessential artistic expression of a genius, who was the mirror of human's most pervert yet fascinating sides. But let me be the devil's advocate, when talent can allow such magnificent deviations, it can afford pretentiousness, which in Fellini's case, is never a posture, but a risk-taking dynamic tunneling us into our most repressed sensations.

Even at this age you could see her natural beauty and ability as an actor.The acting was awesome and the plot was well laid out, but I found several parts of the movie which weren't believable. I won't bother with them here, but you can see from my score that these scenes brought the movie down a few notches for me.I definitely would recommend this movie in HD or even 3D with a mega, killer sound system.

The plot is well known and the style - the same. But the movie succeeded in carrying you into his idea and to make you ask yourself which protagonist of its are you or which protagonist I am in life.Even we can generalize the moments in the movie to the total moments which the producer and the script-writer are showing recently. Here we speak about the people who stay with us, who helps us get up when we fall, with who we live easily or even we love. More, the movie shows the inability to tore with our past, not to be the therefore in the concluding, to change our life when we are grown ups. Or shows the derail of the present into the unknown future.So, this film is good but it is a modified version of other Allen's pieces of art. Made a little like a documentary and on moments like a staging.http\/\/vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"23 August 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" My rating for this movie is high when I mean the shooting and the hardening interests of Woody.
