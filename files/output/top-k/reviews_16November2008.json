Most, however, speak to trooper served simply, with a slight dusting of salt if available, and as fresh as can be. --From Recipes for the Ravenous, from Ribald Rangers to Raw Recruits With the exception of the last 10 minutes, Ravenous is a fine movie, full of revoltingly intelligent horror, with a disgustingly vivid storyline and nauseatingly moist close-ups. It's one of the best-photographed movies I've seen in a long time, and not just because of the entrails and caked blood. The movie looks cold to the bone, even inside the snow-laden huts and buildings that make up isolated Fort Spencer. The director, Antonia Bird, gives us strong story telling. The horror and the prospects of what we'll see are matched with restrained plotting and persuasive acting. The situation is outlandish and we can't help but smile at how cleverly Bird serves it up on a plate for us. At the same time, what happens to the characters isn't funny at all. It's Grand Guignol in the snow. The movie is set in the late 1840's, high in the California Sierra Nevada mountains. Fort Spencer is a small outpost, with only eight men. Three are important to us. The rest are important for other reasons. There's Captain Boyd (Guy Pearce), who was a coward in the Mexican-American War. He wound up in a pile of corpses, their blood tricking into his mouth, but eventually did a heroic deed. He was awarded a medal and then promptly sent to the isolated Fort Spencer. There's Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), the commanding officer of the detachment's seven men. And there is the ragged man (Robert Carlyle) who, one frigid night, nearly out of his mind and nearly dead of the cold, staggers to the fort. He says he is F. W. Colqhoun. He has quite a tale to tell. Part of it is true. The other part? Think of an old Indian legend that when one dines on another person, one gathers in that other person's strength. A bite of liver, a chew of thigh will set up a man for days with good humor and virility...heals wounds and cures sickness, too. Whether California will be populated by settlers and gold prospectors or by military cannibals depends on a coward who is trying to fight his inclinations. That brings us to the showdown battle between two men who, having dined recently, have great strength. It's a battle that is loaded with big-fight, gruesome clichés. The movie is so sly and original that it's a shame it is stuck with a climax that is so predictably groan-slash-slice-stab-squirt. The final scene, involving a general and a pot of stew, seemed to me to be just a cheap final laugh. It made pointless Colonel Hart's integrity and Captain Boyd's bravery. It undercut the reason for the two men's final actions. Robert Carlyle chews the snowy scenery but he's a fine actor. Guy Pearce has the tough job of being a frightened coward, yet brave and honorable when it comes down to it. Jeffrey Jones' as Colonel Hart gives the most intriguing performance, in my view. Hart looks like a disintegrating, heavy-set buffoon when we first meet him. He turns out to be a competent, thoughtful, well-educated officer who knows his men, knows himself and knows his job. And he knows the horror he's become. Jones gives a dramatic, ironic, likable performance. Ravenous is a first-class movie with a second-class ending.

A well-done serial murderer story? Yet they do come along from time to time. This one isn't as innovative as Seven, not as well observed, but it's still above average.The killer, the affable Danny Glover, arranges to take the hitch-hiking, unwitting Jared Leto on a trip through the Colorado mountains in the middle of winter. Glover, whose identity is unknown to any social control agents, is being pursued by a local police department, R. Lee Ermey in charge, and a loose cannon FBI agent, Dennis Quaid, whose son Glover has kidnapped and stashed away somewhere.Half the film has Glover driving his white El Dorado, festooned with pics of Playmates of the Month, through a convincingly snowy landscape. The other half deals with the reluctant cooperation between Ermey and Quaid. Ermey finally decides to throw the law books out the window and join Quaid in his personal quest. The climax brings Glover, Leto, and Quaid together in the caboose of a freight train plowing its way through a mountain pass and turns the movie into what is more or less a formulaic bang up.Two things contribute to the quality of the film. One is the location shooting. Everything looks cold, bare, gloomy, and windswept. The landscape seems to be hibernating and waiting for spring. The other thing is Danny Glover's performance as the serial killer. He's great. A Scatman Crothers whose big grin and avuncular manner barely manage to mask the vicious psychopath beneath. Glover's character has worked these mountain passes for the railroad before. Everyone in the small towns along the route and on the job seem to know and love him -- and he's a black guy too. It says volumes about our national change in attitude that someone was willing to cast an African-American actor as a charming murderer of white people, and Glover justifies the risk that was taken.Quaid is stolid, stuck in the humorless role of the anxious but determined father. Jared Leto can't really act at all. And there are clichés in abundance. The car that rolls off the road and hangs on the edge of a cliff while its occupants try to crawl out of the wreck. It's held up by a single tree, which cracks and allows the vehicle to plunge into the valley, while Leto hangs onto some projecting roots by his fingertips.But it's Danny Glover who redeems the film. At the start, we only see him as an amiable guy, and only gradually do we come to suspect his identity as the killer. The first time he uses his knife, the victim is an old friend with whom he has shared his childhood. It's a truly chilling scene. Glover's friendly smile fades into a scowl while the puzzled victim simply stares back at him. Then there is Glover's death. He's knocked from a speeding train and does a series of somersaults down a snowy slope, yipping and yelling along the way, like Major Kong riding the catastrophic bomb in Doctor Strangelove. What a job he does.At heart, it's just another serial killer story but -- here we must all get on our knees and thank heaven for small favors -- the killer doesn't leave puzzling clues behind based on Alice in Wonderland or The Seven Deadly Sins or the first folio of Billy Shakespeare's works or the seven levels of Inuit hell. There's only one teasing clue, and it doesn't require a trip to the library to solve it. There's really very little gore, and no violence except for a few minutes at the end.You'll probably like it.

It tries to put way too much into the movie and its filled with many different supernatural things and elements. It's a bit incoherent and you can often wonder what the one thing has to do with the other. This is also because a lot of things within this movie remain unexplained.

Yet, such movies usually lead us to a dilemma of high expectations and the subjective reactions after first viewing.When I decided to see PSYCHO for the first time, I was surprised with one feature that from the very beginning and throughout the whole movie caught my attention intellectual authenticity. That concerns all aspects from performances to soundtrack and script. Since PSYCHO by master director Alfred Hitchcock was released almost 50 years ago and has already experienced the test of time, we could well expect this movie to occur dated due to its black and white nature and allegedly old fashioned acting. However, what appears to all viewers is just the opposite. The movie still impresses as a clever story, still shocks as a horror, still stuns with its cinematography and soundtrack as a work of art.Who can possibly ignore the flawless thrill in various moments of the film that remain in memory for long, moments of stunning cinematography, marvelous lighting that make black and white more attractive than lots of top visual effects? Except for the famous shower-murder scene that combines gore with sexuality and thrill with empathy, there are really breathtaking moments that lead the viewer to the extent of orgasmic trance of mind. Consider for instance, Marion (Janet Leigh) driving a car and her thoughts of various sorts. Another moment worth attention is Marion - Norman conversation...someone would perhaps ask what's brilliant about it? Everything! It is simply the moment of mental power that I have hardly found elsewhere, you, as if (of course illusively) get into the mind and perception of this man, into his peculiar hobby, into his very island of divided self. The shot of Norman's house with cloudy sky in the background makes an enormous effect. And here, it's a must to mention the marvelous scene of Lilah (Vera Miles), Marion's sister approaching the house... How wonderfully filmed, what a soundtrack, what a power of illusion and bliss of thrill! Nowadays, one can only imagine how innovative and convincing the film must have been in 1960...The performances in the film are sublime. I find all of the acting remarkable but if I were to choose the three most memorable ones, I'd say Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles\/Janet Leigh and Martin Balsam. I know that this choice may seem inaccurate to some readers but that is my personal opinion. Perkins gives a masterwork of performance embodying a character of true psychological contradictions that we find later, as we get to know him better. Naturally, psychology is hidden, innate and far from being discovered as easily as looks. Perkins had a very difficult task in this film, some of the hardest ones ever, but he crafted it perfectly, including his final scene... Perhaps you wonder why I have combined Vera Miles and Janet Leigh together but it was done deliberately. The two portray sisters and occur to me as true sisters of the same authentic depiction of fear, of curiosity, of sexual appeal. There could not be a better choice for these roles than the two. Finally, Martin Balsam as private detective Arbogast is brilliant focusing on strong personality ready to cope with suspicion and terror. His scene with Norman is unforgettable with this truly accurate wordiness of investigation.But I feel that the gist of why PSYCHO was such a blockbuster and has been popular for all these years is neither its artistic side including performances, cinematography, soundtrack, nor even the direction. Its key of success lies in the fact that it is a horror of a psyche set partly within the psyche. It is not a series of shocking scenes with monsters, ghosts or imaginary creatures but the film rooted in the very riddle of human mind, distorted as it may seem yet pretty universal. The scenes we get near the end of the film, perhaps seem hardly real as if not of this world but after longer inspection, it appears they all make a perfect sense. Therefore, the reason for its authenticity is foremost the movie's psychological aspect memorably presented. Strange numbers add to the mystery of all and the atmosphere works for the rest.All in all, PSYCHO is an unforgettable film, a pearl in the genre and a true model for many modern thrillers that turn either to kitsch or to cheap entertainment. Hitchcock's film is an example of how cinema can entertain, shock, provoke and also educate a bit. If you're looking for your island of escape from decadent and meaningless effects in modern horrors, go to something original and see PSYCHO, a superior thriller of mind.

Spielberg did a great job in telling the horrific stories of illegal slave trading, just what it must be like to not be treated as a human, but nothing more than property and like an animal. Djimon Hounsou, I can't believe this guy was not nominated for an Oscar, he was just incredible in this film and delivered his lines so beautifully. This was a very sad but important story to tell and I felt that no one else could have told it better than Steven Spielberg.On an illegal slave trade, all the African slaves escape and slaughter the sails men brutally, the slaves are captured though and brought back to America to be put on trial for murder. Baldwin, their lawyer is fighting their innocence while their leader, Cinque, tells their horrific story of their trade and how the men that kidnapped them brutally beat and killed some of them. In a country where almost half the population are slave owners and white, this seems like the trial of the century and hopefully with the help of an ex president, John Quincy Adams by their side, they will be free to go home again.I highly recommend Amistad if you get the chance to see it, I honestly don't see how others cannot appreciate this story.

But Anthony and Djimon truly take the show, especially in their first scene together where Cinque is explaining how he will have his ancestors with him by his side at the trial.

Fortunately for the prosecutors at Nuremberg and for history the Nazis being the anal retentives that they were, made these incredibly meticulous records which scholars and historians have sifted through and we have the whole thing incredibly documented by the perpetrator's own hand. With a fifty year perspective now and the very existence of the state of Israel questioned by those who ought to know better, Steven Spielberg has given us a work for the ages.If you can sit through two incredibly long and sorrowful films one ought to see Schindler's List back to back with The Diary Of Anne Frank. In the latter film, we see a very ordinary group of people fighting for survival to escape the fate of what we see happened to so many. The fact they were days from possible liberation makes the sorrow of that film all the more poignant.Schindler's List is a story of escape from the ultimate fate of six million. Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson is a German businessman who sees a chance at some nice war profits using some incredibly cheap labor from the concentration camps. He's willing to start a factory in occupied Poland with slave labor Jews. Towards that end he hears of a man who ran a factory among the Jews in the newly formed Cracow ghetto, Itzak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Kingsley agrees to work for him and with him recruiting the labor force, Neeson gets his factory going. With that comes responsibility for these people. He fights for them, the original ones and some added to his growing work force. Over the over 3 hour film, Neeson gradually changes and his concern for his charges becomes humanitarian. He plays a dangerous game, especially with concentration camp commandant Ralph Fiennes. A man who delights in the total power he's been handed and the liberation from all civilized restraints to exercise barbarism, arbitrary and capricious. Fiennes will chill you with his penultimate portrayal of a perfect Nazi.Let us not forget that Schindler himself was a Nazi. He did in fact in the end go broke in paying out bribes for special consideration for his charges that meant their very lives. It's also possible that he saw the way the war would end and that those responsible for the Holocaust would be held accountable. Some have speculated that he did this for no other reason than to bank credit with possible witnesses. If that was the case it certainly worked because he was investigated and not charged with any war crimes.Still I'd prefer to believe the testimony of those on the scene including the real life Itzak Stern. Those are the folks that ought to know.Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. It deserved every honor it got and I only wish Neeson and Fiennes were winners as well.It's a film about the Holocaust, but it's also a film about the results of dehumanization of a people and when the state completes the process of dehumanization what can be the result. I'm not sure what future work Steven Spielberg has planned, but he can't top this no way, no how.

It is an entertaining film which helped build up Bruce Lee's reputation in the West, and sadly, gave us Chuck Norris as an actor.The plot for the film is thin. Restuarantour, Chen Ching Hua (Nora Miao), was suffering trouble with local gangsters in Rome, who want to buy her restaurant and use the land. They force business away and intimate the owners. She writes to her uncle who sends martial artist and Kung Fu expert Taug Lung (Bruce Lee), which she was surprised about. The workers of the restaurant also trained themselves up in karate. The gangsters try and take control of the restaurant, and each time Bruce Lee beating the living days out of them. This lead to the gangsters to hiring on of the best fighters from America, Colt (Chuck Norris), which lead to the two fighters having a epic fight in the Colosseum.I say the plot is thin, but you do not watch martial arts films because you want to see action and top-notch fighting, and you get a lot of it in this film. Bruce Lee is on the top of his game and its great watching the man at work. The fight with Chuck Norris is especially good. However, if you put any ideas of logic to the plot then it would fall like a house of cards, such as why didn't the gangsters just go in with guns and kill them all or why not all the gangsters and fighters attack Taug Lung at the same time, or bomb or touch the café? As well, why when the film is set in Italy, why does everyone speak Cantonist or English and not Italian? They was also a very camp gangster in this film which by modern standards might be considered homophobic. But at least some credit should be given to Bruce Lee, because before Bruce Lee became a massive influence on Hong Kong cinema, films were just mindless action and swordplay. Bruce Lee at least gave it story and structure.Bruce Lee was also the director of the film and he does a good job at it. The fights were really well done, and he is a perfectionist. As well, its nice to see a fight scene where you can see the action and fighting, compared to the second two Bourne films and Quantum of Solace (which I liked). It goods out-skool film-making. As well, I like during the scene in Colossum where the shot cut from the fight to the cats watching, especially with Bruce Lee's famous scream. If you like you martial arts films, even if you only watch the modern ones, you will be happy. As well, you get to see Bruce Lee using Nunchakus, which is always fun to see.As well the film is more comical then I expected, especially at the beginning. I assume its deliberate. It is basically a fish out of water situation and the fact that Taug Lung can't communicate with the locals. He is also a slightly native character at the beginning who grows as the film continues. As well you get a little of Bruce Lee's philosophies and some old Chinese sayings in the film. Taug Lung is also a man on a mission and does it out of loyalty; he doesn't leave his friends and will do anything for them.Finally, the film was rated 18 in the UK, but I feel if it was made now it would be a 15.Basically, a good film, a worthy 4 out of 5.

Then there's Little John, the goofily camp sidekick to Robin. Sir Hiss is the camp, oleaginous lackey to Prince John; and the Sheriff of Nottingham is a delightful bastard who skips down the street as he does his evil deeds (i.e. is camp).But none are as camp as the most ravishingly evil bastard of all, Prince John. He's more camp than a campervan full of camp campanologists on a camping trip in Campbelltown. He is also outrageously effeminate, what with him being a lion and not having a mane (kind of equivalent to a human male with flowing locks of perfect golden hair - and a big pink ribbon in it). On top of that he has some serious mum issues. Now, I'm not saying it's definitely true, but a certain complex with a certain Greek name does come to mind...Vive la creepiness!Lion? Mane? Yes. The characters in 'Robin Hood' are all anthropomorphic animals, with fox-men who walk upright and wear clothes and stuff, and all 20 years before Furry fandom came along, too.Yes indeed, 'Robin Hood' was a pioneering film in many ways. For one thing, it was the first Disney film made with no input whatsoever from Disney himself (what with him being dead and all). On top of that, you'll see characters moonwalking during the opening credits - over a decade before 'Thriller'.Now, no film is perfect, so there must come a time when I point out what's wrong with even the best of films.In the case of 'Robin Hood', it's bad animation. Or at least, bad by Disneys' usual high standards. It's my understanding that the budget for this film was smaller than usual (presumably the folks at Disney had just received old Walts' freezing bill), which would explain it. But it really isn't much to complain about.Then there's Friar Tuck - he's a badger... apparently. It's just as well this was pointed out at the start, because he doesn't look like one. He could pass for a mole or a even a raccoon at a pinch, but not a badger. Had the artists even _seen_ a badger before?And finally, at the end we see King Richard (a lion *with* a mane). The problem? I just didn't like him. He was only on the screen for a few seconds, but he came pretty close to ruining the whole finale. Which in itself deserves respect, I suppose...But these are minor gripes in a film that otherwise had me laughing out loud and slapping my knee.So overall, 'Robin Hood' is pure fun, and stands as a very un-Disney-esquire Disney film.

They find send a strange print found at one of the crime scenes and it is sent to the Department of Agriculture. Doctor Harold Medford and his daughter Doctor Patricia Medford arrive and ask to be taken to the scene of some of the disappearances. When they get there they are shocked to find gigantic ants, whose mutations were caused by the first atomic bomb explosion nine years earlier. They manage to destroy the nest of ants, but not before two winged queen ants and a couple of drones have hatched and escaped the nest. Now it is a race against time to find the two queen ants before they can establish more nests and hatch more queens.I believe that Them is a film to be watched by any film lover, this is a true classic in it's own right. I'm really falling in love with these old sci-fi films, the story, the effects, the history, the actors, they're a lot of fun to watch. Them is now in my top fav's, the scariest scene was without a doubt when you see those little boys trapped in the cave with the queen ants, I couldn't imagine the fear they were experiencing. This was a very fun film to watch and I'm looking forward to my next sci fi film, but Them is going to be tough to beat on the scares.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 November 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ah, my next on list of big 50's sci fi films, Them!

Them has a great story and is one of the best scary bug films you'll ever see.After several people in the New Mexico desert wind up missing or dead, including an F.B.I. agent and most of his family, police Sgt. Ben Peterson teams up with F.B.I. agent Bob Graham to find out what's causing the strange occurrences. They find send a strange print found at one of the crime scenes and it is sent to the Department of Agriculture. Doctor Harold Medford and his daughter Doctor Patricia Medford arrive and ask to be taken to the scene of some of the disappearances. When they get there they are shocked to find gigantic ants, whose mutations were caused by the first atomic bomb explosion nine years earlier. They manage to destroy the nest of ants, but not before two winged queen ants and a couple of drones have hatched and escaped the nest. Now it is a race against time to find the two queen ants before they can establish more nests and hatch more queens.I believe that Them is a film to be watched by any film lover, this is a true classic in it's own right. I'm really falling in love with these old sci-fi films, the story, the effects, the history, the actors, they're a lot of fun to watch. Them is now in my top fav's, the scariest scene was without a doubt when you see those little boys trapped in the cave with the queen ants, I couldn't imagine the fear they were experiencing. This was a very fun film to watch and I'm looking forward to my next sci fi film, but Them is going to be tough to beat on the scares.8\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 November 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ah, my next on list of big 50's sci fi films, Them! This is a film that my parents were crazy about it and always wanted me to watch this classic. But of course when you're a kid, naturally you don't find many black and white films that appealing. I always thought this was going to be a lame film, but like I said, I'm on a goal to see the big sci fi films of the 1950's and I'm glad that I finally gave this fine film a chance.

It has just the right mix of action, comedy, emotion to grab your attention from the beginning and carry you through to the end, without ever getting boring or dry. In this film we deal with issues of racism. I never had the idea that Asian people faced so much racism in the United States. It's wrong that they were treated that way. But the way Bruce overcame it with humor and confidence is awesome. The fighting scenes are some of the best I have ever seen. And there is plenty of it as well. I think they should have said a bit more about his mysterious death at the end, because that was a very powerful scene, but the fact that they left it as it was made the ending a bit more positive, yet still emotionally powerful. In my reviews I usually find a character in the movie that needs a punch in the face, and this is either a tribute to good acting\/writing, or to extremely poor film-making. In this film it's good acting\/writing. That person is Linda's mother. The is a racist bigot that should be restricted from interacting with other humans. Her hatred of Asians is uncalled for, and her callous resistance to Linda's marriage is a manifestation of bigotry and evil. People like her need to be stopped. I am glad her ideas did not prevail in the story. You are left, after watching this film, with a sense that a positive attitude and a strong drive can overcome any obstacle. Bruce Lee had a dream and he made it happen. It is a shame he did not live longer. This film has incredibly high replay value and I think you will think so as well.Please see my profile to understand my rating philosophy.

Like earlier adaptations such as 'Salem's Lot' and 'Children of the Corn' it didn't feel like sequel material, but I guess the people at Paramount didn't see it that way because three years later II was released. This time Stephen King wanted nothing to do with the project, but Mary Lambert returned to the director's chair and once again the location was Maine. Despite the fact that this sequel was entirely unnecessary, it actually turned out to be much better than it has any right to. Call me crazy, but I actually like it a little more than the first film.Pros Fine work from the cast, especially Clancy Brown who has fun with his part. The entire film has a real grim and depressing tone. Has a real mean streak. A good score and a great rock soundtrack, again featuring a song by the Ramones. Fast pacing. Mary Lambert injects some style into the film by use of colored filters, aerial shots, slow motion, etc. Excellent gore and make-up effects, not to mention a good amount of the former. Nice shots of the Maine landscape in Fall.Cons The dream sequences are more laughable than scary. Lacks the smarts and scares of the original.Final thoughts The original is and always will be a great horror film, but I can't help but like this sequel a little more. It's a rare example of a sequel that's done right. I think having the same director and such a talented cast really helped keep it from being just another by-the-numbers effort.My rating 4\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 November 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The 1989 Stephen King adaptation of his novel 'Pet Sematary' is one of the best based on his work and was a hit at the box office.

If he loves anything more than film-making it is music. 'Radio Days' is a high tribute to the golden age of popular music, filled with great songs and dance tunes from the 30s and 40s. This music accompanies a very funny and nostalgic story of a family during WWII living in Far Rockaway, Long Island. 'Radio Day's is from what I think of as Woody Allen's middle period, following on his more raw-feeling early work and preceding his current period of what seem to me less- inspired writing, with casts who often seem too conscious that they are doing a 'Woody' film.During this great middle period, with films like 'Radio Days', 'Alice' and 'The Purple Rose of Cairo', he was graced with a fairly regular team of core actors who inhabit their roles so completely as to banish their own identities. Not an easy thing to do when an actress like Mia Farrow, so famous for so many years, can disappear so fully into the far-fetched characters Woody creates.As she did in 'Hannah and Her Sisters', 'The Purple Rose of Cairo', and 'Alice', Farrow displays her formidable gifts with dazzling effortlessness. She, along with Dianne Wiest and a sensational supporting cast, carry the viewer along on a fast-moving sentimental journey. Along with the laughs are a few tears, something that is not always evident in Allen's films. He blends these moments seamlessly into the over-all fabric of the film and the viewer never feels emotionally manipulated, the emotions well up naturally, adding depth to what might otherwise have been more akin to the 'Big Broadcast' movies of the 30s.Woody Allen stretches his leading ladies, especially, to the limits, and they are great. I think it is time for some enterprising producers to bring Ms Farrow and Ms Wiess back to the big screen. Their absence from the big screen is a crime. And given all the multi-million dollar, money-losing flops Hollywood continues to barf out, with a bunch of scrawny-assed, personality-less young celebs simulating sex, the return of some of the greats of 20 years ago might be just what the industry needs to get people back into the theaters.'Radio Days' is classic Woody at his most inspired.
