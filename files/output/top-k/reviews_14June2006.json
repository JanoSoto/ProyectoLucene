Friends of mine introduced me to the sound track at first on a high quality stereo system. It was amazing. I went home and ordered the CD. I am no great fan of techno music but that first track made me hold my breath because of its beauty. It felt like sitting in a cathedral and listening to a simple choral. I know, awkward comparison, but...A few observations of my own. Lola's first run reveals that her father believes she is not his biological daughter, calls her a cuckoos egg. And it's quite possible, since we see her mom in all 3 runs talking on the phone with someone other than her husband. Lola is devastated. All three runs feature the bank security guard, trying to calm down Lola, giving her support. Every time they have intense eye contact, some silent understanding. He once even greets her with Da bist du ja, Liebling (there you are, darling). Quite strange for a bank employee to call his boss' daughter that, don't you think? We also see early on that he might have a heart condition. In the last story segment, we see the guard again, in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Lola caught a ride, for a change, to her meeting destination with Manni. Miraculously, the guard's heart condition improves as his hand reaches toward Lola's. The medic, at first annoyed (what the heck are you doing here?) is puzzled. Lola's answer to his question, as she reaches for the guard's hand is Ich gehoer zu ihm. Very important, I think. Call me silly, but somehow I have this feeling that he might be her illegitimate father. As bank employee he might well have had contact with Lola's mother, and even time to have an affair with her, considering the workaholic dad being gone so much. Ich gehoer zu ihm is badly translated in the subtitles as I'll stay with him while the German would better translate into I belong to him. And that is something Lola could well have realized after her dad abandoned her with the accusation of being a cuckoo's egg. The guard is also in the beginning of the movie quoting famous soccer coach Sepp Herberger's the ball is round. It's in the league with Yogi Berra's famous word creations. The ball is round meant for Herberger, that anything can happen as long as the game is on. Expect the unexpected. Since this is a movie that wants the viewer to think about possibilities, why not go all the way?

The soundtrack, picture were so bad that it was pointless to try and watch it. I would've rented the DVD but they did not have it at rental store. The re-release of the film a few years ago in theaters was my first real chance to see it. I sat in a packed auditorium with people ranging from late teens to 40 somethings. We were all scared to the core from the images presented in this film. I cannot comprehend how any normal god fearing human being could think this movie is laughable or a joke. I have been a horror film fan since i turned 8rys old in 1980. The Exorcist makes all the other horror films i have watched seem mild mannered. Almost everyone knows the story behind this movie and its basis in factual events. In real life it was a 14 yr old boy who was possessed while in the movie its a 13 yr old girl. Regan, as played by Linda Blair, is possessed by a demon because of her innocence,vulnerability,and insecurities. The opening of the movie takes place in Iraq where we meet Father Merrin on an archaeological dig. A member of his crew discovers a small\/hand sized carving of an ancient,powerful evil. Father Merrin recognizes the carving as the likeness of a demon he fought decades prior as a young priest. He is terrified to the point to leaving the dig sooner than expected. Next is the set up for the circumstances by which Regan is possessed by the demon. The version with added scenes gives more insight into the intense frustration felt by Regan's mother Chris,played by Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn,as she continues to take Regan to one specialist after the next to get a medical or psychological explanation of what is happening to her daughter. In between doctor visits Regan becomes more violent,sadistic,and disfigured outwardly due to the demon's presence in her body. Finally, Chris seeks out the help of the Catholic Church,through a young priest\/psychologist serving at the local university, to save her daughter and this pulls together all the horrific elements that lead to the exorcism of Regan. Father Merrin is called in by the younger priest, played by Jason Miller, to aid in the performing of the exorcism of Regan. Again this pulls the back-story into the present situation thus making it even more terrifying. Do not watch this film by yourself. Have one or more people with you and be prepared for the after affects of the film on your subconscious mind. Basically, you will more than likely have bad dreams over this movie. However, its an excellent horror\/suspense\/psychological film that set the standard very high for all other films of its nature that followed.

PSYCHO was one of those rare beasts that stand alone in its pedestal. The story of a woman who is in an illicit affair and wants out of her dead-end life, impulsively takes some money, and morphs into the songbird whose song gets cut in mid-tune as the story then turns into something completely black and sinister is the stuff of movie history. That you still cared for the perpetrator was amazing... but Hitchcock had a flawless story, one that needed only one major scare and one major twist to hook you in and then lead you into a nightmare.Neil Jordan must not have known the repercussions that his movie THE CRYING GAME would present -- and this was in a good way. He had thought on the title The Soldier's Wife for the film, but Kubrick advised him against it because it would spell it out too much and could hurt the movie's success. Because a lot of its success depended on if the audience would accept the plot twist that occurs roughly midway, thus a new title, one that would say as little as possible about the movie, had to be chosen. Thus how a British pop song which figures prominently within the movie and introduces the wild card was born. And because so much was made about the twist, was exactly the main reason that people flocked in droves to see it. I was living in Dominican Republic when this movie came out and I was one of the first ones to see it there... and I have to say I was floored.What this movie caused (in me, and everyone I knew, film critics and film buffs alike) was the feeling I expressed earlier that of having the wind knocked right out of me. A movie that started out one way -- with the kidnapping of a British soldier played by Forrest Whittaker -- turning into something completely different, and not only because of the aforementioned twist but the gender reversals that takes place for two of the supporting characters. THE CRYING GAME is a lot more than what it seems to be from a superficial point of view; it's a game of political power that morphs into a game of sexual power and ends in an all-out battle of supremacy between the sexes. It's as if all of the elements that were introduced so carefully, like a house of cards, were blown away, leaving an afterimage that was there in subtle form.Stephen Rea's relationship to the three major players is crucial for anything to take place in THE CRYING GAME. From the get-go there is a hesitancy within his approach to the Miranda Richardson, who sports the masculine name Jude. She is all about action, pausing if at all to think later. She uses her own sexuality to bring down a man, and it catches up with her later in the most unusual way. But she also, we learn later, seems to want more from Rea's Fergus -- the terrorist blah-de-blah is only (to me) a setup for her more sexual machinations. A man trapped inside the body of a woman, she is really going after what she can't have, and Fergus is her complete opposite. Ergo, her complement. She may not know it, but something impels her not to leave him alone.Rea and Whittaker's friendship is a doomed affair, but one that allows him to jump a narrow chasm and embrace something even more exotic. It's not a problem that Whittaker's character already is above the action -- his active part in the story is essentially over the moment he becomes a prisoner; all he has left is to tell a story to whomever may listen. That Fergus does is like winning the lotto... but Fergus is a kind man and also beyond the terrestrial nature of the action. Now, that their interaction leads to Jaye Davidson who has a score to settle later on once the truth comes out of Whittaker's character's death is labyrinthine, but dependent on Rea's character's own evolution. Davidson, as the neutrally named Dil, is a woman who has her own story to tell as well, and a man's heart to open.A dazzling film, it's a staple of what to do with an intelligent script, and using a twist (or two) for the better of a story, and not revolving a story around a twist.

Far from living in a world of futile fantasies, I think, Archie's character is much more accurately expressed by the line The only thing I know how to do is to keep on keeping on. All available options (Canada, failure, escape, or perhaps, suicide) being unthinkable, what choice has he but to chase another hopeless dream of somehow, finally, nailing a successful show? Perhaps I identify with Archie more strongly than many viewers, having myself been at the helm of a sinking ship (a business.)One unreasonably scathing critic (did he actually watch this film??) commented on Archie's daughter, Joan's, blind love for her father. I think it was not blind love at all, but a recognition of the (probably useless) courage Archie has to muster to continue to face each day -- a day likely to hold for him only more demoralizing failure and unceasing accusation and blame. And far from being totally selfish, as some commentators have written, Archie really seems to be the only person in the family able to look beyond the extremely small focus on their own interests he is, in fact, the only person in the Rice tribe making a real effort, despite the pain, to find a path out of the mess to a place of security for them all. Perhaps we have forgotten how dependent families were in that era on the earnings of the breadwinner, and yet, reviewers seem to have been just as blind as many wives and families of that time to what a man often had to give up in order to be that breadwinner, including, as in Archie's case, any fantasies of greatness or even, finally, his last shreds of self-esteem. Was Archie aware of his utter failure? Oh, I think absolutely so. This is why his admission to his daughter that he was dead behind his eyes. All the brightness of hope or illusions of personal excellence have been hammered out of him on the iron-cold anvil of real-world failure. Even so, he found it in him to dredge up the understanding and compassion to alleviate his wife, Phoebe's drunken crash into despair and hostility; and shore up his father's nostalgic dreams. Though, alas, the latter, too, led to yet another unforgiveable tragedy (-- or was it?.The most exquisite and poignant tragedy of it all is that maybe, just maybe, Archie might have pulled it off, but for the failure of his clueless family to understand him or the grim realities of his doomed profession. Forget metaphors of Imperial England, this tale has surely played itself out millions of times, whenever a new technology has made an old craft obsolete -- as when the printing press replaced scribes, or when electric lights eliminated the town's lamp lighter, or when automated projectors replaced skilled projectionists. Many of the movie's reviewers, in my opinion, are as blind to what is really going on here as is Archie's family. They assume that Archie's failures are the result of his negligence and selfishness, and that his dalliance with the beauty queen is a real romance (and threat to their security), when, in his eyes, it is just another, necessary, desperate and ultimately demeaning business deal. Joan alone, it seems, finally understands -- far too late to avert the inevitable end. Ultimately, every family member's myopic conception of Archie's reality leads them to take the reflexive steps that seal his doom.Shakespeare would have been completely a home with this tragic tale, and I think it was not such a great leap away from Hamlet for Olivier.The story is richly-detailed, unexpected and though-provoking. And Olivier is superb. A stunning performance from beginning to tragically inevitable end.

And far from being totally selfish, as some commentators have written, Archie really seems to be the only person in the family able to look beyond the extremely small focus on their own interests he is, in fact, the only person in the Rice tribe making a real effort, despite the pain, to find a path out of the mess to a place of security for them all. Perhaps we have forgotten how dependent families were in that era on the earnings of the breadwinner, and yet, reviewers seem to have been just as blind as many wives and families of that time to what a man often had to give up in order to be that breadwinner, including, as in Archie's case, any fantasies of greatness or even, finally, his last shreds of self-esteem. Was Archie aware of his utter failure? Oh, I think absolutely so. This is why his admission to his daughter that he was dead behind his eyes. All the brightness of hope or illusions of personal excellence have been hammered out of him on the iron-cold anvil of real-world failure. Even so, he found it in him to dredge up the understanding and compassion to alleviate his wife, Phoebe's drunken crash into despair and hostility; and shore up his father's nostalgic dreams. Though, alas, the latter, too, led to yet another unforgiveable tragedy (-- or was it?.The most exquisite and poignant tragedy of it all is that maybe, just maybe, Archie might have pulled it off, but for the failure of his clueless family to understand him or the grim realities of his doomed profession. Forget metaphors of Imperial England, this tale has surely played itself out millions of times, whenever a new technology has made an old craft obsolete -- as when the printing press replaced scribes, or when electric lights eliminated the town's lamp lighter, or when automated projectors replaced skilled projectionists. Many of the movie's reviewers, in my opinion, are as blind to what is really going on here as is Archie's family. They assume that Archie's failures are the result of his negligence and selfishness, and that his dalliance with the beauty queen is a real romance (and threat to their security), when, in his eyes, it is just another, necessary, desperate and ultimately demeaning business deal. Joan alone, it seems, finally understands -- far too late to avert the inevitable end. Ultimately, every family member's myopic conception of Archie's reality leads them to take the reflexive steps that seal his doom.Shakespeare would have been completely a home with this tragic tale, and I think it was not such a great leap away from Hamlet for Olivier.The story is richly-detailed, unexpected and though-provoking.

Far from living in a world of futile fantasies, I think, Archie's character is much more accurately expressed by the line The only thing I know how to do is to keep on keeping on. All available options (Canada, failure, escape, or perhaps, suicide) being unthinkable, what choice has he but to chase another hopeless dream of somehow, finally, nailing a successful show?

Peter Finch was portraying a cranky guy who is an angry messiah and also has eloquence as one of his strengths.

William Holden shows the crisis which he is going through both in his personal life and professional life and how one crisis effects the other. That transformation alongwith his natural vulnerability towards Love and in the end walking over the one whom he loved back to the one who loved him is awesome.

Liar Liar is a comedy with a message, and with Jim Carrey's hilarious style, the movie is a guaranteed fun time.Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey apparently work really well together, because all of their pairings have been hilarious. This is a god comedy for Carrey because he's not playing a zany character like a pet detective, a dumb limo driver, or a superhero on steroids. No, instead he plays a normal every day guy. An intelligent lawyer who just doesn't make time for his son. Only when he can't spit out a simple lie, such as saying a blue pen is red, does the movie get truly hilarious. He suddenly finds everything he cares about crashing down around him because he can't lie, and Carrey's hilarious facial expressions and actions just amplify the already funny situation. The fact that the movie makes several jabs at the lawyer profession and that the movie actually has a message behind it makes it a better comedy than most.I am a huge Jim Carrey fan. Have been ever since I first saw him in Ace Ventura. His movies of late haven't been all that satisfying, but I can always turn to Liar Liar to make me laugh. Most comedies are funny for the first two times you watch it, but afterward they become dry. As for Liar Liar, it keeps me laughing every time. Overall, it's a really good comedy that I think most people will enjoy.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 June 2006","score":"","review":" Liar Liar tells the story of Fletcher Reede, a hotshot lawyer, father, and ex-husband with commitment issues.

An intelligent lawyer who just doesn't make time for his son. Only when he can't spit out a simple lie, such as saying a blue pen is red, does the movie get truly hilarious. He suddenly finds everything he cares about crashing down around him because he can't lie, and Carrey's hilarious facial expressions and actions just amplify the already funny situation. The fact that the movie makes several jabs at the lawyer profession and that the movie actually has a message behind it makes it a better comedy than most.I am a huge Jim Carrey fan. Have been ever since I first saw him in Ace Ventura. His movies of late haven't been all that satisfying, but I can always turn to Liar Liar to make me laugh. Most comedies are funny for the first two times you watch it, but afterward they become dry. As for Liar Liar, it keeps me laughing every time.

With one hired gun, who needs an upstart, who's a total hothead. Sly Stallone plays Robert Rath, a veteran killer who meets his match, a young upstart named Miguel Bain(Antonio Banderas) who kills one of the few crime families at a funeral, then makes his escape while being handcuffed by the police. He dislocated his thumb to slip through the cuffs, and snaps the officer's neck in the process. Robert has the scanner which makes himself more efficient. Bain is so dangerous, he kills anyone who got in his way. It was downright barbaric to tamper with the fireplace to kill that young lady, and follow her every move. I liked the part where both men realize that the man Rath thought has killed, was still breathing. And Bain who tried to shoot Rath confronts him in the bank to have a little chat with him. Why blow the chance and do it already? Maybe he had a another plan if the first one backfires. To me, his assassination of Rath was stalled out for too long. Bain may have had youth, but Rath had more tricks up his sleeve, or tucked in his belt. This movie in my opinion is great, plenty of cunningness, and the plot was played out very well. This is one of Stallone's finest movies. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.

Some of them are pretty good -- Citizen Kane, All About Eve. Some are mediocre -- Keeper of the Flame. This is one of the best.The acting honors generally go to Broderick Crawford and he's not bad. He's rather like a switch who can toggle either into thoughtful candor or blustering Hickhood. (He used the latter persona to good effect as a New Jersey junk man later.) He also had a third position, the incredibly dumb goof, which he never used after becoming a serious actor, but see, Larceny, Incorporated for an example of what I mean.If there's a problem with the script it's not his fault, although it involves his character. Hung over, still a bit drunk, Crawford steps on stage and instead of his usual boring tax speech he gives a redneck-rousing go-getter. And he never changes after that. Rather too quick a transition.The direction is very good. There's a scene in which Mercedes McCambridge enters the hotel room in which John Ireland has been cooped up for four days in a depressed state. Whew, lots of smoke, she says. And lots of whiskey. The scene is almost perfectly staged, with Ireland crumpled on the bed in the foreground and reaching for his liquor out of the frame, while McCambridge busies herself emptying ash trays in the background and staring at her face in the mirror. Smallpox, she says. (She's not nearly as attractive as Crawford's new girl friend, JoAnne Dru, nee Joanne Letitia LaCock, a name that could have come straight out of Andy Warhol's Factory.) Everyone's acting is quite up to par. It's John Ireland's best role. He was never Hollwyood-handsome with those squished up eyes, that deep hole between them, and that protruding nose beneath.But the honors really should go to Mercedes McCambridge. Robert Rossen, the director, allows her a few seconds here and there to be unique. When Ireland slaps her face hard, she doesn't cry. She replies with a mixture of contempt and not entirely displeased surprise at having provoked him to violence.

However, on his mission, Logan quickly starts to doubt that anyone has been renewed and crosses over to be a runner for real.When I watched 2005's The Island, I was put in mind of Logan's Run because it was similar enough to be almost called a remake. So after criticising the former for lacking brains amongst other faults, I decided to rewatch the original I you will. Sadly (and my girlfriend will not appreciate my opinion on this) I could as easily say the same about this film because it is rather disappointingly lacking in much in the way of substance. After the original idea is set out, there is basic development but not to any degree and certainly not to the point where characters and plot could be described as thought provoking or interesting.It is a shame because the film has a nice flow to it but here it only manages to be a series of little adventures on the road, some of which are interesting, some of which are silly but most of which feel disconnected from one another. The reason for this is the lack of substance within it &#150; it is evident in the script, the film and the characters themselves.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"14 June 2006","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Safe from the pollution of the broken world outside, humans now live in one enclosed city living lives of pure happiness and joy. Nobody gets old because, at age 30, you enter a ritual for renewal and a new life. Some people decide not to undertake this ritual and decide to try and escape the city. These runners are hunted down by Sandmen &#150; one of whom is Logan 5. When Logan meets Jessica 6, she infuriates him with ideas of if's and but's. However Logan approaches her again when his remaining life is cut short and he is told to become a runner in order to find and destroy the legendary runner's safe haven of Sanctuary. However, on his mission, Logan quickly starts to doubt that anyone has been renewed and crosses over to be a runner for real.When I watched 2005's The Island, I was put in mind of Logan's Run because it was similar enough to be almost called a remake. So after criticising the former for lacking brains amongst other faults, I decided to rewatch the original I you will. Sadly (and my girlfriend will not appreciate my opinion on this) I could as easily say the same about this film because it is rather disappointingly lacking in much in the way of substance. After the original idea is set out, there is basic development but not to any degree and certainly not to the point where characters and plot could be described as thought provoking or interesting.It is a shame because the film has a nice flow to it but here it only manages to be a series of little adventures on the road, some of which are interesting, some of which are silly but most of which feel disconnected from one another. The reason for this is the lack of substance within it &#150; it is evident in the script, the film and the characters themselves. Case in point is just how very simplistic Logan and Jessica are; I never felt they were real people and they just came over as enthusiastic puppies responding to anything put in their way. The direction is reasonably good but it is hard not to react to the dated sets and costumes, not to mention the special effects &#150; unfair criticisms perhaps but some things don't age well.The cast are pretty poor, which is a shame because a lot needed to happen within them to make this more than a basic, forgettable piece of sci-fi. York and Agutter therefore were probably not the people to bring on board. Neither is very good, coming across very wooden and unconvincing &#150; like they are both doing what they were told to do in each scene they shot, but never understood their characters or had their own visions of who they were playing. Support is reasonable from Jordan, Fawcett, Ustinov and others but the lead two are the film &#150; and are it's undoing in some ways.Many people will view this film through tinted sunglasses and I wonder if they should perhaps not watch it again to avoid spoiling these childhood memories. As for me, my return to it after about 20 years found me watching a rather unengaging film that had forward motion but nothing in the way of substance or thought coming out from below. A remake is due and I wonder will it go back and do more of interest with the material or if it will just use technology to beef up the action and the effects? I think I know the answer but Hollywood might prove me wrong &#150; but they didn't manage it with this original.

This film has very much been built up on it's controversy, like many other films. Some quotes include, 'purile and disgusting' 'highly offensive' and 'stupid, immoral and idiotic.' All of the above are true.But it is also very, very funny.I had never heard of Tom Green before, so I didn't really know what to expect. I put on the DVD, and judging by the cover, the blurb and the beginning of the film, it seemed like a light hearted, stupid slapstick fare. I wish I had paid more attention to the rating.The storyline is non - existent. Well, very little anyway. Gordy, a wannabe animator, tries to make a break for Hollywood, making just enough money as a cheese sandwich factory worker. But he fails miserably, and goes back to living at home with his parents.That is all the 'storyline' I could decipher. What follows is a barrage of offensively brilliant comedy, including the infamous deer scene.For 90% of the films running time, it doesn't really make sense. That is the one thing you must remember. But it is not supposed to. I think that it is not the deer scene that sets the tone, though. It's another.Here's the scene Gordy and his friend, Darren are standing on a half - pipe built outside Gordy's home. Darren tries to do a bit of skating, and trips up and breaks his leg - bone poking out through the skin, blood everywhere, and Darren screaming. This really took me aback - I wasn't really expecting anything so disgusting. While I was laughing a retching at Tom Green's childish antics during this scene, I never really recovered from it.Although not all the humour is disgusting; some of it is just plain weird. For example, the sketch where Gordy hangs sausages from the ceiling and hooks them up to the piano strings, so that when he plays on the piano the sausages go up and down, made me crack a grin. He plays while randomly singing in an off - tone voice, 'Daddy, would you like some sausage? Daddy would you like some sausages? It made me smile just out of pure curiosity.Also in the bizarre section of the humour of this movie is the 'Treasure' sequence, in which Gordy childishly pretends he is a deep sea diver in the shower, and pretends that soap on a rope is treasure.

In my opinion, this sequence is one of the films stand out moments.But what I really think makes Freddy Got Fingered shine is the moments which parody the usual Hollywood schmaltz's. For example'Oh Gordy,I don't care about jewels. All I really wanna do is.... suck your c***''This has been a valuable life lesson. This trip hasn't been about spending about acting like a d***, shouting at the top of my voice like a hyperactive child or whacking off an elephant.

Others have eloquently talked about the wonderful music and score, the very real script, and excellent acting, so there is no need for me to elaborate. But another element of the movie that I found even more notable is its depiction of Native Americans as individuals with feelings, honorable if at the same time frequently peculiar customs, and as human beings with human urges and impulses. What a refreshing contrast to all of the pablum and nonsense that has been the staple of Hollywood and its treatment of injuns over the years.So it comes as no surprise that some of the criticisms here come from people who believe the movie is anti-white or anti-army or glorifies Native Americans. But I believe these comments completely miss the mark. First off, Costner in the movie himself portrays an army figure--the movie is trying to show that not all people in the army are beasts. This is again brought out by the young leader of the troops attempting to arrest Costner and bring him back to trial; this soldier is depicted as a fair and honest young man put in a difficult spot.Perhaps one of the reasons for the shortsightedness of some of the movie critics is their lack of understanding of the terrible plight faced by native Americans and the awful, holocaust-like consequences of the policy that was known as Indian Removal. And yes, I am a professor who knows something about the subject and who uses this film in class (and I am not afraid to admit it). Please have a look at As Long as Grass Grows or Water Runs a chapter in Howard Zinn's famous book, A People's History of the United States. It uses many primary sources to describe exactly what happened; the phrase, by the way, was a promise made by Andrew Jackson (later President Jackson) to Cherokee Indians if they would relocate (a promise later broken, of course). Jackson, by the way, refused to enforce a court order from the Supreme Court in the case of Worcester v. Georgia involving an individual sentenced to prison for questioning the legitimacy of laws repressing the Cherokees. Jackson also fought the Creeks killing hundreds of them and later boasted, the truth is, the (Creeks) did not respect the power of the United States...We bleed our enemies in such cases to give them their senses. From 1814 to 1824, Jackson was instrumental in fashioning a series of treaties that deprived Indians of over 3\/4 of Alabama and Florida, one-third of Tennessee, one-fifth of Georgia and Mississippi, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. These treaties were little more than land grabs and Jackson is widely known to have practiced extensive bribery and other dirty tricks in securing them. At the same time, Jackson and his friends and relatives received many patronage appointments as land agents, traders etc (I guess he would have gotten along well with Dick Chenney and Bush) and of course, he and his friends bought up much of this land that became suddenly available.Another good source for what happened to the Indians is the eyewitness account of a soldier who served in the mounted infantry. John G. Burnett in 1890 published his reminiscences, The Cherokee Removal through the Eyes of a Private Soldier. I was sent as interpreter into the Smoky Mountain Country in May, 1838, and witnessed the execution of the most brutal order in the History of American Warfare. I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes, and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning, I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into 645 wagons and started toward the West. This evokes images not unlike those showing S.S. officers putting Jews in railroad cars. At this time, 1890, continues Burnett, we are too near the removal of the Cherokees for our young people to fully understand the enormity of the crime that was committed against a helpless race. Truth is, the facts are being concealed from the young people of today. Burnett later describes the streams of blood that flowed in the Indian country in the summer of 1838 and the 4000 silent graves that mark the trail of the Cherokees to their exile, again very much like a World War II death march. So what I find shocking about Dances With Wolves is that it shows, to a great extent, the brutality of the conflict between settlers from one civilization, and the people who already lived on the land. This stands as a testament to Costner and his willingness to take this brave position. It is precisely because this subject has become taboo and because most Americans haven't a clue as to their own history, because their image of America is similar to Pleasantville (before colorization), that many people find this movie revolting and unacceptable. Hence, they prefer to shoot the messenger of the bad news-- Costner.Finally, as others have pointed out, the movie does not glorify all Native Americans. It shows that there is a spectrum of behavior amongst them, and also shows that many of their customs (eating fresh meat from just-killed animals, for example) are shocking and barbaric to us today.

It uses many primary sources to describe exactly what happened; the phrase, by the way, was a promise made by Andrew Jackson (later President Jackson) to Cherokee Indians if they would relocate (a promise later broken, of course). Jackson, by the way, refused to enforce a court order from the Supreme Court in the case of Worcester v. Georgia involving an individual sentenced to prison for questioning the legitimacy of laws repressing the Cherokees. Jackson also fought the Creeks killing hundreds of them and later boasted, the truth is, the (Creeks) did not respect the power of the United States...We bleed our enemies in such cases to give them their senses. From 1814 to 1824, Jackson was instrumental in fashioning a series of treaties that deprived Indians of over 3\/4 of Alabama and Florida, one-third of Tennessee, one-fifth of Georgia and Mississippi, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. These treaties were little more than land grabs and Jackson is widely known to have practiced extensive bribery and other dirty tricks in securing them. At the same time, Jackson and his friends and relatives received many patronage appointments as land agents, traders etc (I guess he would have gotten along well with Dick Chenney and Bush) and of course, he and his friends bought up much of this land that became suddenly available.Another good source for what happened to the Indians is the eyewitness account of a soldier who served in the mounted infantry. John G. Burnett in 1890 published his reminiscences, The Cherokee Removal through the Eyes of a Private Soldier. I was sent as interpreter into the Smoky Mountain Country in May, 1838, and witnessed the execution of the most brutal order in the History of American Warfare. I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes, and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning, I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into 645 wagons and started toward the West. This evokes images not unlike those showing S.S. officers putting Jews in railroad cars. At this time, 1890, continues Burnett, we are too near the removal of the Cherokees for our young people to fully understand the enormity of the crime that was committed against a helpless race. Truth is, the facts are being concealed from the young people of today. Burnett later describes the streams of blood that flowed in the Indian country in the summer of 1838 and the 4000 silent graves that mark the trail of the Cherokees to their exile, again very much like a World War II death march. So what I find shocking about Dances With Wolves is that it shows, to a great extent, the brutality of the conflict between settlers from one civilization, and the people who already lived on the land. This stands as a testament to Costner and his willingness to take this brave position. It is precisely because this subject has become taboo and because most Americans haven't a clue as to their own history, because their image of America is similar to Pleasantville (before colorization), that many people find this movie revolting and unacceptable. Hence, they prefer to shoot the messenger of the bad news-- Costner.Finally, as others have pointed out, the movie does not glorify all Native Americans. It shows that there is a spectrum of behavior amongst them, and also shows that many of their customs (eating fresh meat from just-killed animals, for example) are shocking and barbaric to us today.

Others have eloquently talked about the wonderful music and score, the very real script, and excellent acting, so there is no need for me to elaborate. But another element of the movie that I found even more notable is its depiction of Native Americans as individuals with feelings, honorable if at the same time frequently peculiar customs, and as human beings with human urges and impulses. What a refreshing contrast to all of the pablum and nonsense that has been the staple of Hollywood and its treatment of injuns over the years.So it comes as no surprise that some of the criticisms here come from people who believe the movie is anti-white or anti-army or glorifies Native Americans. But I believe these comments completely miss the mark. First off, Costner in the movie himself portrays an army figure--the movie is trying to show that not all people in the army are beasts. This is again brought out by the young leader of the troops attempting to arrest Costner and bring him back to trial; this soldier is depicted as a fair and honest young man put in a difficult spot.Perhaps one of the reasons for the shortsightedness of some of the movie critics is their lack of understanding of the terrible plight faced by native Americans and the awful, holocaust-like consequences of the policy that was known as Indian Removal.
