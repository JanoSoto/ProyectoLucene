The movie is based on a short story, but there are obvious parallels to the story of Pinochio. A toy is created, and then that toy is granted consciousness. The toy, in the movie, is a Robot played by Haley Joel-Osment; it's meant as a substitute child for people wanting children of their own but cannot. In this case however, the two people were already parents, but their son was sick and comatosed. After awhile, their true son is returned to them, and this creates obvious conflicts. The Robot boy is made to leave, and then he goes out in search of becoming a real boy, so that he will become accepted. This is the major cause for problems that occur at the end of the movie. This movie isn't a real fairy tale. We're told to believe all of the things that happen in this movie, as if they are possible. And for the most part, we have no trouble doing that. The superb acting of Osment lets us believe that he is a robot trying to conquer the gap between human and machine. But as it seems apparent, the last thirty minutes come off as a completely other movie in itself. The events that transpire in the end are ludicrous, and they left me bored and wishing the credits would come rolling up, even though I knew it wouldn't happen. The happy ending that Spielberg tries for left me annoyed. It would appear that the real problem in this movie that tries to live up to a fairytale, is that there is no reasonable way to make a robot into a real boy. He will never genuinely love, because he was only programmed. I am hoping that there will be a director's cut to this movie. I think with some editing, it could be a far superior film to what is being watched now. Everything was well done. The acting, directing, and the special effects were all wonderful and beautiful. There were just plot holes that left the movie having to go in a ridiculous direction. And if Spielberg could peruse himself into avoiding the happy ending, there could be a much better ending that wouldn't bore me and roll my eyes.~Christopher ","genre":null},{"date":"29 July 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This could have been a truly great piece of work, but unfortunately, after much thought, I feel like it just can't be done.

I love Tim Burton's work; and I was greatly intrigued by the new APES movie idea.  For two full hours, I was thoroughly convinced that this was the best movie I've seen all year.  Better than Proof of Life, better than X-Men, better than Moulin Rouge, better than The Pledge, Traffic, or Shrek.  I was minutes away from leaving this movie in awe.Then, the walls came a-crumblin' down.I thought that this reimagining had many great additions to the plot that were excluded from the Heston classic  an explanation of the origin of the ape population and intelligence, the early fate of the humans, the origination of the holy scripts of the ape culture, a reasonable and more realistic adaptation of evolved apes (keeping some ape attributes in the process), and a less predictable twist-of-fate discovery on the foreign planet by the hero.  This time, it's not Earth he discovers, just like the pre-movie trailers say it isn't, but he discovers his role in the history of the planet.  It works well, as does the whole plot, in a wonderfully designed planet with great costumes and backgrounds.  It was an A+ movie until the ending.I had heard that Burton filmed many endings for this film and then chose one.  If this is true, then I have a great idea for him  send out the alternate endings in the next coming weeks and tell the public you've done so.

The ending of this movie makes absolutely no sense, none.  It is in logical, chronological, and collossal error.  It does not correspond with anything else in the movie, and it simply makes no sense whatsoever.  This is perhaps the worst ending of a movie since Waterworld, and ruins what was over two hours of the best movie I've seen all summer. It was a great movie, it should have ended greatly.  I give it an A++ for two hours or so, and an F-- for the last few minutes.

Like it or not, most of this is where we're headed!Was it better than most films today?  Yes.  Too many action pseudo-scifi films are for the brain dead.  This film at least dared to be interesting.I thought the ending was the weakest part (spoiler here).  It boiled down to kill the bad guys, blow up their stronghold and all is well.  I would liked to have seen at least some surprising twists, to see society faced with this information and the drama which would ensue, or to truly be faced with the philosophical ramifications of the two Adams.  I really expected a twist at the end like the real Adam, whom we assumed was the original (since 'Adam 2' had the spot in the eyelid), would see TWO spots under his eyelid!  But since he wasn't the one who learned what that meant, he would dismiss it and go on, leaving us to wonder what happened.  That, or the wife and\/or daughter finding the eyelid dot, insinuating THEY were clones (having been switched while in custody as a double cross)!   On a different note, it was nice to finally see a blonde in a movie do something interesting to her hair instead of women of great natural beauty dying to BECOME blonde!  Even if she was a muderous fiend  -)I was rather disappointed there were not more special features on the DVD, especially **CUT SCENES**.  Most movies seem to have EXCELLENT scenes cut.  I would like to have seen them.I would say this is worth renting.  Go to Blockbuster; it will be due back noon on the 6th day....

The scenes in Burkewaite's class are excruciating. Even if the subject is Social Studies, this guy is WAY over the top. His speeches are so overwrought they are laughable. And no teachers I ever had would grill their students like that, and tell the ones who protest to Shut up!. These scenes are brief, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. Next, how the heck does Layne just walk out of the police station near the end? Also, what happened to Samson's car after the first scene of him riding into town? He spends the rest of the film being chaffeured around by Layne or Feck.  ***END SPOILERS*** Ahhh, Feck...this guy is great. Dennis Hopper effortlessly steals the movie. Check's in the mail, I love company, you're my friend - every line is a classic. He gives Feck an internal logic that makes the story work. Incredibly, he actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy, especially when Samson talks about his (Samson's) future.   By contrast, Crispin Glover is hard to take sometimes. Yet the scenes of him driving around in the Beetle are perfect - kids with cars in high school always have something to do, and buds to do it with. Matt's low-key attitude makes a good foil for Layne - their friendship is believable. Glover's mannerisms are a little much, but he is consistent throughout. He drives the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to imagine this flick if Layne were as much of a zombie as Matt or Samson - snoozefest! ***SPOILERS***  What makes River's Edge unsettling is the fact that Samson is not really evil, in the usual sense.

We start off with an electrical storm in space that results in some serious time travel, just like we saw in Lost In Space, which results in our hero winding up thousands of years in the future and on an unknown planet. Seconds after surviving the crash landing of his pod on this mysterious planet, Leo Davidson (Mark Walhberg) finds himself surrounded by fleeing HUMANS. The first thing I thought was that there are humans and apes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy roughly 5000 years in the future, but later we learn (also as seen in Lost In Space) that Leo's ship also passed through that time warp and landed in the same place, leaving the humans to go into submission to the out-of-control apes that were on the ship for experimentation, and the apes themselves were left to evolve and take control, ultimately turning into the hard-nosed apes that ruled the planet when Leo crash landed. That was a mouthful. Pretty creative though, once we are eventually informed as to what the hell is going on. So Leo is stuck on this planet where the roles are basically reversed and exaggerated between humans and apes, and now it is entirely up to Leo to save this planet's version of the human race from the oppression of the apes. Tim Roth delivers a horribly annoying performance as General Thade, the militant leader of the apes who is so filled with hatred for the humans (for reasons never made entirely clear) that he operates just like a machine. He's always grunting and growling and always has his head tilted downward like he's expecting physical confrontation at all times, and his constant guttural tone of voice makes him almost amusing after a while. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that the apes are so well made up, but they also have tremendous intelligence, as is made evident by their strikingly human eyes, and yet they switch back and forth from normal speech to the same screeching and screaming that you hear from the monkeys at the zoo. There is a scene where General Thade is told that the humans crossed the river using the apes' own horses, and he jumps all around the place, screeching and jumping and breaking things, and then he's back on the ground talking like a warrior. It's so hard to take this stuff seriously.Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Ari, the weirdly attractive ape who is disgruntled with the way that the humans are treated by the apes, and who turns against her own kind to help the humans escape. There is a childish scene at the end of the film where Leo kisses Ari that is sure to get a laugh from any audience, while the stunningly but almost weirdly beautiful Estella Warren provides the human love interest. It's a good thing that they had a human woman in this movie to take romantic interest in Leo, because without her we only have Ari, who is 100% ape but who acts exactly like a human woman while interacting with Leo. For the first half of the film, I was a little nervous about the possibility of a little bestiality happening somewhere in there. So we know that Ari is helping the humans because she is disillusioned with her violent species, but they are also accompanied by another ape - Attar, I think (hey, half the fun was trying to figure out who was underneath all that make-up, right?) - and we never know why he agrees to go along, knowing that he will face severe punishment upon returning, which is one of the movies more simplistic but peeving oversights. It is, however, the ending of the film that ruins it beyond all hope for being saved.At the beginning of the film, when Leo took off in the pod toward the electrical storm, he was going after the pod of his chimp, with whom all communication had been lost.

And General Thade, I guess, was just left sulking under that console on the ship forever, doomed to live the rest of his life as a loose end in a sub-par sci fi movie. It was bad enough that everything on the ship still worked after thousands of years, now they have to leave stuff everywhere unexplained.So we get back to Earth, Leo survives the entrance through the atmosphere and then miraculously survives another violent crash landing without a scratch, and he finds the Lincoln Monument is an ape (when I saw Lincoln from behind, I jokingly said to myself that it would be an ape. I was disappointed and amused to find that I was right). This could, of course, mean only one thing. Seeing how there was barely an explanation for the English speaking humans and apes on the planet on which most of the film took place, and there was literally none at all given for the apes replacing the humans on Earth, we can only assume that they ran out of money or they are just setting up for a sequel.

Seconds after surviving the crash landing of his pod on this mysterious planet, Leo Davidson (Mark Walhberg) finds himself surrounded by fleeing HUMANS. The first thing I thought was that there are humans and apes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy roughly 5000 years in the future, but later we learn (also as seen in Lost In Space) that Leo's ship also passed through that time warp and landed in the same place, leaving the humans to go into submission to the out-of-control apes that were on the ship for experimentation, and the apes themselves were left to evolve and take control, ultimately turning into the hard-nosed apes that ruled the planet when Leo crash landed. That was a mouthful. Pretty creative though, once we are eventually informed as to what the hell is going on. So Leo is stuck on this planet where the roles are basically reversed and exaggerated between humans and apes, and now it is entirely up to Leo to save this planet's version of the human race from the oppression of the apes.

He's always grunting and growling and always has his head tilted downward like he's expecting physical confrontation at all times, and his constant guttural tone of voice makes him almost amusing after a while. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that the apes are so well made up, but they also have tremendous intelligence, as is made evident by their strikingly human eyes, and yet they switch back and forth from normal speech to the same screeching and screaming that you hear from the monkeys at the zoo. There is a scene where General Thade is told that the humans crossed the river using the apes' own horses, and he jumps all around the place, screeching and jumping and breaking things, and then he's back on the ground talking like a warrior. It's so hard to take this stuff seriously.Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Ari, the weirdly attractive ape who is disgruntled with the way that the humans are treated by the apes, and who turns against her own kind to help the humans escape. There is a childish scene at the end of the film where Leo kisses Ari that is sure to get a laugh from any audience, while the stunningly but almost weirdly beautiful Estella Warren provides the human love interest.

The general mood of the movie is quite depressing, but this doesn't take you off guard, as the plot immediately sets in as soon as it starts, so make sure you're prepared from the beginning. Almost all of the movie is set in the late 1700s, then continues on a bit further, then briefly goes over the events throughout the nineteenth century. A note beforehand This movie has some gore... it's not all about feeding on helpless victims or special effects, but about the first hour may seem very gory for some people, but this doesn't last long at all, so don't for one second start to think this is what the movie's all about.**SPOILER WARNING** Anyway, the immortal Louis (Brad Pitt) tells of his life as a vampire and his own personal hell. These vampires are beyond amazing- they are not just bloodsucking creatures, and feel as they felt as humans. This captivating tale takes you back to 1791, where Louis has turned suicidal what with the recent deaths of his wife and infant son. He roams to taverns, drunk, picking fights, with an invitation open to anyone to end his life. Soon a vampire, by the name of Lestat (Tom Cruise) offers Louis a life without pain, one that cannot end. Ever. Louis accepts, not really knowing what he's getting into, and so therefore Lestat transforms him into a vampire. Immediately the movie's theme mood is set Louis is distressed. He despises his vampiric ways (You'll find out MUCH more about this if you read the book) and hates to kill more than anything. As explained in the novel, he was extremely sensitive about death due to his family's death, and simply could not take a human life. When he did kill, he felt awful and throughout his time with Lestat went bitter. As the movie continues- and you're praying for poor Louis to be happy- fights start breaking out between him and his maker, who only wants Louis to share his love of human blood and immortal power. Then, one night, when Louis' hunger was unbearable, he drank from a little girl named Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) and Lestat appeared... then, as a gift (as said in the book, but in the movie it's more brutal) Lestat makes her as one of them. Thankfully, the scenery changes, and there are a number of funny scenes- Claudia's clumsiness and Lestat's inevitable impatience- then, of course, Claudia started asking questions. After all, she was made immortal in such a small body and seeing all the older and larger women, she grew distraught and closer to Louis. In an unforgettable scene, she throws all her dolls out of a trunk and Lestat sees she hid a dead mortal in there... then, in a fury, she screams at Lestat and Louis, demanding answers, and then cuts her hair and runs into her room, only to scream even more hysterically when she sees it has all grown back in a matter of seconds. From here on, she is as Louis is, and then the plotting begins.Let me add that this took me totally by surprise when I first saw the movie. Claudia had come to hate Lestat so much that she hints of killing him- and then does. Sweetly, she makes peace with him and leads him to two 'drunk' boys, who are actually dead, but filled with a poison that keeps their blood warm. As a rule, vampires can't drink dead blood or they'll go down into death with their victim. And so did Lestat... and in another breathtaking scene, he drinks from one of the boys and starts gasping for breath, thrashing around on the room and yelling for Louis, but by the time Louis arrives, Claudia has just cut Lestat's throat, and the two watch- Louis in shock, Claudia only smiling- as Lestat chokes on his blood and shrivels down on the floor, dead. The two fledgings then drop Lestat's body into the swamp, figuring the blood put an end to him. The two make plans for Paris, both wanting to seek out others of 'their kind' as Claudia put it, and then, on the night of their leave, they hear someone at the door. In a heart pumping scene, Louis opens it and sees no one is there. In a long moment of silence, he looks around strangely, and then turns around in confusion, when suddenly Lestat jumps up and shoves Louis against the wall, his hand around his throat. Louis then slams the door on Lestat's hand, making him back off into the street.He picks up Claudia and the two run up the stairs. Entering a room, they stop in fear as music from the piano suddenly starts playing, and they see Lestat is there, alive and well... but, not exactly. The makeup in this scene is excellent. Claudia... you've been a very, VERY naughty little girl.. He then attempts to harm Claudia, and with a thrust of his arm, Louis throws a lantern on Lestat, aflaming him. The two escape and barely make the ship, watching from afar the burning city of New Orleans. Another cheerful section of the movie is set in as the two arrive in Paris. We were alive again, Louis says. The scenes of Paris are also breathtaking... then the part with Armand comes.A lot of people don't like Antonio Banderas as Armand. I agree. Armand is supposed to have a cherub face, but 'play the devil' inside, him only living up to 16 years of mortal life, but 500 as a vampire. Instead, the Armand in the movie has an evil expression... and the age not even appropriate for his character. Here, Louis so sadly seeks out the answers of their kind; what they are, where they come from, when Armand answers the best he can, when really they're both just falling in love with each other. Claudia immediately senses this, picking up a message from Santonio, Armand's evil side kick, and assumes Louis is going to leave her... and with thinking that, she demands Louis make a dollmaker from one of her favorite shops, by the name Sybelle, immortal. Louis desperately denies him ever leaving her, but still ends up making Sybelle immortal, in one of the most emotional and powerful scenes in the movie. And as soon as this resentful deed is done, Armand's vampires (from the Theatre Des Vampires) come and take them to the theatre. Santonio then orders Sybelle and Claudia executed, and Louis to be shut up in a coffin for eternity. They want to punish them because Santonio thinks Louis killed his maker, and also, though not known to Louis ever before, children are NOT allowed to be made vampires.Unfortunately, the killing of Claudia and Sybelle is successful- with regretful Armand shutting himself up in a room while the three screamed for him beforehand- but he gets Louis out right away, who then discovers the bodies of the two vampires, and then- in one of my favorite scenes- slowly walks out of the room and turns to the vampires, with the most powerful glow in his eyes, full of hatred. And for a good reason. That night, he returns, and burns the Theatre Des Vampires to the ground, killing all of them except Armand, who then saves Louis from the daylight, as he wasn't exactly keeping track of time while destroying all of his enemies. The two are then together, but not for long. In an emotional scene, Louis confronts him, and of how he could have stopped them, and with that, leaves Armand.This is the part that kills you. The music from the beginning comes back- Medley, the theme song, which is extremely sad- and as it was as his last days of mortality, when he longed to die, the mood is the exact same but worse. By now anyone watching the film feels his pain terribly, and he talks about what he did after that, recklessly traveling from country to country. But the world was a tomb to me; a graveyard full of broken statues, and each of those statues resembled her face. He then tells of how the technological miracle, film, let him see the sunrise for the first time in 200 years. The movie is definitely concluding, but not before Lestat pops up again. Coming out of the theater, Louis catches the scent of death as he walks into a graveyard... but it wasn't coming from the graves. He continues to walk and then finds Lestat, weak, dry, his back to him, talking in a small voice. The reunion isn't too long... in a touching moment, Louis comforts Lestat when he fearfully cowers when a pilot comes over them, and then, pretty much Lestat telling him of how he can be like he was in the old days, Louis simply says I have to go and leaves him there. He then goes on to say he lives on, night after night, feeding on those who cross his path. The scene comes back to the setting of the first, where Louis has just told this all to an eager reporter (Christian Slater) by the name of Daniel. Daniel then comes to say that he's not dead, and with a sudden outburst, Louis comes and threatens him, scaring Daniel away. He runs out of the building and into his car, racing along the street. Daniel then starts to calm down, joking to himself a little, when suddenly Lestat comes up behind him and sinks his fangs into his neck. Daniel screams out as the car swerves madly on a fast moving highway, and then, Lestat, regaining the wheel, hears Louis' tape playing. Have you heard enough? I've had to listen to that... for centuries! Lestat sneers, then turning it back to the radio. Don't be afraid. I'm going to give you the choice...I, never had.He then looks at Daniel and starts laughing mockingly, which, is a very funny ending, as it reminds you of his cockiness in the beginning of the movie. It ends with an upbeat tune of 'Guns and Roses', the singer actually telling about his immortality when the credits come on. This, truly, is a classic.The movie goes through three stages Louis becoming a Vampire- His meeting Lestat and learning the ways of a vampire, the suffering even more intense and neverending. Falling in Love- A part of the movie where it's actually funny and somewhat high spirited, how he fell in love with Claudia, still mixed in with a vampiric sense of evil. And then... the happiness ends. Surviving it All- Conclusion to the movie, where it's back to where it was in the beginning, only far worse. The last scene is great and it sets the mood for the other Anne Rice books, and the upcoming sequel of this movie, 'Queen of the Damned' due out in October, starring Aaliyah (none of the IWTV cast).If you can understand English, you should see this movie. I love it! If you want more info email me. It truly is a classic.

Claudia... you've been a very, VERY naughty little girl.. He then attempts to harm Claudia, and with a thrust of his arm, Louis throws a lantern on Lestat, aflaming him. The two escape and barely make the ship, watching from afar the burning city of New Orleans. Another cheerful section of the movie is set in as the two arrive in Paris. We were alive again, Louis says. The scenes of Paris are also breathtaking... then the part with Armand comes.A lot of people don't like Antonio Banderas as Armand. I agree. Armand is supposed to have a cherub face, but 'play the devil' inside, him only living up to 16 years of mortal life, but 500 as a vampire. Instead, the Armand in the movie has an evil expression... and the age not even appropriate for his character. Here, Louis so sadly seeks out the answers of their kind; what they are, where they come from, when Armand answers the best he can, when really they're both just falling in love with each other. Claudia immediately senses this, picking up a message from Santonio, Armand's evil side kick, and assumes Louis is going to leave her... and with thinking that, she demands Louis make a dollmaker from one of her favorite shops, by the name Sybelle, immortal. Louis desperately denies him ever leaving her, but still ends up making Sybelle immortal, in one of the most emotional and powerful scenes in the movie. And as soon as this resentful deed is done, Armand's vampires (from the Theatre Des Vampires) come and take them to the theatre. Santonio then orders Sybelle and Claudia executed, and Louis to be shut up in a coffin for eternity. They want to punish them because Santonio thinks Louis killed his maker, and also, though not known to Louis ever before, children are NOT allowed to be made vampires.Unfortunately, the killing of Claudia and Sybelle is successful- with regretful Armand shutting himself up in a room while the three screamed for him beforehand- but he gets Louis out right away, who then discovers the bodies of the two vampires, and then- in one of my favorite scenes- slowly walks out of the room and turns to the vampires, with the most powerful glow in his eyes, full of hatred. And for a good reason. That night, he returns, and burns the Theatre Des Vampires to the ground, killing all of them except Armand, who then saves Louis from the daylight, as he wasn't exactly keeping track of time while destroying all of his enemies. The two are then together, but not for long. In an emotional scene, Louis confronts him, and of how he could have stopped them, and with that, leaves Armand.This is the part that kills you. The music from the beginning comes back- Medley, the theme song, which is extremely sad- and as it was as his last days of mortality, when he longed to die, the mood is the exact same but worse. By now anyone watching the film feels his pain terribly, and he talks about what he did after that, recklessly traveling from country to country. But the world was a tomb to me; a graveyard full of broken statues, and each of those statues resembled her face. He then tells of how the technological miracle, film, let him see the sunrise for the first time in 200 years. The movie is definitely concluding, but not before Lestat pops up again. Coming out of the theater, Louis catches the scent of death as he walks into a graveyard... but it wasn't coming from the graves. He continues to walk and then finds Lestat, weak, dry, his back to him, talking in a small voice. The reunion isn't too long... in a touching moment, Louis comforts Lestat when he fearfully cowers when a pilot comes over them, and then, pretty much Lestat telling him of how he can be like he was in the old days, Louis simply says I have to go and leaves him there. He then goes on to say he lives on, night after night, feeding on those who cross his path. The scene comes back to the setting of the first, where Louis has just told this all to an eager reporter (Christian Slater) by the name of Daniel. Daniel then comes to say that he's not dead, and with a sudden outburst, Louis comes and threatens him, scaring Daniel away. He runs out of the building and into his car, racing along the street. Daniel then starts to calm down, joking to himself a little, when suddenly Lestat comes up behind him and sinks his fangs into his neck. Daniel screams out as the car swerves madly on a fast moving highway, and then, Lestat, regaining the wheel, hears Louis' tape playing. Have you heard enough? I've had to listen to that... for centuries! Lestat sneers, then turning it back to the radio. Don't be afraid. I'm going to give you the choice...I, never had.He then looks at Daniel and starts laughing mockingly, which, is a very funny ending, as it reminds you of his cockiness in the beginning of the movie. It ends with an upbeat tune of 'Guns and Roses', the singer actually telling about his immortality when the credits come on. This, truly, is a classic.The movie goes through three stages Louis becoming a Vampire- His meeting Lestat and learning the ways of a vampire, the suffering even more intense and neverending. Falling in Love- A part of the movie where it's actually funny and somewhat high spirited, how he fell in love with Claudia, still mixed in with a vampiric sense of evil. And then... the happiness ends. Surviving it All- Conclusion to the movie, where it's back to where it was in the beginning, only far worse. The last scene is great and it sets the mood for the other Anne Rice books, and the upcoming sequel of this movie, 'Queen of the Damned' due out in October, starring Aaliyah (none of the IWTV cast).If you can understand English, you should see this movie. I love it! If you want more info email me. It truly is a classic. ","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"29 July 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I can't say I read the book before seeing this film, but the movie based off of Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire has inspired me to, and not only did I read the book, but I actually have the whole series now and am awaiting her future writings.Interview with the Vampire takes you into the world of Louis de Pointe du Lac, a two hundred year old vampire who tells the tale of his eternal life of hunger, betrayal, love, and suffering. The general mood of the movie is quite depressing, but this doesn't take you off guard, as the plot immediately sets in as soon as it starts, so make sure you're prepared from the beginning. Almost all of the movie is set in the late 1700s, then continues on a bit further, then briefly goes over the events throughout the nineteenth century. A note beforehand This movie has some gore... it's not all about feeding on helpless victims or special effects, but about the first hour may seem very gory for some people, but this doesn't last long at all, so don't for one second start to think this is what the movie's all about.**SPOILER WARNING** Anyway, the immortal Louis (Brad Pitt) tells of his life as a vampire and his own personal hell. These vampires are beyond amazing- they are not just bloodsucking creatures, and feel as they felt as humans. This captivating tale takes you back to 1791, where Louis has turned suicidal what with the recent deaths of his wife and infant son. He roams to taverns, drunk, picking fights, with an invitation open to anyone to end his life. Soon a vampire, by the name of Lestat (Tom Cruise) offers Louis a life without pain, one that cannot end. Ever. Louis accepts, not really knowing what he's getting into, and so therefore Lestat transforms him into a vampire. Immediately the movie's theme mood is set Louis is distressed. He despises his vampiric ways (You'll find out MUCH more about this if you read the book) and hates to kill more than anything. As explained in the novel, he was extremely sensitive about death due to his family's death, and simply could not take a human life. When he did kill, he felt awful and throughout his time with Lestat went bitter. As the movie continues- and you're praying for poor Louis to be happy- fights start breaking out between him and his maker, who only wants Louis to share his love of human blood and immortal power. Then, one night, when Louis' hunger was unbearable, he drank from a little girl named Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) and Lestat appeared... then, as a gift (as said in the book, but in the movie it's more brutal) Lestat makes her as one of them. Thankfully, the scenery changes, and there are a number of funny scenes- Claudia's clumsiness and Lestat's inevitable impatience- then, of course, Claudia started asking questions. After all, she was made immortal in such a small body and seeing all the older and larger women, she grew distraught and closer to Louis. In an unforgettable scene, she throws all her dolls out of a trunk and Lestat sees she hid a dead mortal in there... then, in a fury, she screams at Lestat and Louis, demanding answers, and then cuts her hair and runs into her room, only to scream even more hysterically when she sees it has all grown back in a matter of seconds. From here on, she is as Louis is, and then the plotting begins.Let me add that this took me totally by surprise when I first saw the movie. Claudia had come to hate Lestat so much that she hints of killing him- and then does. Sweetly, she makes peace with him and leads him to two 'drunk' boys, who are actually dead, but filled with a poison that keeps their blood warm. As a rule, vampires can't drink dead blood or they'll go down into death with their victim. And so did Lestat... and in another breathtaking scene, he drinks from one of the boys and starts gasping for breath, thrashing around on the room and yelling for Louis, but by the time Louis arrives, Claudia has just cut Lestat's throat, and the two watch- Louis in shock, Claudia only smiling- as Lestat chokes on his blood and shrivels down on the floor, dead. The two fledgings then drop Lestat's body into the swamp, figuring the blood put an end to him. The two make plans for Paris, both wanting to seek out others of 'their kind' as Claudia put it, and then, on the night of their leave, they hear someone at the door. In a heart pumping scene, Louis opens it and sees no one is there. In a long moment of silence, he looks around strangely, and then turns around in confusion, when suddenly Lestat jumps up and shoves Louis against the wall, his hand around his throat. Louis then slams the door on Lestat's hand, making him back off into the street.He picks up Claudia and the two run up the stairs. Entering a room, they stop in fear as music from the piano suddenly starts playing, and they see Lestat is there, alive and well... but, not exactly. The makeup in this scene is excellent.

Stone gave us his theory movies about the presidency of Richard Nixon and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. But it is Platoon that most vividly shows us the reality of the Vietnam War. It is based on Stone's personal experience and that perhaps is why it was so much easier to stick to the facts in this account, rather than try to fill in huge gaps with mere guesses as he did in Nixon and JFK. (Just so you will know, I like both of those films but too many people view them as Gospel truth rather than one man's take on what MIGHT possibly have happened. In Platoon we are carried through a private's personal tour of duty from start to finish. His name is Chris and his story is based loosely on the director's own experiences. Chris and his Platoon are soon torn between two points of view between conflicting leaders. Sgt. Barnes is tied to the code of following the orders of superiors. Barnes doesn't believe in questioning (as long as he is not the one doing it), much less out and out not obeying orders from a superior officer. That is the machine and as Barnes says if the machine breaks down we break down. Sgt. Elias is more of a diplomat and steps in when Barnes takes things into his own hands and disobeys the rules of humanity. Barnes is still intent on winning the war. Elias has given up hope and sees his job as trying to get out alive and take as many as he can from his Platoon back home with him. Killing for survival is allowed, but killing for revenge or for advantage is no longer a part of the war for him.Chris ultimately has to choose which one of these voices he will listen to. There are times when Chris seems very much in agreement with Barnes and there are other times when Elias shines through his actions. It is this conflict for Chris' soul that drives this film to its final climax. Who Chris ultimately sides with may not even be clearly answered. Remember actions speak louder than words. Aside from the characters themselves Platoon clearly demonstrates that most Americans who died in Vietnam were viewed as expendable human beings whose worth back home was not much. The American government sent these men over there to fight the government's war. Of course if you were in college you didn't have to fight and where do you think the government official's kids were? Stone does a great job in not letting us know exactly what the soldiers were trying to accomplish. This took away our ability to see some ultimate goal in this mishmash of gunfire and explosives. Instead we are allowed to understand the fear of moving in one direction or another. Platoon does not glorify war in the least, but let's us view the hell that it is.There are some who went to Vietnam who did not like this movie because it shows alot of the ugliness of the American soldier's relationship with Vietnamese civilians. I think it is safe to say that village annihilation did not happen all the time. I do think it happened more than we would like to admit. Were innocent people killed in Vietnam? Yes. Were children and women killed by inhumane American soldiers? Yes. Give Stone credit for not trying to sugar coat this at all, but presenting it with all its ugliness. If anything this movie has promoted healing as many of us who did not serve can at least have some way of understanding the hell that the vets went through.

If you liked this film I highly recommend Born on the Fourth of July, Stone's work that deals with the return from Vietnam.

It was obvious that the studio had no clue about how to market it one preview made it look like a zany comedy; another one months later pitched it as an adventure story. I smelled 'disaster', and yet I went to see it, because I like Terry Gilliam and Jeff Bridges. After multiple viewings, it became one of my top five films of all time. What can I say about the wonderful, indescribable anarchy that is The Fisher King? Part buddy-movie, part love-story, it is a parable for a society where cynicism is the height of chic, and genuine emotion is passe. It features four of the most heart-wrenchingly real and affecting displays of film-acting artistry ever in one movie. The main actors perfectly inhabit their roles, giving perhaps the best performances of their careers (although I have seen very few of Amanda Plummer's pictures, it is hard to imagine her topping this). Jeff Bridges is great, as always, playing the how-the-mighty-have-fallen character that the rest of the movie hinges on. Mercedes Ruehl is superb (Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) as Anne, the tough-talking babe with a soft heart for Bridges' self-loathing, embittered Jack. Robin Williams keeps his manic side just enough in check that he does not become tiresome, and he creates a memorable portrait of the  schizophrenic Parry. Amanda Plummer finds some tidbits of self-respect in her cripplingly shy and self-conscious Lydia.Another strength is the Oscar-nominated screenplay by Richard LaGravenese. Tellingly, there is a single author, unlike the multi-writer rehashes so common in current (July '01) movies. Without ever lecturing, The Fisher King addresses serious issues homelessness, AIDS, mental illness, mass murder, public health care, the pervasive influence of mass media. Yet much of the film is quite humorous. The dialog is insightful and very witty, giving each character their own voice.*****SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!*******The excellent writing and performances join forces to create some unforgettable, genuinely moving scenes. The I don't drink coffee exchange between Parry and Lydia, the breakup scene between Jack and Anne, Parry's mad flight to the river, the Home Free sequence including Jack's encounter with Michael Jeter's character, Tom Waits' cameo as a 'moral traffic light' - any one of these would be a standout moment in any movie. The Fisher King is just one gem after another, with very few weak scenes (Jack's burglary of 'the Grail', Parry's monologue about the 'fat fairies').***************END SPOILERS!!!****************  Terry Gilliam finds just the right tone for the material. He uses Parry's madness to introduce the fantasy elements found in all of his films. The visuals are perfectly in sync with the story odd shifts in perspective, unusual camera angles are used to open up Parry and Jack's New York for the audience. By entering Parry's world, Jack discovers that worldly success is meaningless without true love (the real 'Holy Grail'). The Fisher King is one of the most unapologetically romantic movies ever made.   This is one of those exceedingly rare times where all of the elements - the writing, acting, Gilliam's fantasy touches, the evocative score, and the storyline of personal redemption, unselfishness, and true love -  come together to create a truly enjoyable, unique, and rewarding movie.

The new Planet of the Apes immediately got off on the wrong foot with me when in the first few minutes of the movie Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) disobeys his commanding officer and takes a pod cruiser from the station.  It's stupid and it makes no sense.  The script writers could have come up with a dozen better ways to get him out into the storm in the pod.  It just makes the characters unbelievable from the start.Once we're down on the planet, things move along, but we don't seem to make any real progress in character development.  Why does Ari (Helena Bonham-Carter) care so much for the humans?  What's with Karubi (Kris Kristofferson)?  He shows up, but the character never develops.  Daena (Estella Warren) is easy on the eyes, but contributes little else. Ultimately I didn't really care all that much about these people.  There was no outpouring of sympathy from the audience when any of the characters died. That's because no one cared.I could possibly accept the complete lack of characterization if this were an action flick.  It failed there also.  The climactic fight sequence needs re-editing.  The climax was incredibly slow moving.  The pacing during the climax was all wrong.  For no apparent reason, this kid that we barely see and know nothing about (Birn, played by Luke Eberl) is all over this sequence.  Why?  Please, cut him, or at least make us care about him.  The climax needs to be tightened up a lot.Leo also manages to reinforce his stupidity with his plan (or lack thereof) for the climactic battle sequence.  Why blow your one big shot on the initial charge?  Why not come up with a plan that take advantage of your enemies obsession to make a bigger dent in the attacking army?  I like movies where the characters are smart or clever, again the characters just stumble along here with barely a semblance of a plan.  (Leo's escape sequence earlier in the movie suffers from the same problems.  He gets away, but it's mostly dumb luck.)The conversion of Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) is also just not believable.All of this could have been fixed with a better script and better editing.
