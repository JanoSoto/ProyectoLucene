In this kind of society, welcome to those who don't not belong to Wild West, with death.

In this film violence is showed clearly and in terms of mine, it is the negative point of the film that companies with some how exaggeration. e.g. when Wilson, one of the appointed person by Dickinson for killing Blake, easily eat hand of some body, who had killed his father and mother and eaten them. He plays many violence scenes over the film. Brutality is exhibited heinously in Dead Man. More over the West American hatred to religion shows clearly at the scene when Wilson, pushes his foot on the head of the killed one by the Blake, in way his head burst and says Looks like a goddamn religious icon. It shows the most detest to religious peoples. In pointing to cruel affair of white people, even Nobody says to Blake, from now you'll write your poetries by blood. Making this film in Black and White is another points that Jarmusch wants to point it, in terms of mine he wanted to say all of the people are equal for God, and what comes to be different among the people of the world are their action, behavior and their believe. In this film, for white men, there is nothing to be important just wild action, killing and individualism. I think, this film overall points to 2 notes the first one the West American society, which just in seeking to supremacy and hegemony, had killed millions of people around the world in order to prove its power to the world and possesses the world and to be the despot in the world, so for reaching this, does any thing; and the second one, points to those who think America is the end of the world, who in order to going there, resorting to any kinds of actions blindly.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Western"},{"date":"23 November 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When most people talk about this movie they usually refer to the violence. The extent of the violence portrayed at the beginning of the movie was enough to attract an R rating, though this was lowered to an MA rating because of the purpose of the violence. When I spoke to people about it they seem to dwell upon this point and even talked about the images that went through their minds when they went to sleep and woke up. The image that went through my mind was that of the soldiers under water getting struck by the bullets.The movie opens with the landing at Normandy and graphically shows the horror of this beachhead. This part of the movie I thought was the best part because it really draws out the horror, futility, and waste of war. People were getting healed only to be shot and the bloodbath was intense. The impact of this scene was even greater when three brothers, in three different locations, are killed and their mother is due to receive notice of their death on the same day. Thus the decision is made that they must travel into France and rescue Private Joe Ryan, a paratrooper who was misdropped.The major theme in this movie is the horror of war and this is picked up at the beginning and the whole goal. Mother Ryan is devastated because three of her son's are dead and thus the US army chooses to rescue the forth son because the war has had a great impact on her already and they decide that they need to comfort her by returning to her her only son.Yet there is a purpose behind this war, and even though we look at the immense waste, especially in the beginning, we are reminded through the rest of the movie that the cause they are fighting for is just. They are fighting an oppressive power that intends to enslave the world and as such they are fighting for a noble cause. Even though the cause may be noble, we are reminded that this war brought about an immense waste of life.The violence was graphic at the beginning but as the movie draws near to the end the violence becomes more glorified. The scene that comes to mind is when the soldiers on the tank are shot to pieces with the chaingun. This scene, though graphic and probably realistic, is still, to me, glorified.Purpose is another theme in this movie. The purpose of the mission is to rescue one young man, and throughout the mission they are complaining that they are not helping the war progress. Tom Hanks talks about how when he loses a man he thinks of the thousands of lives that he has saved, but there is an ominous feeling that there is no point to this mission but to save a pathetic little kid; thus it is ironic that when they do find Private Ryan, he refuses to leave his post because they hold one of the only two bridges that Rommel can bring his tanks across to repel the Allied landings.Salvation is another theme that runs through this movie. Unfortunately it is salvation by works. When Ryan is saved, Hanks says to him, earn it, suggesting that he must now pay back in good deeds for what Hanks has done for him. Then fifty years later he asks his wife (in front of a large family) if he has been good, to which his wife replies, Yes. This I feel is quite irritating because it suggests that we can earn our salvation, which is not possible. Paying back bad deeds with good is like paying off a loan with a credit card, it simply gets you nowhere. Our sin is so bad and twisted that there is no way we can earn our way into God's good books. Instead we must rely upon what he has done for us, and that is punished his son Jesus instead of us and by trusting this we will be forgiven for what we have done.Saving Private Ryan, I think, has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it falls down in a number of places.

The extent of the violence portrayed at the beginning of the movie was enough to attract an R rating, though this was lowered to an MA rating because of the purpose of the violence. When I spoke to people about it they seem to dwell upon this point and even talked about the images that went through their minds when they went to sleep and woke up. The image that went through my mind was that of the soldiers under water getting struck by the bullets.The movie opens with the landing at Normandy and graphically shows the horror of this beachhead. This part of the movie I thought was the best part because it really draws out the horror, futility, and waste of war. People were getting healed only to be shot and the bloodbath was intense. The impact of this scene was even greater when three brothers, in three different locations, are killed and their mother is due to receive notice of their death on the same day. Thus the decision is made that they must travel into France and rescue Private Joe Ryan, a paratrooper who was misdropped.The major theme in this movie is the horror of war and this is picked up at the beginning and the whole goal. Mother Ryan is devastated because three of her son's are dead and thus the US army chooses to rescue the forth son because the war has had a great impact on her already and they decide that they need to comfort her by returning to her her only son.Yet there is a purpose behind this war, and even though we look at the immense waste, especially in the beginning, we are reminded through the rest of the movie that the cause they are fighting for is just. They are fighting an oppressive power that intends to enslave the world and as such they are fighting for a noble cause. Even though the cause may be noble, we are reminded that this war brought about an immense waste of life.The violence was graphic at the beginning but as the movie draws near to the end the violence becomes more glorified. The scene that comes to mind is when the soldiers on the tank are shot to pieces with the chaingun. This scene, though graphic and probably realistic, is still, to me, glorified.Purpose is another theme in this movie. The purpose of the mission is to rescue one young man, and throughout the mission they are complaining that they are not helping the war progress. Tom Hanks talks about how when he loses a man he thinks of the thousands of lives that he has saved, but there is an ominous feeling that there is no point to this mission but to save a pathetic little kid; thus it is ironic that when they do find Private Ryan, he refuses to leave his post because they hold one of the only two bridges that Rommel can bring his tanks across to repel the Allied landings.Salvation is another theme that runs through this movie. Unfortunately it is salvation by works. When Ryan is saved, Hanks says to him, earn it, suggesting that he must now pay back in good deeds for what Hanks has done for him. Then fifty years later he asks his wife (in front of a large family) if he has been good, to which his wife replies, Yes. This I feel is quite irritating because it suggests that we can earn our salvation, which is not possible. Paying back bad deeds with good is like paying off a loan with a credit card, it simply gets you nowhere. Our sin is so bad and twisted that there is no way we can earn our way into God's good books. Instead we must rely upon what he has done for us, and that is punished his son Jesus instead of us and by trusting this we will be forgiven for what we have done.Saving Private Ryan, I think, has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it falls down in a number of places.

Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman get mentioned all the time but the Mummy? His Egyptian setting causes him to stick out among the classic European horrors. This is odd because The Mummy is very much a Gothic story, one that wouldn't have been out of place during the genre's literary heyday.There's a world of difference between '31 and '32. A good third of The Mummy is scored, with trembling but effective pieces of music. Karl Freund, the man responsible for the look of Dracula and Frankenstein, directs with a creative, steady hand. The early scenes of Imhotep in his tomb never reveal too much. The camera roams the museum, eying the artifacts in one scene while slowly revealing a praying Ardith Bay in another. My favorite shot involves a cutaway from Ankh-es-en-Amon's death-mask to the face of Zita Johann, her modern descendant. It's a beautifully shot film. The desert dunes and dusty streets of Cairo don't afford much opportunity for foggy atmosphere. The film makes up with its mythic, mystical tone. Similarly, the set design is more subtle then Frankenstein or Dracula, but its attention to detail lends some verisimilitude to the proceedings.Really, it's all about Karloff. Imhotep is one of the more intriguing figures in the Universal canon. He's undeniably sinister. He makes no attempt to hide his hideous nature and openly threatens the cast. His imposing stature and cruelly deployed powers make it clear he can back up any claims up. However, Imhotep is also a romantic figure. His actions, no matter how monstrous, are motivated by love. His desires are obsessive, dangerous, but all too human. This dynamic is best displayed in the scene when Helen and Ardith Bay first meet. He towers over her, standing uncomfortably close, his hypnotic eyes staring down. She's seems similarly frightened and enchanted. The love between them is real and, at least a part of her, shares Bay's obsession. Helen is given a human love interest in Frank Whemple but their love-at-first-sight relationship is unconvincing compared to Imhotep's century-spanning passion. Karloff's performance is fantastic, proving he had range beyond Frankenstein, while Zita Johann's intriguing good looks, her round face and big eyes, perfectly embodied the time swept princess.Ancient Egyptian magic is completely alive in this setting, a surprising move. A modern Nubian immediately submits to Imhotep's slavery. The mummy's powers are unstoppable, with a charm of Isis being the only protection. In the film's primarily narrative gaff, a climatic call for help from the gods proves successful. There's a creaky spookiness to the film, especially its sacrificial ending. The film is well edited, avoids most pacing issues, the performances are assured, the direction solid, and the story rife with complex themes. The modest goals are wildly exceeded. In some ways, it's a better film then Dracula, which it's frequently compared too.

'Gimme some sugar baby'...oh wait that's the third most iconic horror film ever.So up to a few years ago I was a little confused by this sequel. The plot appears to show 'Ash' venturing back up to a remote cabin with another girlfriend, was this the original cabin or a completely new one? I asked myself. As things progress (very quickly) Ash discovers yet another recorder which he plays and inadvertently sets the dark demonic forces free again. It was at this point I was thinking why on earth Ash would do that? didn't he learn from his first cabin experience? and when you think about it why the hell would he go back to a remote cabin?! dude seriously!.Twas then I found out that this sequel is actually a reboot of the first film, yet Raimi called it Evil Dead 2 as though its a continuation of the first. The plot is exactly the same as the first film because its a remake basically, a remake with better effects, more action and less build up...essentially more game time. Ash is even wearing the same outfit he had on in the first film!. So yes that is a bit confusing if you're not in the know but somehow it doesn't matter, the film is so damn fun you let it slide. Myself I think he should of avoided the 2 in the title and tried to make it follow the first but hey.As I said there's no messing around in this film, no sooner has Ash arrived at the cabin he's released the demons and all hell is breaking loose. This is good as we know the basic outline from the first film, everybody simply wanted to see more of Ash kicking undead ass. And that is exactly what we get with much sweeter looking effects.The effects are much the same type of thing as in the first but due to success and extra mula they are simply better. Of course by today's standards they aren't that good, a bit basic, any fresh faced kids are gonna laugh at most of it truth be told. But again its the old adage that with little money and tech you've gotta work to make your film look good. You've gotta be inventive and once again Raimi and co excel with their visuals. A nice blend of classic makeup, mask work, models, stop motion, bluescreen, miniatures, puppets etc...the full gamut of special effects to bring every creature alive in the best possible way.Personally I loved the sequence where 'Linda's' corpse rises from the grave and then dances around in the swirling bleak mist as Ash watches in horror from the cabin. The whole scene is using classic stop motion and even though it of course looks a bit hokey the atmosphere is just so flippin eerie. It could almost be a Tim Burton moment. There is so much to enjoy here, chock full of tasty visual kookiness, the severed hand that scrambles around, the excellent possessed makeup jobs on the survivors and Campbell especially and then there's the huge demon head\/face thing at the end. Corny as hell but so much fun.Its also no secret that this sequel was taken down the horror comedy route. The first film was suppose to be an all out horror but this started down that surreal goofy route which has now become so legendary. Not for the most part though, most of the film is still very dark, some of the demonic sequences are clearly more slapstick but its still evil looking. Its only when the last female survivor crafts Ash's chainsaw onto his bloody stump along with his shoulder mounted shotgun do we finally cross over fully into the comic book\/graphic novel genre. Its at this moment that Ash becomes a superhero of sorts and enters into the world of merchandise.Does this mood swing cause any problems? no, no it doesn't, in fact it just makes the film even more awesome and gives it a whole new scope. We go from classic horror gore with Ash being the victim in all manner of slapstick tomfoolery, to action man gore and violence with the start of ice cool witty quips and full on hero posing.It is strange how this franchise developed no doubt about that, plus the oddity of rebooting\/remaking his first film virtually scene by scene and calling it a sequel. Like the first its not really scary but this time it was never meant to be scary, its a wild ride bordering on fantasy that happens to have a lot of blood and goo. Its one of those perfect 'sequels' where everything is just right, it all works...even the bits that kinda don't work, work. There are moments of great horror and moments that are almost childish in nature, you could even say its a satire of certain grotty horrors. End of the day Campbell can simply make these things work.No excuses here, its a balls to the wall, hyper demonic blood n ooze frenzy with typically gritty low budget ferocity and absurd creations. A completely cheesy turbo charged B-movie of diabolically hellish proportions, you wanted it you got it...and its groovy baby.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 November 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Sam Raimi already gave us one of the most iconic horror films ever devised by man so what does he do next? he gives us the sequel which is even more iconic than the previous film!.

'Gimme some sugar baby'...oh wait that's the third most iconic horror film ever.So up to a few years ago I was a little confused by this sequel. The plot appears to show 'Ash' venturing back up to a remote cabin with another girlfriend, was this the original cabin or a completely new one? I asked myself. As things progress (very quickly) Ash discovers yet another recorder which he plays and inadvertently sets the dark demonic forces free again. It was at this point I was thinking why on earth Ash would do that? didn't he learn from his first cabin experience? and when you think about it why the hell would he go back to a remote cabin?! dude seriously!.Twas then I found out that this sequel is actually a reboot of the first film, yet Raimi called it Evil Dead 2 as though its a continuation of the first. The plot is exactly the same as the first film because its a remake basically, a remake with better effects, more action and less build up...essentially more game time. Ash is even wearing the same outfit he had on in the first film!. So yes that is a bit confusing if you're not in the know but somehow it doesn't matter, the film is so damn fun you let it slide. Myself I think he should of avoided the 2 in the title and tried to make it follow the first but hey.As I said there's no messing around in this film, no sooner has Ash arrived at the cabin he's released the demons and all hell is breaking loose. This is good as we know the basic outline from the first film, everybody simply wanted to see more of Ash kicking undead ass. And that is exactly what we get with much sweeter looking effects.The effects are much the same type of thing as in the first but due to success and extra mula they are simply better. Of course by today's standards they aren't that good, a bit basic, any fresh faced kids are gonna laugh at most of it truth be told. But again its the old adage that with little money and tech you've gotta work to make your film look good. You've gotta be inventive and once again Raimi and co excel with their visuals. A nice blend of classic makeup, mask work, models, stop motion, bluescreen, miniatures, puppets etc...the full gamut of special effects to bring every creature alive in the best possible way.Personally I loved the sequence where 'Linda's' corpse rises from the grave and then dances around in the swirling bleak mist as Ash watches in horror from the cabin. The whole scene is using classic stop motion and even though it of course looks a bit hokey the atmosphere is just so flippin eerie. It could almost be a Tim Burton moment. There is so much to enjoy here, chock full of tasty visual kookiness, the severed hand that scrambles around, the excellent possessed makeup jobs on the survivors and Campbell especially and then there's the huge demon head\/face thing at the end. Corny as hell but so much fun.Its also no secret that this sequel was taken down the horror comedy route. The first film was suppose to be an all out horror but this started down that surreal goofy route which has now become so legendary. Not for the most part though, most of the film is still very dark, some of the demonic sequences are clearly more slapstick but its still evil looking. Its only when the last female survivor crafts Ash's chainsaw onto his bloody stump along with his shoulder mounted shotgun do we finally cross over fully into the comic book\/graphic novel genre. Its at this moment that Ash becomes a superhero of sorts and enters into the world of merchandise.Does this mood swing cause any problems? no, no it doesn't, in fact it just makes the film even more awesome and gives it a whole new scope.

This is a sensitive salute to the people of the land, spiritual in their own natural way, that may not have needed Christians from Europe to tell them how to live their lives and worship. To these human beings, the white man is a dangerous fool, yet they are not above showing those truly interested in how their traditions had shaped their lives long before they were basically decimated by the military moving their way into territory already taken through nature, not through a paper deed.For Jack Crabb, the 110 year old survivor of Custer's Last Stand, he means to tell the truth about his findings, having been brought up by the Cheyennes after all but him and his sister were massacred by the Pawnees. Dustin Hoffman essays this part with sensitivity and grace, convincingly aging from teen to octogenarian, tells his story to the seemingly exploitive reporter, played by a younger, but very recognizable William Hickey. Jack was basically raised by the Cheyennes until captured by the military and turned over to a minister and his much younger wife (Faye Dunaway, looking striking here), then ending up with a traveling medicine salesman (Martin Balsam) before heading back to see the people who raised him, especially the wonderful adoptive grandfather, played warmly by Chief Dan George in a well-deserved Oscar Nominated performance.You can see why the natives referred to the Caucasians the way they do, and over a century later, you may want to shake your head at the evil that many white men do in the name of conquest, power and greed. This is a film to make you really think of where our world has gone in just a short period of time since our ancestors separated from England and took over what is now known as North America. The lives of the Cheyennes are a noble one, from the adoptive brother who resents Hoffman for having saved his life and owes him a life, after which he feels he can freely kill Hoffman without being considered evil, to the sweet and honored homosexual native who stayed at home with the women yet was never shamed for it by the warriors in his tribe.There's also the various women in Hoffman's life, from his very masculine sister (who seems to long to be ravished by a man, any man), his Swedish wife who ends up being kidnapped by Indians in a raid on their stagecoach (and ends up in the most ironic of places), and Ms. Dunaway, teaching Hoffman the values of chastity yet not quite following that rule herself. Then, there's the single or widowed young Cheyenne women who all openly lust for Hoffman in their quest to become mothers, and this leads to the battle lead by George Armstrong Custer (played by the usually comic Richard Mulligan in a way that will totally surprise you) where everything comes together that changes the destiny of history for the natives given land by the government but suddenly forced to fight to keep it.Sometimes, the film seems like it was edited in a way that cut out several key scenes, probably deemed necessary at the time by its extreme over-length. Even at almost 2 1\/2 hours, it never seems to drag, unlike the similar Dances With Wolves which flowed from situation to situation and always seemed to be concluding before heading into a new area of its story. The wonderful Jeff Corey has a nice small role as Wild Bill Hickcock, and like Dunaway, Balsam and Mulligan, you always hope they will turn up in later scenes to further spice things up for the wonderfully hero essayed excellently by Hoffman who even here as a young actor shows the chops of a veteran.

Even if the details are missing or changed around the spirit of the source material is welcome(though I try not to be a purist, I have always believed in judging things on their own merits), something that the second half of this film doesn't really do. It is not an awful film, there are a lot of impressive things but it didn't entirely work and fares the weakest film version of Les Miserables.It is very beautifully shot and the costumes, settings and scenery are authentic(at least it doesn't look too clean) and very easy on the eye, so it is a very well-made film. Basil Poledouris' music score is as stirring and hauntingly beautiful as is characteristic of him and his other scores like Conan the Barbarian and Hunt for Red October. Billie August at least directs with style and pace without being too flashy or dull, though it's the kind that gets the job done admirably but passion-wise rather lukewarm. There are three excellent performances as well.Liam Neeson commands the screen as he always does and gives a real nobility and dignity to Valjean, with an effort in the first half to make him compassionate, the second half doesn't allow for him to go into as much depth as it could and should but Neeson, the great and conscientious actor he is, gives it his all. Geoffrey Rush's Javert is ruthlessly cold and authoritative, yet there is signs of a tortured soul too which stops Javert from being too one-dimensional. On paper, Uma Thurman seemed all wrong, on film she is a deeply moving Fantine(even perfectly fitting the role physically) and of the adaptations her Fantine is one of the better developed ones. Peter Vaughn is appropriately kindly as the Bishop,and young Cosette is adorable. The first half was excellent to me, fidelity to the book is strong, Fantine's plight is very tragic and poignant and Valjean and young Cosette's escape from Javert and to the Convent does have a tension to it.Unfortunately the second half doesn't maintain that promise, the production values, music and Neeson and Rush's performances are still top drawer, but Claire Danes, the characterisation and the ending are off. Claire Danes I found terrible as Cosette, she is both a spoiled brat\/rich girl and completely bland(it's like her Juliet from Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet again) and her pouting is annoying. Hans Mattheson fares a little better but not much, he has the looks but he is stiff and tries too hard, also coming across as a rather wimpy leader for the barricade. The ending has no emotional impact whatsoever and is very abrupt, if you have not read the book or seen the musical you will be asking why Javert committed suicide, in fact this is the sort of adaptation that evokes more questions than answers.

Even if the details are missing or changed around the spirit of the source material is welcome(though I try not to be a purist, I have always believed in judging things on their own merits), something that the second half of this film doesn't really do. It is not an awful film, there are a lot of impressive things but it didn't entirely work and fares the weakest film version of Les Miserables.It is very beautifully shot and the costumes, settings and scenery are authentic(at least it doesn't look too clean) and very easy on the eye, so it is a very well-made film. Basil Poledouris' music score is as stirring and hauntingly beautiful as is characteristic of him and his other scores like Conan the Barbarian and Hunt for Red October. Billie August at least directs with style and pace without being too flashy or dull, though it's the kind that gets the job done admirably but passion-wise rather lukewarm. There are three excellent performances as well.Liam Neeson commands the screen as he always does and gives a real nobility and dignity to Valjean, with an effort in the first half to make him compassionate, the second half doesn't allow for him to go into as much depth as it could and should but Neeson, the great and conscientious actor he is, gives it his all. Geoffrey Rush's Javert is ruthlessly cold and authoritative, yet there is signs of a tortured soul too which stops Javert from being too one-dimensional. On paper, Uma Thurman seemed all wrong, on film she is a deeply moving Fantine(even perfectly fitting the role physically) and of the adaptations her Fantine is one of the better developed ones. Peter Vaughn is appropriately kindly as the Bishop,and young Cosette is adorable. The first half was excellent to me, fidelity to the book is strong, Fantine's plight is very tragic and poignant and Valjean and young Cosette's escape from Javert and to the Convent does have a tension to it.Unfortunately the second half doesn't maintain that promise, the production values, music and Neeson and Rush's performances are still top drawer, but Claire Danes, the characterisation and the ending are off. Claire Danes I found terrible as Cosette, she is both a spoiled brat\/rich girl and completely bland(it's like her Juliet from Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet again) and her pouting is annoying. Hans Mattheson fares a little better but not much, he has the looks but he is stiff and tries too hard, also coming across as a rather wimpy leader for the barricade.

This time, I realized Dracula is set in the modern day. During the flower girl scene, you hear a car horn and see modern street lamps. Another question I ask for the first time Why did Dracula disguise himself as the carriage driver? Why hide his face? Despite this question, it is one of the most atmospheric scenes in a film built primarily on atmosphere.Modern critiques tend to say Lugosi is the sole graceful factor in a stagy film. True but don't undersell. Karl Freund's camera is not stationary. A pan around Renfield's shoulder, a slow move up steps, a panorama of Seward's sanatorium. Renfield leering from the ship or the shadow of the captain lashed to the wheel are just two chilling scenes. The use of shadows is toned down from Universal's silents and it's generally agreed that Freund's artistry was held back by Todd Browning. Wither Browning had trouble adapting to sound or was still grieving for Lon Chaney (and the version of Dracula they had planned on making) is debated.Either way, you can't deny the power of these images. The early shots of Dracula's castle, the brides awaking in the catacombs, the illogical armadillos, beetles in tiny coffins, Lugosi's glaring eyes. These images are the base upon which all American horror films are built. They still send chills up a viewer's spine seventy years later. The set design is incredible, particularly the dusty staircase of Castle Dracula or the ruins of Carfax Abbey. Supporting the sets are fantastic glass painted backgrounds.I won't waste words on why Lugosi is the iconic Dracula. He exudes an authority over everyone simply with his body language. Shots of him doing nothing but standing in shadow-swept doorways manage to be creepy.Given Dracula's sway over the opposite sex, it's easy to understand while the vampire is a fantasized character for men. But why is the vampire a sex symbol for women? The film is split on the issue. The scene of Dracula cornering the flower girl brings to mind nothing but sexual assault. I believe Dracula leaning over the sleeping bodies of his prey aren't meant to be provocative but rather to invoke classical nightmare imagery. We are all vulnerable when we sleep and many horror films prey on that innate vulnerably. (Yep, I just traced a line from Dracula to Freddy.) Dracula is feared by his female victims, yet still oddly attractive. Lucy doesn't seem totally asleep when Dracula comes for her. A later scene, where Mina walks into the count's arms, his cape wrapped around her, blending in with the shadows, is undoubtedly romantic. The vampire is a man with complete control over his females, psychic and sexual. Why women would desire such a mate is a topic unsuited for this blog. The seductive female vampire is a horror concept not yet solidified. Mina, once turned, seems less like a willing seductress and more like a drug addict, uncontrollably forced to attack her beloved husband.The movie is flawed, no doubt. Who the heck is the main character? The count is unknowable. Harker or Seward don't do anything besides wring their hands. Van Helsing comes in too late, Lucy exits too early, while Mina is a damsel in distress. Nope, it's gotta' be Renfield. We follow him from the beginning and he features in most of the scenes. A book must exists that explores his character more. There's a lot of untapped potential there. Dwight Fry had enough range to play a straight-laced businessman perfectly, even if his unhinged insanity is what we remember. When his spider is thrown away, you almost feel for the guy. His monologue about Dracula presenting him with a feast of rats is great and I wonder why no other adaptation has gone into more detail about that. Why does Dracula even keep the guy around? He doesn't serve him much and is even responsible for revealing the count's hiding place.The pacing drags in the latter half, as the staged qualities take over. There's a number of narrative question marks. Lucy's story arc is oddly abbreviated. We hear about her escapades as the Woman in White but Van Helsing disposes of her off-screen. Why does Dracula have Mina just hanging around the abbey at the very end? What purpose did that serve? Renfield preys on the unconscious maid in one scene but we never find out why. The guy sure gets out of his cell easy. Dr. Seward should probably hire a new staff. Dracula's final confrontation with Van Helsing is anticlimactic. Even the weaker second half of the film has its moments, such as Dracula making eye-contact with Mina's maid or smashing the mirror out of Van Helsing's hand.I'm not begrudgingly calling it a great movie.

Scott was in some amazing films and, even though this is not as well-known as his earlier work, such as 'Dr. Strangelove' (1964), 'Patton' (1970) or 'The Hindenburg' (1975), I believe his role as heartbroken composer, John Russell to be both one of his warmest and his most unsettling performances out of those of his films that I have seen. He even works well with his real-life wife, Trish Van Devere, who I recognised from the final episode of the original 1970s run of 'Columbo'.In supporting roles, Jean Marsh makes a key dramatic impact as John Russell's tragic wife, whilst John Colicos is in full creepy mode in the small, but important role of Police Captain DeWitt. If, like me, you admire and enjoy old Seventies television series like 'Columbo' and 'Kojak' (to mention the best), you may remember Colicos as a grieving, homicidal father seeking revenge in 'Charlie's Angels'.With the benefit of not having even been born when this film was released, I can say that, for its premise, it sets the scene perfectly, Sure, at times you may feel a bit of deja vu for other, more modern horror films - but those more modern films clearly used their predecessors, such as this, as their templates.The story soon gains depth on a brilliantly unexpected scale, so much so that in it's gripping finale, I felt truly horrified when certain things began to happen that, in other horror films, seem purely routine.However, despite the beautiful blend of both expected and unexpected thrills and chills, what makes this film stand out, in my mind, is the fact that, alike so few other horror films of its time, it does not lose sight of the human side of the plot.

If, like me, you admire and enjoy old Seventies television series like 'Columbo' and 'Kojak' (to mention the best), you may remember Colicos as a grieving, homicidal father seeking revenge in 'Charlie's Angels'.With the benefit of not having even been born when this film was released, I can say that, for its premise, it sets the scene perfectly, Sure, at times you may feel a bit of deja vu for other, more modern horror films - but those more modern films clearly used their predecessors, such as this, as their templates.The story soon gains depth on a brilliantly unexpected scale, so much so that in it's gripping finale, I felt truly horrified when certain things began to happen that, in other horror films, seem purely routine.However, despite the beautiful blend of both expected and unexpected thrills and chills, what makes this film stand out, in my mind, is the fact that, alike so few other horror films of its time, it does not lose sight of the human side of the plot. Russell's tragedy is absolutely horrifying and instantly makes him a sympathetic character for the audience, which is central to driving his curiosity-turned-obsession about the grand, but lonely house that he has rented in the wake of a personal tragedy.Well-made, very well directed and well acted. Should be on the watch list of every fan of horror and\/or psychological thrillers!

The opening burial, taken place in a barren, stark graveyard, is watched over by a gruesome grim reaper statue. Colin Clive's Henry Frankenstein literally throws dirt in Death's face in this scene. Another early moment featuring Edward Von Sloan's Dr. Waldman is framed by shelves full of skulls. Fritz' robbery of the brain, his shadow cast huge on the wall, is foiled by a hanging library skeleton. The morbidity of the subject matter extends to the very structure of the film.I can't believe I never noticed the deeply expressionistic sets in this movie before. The pattern on the floor of Frankenstein's laboratory are criss-crossed at conflicting angle, putting the viewer off. The beams and walls in the tower are at askew angles, subtly evoking an otherworldly atmosphere. The Monster's prison are the sets most obviously indebted to Caligari and its ilk. The sole window appears in the center of a slouching triangle while the door is tightly squeezed between two encroaching walls. Even the hallways of the ancestral Frankenstein home are slightly in the same style. The film's extensive use of shadows and lightening seals it. Frankenstein is the extreme surreal stylings of 1920s German cinema streamlined for an American audience.Colin Clive's performance as the Doctor is sort of underrated. His more manic moments are the most famous but his quieter scenes work well too. In Mary Shelley's novel, the desire to recreate life is born out of a desire to conquer the death in his own life. In a monologue, Clive's Doctor reveals that his experiments steam from what he sees as a natural progression of man's curiosity and science. Even his softer scenes with Elizabeth have a warmest to them. Dwight Fry ultimately isn't given too much to do, due to Fritz' monosyllabic nature, but his body language still sells the character. In the final version of the film, the character of Victor doesn't serve much of a purpose. Originally there to be beside Elizabeth after Henry's demise, the revised, happier ending ultimately leaves the love triangle unresolved. It's a bit of a shame since John Boles makes the usually aggravating third wheel of the obligatory love triangle actually a pretty nice guy.The nature of Karloff's monster has been discussed endlessly. Listening to Ruby Belhmer's informative, if overly studious commentary, it's not surprising to learn that the criminal brain aspect of the script was a late addition. It seems to me that James Whale's intention was that the Creature was a pure innocent, totally child-like in nature. His reaction to Maria the flower girl's drowning is one of abject horror. He is not born a monster, but rather transformed into one by the cruelty and rejection of the world. His only truly malicious move is the murder of Dr. Waldman. Even the attempted abduction of Elizabeth could be explained away by a naive curiosity. In the original script, the doctor's laboratory was also the climatic windmill. In light of this, the Monster dragging Henry's limp body back there becomes a frightened, confused creature returning to the only home he's ever known with the only person to show him anything but cruelty in hand. The film is even more a tragedy then ever before.James Whale seems fond of side-way sliding dolly shots. He uses them numerous times, passing through the set's walls as if they were a stage play. Undoubtedly, the most memorable of these types of shot is Maria's father carrying her body through the village. Behind him, the celebrating faces of the villagers transform into frozen faces of terror, their songs dissolving into horrified screams. Though the sequel would make it obvious, Frankenstein does contain some of Whale's trademark camp humor. The elder Baron Frankenstein, fed up and disgusted with his son's antics, is the film's primarily comic relief and far more subtle then the era's usual style. The film certainly never suffers from the pacing problems Dracula has.Long time readers should know how much this film means to me. I could ramble on for pages. Instead, I'll cut it off here.
