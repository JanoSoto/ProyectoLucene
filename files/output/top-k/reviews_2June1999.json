It's the best movie of 1999 and nothing else will be better. Not even the next nominated moviesat Oscar 2000. To all the hypocrites of the public and movie reviwers who said bad things about this movieSHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sorry, but those people are movie haters and don't know anything about movies. They just go to movies for no reason and act like they're smart. They're not smart. Anyways, Episode 1 was great because it's the first chapter of one of the best stories in the world. It explains everything. Everyone was a great actor. I'm angry that people didn't like Anakin or Jar Jar Binks. THey were great. The people who didn't like them don't know what they talk about. Jar Jar was funny. He was like a creature version of Roberto Begnini. He provided great comedy for the movie. I wish people liked him as much as I did. Jake Lloyd was great as Anakin. The way he was, so energetic and ambitious. It's hard to believe that he's Darth Vader in the future. I don't want him to be Darth Vader. He was so innocent. Liam Neeson is one of our best actors in the world. He has never done a bad performance. He was great as Qui-Gon Jin. Ewan McGreggor was also great as Obi-Wan Kenobi. He acted so much like the later one you see in the later episodes. Darth Maul. He was scary. What's interesting about him is that he's a mystery character. You don't know anything about him other than he's a Sith Lord. His one expression appearence is really scary. You don't need to hear him say much because he already is a big part in the movie. Ray Park who played him of course like everyone else was great.Lightsaber fights were excellent. They were extremely intense with the music playing in the background. I was at the edge of my seat. I wouldn't want to be touched by those. The story was great. People can't say it wasn't good. You don't go to this movie to see a story made for you. It's not supposed to be like A New Hope. or Empire Strikes Back. It's immoral to not like this movie. You have to see it and call it EXCELLENT. No less than EXCELLENT. I love movies.

For me, amidst the spectacle and sweep of the movie, the idea of this conflicted man who thought he was godlike and was humbled, not only by his physical nature but also by his ability to betray that which he thought he loved, made Lawrence of Arabia unique. I'd never seen an epic movie quite like that before or since ... and it also made me become a Peter O'Toole fan forever!

This film is a true masterpiece and of epic standards.Charlton Heston gives a formidable performance in the title role. Could anyone have played it better? Highly unlikely. Heston's performance reminds me of his other great performance in The Ten Commandments, powerful at most, however, showing compassion and a desire to help out his fellow man at other times. All supporting roles are played very well, including the spiteful Pontious Pilate. An interesting note to this film is the fact that the front of Jesus is never shown on camera. The audience only sees him from behind, perhaps because the filmmakers felt it unecessary to give any lines to a man who at many times was left unspoken.Ben-Hur was a pleasure to watch, especially in its widescreen format. After all, the only way to watch the greatest moments captured on film (The Chariot Race ) is the way it was meant to be seen. Highly Recommended.9\/10 stars.

Heston's performance reminds me of his other great performance in The Ten Commandments, powerful at most, however, showing compassion and a desire to help out his fellow man at other times. All supporting roles are played very well, including the spiteful Pontious Pilate. An interesting note to this film is the fact that the front of Jesus is never shown on camera. The audience only sees him from behind, perhaps because the filmmakers felt it unecessary to give any lines to a man who at many times was left unspoken.Ben-Hur was a pleasure to watch, especially in its widescreen format. After all, the only way to watch the greatest moments captured on film (The Chariot Race ) is the way it was meant to be seen. Highly Recommended.9\/10 stars.

I think the film is more accessible for european viewers, the same way Dawn by law might be for american viewers (I can´t bear that pretentious american underground movies at all, with cool men swearing all the time, trying to be funny... I can´t identify with most of nineties american characters). There are many american art house films buffs as well, so I can´t say this is a general fact, it´s just my view anyway.Regarding the development of the characters, Tsylia probably couldn´t understand at the beginning of the film how both women are described so poeticly. Weronicka is watching at the stars, while Veronique is watching the leaves fall. I see this is not evident but it  says a lot about the two. Weronicka is more spiritual, magical, and Veronique is more practical, more down to earth. If you cannot see the metaphores throughout the film you will not grasp anything about the development of the characters, that´s for sure. Furthermore, Irene Jacob performance is sublime, you can see on her face so many difficult to express sensations, she´s not just a beautiful face as it has been stated below (I can name hundreds of pretty american girls on stupid films, I was shocked to read Irene Jacob is just pretty, couldn´t these people see she´s a valuable actress as well). In any case she´s pretty in the sense Catherine Deneuve is, I mean she´s not the common beatiful woman, you can see by his gestures that she feels alone in the world, that she feels the fullness of life, ... She sometimes seems like an angel in this film (Weronicka).I´m an atheist, but I admit the religious or spiritual feeling of the film engages anyone. The film evokes the idea that gifted people such this soprano singer have a spare part somewhere in the world, the same way the puppetier has a spare marionette for the one he uses most.God is not mentioned but the scenes are revealing Veronique caresses the bark of a thick tree in the very last scene, which could signify her real father as well, or just the idea of fatherhood.The music is ten out of ten, if you feel nothing while listening to Preisner´s masterpiece, you´d better not say you´re sensitive anymore. This is his best for me alongside with the music for Short story of a killing and Damage soundtrack which sounds cruel and mysterious to me.I can´t think of any other film more precious and lyrical than this one.

In case you are in any doubt, Mediterraneo ranks in my best three ever - a magnificent film. If you never see it, part of your life will have been unlived.Mediterraneo epitomises the difference between Hollywood and the demands of a largely US audience and the subtler approach of the European director\/writer who seeks simply to express him\/herself through the medium. I read two reviews in the Washington Post both of which managed to misunderstand the film completely, one going so far as to characterise the cast as Marx Brothers. In fact, they are probably the finest ensemble of characters I have ever seen in film - a completely disparate group of individuals who nearly all manage to find spiritual (and sexual) fulfulment in the sensuality of Aegean island life.The film is multi-layered and, the more obvious ones, such as the powerful anti-war message and the venality of post-Fascist Italy are often mentioned. But no-one has ever picked up on the phrase una face, una race which is repeated throughout the film.  This is the nostrum that Italians and Greeks have a common Mediterranean heritage (come on Washington Post hacks - didn't the title give you a clue?) and that there is an enormous irony in the Italians - who rightly pride themselves on the antiquity of their civilisation - seeking to subdue another culture whose origins are 2000 years older.This is underlined by the easy participation of the soldiers in both high and low Greek culture, .....the painting of the frescoes in the church (n.b. the Orthodox Church predating the Holy Roman Empire by centuries - clever eh!) and the wonderful unifying theme of football, which only a European or South American viewer could truly appreciate.The group's ambivalent attitude to sexual mores adds to the sense of the place as essentially a home for Greco-Roman sensuality - a fact which is gloriously exposed with the later juxtaposition of our band of heroes with the starched British Royal Navy officers who arrive to remove them from the island.I have not seen any mention in other reviews of the beautiful cadence of the Italian dialogue - as lilting as the bazouki music which accompanies much of the film.The sense of disillusionment that takes over the film at the end is very powerful and it is no accident that Salvatore shows us the Lieutenant returning to the island on a ferry full of burnt-pink tourists.This is a film that can only truly be appreciated if you have a feeling for, and understanding, of European culture. This is a film for grown-ups.Mediterraneo demonstrates that though box-office grosses for European films are small (unless it is something produced explicity for a US audience, like the truly dreadful Four Weddings) our directors have managed to stay true to their craft.If there are not enough car chases or shoot outs for you, look out for the five-star ratings in the Washington Post.Fact 1 Only 10% of Americans possess a passport Fact 2 None of them review for the Washington Post.
