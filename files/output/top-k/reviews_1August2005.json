Overall it was an enjoyable movie, about a group of superhero wannabes, who end up becoming real heroes in the end. It's a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet, because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage. After viewing this film, I finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and even that kid from Good Burger.

It really helps that the viewer realize Moore is not a director out to make bipartisan political pictures; he's angry and wants to do something to change America for the better.Stereotype #2 Roger & Me is one of the greatest documentary films of all time.The Truth Bullseye, baby - two-for-two.In 1989, Michael Moore, then a 35 year-old native of Flint, Michican, picked up a video camera and a microphone and embarked on a quest to seek Roger B. Smith (of the film's title), the Chairman CEO of General Motors, and find out why he closed down the GM plant in Moore's hometown of Flint. In doing so, Moore made his first movie Roger & Me, a rough, (mostly) brilliant, funny, and sad expose of corporate America's reign of terror against blue-collar working men like himself.There's no two ways around it; this is one of the best documentary features I've ever seen, as I'm sure most Americans, even Moore's detractors, can relate to the desperation of his current predicament. General Motors was at the height of its profits during the late '80s, as we're told, so you have to wonder Why would it close down its Flint plant, knowing it was the number-one source of employment there?I don't know, and neither does Moore, whose personal quest to seek the truth sends him on a whirlwind tour across the country as he tracks the elusive Roger and attempts to have a sit-down with the man. Along the way, however, Moore also meets a number of colorful characters, many of whom whose lives have been drastically affected by the General Motors plant's closure.We meet the local sheriff, who has now been reduced to evicting unsuspecting tenants from their homes. These scenes are indeed unflinching and hard-to-watch because you can't help but be made to sympathize and at the same time be angered that such things are happening, which is an emotion made all the more passionate by the fact that what's going on is real.Another native of Flint is a woman who's forced to sell rabbit meat to have some kind of income. Our encounter with her culminates in the film's most notorious scene (and one of the other presumed reasons for the R rating, aside from the harsh language), which is when she beats a rabbit to death and skins it, right before our shocked eyes. Perhaps Moore's camera lens doesn't flinch once because he knows this is what she's been reduced to as a result of a lack of suitable employment in Flint.Flint goes to shambles as a result of the plant's closing down, and the town looks a lot like a war zone. Moore's narration is mostly angry and resentful, something which would become more refined and apparent in later films. Here, he's angry, as he's effectively adopted his signature persona of the Everyman who's at war with powers far greater than he is while also fighting for his slice of the American pie.Whenever Smith appears on camera, he's definitely shown to be arrogant, smug, and pigheaded. (Sound familiar?) Just watch one of the film's ending segments where Moore appears at a business conference and pleads his case before Smith and other investors. When you think it couldn't get any worse for Moore, the light shines off his rumpled everyday figure and he's brutally ignored by the others, left standing woefully in the dark corner where he remained the rest of that evening.We know that Reagan's downsizing policies during the '80s affected a lot of Americans in some very negative fashions and that's made crystal clear with Roger & Me. Moore seemed to have struck gold with this picture, as it was set to become one of the most popular and acclaimed movies of the year in 1989. It, of course, allowed him to define and shape his image as the political gadfly and make more, controversial movies, like The Big One (1997), his Oscar-winning anti-gun feature Bowling For Columbine (2002), and last year's Bush examination Fahrenheit 9\/11 (2004).But before those movies, he was just the everyday guy with a video camera seeking the truth. This film does contain some of his trademark stunts, which include Moore heckling the security officers in the lobby of the General Motors building. Regardless of your political leanings, it's hard to not cheer him on in Roger & Me. Though Moore personally considers this film to be a failure (because he never did talk to Roger Smith, and no new interest was generated in Flint as a result of this picture), he made a fantastic movie that captures the death of the American Dream, and the death of his hometown and the reason why it died.Filmmaker Michael Moore has become of the one of the most valued figures on the political landscape. As a libertarian Democrat (who hates both libs and cons), I often find myself sympathizing with the liberal cause, and Moore's antics as a liberal prankster. He's just as valuable to liberals as Bill O'Reilly or Ann Coulter are to conservatives.

It is in pretty much the same military farce style that he used in other movies such as Operation Mad Ball, and What Did You Do In The War Daddy? He makes a thing as horrific and serious as the concept of war, and transforms it into something quite witty and jocose. Blake does this without causing any offense however, and therefore he did it well. Basically, the movie has an astonishing likeness to Down Periscope, or I should say that Down Periscope has a peculiar likeness to this movie. In essence, a naval submarine commander is given command over a broken down sub, and a motley, ragtag crew. The most rowdy crew member however, is the supply officer Lt. Holden. He displays a blatant disregard for rules, and yet still portrays as likable. Even more surprising is the fact that somehow, despite his various behaviors, Holden manages to get the job done and have some fun along the way.The commander encounters various obstacles because of his supply officer, but nothing that isn't purely entertaining. The commander is portrayed by Cary Grant, and Holden is played by Tony Curtis. Both Grant and Curtis do a fantastic job in this film, and play off of one another quite well. Grant, as you know, is an amazing actor, and has been in many classics like Arsenic and Old Lace, An Affair to Remember, North by Northwest, Only Angels Have Wings, To Catch A Thief, and The Bishop's Wife, just to name a few. This is a classic Grant performance, his style predictable, yet this litany is somehow appealing. Tony Curtis is also one of my favorite actors, at least in his older films. As of late, Curtis' movies have been losing a lot of their former luster. It's only one more reason that this light-hearted movie is enjoyable, seeing Curtis in one of his finer performances. I would put it right up there with his performances in movies such as Houdini, Spartacus, Some Like it Hot, not to mention the Boston Strangler, and Six Bridges to Cross. In some of their finer performances, Curtis and Grant dominate the film with their clever acting. However, the acting aside from Curtis and Grant was actually good, not specifically notable, but never was there a moment in which I was aware of bad acting. The only small exception was in some of the dialogue referring to women, in which the lines were rather cliché for war movies. Also, aside from the actors and directors of course, the camera work is as fine quality as it could have been. The musical score fit perfectly in with the style of the movie, and writing was well done on the parts of the writers; especially Maurice Richlin, who has worked with Blake on quite a few of his productions, including some of the Pink Panther movies, as well as the aforementioned, Daddy What Did You Do In The War? The situations that the writers came up with for a war scenario are ridiculous, but very entertaining. Overall, this is a higher quality film, and noteworthy in the long run. Despite this, it certainly was not amazing by any means. This movie in the end was a very appealing, satirical, and splendid production. A movie which is definitely worth a view, but not important to have seen.

In some of their finer performances, Curtis and Grant dominate the film with their clever acting. However, the acting aside from Curtis and Grant was actually good, not specifically notable, but never was there a moment in which I was aware of bad acting. The only small exception was in some of the dialogue referring to women, in which the lines were rather cliché for war movies. Also, aside from the actors and directors of course, the camera work is as fine quality as it could have been. The musical score fit perfectly in with the style of the movie, and writing was well done on the parts of the writers; especially Maurice Richlin, who has worked with Blake on quite a few of his productions, including some of the Pink Panther movies, as well as the aforementioned, Daddy What Did You Do In The War? The situations that the writers came up with for a war scenario are ridiculous, but very entertaining. Overall, this is a higher quality film, and noteworthy in the long run. Despite this, it certainly was not amazing by any means. This movie in the end was a very appealing, satirical, and splendid production. A movie which is definitely worth a view, but not important to have seen.

It is in pretty much the same military farce style that he used in other movies such as Operation Mad Ball, and What Did You Do In The War Daddy? He makes a thing as horrific and serious as the concept of war, and transforms it into something quite witty and jocose. Blake does this without causing any offense however, and therefore he did it well. Basically, the movie has an astonishing likeness to Down Periscope, or I should say that Down Periscope has a peculiar likeness to this movie. In essence, a naval submarine commander is given command over a broken down sub, and a motley, ragtag crew. The most rowdy crew member however, is the supply officer Lt. Holden. He displays a blatant disregard for rules, and yet still portrays as likable. Even more surprising is the fact that somehow, despite his various behaviors, Holden manages to get the job done and have some fun along the way.The commander encounters various obstacles because of his supply officer, but nothing that isn't purely entertaining. The commander is portrayed by Cary Grant, and Holden is played by Tony Curtis. Both Grant and Curtis do a fantastic job in this film, and play off of one another quite well. Grant, as you know, is an amazing actor, and has been in many classics like Arsenic and Old Lace, An Affair to Remember, North by Northwest, Only Angels Have Wings, To Catch A Thief, and The Bishop's Wife, just to name a few. This is a classic Grant performance, his style predictable, yet this litany is somehow appealing. Tony Curtis is also one of my favorite actors, at least in his older films.

Or the fact that despite the fact that for some of the subject matter exposed here, nothing quite serious was made of it. Nevertheless, I will say that from start to escapist finish, the movie was fun, entertaining, and quite daring if for the presence of three macho actors effectively playing drag queens (and never allowing us to see them in any other form).Like I said, the premise of this movie has been done to death highly different people come to a small town (by accident), see the problems there, and manage in the course of their stay to get townsfolk to get in touch with themselves. It's a premise seen in such films as Pasolini's TEOREMA which had a different yet similar premise where a stranger gets inside a household and manages to somehow change every person there. Of course, that film was risky; this one, while featuring drag queens, is not. But my guess is that the intentions of the writer and director was not to attack social issues (such as spousal abuse, or Vida's estrangement from her family, for example), but to present them and move on because life is and should be a party.But this course is the movie's fault. That Vida Boheme, Noxema Jackson, and Chi-Chi Rodriguez, in getting lost and winding in a backwoods town where not only do they stumble upon Carol Ann (admirably played by Stockard Channing) who is being abused by her husband (in two particularly uncomfortable scenes, one played off-screen), but where Chi-Chi almost gets raped by the local roughnecks, seems like this should belong in something darker, not a comedy. The fact that on both occasions nothing is resolved (satisfactorily) points towards this movie's failure to step up to the plate, examine those issues, and make something truly revelatory. That what should have been a one-scene situation in which Vida Boheme whacks Sheriff Dollard unconscious is turned into a weak showdown in which neither of the drag queens comes out to make an appearance (like they would under similar circumstances; anyone who knows or has seen drag queens knows that they have little fear of cops or men in uniform and will knock them out easily) only makes matters more false whether or not these townsfolk were latently ready to accept change it is highly unlikely that it would have been played out this way. Why would Dollard even want to arrest these men in drag? It makes little sense but to force the issue that the people will stand up for Those Who Are Different. (And that among those people are the same roughnecks, now wearing pink and read boas? Something is wrong here.) And that Virgil just drives away once Dollard has been humiliated probably can be plausible in a non-verbal, more poetic sense, but again, this is not a poetic movie with suggestive images devoid of dialog, and the reality in spousal abuse is much different than what is left unexplored here. Also unsatisfactorily is the way ChiChi's budding relationship with the local guy (Jason London) is handled why not have him know she is a he and by doing so, take a huge risk that would strike the point home? Maybe it's timing. America isn't ready for men in drag and the chance someone might see through the appearance of femininity a man may have and go with their instincts. If Leguizamo's and London's characters would have hooked up it would have sent the message right onto anyone's lap. Building the gorgeous scenes between them as if to lead the viewer to believe they will become an item only to have ChiChi reject him is a total cop-out. TO WONG FOO is a movie that should have tackled these premises more upfront. It should have given all three of these men an actual sex life, real personalities. The closest thing that happens to romance is some shy flirting from Bobby Ray (Jason London) towards Chi-Chi, but even that is left flat after much exposition. The same way nothing else is said of Vida's familial relationship all we know is that there is an estrangement, but nothing else. And Noxema gets saddled with nothing else but to be there, say one-liners, and chat with an old lady about Hollywood. And this is also, precisely, what keeps it from being a richer movie which explores its characters instead of laying them out to pasture and later dressing them in boas and fancy dresses. To see a drag queen without her make up on is to see the man underneath; since we aren't given that chance here, this is drag-lite, in which all is at surface level, messages of love run rampant as house music plays in the background, and just as it started, it ends in a beauty parade.Kudos to Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze, and John Leguizamo for stepping out of their shoes and donning pumps and wigs. All are great, in equal measure. Snipes manages to channel a lot of Missy Elliott while Swayze might as well have become Brini Maxwell with a red wig. Leguizamo, though, is my favorite. While playing a close rendition of Rosie Perez with a good deal of Jennifer Lopez (pre J. Lo.; look closely and it's there), he gives his character a sweet dimension. These three are the ones who make this movie completely enjoyable despite these complaints that arise once the credits have rolled. Because of them I accepted the (pardon the pun) fairytale ending and its message of love and acceptance, and that takes guts and talent to make it work.

I'm totally seeing that one day. So here I am, with my fancy college degree, so many years later, having just finished viewing the film. And yes, it was totally friggin' nuts.It's incredibly well directed, superbly acted (except for Deborah Kara Unger, who barely moves her lips the whole damn movie... oops, I meant to say she barely moves her UPPER LIPS, b\/c the 2nd set gets a workout in this flick... more on her later, though), and overall, not a total waste of time by any means. Elias Koteas, Holly Hunter, and Patricia Arquette were appropriately creepy, although the only reason I can think of that Holly's name gets billing over the other two is her marketability during that era of Hollywood. She's in like... ummm 10 minutes? So. I'm thinking to myself, really, no one could possibly go into this movie thinking it's going to be a good time. If someone said, to the average moviegoer, Hey, wanna see a movie that explores the link between sex and car crashes, and along the way eroticizes death and scarring??? he or she would probably get a negative response. Not that such movies aren't valid or shouldn't be made, mind you, it's just that I can't see how anyone expected to get a whole lot of respect or money for putting a freakish amalgam of T&A and twisted metal, with a dash of homo-eroticism, on the screen.I get the point. It's actually kind of eloquent and well thought... but the necessity to film it somewhat eludes me. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.And onto the hot mess that was Deborah Kara Unger. She registered like .032 on the charisma scale. She freaking looked like a sleeping cat. And if my agent ever were to tell me that it was a good idea to do a film with a monologue like her tirade about penises and semen, I'd fire him or her, on the spot. That was just total crap... but I don't entirely blame her. I'm not sure there was much you could do with that turkey of a speech right there. I kept wanting James Spader to smack her and say, B*tch, you are SO ruining my mood. But I mean, hey, look how HER career took off after this blockbuster. Who the hell am I to talk? Anyway, I guess my point is, that there IS no point to the controversy surrounding this movie. Sure, there's a copious amount of chick parts, some guy on guy and girl on girl action, but it's nothing you're not going to see on the Real World on any given day. It's worth it if you want to check out a controversial and well made film, but other than that, I don't see the point.

Jada is playing Maureen Evans a bright young Women and hates scary movies. after her boyfriend is killed hes after her but the audience think thats its a funny stunt, but it turns out not to be funny at all when she dies in front of 200 people. When than see a familiar face Sidney Prescott, shes now at college with her new best friend Hallie played by Elise Neal and now Sid discovers its happening all over again. We than get introduced to Sidneys new Boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O Connel and too Woodsboro survivors Dewey and Randy. suddenly out of no where Courtney Cox is back as Gail Weathers and she brought along Cotten Weary because she wants Sidney to talk about what happened the year before, Sid is not happy and walks away.

I've always said Buster Keaton was my favorite classic comic of all-time. Especially masterpieces like THE GENERAL, and SHERLOCK JUNIOR, Keaton was actually **funny**; while Chaplin tended to be **just** simply cute and sweet (obvious connection to modern humour there).Now I've just seen this one, and I've finally admitted that Chaplin does have the knack to be out-and-out rib-ticklingly hilarious. Of course, I could also have remembered classics like Easy Street and of course Modern Times (which I really have to check upon again); but definitely in this film, there were scenes that were so perfect and spot-on hilarious, with impeccable timing and pure side-splitting hilarity.Not only the famous playing with the world scene; but the whole opening segment with the Big Bertha gun; including the bit with the anti-aircraft gun, the walking through the smoke scene, and of course the upside-down aircraft bit. Pure comic genius!!!And to top it off; the absolute satirical punch of the Dictator Hynkle - the speeches, the gestures, the bits with the microphones, the competition with Napolini... And I think Jack Oakie has to be totally on par with Chaplin in this movie. The sheer gusto of the big guy's performance is breathtaking. Especially the classic food fight scene! This film has all the great comic bits!Another actor that doesn't get enough credit I think in most discussions of this movie is Henry Daniell. I just saw him a few months back in TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS - the difference in character between that and this is quite amazing. Further proof that with the right material, a very serious drama actor can be a great choice for a comic movie. (Am I the only one who Garbitch reminds of Professor Snape? Not knocking either character or anything, though.)And the final big point - just look at the date this film was released (1940 - right in the middle of WWII.) Talk about topical! Can you imagine any filmmaker today who would have the guts to make this type of movie about a subject matter that was hitting the headlines so blatantly? It would be like the Farrally brothers today doing a trash comedy about Osama Bin Laden - (and I know just mentioning the idea is going to have some people flame me ferociously!)

Finally Kim falls in love with him.The story was amazing and the acting was incredible. Johnny Depp played his part very well. Tim Burton is one of the best directors and it would be impossible to improve the story he created as a teenager. Isn't that incredible? a teenager created such an original and emotional story? About the ending When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought the ending was upsetting. Later I saw it in DVD where I chose to see it with the comments of the director. Just at the end he said that he preferred to make Edward and Kim never see each other again than struggle for a long time trying to think about a way they could meet again. That upset me even more. When you love someone you are supposed to be with that someone. Would you resist having a loved person and never see him\/her again, when you can just walk a few meters to see him\/her? In some point of the movie, Peg says something that makes you think that Edward would be more happy if he lived up there, that made the ending less painful but the fact that he and Kim never meet again? Quite absurd. It makes you think that when Kim told Edward that she loved him, the words she said were just words and not her real feelings. Anyway I give an 8 to the movie because it teaches us many things such as respect, but I think the movie's end was as unfinished as Edward Scissorhands was.

Then Jackie Chan is like the guy you WANT to marry your sister, you can imagine sitting with him at the Thanksgiving dinner table and enjoying a good time. I agree with the other review, Wilson\/Chan did not seem to gel for some reason. Didn't Chan knock Wilson after release of this movie, saying he whined too much on aches and pains after doing stunts? Sounds like a bad match to me from the start. Loved the stunt horse, I was in stitches watching him. Actually he (the horse) and Jackie made for better stunts and humor then Wilson\/Chan. Some scenes were making fun of old cowboy movies and that was sort of fun to watch, but a little rehashed I guess for a Baby Boomer like me. Chan's stunts were hot and well timed as usual. You can tell he's a true professional at everything. Guess what I want to say is he makes it look easy. Overall I would call it a good family movie- full of mild humor and sight gags, which Chan is great at.

Minnie Driver's character says 'guy' all the time not 'bloke' as a British girl would. Here's a wake up call for Americans Hollywood is condescending to you! Yes, they think you are so thick (sorry dumb) that you will not understand unless a British character says fries and not chips. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, it makes us squirm in our seat and detracts from what would otherwise be a very good film. A further note on language, I am not sure what kind of people producers mix with, but my friends from University don't use obscenities in every sentence and I went to an Ivy league University.
