The first prequel to the fantastic original trilogy may not be the strongest film of the Star Wars series, or even one of the best blockbusters to come out of Hollywood, it is nevertheless an entertaining ride with a lot to recommend it. First of Liam Neeson is perfect as Qui-Gon-Jinn (I hope that spelling is right). The nearest that we Northern Irish have to a movie star of our own without doubt the best actor in it. His commanding presence and wonderful delivery of his lines recalls Alec Guinness. That's not to say that Ewan McGregor isn't good as the young Obi Wan as he is superb also. While his accent attempt may be a little too English for some, he is better than would have been expected. In saying that Natalie Portman brings the film down a bit. Her performance is, dare I say, a little wooden at time, which is a surprise considering her fantastic performances in Leon and Beautiful Girls. She is undeniably beautiful as Queen Amidala (she is the mother of Princess Leia, she has to be beautiful), but her performance needed a lot more work. Likewise Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. Some child actors can be great, but Lloyd just sleep walks through the film and considering the importance of the character he is playing, it does damage the film a little.Acting, however, is not what this film is about. It's about lightsabre duels and CGI and there is plenty of both. Lucas does go a little overboard with the CGI but the effects are stunning (especially the Spartacus style battle at the end) and the lightsabre battle between Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Darth Maul is spectacular. While his skills as a writer of dialog may have slid over the twenty odd years between his last directing gig, there is no denying that Lucas can still put on a spectacle.This film is not the second coming, nor is it the disaster that critics and nay sayers painted it out as. I have never been on of those Star Wars obsessives, although I admit I have always enjoyed the films, but The Phantom Menace is a film I found hugely entertaining. The pod race, the knowledge that we know what will happen to Anakin, it all makes for an entertaining film. Sure it's not art, it's entertainment and is a pure example of what cinema is meant to do.

Overall, I'd have to say that it lived up to its reputation.  Even though I wasn't really in the mood for it at the start, it drew me in and kept me glued to the TV screen for two full hours.I think enough people have already commented on the plot of the movie (and how cool they think Toshiro Mifune is), so I won't waste your time with more such drivel here...Instead, what interested me most about this movie tonight was how many elements of it I'd already seen before.  For instance, close to the beginning of the film, Mifune's character kills a couple of henchmen and then lops off the arm of another--and then you see the poor guy's dismembered arm, lying on the ground, still holding on to his katana. It's impossible to watch this shot and not immediately think of the bloody arm that Obi-Wan has dismembered in the cantina scene in the first Star Wars movie.Elements of Star Wars are all over this film, in fact from the moment Mifune pops out a couple of floorboards to leave his hiding place (think of Han and Luke on the Millennium Falcon) to the sweeping, horizontal wipe transitions you see between each scene.  Like Obi-Wan, Mifune's Man with No Name is a wandering, mystic warrior--one of the last of his kind.  And the mercenary element of a character like Han Solo is lived out large here, too, by Mifune's character.But that's just it.  As someone has already pointed out here, this movie began the 1960s\/1970s deconstruction of the Western--the good\/bad distinction disappears, and there's just Mifune's Yojimbo to play two despicable rich men (and their cronies) off of each other.  When Mifune actually does something decent for another human being in the film, it comes as kind of a shock.  But at the end of the movie--when he comes back to fight the bad guys--he's not fighting them for any noble purpose, or to help out the poor, old townspeople.  He just wants payback.This is the kind of nihilistic, beyond-good-and-evil stuff that we've seen so often (and loved so much) in action films ever since.  It's not about the triumph of principle over chaos--it's about the triumph of the individual over the masses.  We've seen this thing so many times by now that I think it's difficult for us to appreciate in a film that's seen so many years go by (and been copied as often) as Yojimbo.  In fact, those who are looking for lots of melodramatic action sequences and overly drawn out fight scenes will probably be disappointed by this action movie--its violence is too curt to be really satisfying.What strikes me now, though, is that one of the reasons movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones and everything else that came out of the Lucas\/Spielberg era were so successful is because they injected the old good vs. evil theme back into the Western-style movie.  They just had to transfer their settings to places far away from the American West.  It's like--after Kurosawa and Leone and Eastwood and Don Siegel had had their say--we had to go somewhere else besides the Old West to get what we were really looking for.There's no such triumph of good over evil here.  Just one badass dude making the best of a bad situation.  Check it out if that's the sort of thing you want to see.

George Clooney could have made a great Batman (square jawed, popular with the ladies), the only thing going against him being that can be too laid back (maybe with a better script he could do the darker material). Uma Thurman is perfect for Poison Ivy. She is a good looking yet quirky actress, but you wouldn't know it by the emphasis on camp context and innuendo in this film. Arnie is maybe a little miscast as Mr Freeze, but he does well getting a chance to use some 'great' puns, but someone who can come across as more evil would  have been better. Then there is Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl. Let's just say more charisma can come from a line of fridge freezers with nothing in them. The only decent performance comes from Michael Gough as Alfred, only one of two actors to have appeared in all four films. His performance is wonderful in this otherwise mess of a film.The blame for this disaster can be laid at the hands of Joel Schumacher. His direction misplaced and his intentions misguided. He may have redeemed himself with Phone Booth, but he will always be the man who destroyed Batman in my eyes.

Other than that...totally enjoyable and I can't wait to see Two Towers (playing locally this week I believe) and Return of the King later this month).

It's a ghost story, about a crippled child who is murdered by his greedy father to replace him with a healthy boy. The ghost of this child roams in the attic of the old house where he was murdered. George C.Scott's character, a music teacher who has suffered the tragic loss of his family in a freak accident, rents the house and becomes aware that there's something wrong there. Again, you've probably heard this story line a dozen times before, but The Changeling is brilliantly executed and the performance of George C.Scott is, in my opinion, very down to earth and real. Someone in this section said that his performance was wooden (and gave Keanu Reeves as an example), but I beg to differ. He is an old man who, like many of us would, refuses the idea of having a ghost in his house. His acting was very realistic. Although the movie moves at a rather slow pace, it never ceases to be interesting. It's one of those movies that needs to be seen late at night, surrounded by darkness and put full attention to. I remember I was scared out of my pants when I saw it 20 years ago and I've recently purchased it and have seen it many times again, now with my wife, who also happens to love it. One thing I will never understand is the R rating this film got. There are no nude scenes, no graphic violence, virtually no blood...there's not one curse in the dialog!

Someone in this section said that his performance was wooden (and gave Keanu Reeves as an example), but I beg to differ. He is an old man who, like many of us would, refuses the idea of having a ghost in his house. His acting was very realistic. Although the movie moves at a rather slow pace, it never ceases to be interesting. It's one of those movies that needs to be seen late at night, surrounded by darkness and put full attention to. I remember I was scared out of my pants when I saw it 20 years ago and I've recently purchased it and have seen it many times again, now with my wife, who also happens to love it. One thing I will never understand is the R rating this film got. There are no nude scenes, no graphic violence, virtually no blood...there's not one curse in the dialog! Anyway, it still is a very creepy movie and if you'd like to see a well done suspense story, don't hesitate in watching this one!

It's a ghost story, about a crippled child who is murdered by his greedy father to replace him with a healthy boy. The ghost of this child roams in the attic of the old house where he was murdered.

The two of them meet when Del (John Candy) steals a much deserved taxi from Neal (Steve Martin) and though a lot of mishaps they decide to join forces and work together to get home.Del is a very talkative and overbearing character compared to the much more independent Neal. This combination fills the movie with tons of comedic nervous tension and awkward situations which results in nothing but laughs.The two actors do an amazing job at making this seemingly hopeless situation turn in to a fun and memorable trip.  SO many thing go wrong that couldn't possible happen in one trip.  In fact if even one of the things had happened to you you may consider it a bad trip, but as an audience one bad thing after another just translates into one laugh after another.Overall this was a good movie.  It had quite a few funny parts and even took on a couple serious notes, but not enough to bring you down. The acting was also great, and what would you expect from two such great comedians in one movie. You will get caught up in the movie and enjoy all of it without a dull moment in the show.

After his success with part 2 of this series, this film goes down as a disappointment, however. Miner's name appears in the credits of some truly great horror classics going all the way back to Last House On the Left among others. The 3D concept of this film seems to have clouded his typically stellar vision, though.Jason is back, and this time he is bigger, stronger, and more resourceful than he has been up to this point. He trades in his overalls and gunny sack from part 2, and ushers in the era of the khaki pants, green work shirt, and of course the hockey mask for this one. Plenty of youngsters (and a threesome of bikers) get wasted with various implement tools, and even a spear gun. This film has all that you'd think it would need to be good, except something is missing.The acting is so wooden it's unbelievable. The film isn't as suspenseful as you would hope it to be, until the typical last female standing vs killer sequence where it picks up quite a bit. Jason gets the crap beat out of him as he tries to track the pretty brunette down. The conclusion is murky, just like in part 2, and it clearly left things wide open for further sequels (as intended).The main reason the film comes up short is the fact that you cannot view it in 3D on your home screen. I'm sure it looked cool in the theater, but those days are two decades past. Steve Miner's work now looks forced as he had to spend so much time setting up shots that would look good in 3D, that he didn't really have time to make the film very scary.Oh, well. It's not like this is the worst film of the series. It's just not up to par with Miner's prior effort which was excellent.5 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound p.s.

While Batman Forever is not the greatest film in the world (possible understatement), there are factors that make it an enjoyable enough film.First of all the problems. Well Val Kilmer is far from being the perfect Batman. Sure he is good looking, but his performance is bland and he makes the character of Bruce Wayne uninteresting. Whereas Michael Keaton brought a quirky yet vicious quality to the Dark Knight, Kilmer brings very little. Keaton excelled at playing the part. The inner torment, the endless quest for revenge were touched on in great ways by Keaton, but Kilmer sleepwalks through the whole film. Likewise his chemistry with Nicole Kidman in non-existent. The film tries to present the relationship between Kidman's Doctor Chase and Wayne in a quirky manner (he loves her, she loves Batman and of course Wayne and Batman are one and the same), it's just the film can't reached those quirky heights as it's become centered around outrageous action sequences, gadgets and a camp production design. Kidman herself is good, but it doesn't help when her leading man is acting like a brick wall.The film itself is unfocused. One minute the movie can be camp (the scenes between Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones) and at others quite dark (the killing of Robin's parents). The humor wins out more as the film is not aiming as high at the darker elements as Burton did. This is essentially the first step in making the Batman films a series for kids, which the first two films did not do despite the fact there was a heavy slant on merchandising.There are good aspect, redeeming aspects. Jim Carrey is simply awesome as the Riddler. The man is pumping energy as if he is powered by a national grid. His performance recalls Jack Nicholson in the first film (although the inherent psychotic characteristics are missing here) and is almost as much fun. He is backed fantastically by Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face who tries valiantly to keep up with Carrey, but he's swiping the film from everyone. Undeniably a fine comedian, it is this essence that makes the Riddler a great villain. At the end the film is not perfect (although it's a masterpiece compared to the following film), but it is two hours of fun nevertheless and is worth watching to see Jim Carrey. His performance alone is worth a viewing.
