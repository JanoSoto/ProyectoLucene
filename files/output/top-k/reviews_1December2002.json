HC is an absolute masterpiece of art and deep intelligence, acted by two amazing actresses with such an incredible intensity. The script of Walsh and Jackson is a pure marvel if you know the real Parker-Hulme murder case, it's obvious that nobody could make better, because they choice to make a psychological portrait instead of a sensational criminal story.

Even you can't excuse the murder, you can understand the two friends and their own special logic - in their own irrational world. For Pauline and Juliet, nothing is important but their incredible, deeply and strongly devoted friendship and try to separate them is just unthinkable... and dangerous ! This marvelous movie is so intensive that it makes you feel every feelings beauty and horror, humor and violence, love and hate, happiness and despair... thankful to Kate and Mel who ARE really their characters. This very special relationship is fascinating two adolescent girls so physically and socially opposite, but in fact each one has her own affective problems, a great imagination and a real love for arts, are reunited at first for the best and finally for the worst...

Ice Age had okay animation, although not as good as Shrek, a few funny scenes, but overall as an adult it did not catch my interest at all and I found myself to be quite bored upon renting it. I have no idea how kids liked the movie so I can not judge as to them.I did not particularly like or identify with any of the characters (except maybe Scrat, the proto-squirrel trying to hide his nut who was rather funny). I also like for my movies to have a well-rounded, well-conceived plot, which Ice Age definitely did not. In most stories, such as Shrek, we understand the plot and root for the heroes to overcome problems or adversaries and triumph in the end. In this story it was hard to tell who were the heroes and who was not.I need to preface my review in that I love the old Bugs Bunny cartoons. I also loved Shrek and think it still to be the most clever and witty animated movie ever, along with a cool soundtrack. Monster's Inc. and Toy Story were good but not great animated stories along the same lines and I have watched each of them several times for entertainment value. Therefore, I am not a cartoon slammer and I am not some old fuddy-duddy who does not understand what is funny and what is not. I don't try to look for some hidden agenda or deep, mysterious moral behind a movie, I just watch to get some enjoyment and fun out of it (such as Shrek).And then comes Ice Age. I rented it last week. Unfortunately, with Ice Age, I was rather confused, bored almost all the time, and perhaps appalled at times by the meandering storyline that never quite connected up for me. The animation was okay but Shrek is a much, much better movie in all facets.*SPOILER WARNING* I won't go into detail as to the plot as that has been done elsewhere. But I could not really ascertain what we were supposed to feel in this movie? Was this a buddy movie, a morality play about helping others, Do unto others as you would have them do unto you or what? Very murky writing from what I could see as I could not gather what it all meant. I am not one to slam movies and can find almost anything good about the most awful movies I have ever seen, but I had no clue as to motivations or who we should root for --- the humans who apparently kill all animals, the Mammoth and sabertooth Tiger who are doomed as doomed can be due to extinction issues in real life, orthe sloth, who is rather stupid and the only one who should not survive anyway (See Jar Jar Binks - LOL).But in Ice Age what was the motivation for Manfred the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth, and Diego the Sabertooth Tiger, taking the human baby back to the hunters? Apparently we are to assume that they were doing the right thing. Accepting that theory, then why was taking the human baby back to the hunters the right thing? One could assume that as far as motivations go, it might have been better to kill the human baby so that Manfred and Diego could live longer. After all, these were HUNTERS not Cro-Magnon vegetarians!Also, at the end of the movie, I find it hard to believe that Sid would not hunt down his old sloth herd and that Diego would not find a new bunch of sabertooth tigers to hang with. The buddy-buddy connection was not as strong or believable as in Shrek. Especially, since Diego turns out to be a friend only in the last 15 minutes of the movie or so after leading Manfred and Sid to an ambush for the first 1 1\/2 hours of the flick.Maybe I am overly cynical, but in the flash-back scene, it appears as though Manfred the Mammoth had his entire family killed by hunters and now he is taking a baby back that will grow up and kill him, too? Is he stupid? Is this some kind of thorn in the lion's paw type quid-pro-quo?Are we supposed to see some kind of profound life-changing experience, i.e, the Mammoth brought back the baby, I will never hunt again??? Fat chance of that, I would think. There is no connecting up so that we actually believe the hunters will not kill the animals ever again, so who are we to speculate?Also, is this some kind of pro-vegetarian movie, don't kill the animals because they are the same as us? Fat chance again. Ice age humans lived a nomadic hunting existence and did not start agrarian societies until some 10,000 years later. So they did not establish farms or stay in one place as that was not possible with the advancing Ice Age. They ate what they could, which was mostly meat, along with berries, fruits, and what-not they picked as they went along. So the chances that they would not kill Manfred for food at a later date are slim and none. Not believable even in a kiddy movie context.Don't forget at the beginning that either Diego or the head of his sabertooth pack says that the hunters have killed half their pack and that is why they want to kill the baby. So Diego helps take a human baby back, so the baby will grow up and kill him, too??? Is this believeable or am I missing something?Interestingly enough, the main hunter never mentions what happened nor sheds a tear about the death of his wife (who apparently drowns off-camera), it is all about the male baby who will also grow up to be a hunter. And this is a kid's movie??? Very shocking\/interesting undertones for a kid's movie. Not exactly the type of sentimentality engendered when Bambi's mother dies!Also, for continuity's sake, I thought that Diego was trying to lead the Mammoth and Sid into a trap of the other sabertooth Tigers and not necessarily to the humans? However, coincidentally the humans and sabertooth Tigers are all in one place. I really did not see an entire pack, just 5 or 6 Tigers. They could have easily jumped the Mammoth and Sloth earlier in the film instead of supposedly letting Diego get the baby and bringing the baby to them.Scrat the proto-squirrel provides some good scenes although he really does not fit into the storyline at all. The dodo dancing scene was interesting as was the Ice slide scenes. Even taken as a cute, funny kiddy story with no motives attributed to the producers, I didn't appreciate the undertones to the rhinoceros pair. This was truly not necessary. Also, as adults we know the Mammoth and the sabertooth Tiger are doomed to extinction, so this put a bad slant on the movie for me, knowing that Manfred and Diego were doomed from the get-go.Overall, I would have to give Ice Age an 8 for animation, but a 2 for plotline and continuity. I did not really care much about the characters and did not really care what happened at the end.

Nothing...and I really mean nothing in this movie has anything to do with acting. The girls are not actors the are models with perfect silikone breasts, bodies and teeth. Not seen that often in ancient egypt. Its totally unrealistic, I mean how can a guy shot by an arrow fly through a tent and up in the air. I know this is an adventure movie but there are limits. The actors come with what should be funny remarks throughout the whole movie. However this does not contribute anything good whatsoever.

I had never heard of the film before and it wasn't until afterwards that I found out that it had won Oscars and so on. It's not like I'm a hype-hater or something like that.

Monster Sully really becomes a father-figure to the little girl who accidentally makes her way to Monstropolis, and passes through the same stages many real fathers do, from utter terror to affection to love.  The strongest element in Monsters Inc is that it's very easy to believe in the relationship between Sully and Boo (the name he eventually gives the child, to buddy Mike's dismay).   When Sully inadvertantly scares the girl in a demo for new trainees his dismay is convincing and heart-breaking.  The scene where Sully finally returns Boo to her own room is really an understated, emotional masterpiece, from the girl's initial glee at being home (and the way she shows off all her toys to her new friend Sully--a marvellous detail) to Sully's heavy-hearted exit. A nice detail about that exit--the animators may have been tempted to show a teardrop fall from Sully's eye, but instead we just see his eyes visibly moisten as he turns to go.  I loved it.The point that laughter is ten times more powerful than scream is actually a lovely touch, carrying the implication that a cooperative solution is always preferable to a confrontational one.  Even better, while this message is made distinctly, it isn't stated overbearingly.  It's a nice message for parents and labor negotiators alike.  It might be stretching, but I think there's even an environmental implication to this message that's not stated directly in the movie, but definitely seems to be alluded to.More unstated messages come from Mr. Waternoose (of course voiced masterfully by the late James Coburn).  In the commentary track on the DVD director Pete Docter notes that Coburn brought a warmth and a vulnerability to the character that none of the writers had seen, and that kind of added dimension makes him that much more powerful as a villain.  He also represents a dangerous resistance to change, and to adopt a cooperative solution in favor of one that's even more exploitive; Waternoose's idea of innovation is not just to continue victimizing children, but to escalate that victimization to an unspeakable new level.Okay, okay... I might just have too much time on my hands to start reading these messages into Monsters Inc, but I swear they're here.  And I don't think there's QUITE this much depth to, say, Shrek (which I continue to like a lot, BTW) or A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies (which I also love, but for different reasons). ...And another note on the music while Randy Newman's theme song If I Didn't Have You is pretty much a rehash of a lot of other songs he's done in the last decade or so, his score for Monsters Inc is marvellous.  His theme for the little girl is rendered in a few different ways, and the simple piano version that plays in the pivotal return scene is just plain wonderful.

There was not one dull moment in this movie. From beginning to end, nothing but action. This movie had a lot of surprises and really deviated from the television series. The Decepticons were really powerful in this movie. The series usually portrayed them as weak but here in the movie they were a force to be reckoned with. Like wise with the Autobots in this movie, they seemed pretty weak. I found it interesting how Optimus Prime single handedly defeated all the Decepticons during the battle on the Autobot base on Earth. However, him dying was the biggest surprise of the the movie. It did occur to me that the Junkions could have repaired him just like they did Ultra magnus. Nevertheless, the scene was quite sad.I really would have liked to have known the origins of Unicron. I mean, he was never mentioned in the series. It was obvious that he himself was a transformer created by someone. Where did he come from? Why did he want to destroy the autobot matrix of leadership all of a sudden? I must say, him transforming was one of the high points in the movie. Later in the series they try to bring Unicron back with the floating head begging any drifters to get him a body. I think he even brought back Starscream who turns on him.Anyway, I enjoyed the movie. The soundtrack was awesome and I highly reccomend this movie. ","genre":null},{"date":"1 December 2002","score":"","review":"  **Contains spoilers**My mom took me to see this movie when I was 8.

As an idealistic young man he travels to university to study to become a great doctor.  However he brings with him non-scientific teachings he has researched into life and the influence of electric currents.  His belief is supported by shadowy lecturer Dr Waldeman and Frankenstein continues his work and brings a man back to life using parts of other men.  Realising what he has done, Frankenstein leaves his monster to die but the creature learns fast and wants revenge for his creation.I have seen far too many monster movies that all blur together and share the same focus on effects and gore than story or character.  So when this was promoted as being close to the original material, dark and more of a story than a horror I was looking forward to watching it.  For the most part it sort of works but it's main flaw runs all the way through it like a stick of rock &#150; it's far too worthy.  Or at least it thinks it is.  The film has a constant swell of dramatic music that is only ever seconds away and it really makes the film feel grander and more serious than it really is.  The film isn't scary but that wasn't a problem to me &#150; it just has all these big worthy dialogue scenes with sudden pauses (up comes the music) and then lines.  It doesn't work and the film feels heavy and even dull as a result.This is never more evident than in Branagh's own performance.  He is far too dashing and too much of a young man gone wrong to be believed.  If he'd played it a little less worthy he would have been more of a human and less a cardboard type.  De Niro really tries hard and did well for me.  He may be stuck with a creature but it has been developed past the cliché (but not far enough perhaps).  I did feel for him and it was all De Niro's doing.  Carter is miscast both before and after &#150; far to light and modern for the role, Briers is OK but Cleese is way to miscast.  First of all the fact that he only appears half in shadows and when he opens his mouth the music comes up doesn't help, but it didn't feel like him.  Quinn is a good cameo but the majority of the cast seem to have bought into the whole `worthy' thing and are dulled as a result.Overall the film is worth watching because it is a good telling of the classic tale and De Niro does a good job of showing us the basic human behind the combined dead body parts.  If only Branagh hadn't been overwhelmed by the sheer importance of what he thought he was doing and had let the film flow and bit more and given in less to worthy music, acting and directing.

Emma Thompson did a truly superb job on the screenplay, as evidenced by her Oscar win. The entire film is bright, cheerful, and romantic. The sets, scenery, and costumes are a feast for the eyes; they truly transport you to 1800's England. Thompson does a wonderful job portraying the sensible, reserved Elinor and Hugh Grant is quite good as the bumbling, ernest, but lovable Edward Ferrars. Their love story is really quite sweet. For myself, however, the most interesting charecters were those of Marianne Dashwood and Colonel Brandon. Kate Winslet absolutly stole the picture as the passionate, impulsive Marianne, and was the personification of young love and innocence. Alan Rickman was likewise terrific as the handsome Colonel who longs for Marianne. His subtle performance speaks of Brandon's long hidden inner passions which make him Marianne's soul-mate from the very beginning.SPOILEROne of my favorite parts of the film was the poetry reading scene at Barton Cottage, wherein Marianne begins to display faint signs of affection for the Colonel. It was very sweet, and tells volumes about the way courtships were conducted in the past. Marianne and Brandon, so obviously ment for each other, finally getting together - and then the wedding of the two, when they emerge from the church, arm in arm, beaming at each other, so obviously truly happy at last, for me that was the most romantic scene in the film, and a truly great movie moment. If you haven't seen Sense and Sensibility yet, I highly recommend it. I give it 9 out of 10 stars - it may seem a little slow to some and is definetly not for the unromantic or unsympathetic. A solid show, nevertheless.

The movie may harbor illusions of being a daring, slashing satire on the sexual mores of our time, but the content matter and the approach the film takes to it are so epicene and juvenile that the whole thing merely offends when it should enlighten and entertain (I am certain that this is the first time, for instance, that a full blown erection has been shown, albeit covered up, in a mainstream Hollywood movie).When his girlfriend dumps him, Matt Sullivan decides to give up sex for Lent (thus the 40 days and 40 nights time span), not just sexual relations with women, mind you, but sexual release of ANY kind (and you know what THAT means).  Naturally, Matt's attempt at heroic celibacy makes him the cause celebre around town, with his very own friends setting up an internet pool to take bets on how long he will be able to last without giving into his natural urges.  Further complications arise when our frustrated hero meets and falls in love with a sweet young thing who simply can't understand why Matt won't put the moves on her (neither can we, frankly, since the motivation for sticking to the pledge, given all the aggravation it's causing for Matt, becomes more and more obscure as the movie grinds on).Sex comedies have been around since actors first climbed up onto the stage, but the measure of a truly successful one is in how deftly it can walk that fine line between crass vulgarity and subtle innuendo.  In the case of `40 Days and 40 Nights,' writer Robert Perez and director Michael Lehmann go for the lowest-common-denominator approach every time, piling on one crude comment, joke and sight gag after another, leaving little room for the understatement, subtlety and wit necessary for a truly effective sex farce.  I'm not trying to sound blue-nosed about this, but the level of humor in `40 Days and 40 Nights' rarely rises above the junior high locker room level.  That's a real pity because Josh Hartnett as Matt and Shannyn Sossamon as Erica, the girls he loves, make an endearing and attractive romantic couple.  More time spent with them and less with his Neanderthal friends &#150; who seem never to have heard of AIDS or STD's before - would have made the film far more palatable and enjoyable.  As it is, the movie exudes a kind of smarmy creepiness that renders most of the humor ineffective.  The screenplay also has a strangely sacrilegious tone to it, hitting its peak in a scene showing a priest and a nun engaged in some pretty intense French kissing.  Some of the daring shown by the makers of this film might have been commendable in a work with more serious aspirations.   But in a flat-footed sex romp like this one, the crudity is embarrassment-evoking at best.There is one very funny scene in which Matt and his brother (who is studying for the priesthood, mind you, and is having his own struggle with the celibate life) are having dinner over their parents' house, just at the time when Matt's `condition' is getting critical.  Matt feels that this will be the one `safe' place he can go, the one setting in which the subject of sex will never be broached.  Little does he suspect that his father has a few conversational goodies up his sleeve on that very topic.  The reason this scene works and most of the others don't is that the humor in this case arises from the incongruity of the situation and actually demonstrates a little imagination.  It is the one time in the film when we feel that the writer might actually be on to something.  Given more scenes like this one, the film might have elevated itself to the level of an honest-to-God sex farce, instead of merely contenting itself with being the movie equivalent of bathroom-stall scrawling.    If you're still not sure what I'm talking about, watch `40 Days and 40 Nights,' then check out `The Graduate' and see the difference for yourself.
