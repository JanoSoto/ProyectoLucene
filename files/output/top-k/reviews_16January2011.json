The hacker tries to get into the system to get proof and finds himself sucked into the virtual world where he must try and defeat the security program Tron. Disney's TRON has become something of a folk legend as it's very clear those who saw the picture in 1982 were left speechless due to the visual effects, which for the time were quite ground breaking. I'm sure many people today would look at the film and wonder what the hype was but it's always important to remember when a film was made and judge it for what it was then and not really how the effects compare to the stuff of today. With that said, the film certainly has its own look, which is quite impressive and the imagination in the visual sense is quite high. Needless to say the effects aren't as ground breaking when viewed today but at the same time they have such a unique look that you can't help but admire them. I really enjoyed the first couple games that Bridges must play as they really make you feel as if you're playing them. I don't think there's any question that the visual effects are the main reason to check TRON out as the computer world created is extremely imaginative but at the same time I must call the film a disappointment because of the story. Yes, that crazy thing known as a story. I'm sorry but for the life of me I kept having a hard time trying to figure out why I should be cheering for Bridges. The screenplay really doesn't give us anytime to get to know him so we never really start to like him. The first time we see him he's playing a video game and then seconds later we're briefly told that he has had these games stolen from him. That's all the story gives us and is this really enough for us to have any sort of emotional connection to the character? I personally think the screenplay kills everything in the film because it's nearly impossible to care about anything going on. When the supporting characters come into play they're just as uninteresting and after the first few games you can't help but wish you were spending time with better characters. Bridges is decent in his role but it's certainly far from any of his best work. Warner doesn't get any help from the screenplay either. TRON is visually impressive but for me I need a story to go along with the effects and sadly the film simply doesn't have that.

Along the way he teams up with the beautiful Agent XXX (Barbara Bach) and the two must deal with the villain (Curd Jurgens) and his maniac assistant known as Jaws (Richard Kiel). There's so many great things in this movie that by the time it was over I couldn't help but wish I had enjoyed the film more than I did. It's strange that I enjoyed so much here but in the end the story was just way too weak for my liking and the direction wasn't nearly enough to keep everything moving for me. There's a ton of plot going on here and there's even more action going on but at times it just felt like there was too much going on and the majority of the story was all over the place. This thing clocks in at just 125-minutes but I could have sworn it was at least thirty-minutes longer, which tells me that some editing could have happened. I think fifteen or twenty-minutes shorter would have made for a better film. With that said, there's still a lot to enjoy here including the brilliant opening sequence on the snow slopes and the leap off the cliff is certainly something marvelous to see. This is one case where the director does the right thing and keeps the music score off because it really adds more to the sequence by not having any music. Another great thing is Kiel as the villain Jaws. The actor always had that wonderful frame and it does the character great justice here as he clearly steals the film each time he's on the screen. Jurgens is also quite good when he's on screen and Caroline Monroe looks incredible in that bathing suit but it's a shame she's not here for too long. I thought Moore turned in the best performance (so far) because of the smoothness he brought to the role but he also handled the one-liners very well and managed to mix it up with Bach. Moore and Bach are excellent together and they really do sell their up and down romance because the two actor just have so much chemistry together. The action scenes are both hit and miss but one major hit is the car chase that happens in the middle of the film. The stuff towards the end just seemed way too cartoonish for my liking and not for a second was any of it believable. I'm not really a fan of Carly Simon but her title song here is without question one of the best. I can understand why so many people enjoy this film but for me it was a very good but extremely flawed film that could have benefited from a rewrite.

As well as the tongue-in-cheek humour of the jokes Powell makes concerning filmmaking, he raises serious questions regarding film and its vicariousness. It can't be healthy, watching all these films regards Mark's blind tenant, the mother of the woman with whom he begins to fall in love.

Submissive to His laws and trying to follow them, I have not always understood them. I knew, however, that the sweet counsels which He gave me could not be the work of an enemy, and the comfort which they have always given me has been a stay in trouble and a heart's joy. I never knew what was the deeper design of the Lord. He hid from me in all His messages the dreadful end which I was to endure, having pity on my weakness and on my shrinking from pain, but when the time did come, He gave me strength and courage. I love to think of the hours when first I heard the voices. I cannot say that I was afraid. I was greatly astonished to find myself the subject of the Divine Mercy. I knew instantly that they were the messengers of God, and I felt a great sweetness in my heart whilst the holy voice rang in my ears. It is not possible for me to tell you exactly how I felt, for I could not describe the deep peace and joy, so that when they ceased I felt that I was the child of God and of Heaven. I feebly comprehended that their will should be mine, but though overjoyed at their coming, I was surprised at the orders they gave and feared a little to execute them. It did certainly seem a fine work to save our France, but how was a girl to go among men-at-arms? Finally, in their sweet and constant companionship I came to have more confidence in myself, and the love which I had ever had for God guided my conduct, for it cannot be right to rebel against the will of a Father. It was a hard task, and yet I had joy in obeying, and I set forth to do the Will of God. I am happy that I followed His orders, and I pardon those who were the instruments of my death, for I know that it was not out of hatred for my spirit that they set it free, but because they hated the work that I had done. This work had been blessed by God, and, therefore, they were deeply in the wrong, but, like them, I have no hatred for their spirits. I am only the enemy of all that God condemns, or falseness and wickedness. It is their work which is evil. They return to it ever, but the remembrance of their past cannot be effaced by them. I mourn for the hatreds which they have encouraged among those who should be brothers, and for the evil weeds which they have sown in the Church, which have caused this Mother whom I once cherished to devote herself rather to theology than to charity. It is pleasing to me to see that they improve and admit to some extent their error, but things have never been as I should have wished them, and my love for the Church turns more and more away from this ancient guide of souls in order to give itself more completely to our sweet and gracious Lord.

Liam Neeson is just awesome as Quigon, with his awesome voice, charisma, and Jedi-like wisdom, he really fits this part quite well. Ewan McGregor was pretty good as Obi-Wan, but didn't really get enough screen time to leave a big impression. Natalie Portman was either good or okay.

It is fascinating because it is a 100% pro-war, pro-American propaganda movie in the style of Dr. Goebbels, and it is interesting because it is obvious that that kind of bold propaganda still finds an audience.This movie tells the story of some American soldiers who are trying to kick some ass in Mogadishu - for a good cause as the movie tells us, leaving an uninformed audience with a wrong premise and doing an excellent propaganda job for all those who believe in what they are being told. On top of that, the intro tells us, that it all is based on a true story. False premises and alleged authenticity are mixed into a dangerous cocktail, typical for propaganda.Then, the movie develops into a bold good-guys-against-bad-guys-story. All the American soldiers are shown as good people, they all have hobbies, play chess, basketball or draw children's books (no kidding).

When I watched it in theaters in 1998 I absolutely fell in love with it. I recently purchased the Criterion Blu ray release and realized that after 13 years, I am still very much in love with this movie.The Thin Red Line is not a typical war movie. It is not driven by action alone. It explores the duality of nature and draws parallelism between the struggle within nature and the struggle within each man. It achieves this through poetic cinematography, philosophical narration voice-overs, great battle scenes and great casting from the best actors in the business.The duality of nature is presented from the opening shot. A crocodile leaves the shore and moves into the water. The setting is a beautiful island. There is something about watching the most horrible event in all humanity, war, within a setting so beautiful, it touches your soul. Where the nature lives in harmony, soldiers are fighting a war. This duality continues all throughout the movie and never ceases to amaze. One of my favorite scenes is when the soldiers are walking through the grass, an aboriginal Indian is walking the other way, and when they are in the same frame, soldiers look like the alien element and the Indian seems to perfectly mesh with nature.The other unique aspect of The Thin Red Line is that it gives us the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters. Often, people put up a facade and keep their feelings inside. This is another duality the film presents through voice-overs. Soldiers do not always think about winning. They are human beings and they often dream about being home, going home, and they fear. In that regard, the movie is very realistic.The Thin Red Line also explores the morality in times of war, and the difficulty of making the right decision under extra-ordinary circumstances where the given objective (a military order) could compromise the sacredness of human life. This struggle is presented through the conflicts of colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) with captain James Staros (Elias Koteas) and sergeant Welsh (Sean Penn) with private Witt (Jim Caviezel).One indisputable fact is cinematography of the film is absolutely fantastic. The trees, the water, the hills, birds, all the colors of the island come alive (even more so on the Blu ray). The casting is one of the greatest ones you will witness.

Given that Quakers are pacifists, the family stays out of the action and tries to maintain their separatist ways. However, the husband (Gary Cooper) seems to have more trouble than usual trying to keep this separation, as lots of temptations seem to get the best of him (such as music and his desire to best his Methodist neighbor). As for the wife (Dorothy McGuire), she seems like a giant wet blanket--a veritable black hole that sucks all the fun out of everything! If it's fun, she's against it! As for their three kids, all of them also struggle with temptation and external influences that challenge their commitments to the simple Quaker lifestyle. Ultimately, when Southern raiders attack, each member of the family is faced with the decision to sit by passively, fight for their country or run.This is a lovely film to watch for many reasons.

In addition, the actors did a very nice job and the end result is very enjoyable--at least up until the end.

The Bounty is considered the most accurate film about the events surrounding the rebellion on the Bounty, which was presented in two other classics Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 and 1962). While the original Academy Award Winner film of 1935 is a story about how tyrannical some men can be, and the first hour of the film of the film is pretty much Captain Bligh punishing his subordinates, the 1984 version is more light in this aspect and twists the story in a very different way.The Bounty is told in flashbacks from the point of view of Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) telling how things were in the ship and how the mutiny situation took place. Hopkins portrays Bligh as a friendlier commander who becomes more and more tyrannical after the Bounty gets to Tahiti and then his great friend Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson) forms a group of rebel that takes over the boat. I get used to the whole situation presented in Frank Lloyd's film with Charles Laughton playing a mean figure who most of the time was a brutal and eminent person, treating bad everyone for every single thing that Hopkins way of portraying Bligh was more interesting and from him you realize that this version has its own way to present things and from this point you can enjoy the film or don't care about it. I couldn't help but compare these two films and despite being a more accurate view of the real story I must say that the classic film was more appealing than this one, the adventure moments were fantastic, and the quality of the performances were impeccable while here only Anthony Hopkins display a great performance, the other members of the cast are good (Mel Gibson, Bernard Hill, Edward Fox), some of them are better in other projects (Daniel Day-Lewis, Laurence Olivier, Liam Neeson).Why you should see this movie? The brilliant cinematography is astonishing in every possible way and I can't believe it wasn't nominated for an Oscar that year; if you haven't watched the original version you'll enjoy more than I did because for a film made in the 1980's is very well made, the story is interesting even though there's some weak moments. But if you watched the 1935 movie you're gonna keep comparing both films but depending on your views this can be a better film or don't.The realism worked at times (when the female Indians appear nude in front of the Englishmen on the boat) but placing the whole story as the way it happened wasn't so much interesting because it annoys a little, carries the movie into a dark but slow way, and it misses a little bit of adventure. Another aspect that is out of hand here is the musical score of Vangelis, something that didn't match the film, in some parts when it was needed music there wasn't any, and in other parts that synthesizer music didn't help at all.

While the original Academy Award Winner film of 1935 is a story about how tyrannical some men can be, and the first hour of the film of the film is pretty much Captain Bligh punishing his subordinates, the 1984 version is more light in this aspect and twists the story in a very different way.The Bounty is told in flashbacks from the point of view of Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) telling how things were in the ship and how the mutiny situation took place. Hopkins portrays Bligh as a friendlier commander who becomes more and more tyrannical after the Bounty gets to Tahiti and then his great friend Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson) forms a group of rebel that takes over the boat. I get used to the whole situation presented in Frank Lloyd's film with Charles Laughton playing a mean figure who most of the time was a brutal and eminent person, treating bad everyone for every single thing that Hopkins way of portraying Bligh was more interesting and from him you realize that this version has its own way to present things and from this point you can enjoy the film or don't care about it. I couldn't help but compare these two films and despite being a more accurate view of the real story I must say that the classic film was more appealing than this one, the adventure moments were fantastic, and the quality of the performances were impeccable while here only Anthony Hopkins display a great performance, the other members of the cast are good (Mel Gibson, Bernard Hill, Edward Fox), some of them are better in other projects (Daniel Day-Lewis, Laurence Olivier, Liam Neeson).Why you should see this movie? The brilliant cinematography is astonishing in every possible way and I can't believe it wasn't nominated for an Oscar that year; if you haven't watched the original version you'll enjoy more than I did because for a film made in the 1980's is very well made, the story is interesting even though there's some weak moments. But if you watched the 1935 movie you're gonna keep comparing both films but depending on your views this can be a better film or don't.The realism worked at times (when the female Indians appear nude in front of the Englishmen on the boat) but placing the whole story as the way it happened wasn't so much interesting because it annoys a little, carries the movie into a dark but slow way, and it misses a little bit of adventure. Another aspect that is out of hand here is the musical score of Vangelis, something that didn't match the film, in some parts when it was needed music there wasn't any, and in other parts that synthesizer music didn't help at all.

They were both counsellors, and 22 years later, it's reopened and we meet a new group of such, consisting of guys who are willing to go shirtless(for the sake of the girls in the audience... though it's ruined by the dorky stuff they're wearing) and women who go along with getting half-, or fully, naked. They're stalked(...see what I mean?) by a POV and the score(...I'm going to stop pointing out these similarities). The latter is at times eerie(the infamous echo is present, as one of the only iconic aspects that are here from the beginning of the franchise). This is not good in any sense of the word from a technical standpoint. Filming and editing are average at best. The gore and make-up FX are nice(and at times creative and memorable... note that they aren't plentiful, you don't see much or for long), but they haven't aged all that well(still, you can tell Savini put effort into it, and it came out well). Neither did the slang(an American original? Is that even an insult?), and the dialog is meh. The attempts at humor are pitiful. Acting is basically all over the top. This does try to build up and be suspenseful. The pacing is off. They didn't really know what they were doing here, but they did want to do something well-done, and that really counts for something. This gets the job done, and one can understand why the sub-genre took off. You find yourself going no, don't go in there and thinking the killer will emerge suddenly from a dark space. While there are jumpscares that do not pay off, it can also really work. The biggest problem is that we aren't invested in these characters(only one of them is obnoxious, the rest you just don't remember), and it doesn't last the full nearly 90 minutes. There is a little sexuality and nudity in this. The DVD comes with a commentary track(put together by interviews with the various crew and cast... it's interesting and provides some good anecdotes, fun, history and background), a 22 minute documentary(that I will review on its own page here on the site), and a lousy theatrical trailer.

The biggest problem is that we aren't invested in these characters(only one of them is obnoxious, the rest you just don't remember), and it doesn't last the full nearly 90 minutes. There is a little sexuality and nudity in this.

From the beginning, it is apparent that the young man on trial for a murder is saddled with a jury that is totally unfit to pass judgement on whether he should live or die. Very few of these men should have passed a jury selection process; they were impulsive, lacking in compassion, ignorant of the law, and highly prejudiced against anyone not like themselves,except for two or three. This wedge enabled Henry Fonda, the lone dissenting voice at the start, to make a series of points that eventually blew away the arguments that the young man was guilty. During the process of passing judgement, the jury is subject to an intense self-examination of their own prejudices and opinions.As the movie goes along, the viewer is appalled at the mentality of the group, with no understanding of the scope of their responsibility. The foreman, Martin Balsam, takes his job very routinely and would have easily allowed the jury to pass judgement without any reflection. The movie was very effective in showing the men sweat and fly off the handle in the midst of a New York heatwave that made them eager to get away from the courtroom. At one point, one of the last holdouts, E.G. Marshall, playing an unemotional and stone-faced juror, was forced to wipe his brow under a barrage of questioning from Henry Fonda that exposed the falsehood of his assumptions. We see similar cutaways to Lee J. Cobb, who eventually loses his grip as others take the opposite side in the argument.This is a tense and unvarnished look at human beings thrown together in a jury and it shows the forces at play that would deny that justice be done. I am sure that this movie and others gave rise to some of the changes to the American justice system over the last 60 years to prevent the miscarriages of justice that probably occurred in many cases. A great movie and a lesson in the due process of law.

I hate to say it, but... what a waste of time.I lost interest about 20 minutes into the movie, then fast-forward the rest. I don't get the point of the movie. It doesn't work as a comedy first of all because Benigni is just annoying (yeah, I used to love some of his movies once too. Now I find it annoying) and secondly because we get the point of presenting the holocaust to your son as a game and there's no need to drag it for another hour. However, the movie doesn't work as a drama\/educational either It just doesn't seem to take any of the situations seriously and it doesn't show the horrors of the holocaust. In particular, I don't get the entire first half of the movie - it doesn't have to do with the rest of the movie at all.I didn't really find the movie offensive, just... a waste of a filmmaker's time and effort. It's funny that Benigni chose the prison camp uniform to have the same number as Charles Chaplin's uniform in The Great Dictator (1940), as I wanted to give Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940) as the example of how to make a masterpiece, dealing with the same subject - while making a comedy. Yeah, it's not easy to make a comedy about the holocaust, especially if you want to make a point and have some serious under-layers. In comparison to The Great Dictator, I would say that Life Is Beautiful is quite offensive - making fun of the situation instead of letting the viewer feel the horror and seriousness of it.Let me give you a simple example from The Great Dictator to make my point - How many were going to strike? - Three thousand of them. - Have them all shot. I don't want dissatisfied workers.This is one of my favorite bits. It's so funny, yet Chaplin didn't put it just for the joke - he put it there to show how cruel the Dictator is and REALLY teach about the situation and conditions. Benigni does just the opposite He makes stuff up just for the sake of being funny - I couldn't find any value in his jokes or in the script in general.To sum it all up, Chaplin entertains the viewers while at the same time letting them feel and understand the horror. Benigni completely detaches the viewers from the situation and his entire purpose is to make them laugh. Comparing Benigni to Chaplin is like comparison DreamWorks to Pixar.I honestly don't understand how this movie got so many praises.2\/10 Horrible.

That's more or less what I was expecting with this story about an ice cold assassin known as The Jackal (Bruce Willis) who's hired by a Russian gangster to kill a high profile American political figure in revenge for the FBI's involvement in taking out his brother in Moscow. My expectations were exceeded. The main problem with action\/thrillers is that they often have little in the way of story. Some would argue that this is a standard type of suspense movie, I suppose, but I found the story interesting, and the characters more fleshed out than one would usually find with this type of movie.Although called The Jackal the movie revolves more closely around the figure of Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) - an Irish terrorist jailed in the United States who's recruited to help the FBI find The Jackal before he pulls off the plot. Gere was quite good in the role, and the story filling in his background gave a plausible reason for why he would become so involved with the FBI's efforts. Yes, they made some promises to help him, but there's more going on. It's personal between Mulqueen and The Jackal, which perhaps gives everything a bit more of an edge. At times, the movie looks as though it's just about to fall into unnecessary romanticism with Mulqueen's relationships with a couple of women in the story. Valentina (Diane Venora) - a Russian agent who's involved in the search for The Jackal - and Isabella (Mathilda May) - a former Basque terrorist now living a quiet family life in the US - both look as though they're ready to get physical at times with Declan, but the relationships never go there, which I appreciated. Sidney Poitier was solid as Carter Preston, Deputy FBI director.Generally speaking, I thought this went above and beyond what one would normally expect from the genre. The level of post-Cold War American\/Russian co-operation depicted struck me as perhaps a bit too naive or hopeful, and one of The Jackal's identities (the Canadian Charlie) grated on me (as a Canadian) a little bit. He came across as too much of a stereotypical American perception of Canadians, saying eh in every other sentence and using an accent that I've never actually heard in Canada. The same could be said for Jack Black's gun- dealing Canadian Ian who's also a bit of comic relief. Nationalistic sensitivities aside, however, I found this a very enjoyable, fast-paced and interesting movie.
