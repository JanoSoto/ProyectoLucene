The slow scenes are equally crucial as the action scenes; the gorgeous sequence of Bree and John Klute shopping for oranges in the city market at night is a powerful statement that love can exist between opposites.

I remember reading Chandler's novel The Long Goodbye, and I never actually thought it could be put to film. The story was so convoluted ... philosophical, even. Also I couldn't fathom gangly actor Elliott Gould playing Philip Marlowe, a character whom I've always associated with the late-great Humphrey Bogart. In my mind, The Long Goodbye is the best film adaptation of any Raymond Chandler novel. The essence of Marlowe's character has been preserved in Gould's performance. I read that Robert Altman's intention was that Marlowe had been comatose for many, many years. I think that shows very clearly in the movie. Marlowe sort of stumbles around, mumbling to himself all throughout. Beyond what I'm sure is the popular consensus, Gould's Marlowe isn't stupid, and the end very clearly illustrates this. Sterling Hayden's performance as Roger Wade is possibly brilliant. I couldn't imagine anyone else in that role. It's obvious that much of this movie was improvised, and Hayden adds so much depth to his character through impromptu, incomprehensible speeches. When we see him marching into the ocean, there's an almost harrowing quality to it. Last but certainly not least, Leigh Brackett's script was absolutely flawless. This lady has given us so much, and I'd hate to see her forgotten in the annals of filmmaking and crime\/sci-fi fiction history. In my mind, her next best work was on the script from Rio Bravo ... another perfect work from a master storyteller. Lest we forget that she also wrote a draft of The Big Sleep, the film that everyone remembers as one of Bogart's finest moments. I loved the soundtrack, too. Pity it can't be found anywhere. Johnny Mercer's vocals to the theme song could never be replicated. But I believe it's Elliott Gould that's the brightest star in this movie. He's everything that I used to believe Phillip Marlowe was not. But it works in a way that I really don't know how to explain. His recurring line It's okay with me typifies Marlowe's personality to the letter. Perhaps the reason this film never reached the critical and box-office acclaim that it deserved is because of ... well, people like me. Gould isn't Bogart, so why bother? And you know what? The entire movie is predicated on Gould being the anti-Bogart, if you will. If James Garner or Steve McQueen were cast, no one would remember this movie. I've found a respect for Gould that I never had before. After this, I wanted to see more of his earlier work. While everyone remembers M*A*S*H, what about Little Murders? It comes on the Fox Movie Channel every once in a while, and it's certainly worthy of note. I wasn't alive when Long Goodbye was made, and it makes me nostalgic for the better, more creative days of Hollywood. Few really memorable movies are made today. Many of them are good, but ultimately forgettable. I wish I could have had that feeling of watching The Long Goodbye on the big screen. Doubtless I'd have been even more smitten than I am now. I suggest that you watch this movie along side Five Easy Pieces with Jack Nicholson and Karen Black. Five Easy Pieces is another film that sort of lingers in the shadows.

It explains to the reader what the ultimate facist state would be like. This story is never more important than now, with the world in crisis. It is an absolute must that people read or see 1984. Other films have been made about fascism. One of the most notable examples being Pier Pasolini's Salo. But the problem is hardly anyone is going to see that except for weirdo's or film buffs. This is because of the graphic nature of the film. Besides, Salo was explaining the inherently depraved, decadent nature of fascism. Orwell's 1984 explains the mechanisms that invoke totalitarianism. John Hurt is excellent as the main character. I am quite a fan. The film is also very well made. The bleakness of the book is perfectly captured by the director. You feel sympathy for the characters even though they seem far away because they appear so weary, yet willing to hope. Transcendence is hinted at when there is a scene where Hurt looks out and sees a wilderness instead of a prison. Hurt's character, Winston looks like he is about half dead! You really hope that Winston and Julia can pull off a passionate love affair. Although you know that it is doomed and is more of an act of rebellion against big brother than anything else. The setting is a land that is half destroyed because of the constant wars. The wars being yet another method of control. They tell us in psychology that in war, depression and other similar disorders actually go down! Interesting eh?  The start where everyone sits watching the screens and begins to scream at images of the enemy. This is a great moment in the film that shows a kind of utter conformity through extreme social norms. The most effective form of brainwashing.  The problem with the film, like the book, is that people will find it too bleak and horrific to really appreciate it. It is depressing but this is the horror of totalitarianism. The material is not intended to be a walk in the park. One of the most striking and horrific instances of 1984 is the 2+2 does not equal 4 scene. The torture and brainwashing too achieve utter obedience. Richard 'my voice competes with Orson Welles' Burton, who normally pontificates and chews up the scenery is remarkably restrained here. This restraint is the key to a very good performance. These torture scenes are horrific and Hurt really shines. This guy should have got an Oscar! The scenes had me gasping...When I originally read the book it took a while for me to get over the rats. EWWWWWWW! Looking at the overall rating of 1984 I am just totally surprised that this film has such a low rating. Maybe people would rate the novel exactly the same way because of the material. This brings me too my other quibble. The film does not TOTALLY cover all of the novels themes. In fact, although Suzanna Hamilton puts on a good performance, her character is not completely captured. Viewers must remember that literature and cinema are two completely different mediums. There is no such thing as a 100 percent adaption. Therefore you must rate the film on the usual cinematic features. But the main thing is how well the overall message of the story was transmitted. This film powerfully demonstrates Orwell's message!What is weird is one of the reviewers here states that they did not like the nudity. Well, I'm guessing the director was going for a Adam and Eve state with their being naked out in the woods. This is obviously the complete opposite of the unnatural state they have to live in. It does not cheapen the film and points more to the reviewers own repressed desires. Reaction formation perhaps? Besides no one is going to get this for naked bodies when porn is so freely available from your local video store!   Consider how relevant this story is. How propaganda and public relations has never been more prevalent. How public relations has overtaken journalism, causing journalism to become more and more watered down. How the political economy of the media is now being hugely influenced by being based in a monopoly economy. A few now control the flow of information for the general population in western nations. This is not conspiracy theory, this is fact. True investigative journalism is at an all time low and the media itself is in a shocking state of affairs. Like everything in our capitalist system, it is controlled by money. Ever read Michel Foucault? Dominant hegemonies, discourse analysis, bla bla bla. I don't want to get all crusty and academic here. But Rupert Murdoch is rubbing his hands together. Time and time again, the United States has been shown to be patently false about why they engaged in conflict with Iraq. Just read John Pilger! Yet many Americans supported the conflict. Even believing chemical weapons were used on American troops, when no such event took place! Why? Because they were manipulated by a sophisticated propaganda machine.    Knowledge is power. That is why in 1984 language is being systematically destroyed. This denial of language is the denial of thought itself. Reality is then more easily shaped by the oppressor. Remember dictators, such as Pol Pot destroy the educated first. This is why the film and book are so important, they are still very RELEVANT! In fact I think the progression of western society will become a mixture of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and 1984. Either way we are being manipulated and controlled and these books show you how. America has the 'Patriot Act' that was rushed through congress although human rights groups had many serious doubts about the act. In New Zealand we have a Government that is similary becoming too involved in the regulation of peoples lives. BIG BROTHER IS STILL ALIVE! I give this film a 10 and think the last scene with Hurt looking so haunted in the bar\/coffee place was awesome! GREAT, GREAT BOOK! GREAT, GREAT FILM! I have had a bit of a rant here...But hey I really like the book and this version of the film! So why not? This is a film for rebels!

Richard 'my voice competes with Orson Welles' Burton, who normally pontificates and chews up the scenery is remarkably restrained here. This restraint is the key to a very good performance. These torture scenes are horrific and Hurt really shines. This guy should have got an Oscar! The scenes had me gasping...When I originally read the book it took a while for me to get over the rats. EWWWWWWW! Looking at the overall rating of 1984 I am just totally surprised that this film has such a low rating. Maybe people would rate the novel exactly the same way because of the material. This brings me too my other quibble. The film does not TOTALLY cover all of the novels themes. In fact, although Suzanna Hamilton puts on a good performance, her character is not completely captured. Viewers must remember that literature and cinema are two completely different mediums. There is no such thing as a 100 percent adaption. Therefore you must rate the film on the usual cinematic features. But the main thing is how well the overall message of the story was transmitted. This film powerfully demonstrates Orwell's message!What is weird is one of the reviewers here states that they did not like the nudity. Well, I'm guessing the director was going for a Adam and Eve state with their being naked out in the woods. This is obviously the complete opposite of the unnatural state they have to live in. It does not cheapen the film and points more to the reviewers own repressed desires. Reaction formation perhaps? Besides no one is going to get this for naked bodies when porn is so freely available from your local video store!   Consider how relevant this story is. How propaganda and public relations has never been more prevalent. How public relations has overtaken journalism, causing journalism to become more and more watered down. How the political economy of the media is now being hugely influenced by being based in a monopoly economy. A few now control the flow of information for the general population in western nations. This is not conspiracy theory, this is fact. True investigative journalism is at an all time low and the media itself is in a shocking state of affairs. Like everything in our capitalist system, it is controlled by money. Ever read Michel Foucault? Dominant hegemonies, discourse analysis, bla bla bla. I don't want to get all crusty and academic here. But Rupert Murdoch is rubbing his hands together. Time and time again, the United States has been shown to be patently false about why they engaged in conflict with Iraq. Just read John Pilger! Yet many Americans supported the conflict. Even believing chemical weapons were used on American troops, when no such event took place! Why? Because they were manipulated by a sophisticated propaganda machine.    Knowledge is power. That is why in 1984 language is being systematically destroyed. This denial of language is the denial of thought itself. Reality is then more easily shaped by the oppressor. Remember dictators, such as Pol Pot destroy the educated first. This is why the film and book are so important, they are still very RELEVANT! In fact I think the progression of western society will become a mixture of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and 1984. Either way we are being manipulated and controlled and these books show you how. America has the 'Patriot Act' that was rushed through congress although human rights groups had many serious doubts about the act. In New Zealand we have a Government that is similary becoming too involved in the regulation of peoples lives. BIG BROTHER IS STILL ALIVE! I give this film a 10 and think the last scene with Hurt looking so haunted in the bar\/coffee place was awesome! GREAT, GREAT BOOK! GREAT, GREAT FILM!

","genre":"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 December 2003","score":"247 out of 297 people found the following review useful","review":"   Despite what one reviewer states here, 1984 is an extremely important literary work. It explains to the reader what the ultimate facist state would be like. This story is never more important than now, with the world in crisis. It is an absolute must that people read or see 1984. Other films have been made about fascism. One of the most notable examples being Pier Pasolini's Salo. But the problem is hardly anyone is going to see that except for weirdo's or film buffs. This is because of the graphic nature of the film. Besides, Salo was explaining the inherently depraved, decadent nature of fascism. Orwell's 1984 explains the mechanisms that invoke totalitarianism. John Hurt is excellent as the main character. I am quite a fan. The film is also very well made. The bleakness of the book is perfectly captured by the director. You feel sympathy for the characters even though they seem far away because they appear so weary, yet willing to hope. Transcendence is hinted at when there is a scene where Hurt looks out and sees a wilderness instead of a prison. Hurt's character, Winston looks like he is about half dead! You really hope that Winston and Julia can pull off a passionate love affair. Although you know that it is doomed and is more of an act of rebellion against big brother than anything else. The setting is a land that is half destroyed because of the constant wars. The wars being yet another method of control. They tell us in psychology that in war, depression and other similar disorders actually go down! Interesting eh?  The start where everyone sits watching the screens and begins to scream at images of the enemy. This is a great moment in the film that shows a kind of utter conformity through extreme social norms. The most effective form of brainwashing.  The problem with the film, like the book, is that people will find it too bleak and horrific to really appreciate it. It is depressing but this is the horror of totalitarianism. The material is not intended to be a walk in the park.

When a tagline pokes fun at itself, you know you're in for a real treat. Such is the case with Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, one of the greatest of all comedies and one of the only modern day films able to convince me from the start that I really was watching an old 30s film, and not a film made in 1974.Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are both fans of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and so when they collaborated to write the screenplay for Young Frankenstein, I can only assume that it was a fun experience for both of them. They reworked the story of Frankenstein and his monster into a smart, occasionally hilarious, always enjoyable, classic comedy that helped put Brooks on the map after The Producers (Blazing Saddles also helped quite a bit).Some fans of Frankenstein could consider the film almost sacrilegious, I suppose, but that wouldn't be fair. It's not a poke at any flaws in Frankenstein -- it's a well-thought-out continuation of Baron von Frankenstein's legacy, with an added pinch of slapstick comedy thrown in for good measure.Gene Wilder is Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Frahnk-un-steen, not Frank-en-steyn), grandson of the crazy old loon Baron von Frankenstein, who attempted to re-animate dead matter in his creepy mansion in Transylvania years ago. Frederick is a successful neurosurgeon, eager to put his past behind him. When a student asks him questions about his grandfather and research into re-animation, he is quick to change the subject.Then he inherits his grandfather's castle in Transylvania and makes the long, weary journey there to acquire ownership. Greeted by Igor (pronounced Eegor, not Eyegor), Frederick Frankenstein is soon haunted by his grandfather's interests. I guess the craving for re-animating dead tissue is just something that runs in one's blood!He stumbles upon an old chamber underneath the crumbling mansion, home to an assortment of odd inventions and textbooks (including How I Did It, by Baron von Frankenstein, which is a bit of an in-joke for readers of Mary Shelley's story -- they'll understand the joke, perhaps, more than most audiences).After finding a dead body in a graveyard and accidentally inserting an Abby Normal brain into it from the help of Igor (Marty Feldman), Frederick Frankenstein creates a new Monster (Peter Boyle), who is taken into custody by the townspeople and then escapes, finding an old blind man (Gene Hackman) in a cabin somewhere. He then kidnaps Frederick's bride to take her as his own and Frederick realizes that he must put an end to the Monster before everything in his life falls apart.There isn't much to say about a film like this. The comedy works, the style works, everything about it works. It's classic. Everything in it is classic Mel Brooks comedy.I suppose the accounts of Brooks' and Wilder's off-screen fights during filming are pretty well known. In one instance, Brooks got so mad at Wilder that he threw an object at him. Later he called Wilder and said, Who was that jerk that threw that thing at you today? He should be fired!It was because the two minds clashed together. Both being extreme fans of Frankenstein, I suppose both men had their own unique opinions as to what, exactly, the film should be about, and what, exactly, should happen in it. But for whatever the reason, despite all their arguments the film has turned into a masterpiece.Wilder's performance is extraordinary. After turning Leo Bloom (The Producers) into a nervous, paranoid, timid man, Wilder does a 180 here and makes Frankenstein into a self-assured, mean, forthright character --  giving us the feeling that he's been hassled his entire lifetime by nosy reporters researching into his grandfather's case, and he's tired of it.Filmed on-location in the original Frankenstein set, the film partly works because of its respect for the old horror films. The famous Universal horrors from the 1930s and 40s are spoofed in this film, and that is primarily is what truly makes it stand out from the other films in the genre. But Brooks and Wilder don't insult them. They compliment them and poke fun with them -- not at them.Brooks tried this formula once again in 1995 with Dracula Dead and Loving it!, which starred Leslie Nielsen as Count Dracula, although the outcome was not as smart as Young Frankenstein and not as convincing. Brooks did a great thing by filming Young Frankenstein in grainy 30-style black and white, reminiscent of old films such as Dracula or The Wolf Man or Frankenstein itself (not coincidentally, Brooks makes more than a few references to other Universal horror films, too).

Soon after Ethan reunites with his extended family they are slaughtered by Comanche Indians (except for the two young girls.) This action predictably sends our hero off on a course of vengeance.What makes `The Searchers' interesting is that Wayne's character is not on a traditional rescue mission, but rather he is setting out to kill the younger girl (the posse quickly discovers that the older girl had been murdered on the trail) because she has been contaminated by the Comanche tribe. It seems as if he is trying to rescue her from her horrible plight of being with the tribe for five years. These two characters are rater complicated as the various feelings and motivations are unclear. Does the girl (Natalie Wood) desire to be rescued, or is she happy amongst the Comanche? What causes Wayne to suddenly become more humane at the end and spare her? He seemed rather trigger happy and racist, so it was surprising that he did not end her life.This movie is considered to be amongst the best of all western movies, particularly amongst the John Wayne\/John Ford epics. I do not have enough movies under my belt to comment on the latter, but as to the former I find the `The Searchers' to be highly over-rated. John Wayne's character is complex and played very well, but I find the rest of the cast to be pretty horrible with the exception of veteran character actors, Ward Bond (`Rio Bravo' `Mister Roberts') and Vera Miles (`Psycho' `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.') The other roles, particularly the ones played by Jeffrey Hunter, John Qualen and Hank Worden seem to be comical and over played.The movie itself is amongst the most beautifully filmed I have ever seen. John Ford's familiarity with the location shooting in Monument Valley give this film great quality. Cinematographer Winton C. Hoch was surprisingly not nominated for an Oscar for this film (he won three times prior.) Even with all of the scenic beauty of this film I had trouble `buying' it as the location shooting looks nothing like the Texas prairie that was supposed to be depicted. The overall story of `The Searchers' has served as inspiration for many other movies involving a loners search for a missing girl, notably George Lucas's `Star Wars' and Paul Schraeder\/Martin Scorsese's `Taxi Driver.' While there are some general similiarities with these stories I find that the original character is far more despicable than the `Star Wars' hero or the `Taxi Driver' anti-hero, Travis Bickle. I never got the impression that Travis was willing to kill Iris\/Easy (Jodie Foster) in order to rescue her from her nightmarish existence and worthless life; he only desired to remove the evil forces that surrounded her.All in all, your time is not wasted watching `The Searchers' but it may not be as good as you have heard. John Wayne's performance along with the beautiful location shots are well worth viewing. For my money, the best serious westerns are `Once Upon A Time in the West,' `The Wild Bunch,' `High Noon,' and `The Unforgiven.' On the lighter side I suggest `Cat Ballou,' `Destry Rides Again,' and `Blazing Saddles.' `The Searchers' seems a little unclear to me as to what type of story it is trying to tell.

Soon after Ethan reunites with his extended family they are slaughtered by Comanche Indians (except for the two young girls.) This action predictably sends our hero off on a course of vengeance.What makes `The Searchers' interesting is that Wayne's character is not on a traditional rescue mission, but rather he is setting out to kill the younger girl (the posse quickly discovers that the older girl had been murdered on the trail) because she has been contaminated by the Comanche tribe. It seems as if he is trying to rescue her from her horrible plight of being with the tribe for five years. These two characters are rater complicated as the various feelings and motivations are unclear. Does the girl (Natalie Wood) desire to be rescued, or is she happy amongst the Comanche? What causes Wayne to suddenly become more humane at the end and spare her? He seemed rather trigger happy and racist, so it was surprising that he did not end her life.This movie is considered to be amongst the best of all western movies, particularly amongst the John Wayne\/John Ford epics. I do not have enough movies under my belt to comment on the latter, but as to the former I find the `The Searchers' to be highly over-rated. John Wayne's character is complex and played very well, but I find the rest of the cast to be pretty horrible with the exception of veteran character actors, Ward Bond (`Rio Bravo' `Mister Roberts') and Vera Miles (`Psycho' `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.') The other roles, particularly the ones played by Jeffrey Hunter, John Qualen and Hank Worden seem to be comical and over played.The movie itself is amongst the most beautifully filmed I have ever seen. John Ford's familiarity with the location shooting in Monument Valley give this film great quality. Cinematographer Winton C. Hoch was surprisingly not nominated for an Oscar for this film (he won three times prior.) Even with all of the scenic beauty of this film I had trouble `buying' it as the location shooting looks nothing like the Texas prairie that was supposed to be depicted. The overall story of `The Searchers' has served as inspiration for many other movies involving a loners search for a missing girl, notably George Lucas's `Star Wars' and Paul Schraeder\/Martin Scorsese's `Taxi Driver.' While there are some general similiarities with these stories I find that the original character is far more despicable than the `Star Wars' hero or the `Taxi Driver' anti-hero, Travis Bickle. I never got the impression that Travis was willing to kill Iris\/Easy (Jodie Foster) in order to rescue her from her nightmarish existence and worthless life; he only desired to remove the evil forces that surrounded her.All in all, your time is not wasted watching `The Searchers' but it may not be as good as you have heard.

The real trouble with Harry is it's not funny, but fortunately Hitchcock did leave us with a much surer and defter comedy in the guise of a thriller. Enter The Lady Vanishes.The opening scene gets a lot of hackles from people, as we find ourselves in a mountain valley where, after the credits roll, the camera glides over what is obviously a miniature train set. We even see a toy roadster glide by as the camera closes on the exterior of a model house.Why, it's so primitive and fake! exclaim viewers accustomed to Matrix-style FX.But they miss the point, and not just because they fail to take account of the time when the film was made. Here's what I think Hitchcock shot the scene with a deliberate nod at the hokeyness of it, reminding his audience from the start that this is not the real thing but play-acting, to be taken as such. He knows it looks a bit phony (though the arresting pan-and-zoom would be the sort of opening other directors would imitate as soon as the technology let them). The focus of The Lady Vanishes is not politics, or even mystery. It is fun, in the same non-critical way as a child's entertainment. In this, Hitchcock succeeds, and creates no mere time capsule but a vessel of entertainment that has withstood decades of changing fashion, because it is first, last, and always fun.The Lady Vanishes is the sort of film that works on pace, craft, and charm. The plot is well thought-out, provided you yourself try not to think about it much. There's really no reason for the story to go down the way it does, and once the movie is over, you begin to see the holes. Why is it necessary for British intelligence to go through so much trouble for info that could be just as easily delivered by telegram, or diplomatic pouch? Why, if you cold-bloodedly swipe a woman from a train, do you leave a witness behind to blurt out that there's been a disappearance? How come a name written on the inside of a train compartment window is erased by a blast of locomotive smoke across the outside of the window? But the engaging plot does what it is supposed to, keeping you interested and wondering what will happen next, rather than why it is happening the way it is.The storyline of The Lady Vanishes is unlike any Hitchcock film. It's so light and airy that it reminds me more of a Tintin comic book, with the mythical Slavic nation of Vandreka the sort of simultaneously quaint and suspicious setting Herge would stick Captain Haddock and the Thompson Twins. Leave aside your sophisticated Dashiell Hammett-fed expectations for a moment. If you let yourself go, you will be transported, and quite entertained. Hitchcock never meshed comedy so thoroughly in the body of a story as he does here. Even North By Northwest has its serious spots, but The Lady Vanishes features a tense fight in a baggage car that's right out of Abbott & Costello and a climactic shootout that pauses for jokes between Caldicott and Charters, the cricket-mad pair who are a non-stop font of humor.Margaret Lockwood is an effective plot vehicle as doughty Iris, who refuses to believe a knock on the head made her imagine the presence of the title character, Miss Froy. Michael Redgrave (Vanessa's pop) is a revelation as Gilbert, the folk-music scholar who half-humors, half-believes her strange tale until a stray scrap of trash converts him to her cause. He has a wonderful Errol Flynn-like quality, with his toothbrush mustache and his way with a quip.Speaking of quips, the dialogue in this movie sparkles throughout, as when the barrister tells his mistress The law, like Caesar's wife, must be above reproach, and she replies Even when the law just spent six weeks with Caesar's wife? Or when Iris asks how she was supposed to have replaced Miss Froy's face with that of the sinister Madame Kummer, and Gilbert replies Any change would be an improvement.Interesting also for the opening, which ambles on for about 20 minutes before it starts to go anywhere, establishing the characters and the comic tone without offering a whiff of what the mystery might be. The close, too, with villains who seem oddly detached once the story is resolved ('Jolly good luck to them,' Paul Lukas observes enigmatically.) But that's for film scholars to muse over.Hitchcock was never as agreeable a companion as he was here.

It is just not healthy...Ballard writes in a bleak monotone. A monotone that Chuck Palahniuk seeks to imitate unsuccessfully. All of his characters are alien because of their lack of emotion. Cronenberg takes this aspect and runs with it. This makes the film good not because of the familiarity and sympathy that the viewer can build with the characters. It is actually quite the opposite, the film strikes the viewer because of the sheer UNREALITY of what is happening. The complete and utter icy way that everything is presented just leaves the viewer going 'what?' Am I watching a bunch of jellyfish here?  The characters are so jaded. Trying desperately to experience emotion in an industrialized emotionless world. A world that has become nothing more than a production line. Good Ford! Sorry, Huxley joke.

Certainly not some sought of emotional closeness to one another.This film is just so incredibly empty. But it is also a comment on the human condition. How we make almost suicidal attempts to attain pleasure. If this was a film about heroin for instance, about junkies, this film would be much more understandable. Ballard has taken this addictive, self destructive behaviour and replaced it with an everyday object. The motor car. It is a brilliantly simple idea!

Emma Thompson's screenplay cannot be faulted. There is smooth fluidity in the way she tells this Austen morality tale of two sisters in 19th Century England who are left impoverished when their father dies, leaving most of his inheritance to his son. Naturally their only resort is to find a well-to-do husband despite their lowly status in British society--and of course Austen is in her element with this kind of material--a comedy of manners. Indeed, much of the film seems to be a rehearsal for her Pride and Prejudice which came later.As the more repressed and sensible of the sisters, Thompson does an excellent job, especially when revealing a remarkable sense of humor beneath some typically Austen remarks. As for Kate Winslet, I have to confess I enjoyed her much more as Rose in TITANIC. Her crying fits here are genuine but her foolishly romantic character gets to be a bit trying at times. It's a relief when she finally gets over her obsession for the shallow Willoughby (Greg Wise). A major flaw of the film seems to be relegating Hugh Grant's character to such a minor role in the scheme of things. His final confrontation with Elinor (Emma Thompson) seems nothing more than a contrivance to give us a happy ending for both sisters. Not only that, but he seems awkward in his role as a match for the older sister--and whether intentional or not, it doesn't make the Thompson-Grant relationship as credible as it ought to be. This could also be because of the obvious age difference. While he has some fine acting moments, his costuming and stiff demeanor suggest that he was not at all comfortable in this role.The cinematography by Michael Coulter is outstanding and Patrick Doyle's score complements the action without being a distraction. All of the performances are believable and it's a pleasure seeing Alan Rickman in a sympathetic role for a change as Col. Brandon--although even when he is cast in a more heroic mold there seems to be something sinister about him that he can't quite dispel.

Of course, you know that if it`s the Beatles, there`s going to be music (despite the fact that they`re only miming along to the soundtrack). My only problem was they re-used a few songs in the end sequence. Of course, they could only use songs from the soundtrack and it would be wrong to expect John and Paul to write that many songs for the one album.

I was fully prepared for the realistic beach landing sequence that had already gained so much attention prior to the film's release so what happened next is a personal experience I will never forget. The actual opening scene is NOT the battle sequence but the images of the elderly Ryan and his family visiting the American cemetery at Normandy, France.  In the span of a few seconds,  I was transported back in time and place to a raw spring day in 1982 at the beaches of Normandy, France. It was there, with my late Father and Mother, that we walked the same path along the cliffs as shown in the film. My wife and children were with me (as in the film) when my Dad turned and walked out among the sea of crosses and was overcome with emotion (as in the film). The horrors of war were never more apparent to me in a personal way than at that moment.It was as if Spielberg had been there 30 years ago and somehow filmed our family and then edited it onto the beginning of this movie.  I was so shaken that I barely remembered the rest of the movie and it was quite a while before I could get up and leave the theater. I am normally not prone to emotional outbursts and was embarrassed that I could not stop crying even as we left the lobby.  My reaction scared my son half out of his wits since he had no idea what had hit me so hard (he was only 2 years old in 1982).I have only watch the film once since then and the impact was just as powerful. I have often wondered if anyone else relates to this scene as I do since every other reference to the opening scene is actually the beach landing.For me, the cinematic faults or virtues of this movie are irrelevant in relation to the pain and sacrifice that this war inflicted on the world and I believe there is value in the way this film helps to assure that the pain will never be forgotten.

But, you have to understand that just because the writer\/director chose to focus on these specific Vietnamese people does not mean thats what they feel ALL Vietnamese people do. I was dragged to go see Ben Affleck's new abomination of a film Paycheck and the next day I watched this and it made me realize something. Moive goers now want the fast paced action that doesn't stop. We are apathetic towards slow moving, dramatic movies. I think if we take this movie seriously, and appreciate the fact that we are watching a great story, with wonderful actors in their prime, and a beautiful score that compliments the emotions of these characters so perfectly. Yes, parts are slow, but so what. The movie is great. Not my favorite of all time, but still incredibly well done and well acted.
