I've seen my share of bad cinema; movies like Lord of the Rings, Attack of the Clones, and Batman begins (which audiences seem to lap up like wild turkey), and let me tell you, that the Garbage Pail Kids movie is much more fun than any of those big budgeted piles of trash. What makes the Garbage Pail Kids movie so great is the fact that never in a million years would a film like this be made in todays PC market. The special effects makeup work of John Carl Buechler only adds to the insanity in this crazy little film. If this were made today for a children's audience, the Garbage Pail Kids would have been cute little CGI renders like the dreadful Alvin and the Chipmunks movie. This feature was a perfect product of its time and fit right in with Madballs, Boglins, Scary stories to tell in the dark, and Ren and Stimpy. So kick off your shoes, grab a Pepsi Clear, chill out and watch this thing.

From the moment Carole Lombard as Irene Bullock asks Godfrey Can you Butle? this movie drifts outside the realm or Frank Capra or Preston Sturges realism and into the cotton candy landscape of Hollywood fantasies about there being NO limits to what a load of nonsense movie goers will swallow. Just to mention one of innumerable possible examples from MY MAN GODFREY, this plot posits that HALF the value of a stockbroker's birthday gift necklace to his daughter is enough to acquire a controlling share of the broker's own firm (and that the other half covers the cost of putting Manhattan's homeless population into a swank new nightclub\\condominium project built over the city dump)--and that there's enough liquidity left over to redeem the magic necklace out of hock and let it rest a bit before performing new miracles! What will Godfrey do next--make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, or walk across the East River in August in order to turn water into wine for New Jersey picnickers?
