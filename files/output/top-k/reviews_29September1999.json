Ewan McGregor steps up and speaks. Seven words. Only seven but they were the words I prayed I would never hear in a Star Wars film again I have a bad feeling about this. AAAARRRGGHHH!!!! Suddenly so do I.I had prepared myself for this eventuality. All through the spring months leading up to the release I was telling friends and family alike to calm down. It was not going to be a good film. In fact it was going to be awful. I said it so many times I almost believed it myself. But I refused to get sucked into the hype machine and go out of some unstoppable pull from the force. I was going to see it of course, but with my mind totally unbiased, unclouded and free from expectation so I couldn't be disappointed. The release rolled around and I gave myself a couple weeks for the initial feeding frenzy to die down. Then, off I went to see what George had made after a twenty-year holiday. My opinion it's close. But a cigar it is not.First things first. It's not a total wreck. You can go and see it and enjoy yourself. There's no doubt that Lucas has been incredibly clever in the way he has set up his opus. We know what the end result from this series is going to be. Our young, blond-haired, whiter than white moppet is going to turn into the evil, asthmatic lord of the universe. What we want to know is how. And, to be fair, Lucas has done a grand job of creating a whole host of pointers as to where the series is going. They link up quite nicely and he has given a great deal of thought as to how he can cover all of the bases. To go into greater depth would be to spoil the plot but trust me, the link for how we get from here to there has been very nicely handled. The set pieces are also marvellous. Lucas has not lost his touch for handling big epic battles. We have dynamic dogfights, incredible infantry battles, ravishing raids and the light-sabre duels will make your head spin (they are stunning.) And of course we have Industrial Light and Magic's finest creating visuals which will make your jaw hit the floor so often that a chin rest should be supplied with each ticket. And Darth Maul (though incredibly underused) is outstandingly cool. If he doesn't return then there will be anarchy. No problems here and much slapping of backs for effort.However, all is not completely well. While the plot is fundamentally sound the script is occasionally good, often pathetic and doesn't really get any better than banal. How Lucas ever dared claim his script was finished is a mystery to me. You can't help but feel that if only Lucas had let someone polish it ever so slightly (the likes of maybe a Lawrence Kasdan or David Peoples) then we could have a much better time. And as for those seven, unrepeatable words? When is George going to learn that gripping dialogue they are not? Some performances leave a lot to be desired as well. Whilst the action muscles are still there Lucas's actor-handling ability seems to have atrophied. He almost killed himself making Episode 4. Here, aware of the lack of pressure and the gold plated certainty that this will make money, he's taken his foot off the throttle and is satisfied with just turning his words into pictures. They're pretty but a cake made of soap still tastes awful no matter how much icing it has. When you consider the cast calibre going into this (Neeson, McGregor, Portman and Jackson) you'd think we would get something pretty damn spectacular. What we often get is the wooden, the unsure and the downright awful. The worst is watching Nathalie Portman (one of my favourite actresses) deliver hokum dialogue in a hokum way. But then a ten-star actress cannot make five-star material anything more than what it is. She and, the rest of the cast, can only limit the damage. Jake Lloyd suffers from a similar problem. While not as creaky as some child actors he can only do the best with what he has. When he's good, he's very good. When he's called on to jump around like an eight-year-old shouting 'Yippee!' and 'Wizard!' then you want to strangle him. But at least he's better than the delegates from the Bad Actors Guild that play the Trade Federation iguanas. The pause that occurs when these locos are talking doesn't come from their strange alien dialogue but from the time it takes them to move their eyes to the next line on their cue-cards. Their make-up is a tad shaky as well and is certainly not as good as the effort that goes into making your average episode of Voyager. The CGI is out of this world but you expect this. The thrill of waiting for astounding special effects stopped for me with T2 and J-Park. I now expect CGI to be able to do anything and resent directors deliberately calling attention to their graphical box of tricks in the way that Lucas does here. You quickly forget that the CGI characters are there while watching but if you take one step back and look then it's still obvious that it's done in a computer. As for the Jar-Jar Binks debate? He's not as bad as people have made out but his presence can become irritating for anybody over five and he's about as necessary as the delegates from E.T.'s planet in the Republic Senate (Look closely. They are there.) And what's all this about metachloriwotsits and their symbiotic relationship with Jedi's. I take it that the Force has stopped being this divine, spiritual, essence of the Universe stuff and has become something akin to a germ that can be caught off a shared coffee mug.Maybe I've ranted a little too much here but this is just how it lies. It's great fun while your watching and once it gets going it concludes with an incredible climax. But the road is rocky and the feeling of a twenty-year let down often looms. But enough of that. Episodes 2 and 3 should erase all this cutesy muck, dealing as they do with Anakins fall and the Empires rise, with a much darker tone and more serious subject matter. Think of this as George does a Saturday morning adventure for kids that introduces the main characters and you'll be fine. Remember, we've had our dramatis personae. Lets see the real meat.

Robin Williams really plays well as an outrageous character and as a person who cares a lot.  The film uses every sappy and cliched moments for the audience to like it. However, I'm not sure which message the movie wants to point out laughter is the best medicine or doctors must care for their patients.  Robin Williams displays the former message pretty well.  But doctors aren't all that cold and as in the case of Patch's roommate, we do know he cares for his patients.  In a scene where gynecologists are visiting the hospital, we see Patch has setup a mock of legs where the middle area is the door and watching the doctors enter the hospital is like that famous scene in Look Who's Talking.  It was funny, but I realize also that I wouldn't want that joke played on me. In the generally panned courtroom scene, we see Patch making a speech where he is being tried for operating a clinic without a license.  He talked his way about improving the quality of life for the patients while skirting the issue that he was illegally operating a clinic. From some of the comments here in IMDB, I think the problem with Patch's character was that his way (supposedly laughter is best medicine) is put too much like a gospel.  What we mostly want is that there are people who care for us (much like what William Hurt's character in The Doctor wanted) and treat us well.  We don't really care about any dumb jokes, we just want to be happy and cared for.  The less fortunate ones like the kids in chemotherapy would benefit more from Patch's clownish ways of entertainment.  There's nothing in this movie relating to Make a Wish Foundation, so I wonder why the hell the old woman in the movie must wallow in noodles just so she will eat. Although you could fault the movie for its overly constructed plot, you'll still end up enjoying it.  You just wish for less bias in the story. The verdict 3.5 of 5 stars.

The film is rife with tiny but annoying lapses in plausibility Lester using an open window as a mirror while he pumps iron in the nude; Jane and Ricky walking along a street amazingly devoid of cars (a photographic convenience) until a funeral motorcade comes along; and a series of very sitcom-my devices in a subplot involving a case of mistaken homosexuality.Worst of all, I never felt involved in these peoples' lives. Even the most outwardly superficial people have human qualities on some level, but Mendes' main objective seems to be to satirize his characters rather than show us their depths.

Still, it must be said his performance here is WORLDS better than in Double Team, that classic of bad-moviedom. Perhaps because he's almost restrained, the makers of this have decided to bypass intelligent character or plot development (a fact given away by its grammar-savvy title) and packed it with common-denominator bits that are dime-store quality even by the action genre's sorry standards.

Like all of a sudden Jim Carrey's face was going to explode with laughter and he was going to break into fits of absurdity the way he did when he talked with his butt.  And if that is the hang up you have with this film, then I pity you because there is so much to this film that it could make you look at things a little closer.The Truman Show is what seems to be the story of a man that has lived a make believe life.  We all know what it is about and if you don't then this review is not the best one for you, skip down in the IMDb and there are many great reviews about what Turman is in the narrative sense.  I want to touch on something else and it is something that I hope other people can see as well.The Truman Show can be a metaphor for anyone's life, especially us that dwell in wealth of the Western Culture.  Because the one question arises in this movie that doesn't let go of you is a scary one, and that is  What is real?   I'm not talking in the literal sense the way Truman has it.  His life is not real in the sense that he is there for everyone to view and take pleasure from.  But when I ask  What is real?  I mean what in our life is real?  I'm sure that you can get a myriad of responces to that question but after seeing this movie it makes me question every single one of the answers that I can come up with.  The Truman Show asks you to open your eyes and look around you.  Is what you see pleasing?  Do you have the white picket fence, the two car garage, the double income family, the kids that are going to make you proud and go to college, good friends, a few pets, an okay boss, a sense of security, a faithful spouse, a nice car, money in the retirement fund and so on.  Well do you?  If you do, is it possible to fathom that it could all be a sherade, that it is all a mirage?  That white picket fence could get destroyed by a tornado or vandals, your two car garage could get destroyed by a fire, your double income family could be reduced to nothing if one of you is caught cheating or there are budget cutbacks and someone loses a job or becomes expendable, the kids may not want to go to college, they may get pregnant or make someone pregnant and want to work in a hardware store for the rest of their life, your friends may not like you very much and just put on an act for propriety sake, in fact one of those friends may be sleeping with your wife or husband, your pet may get run over by a car, your boss may despise you, the stockmarket could crash and all of your sense of security with it, your nice car is just a machine to get you places and the retirement fund could be gone tomorrow, you never know.  The whole point to this is that The Truman Show wants us to look a little closer at what it is that is important to us.  It shows and tells us in a round about way that we have become strange and demented when we prioritize the things in our life the way we do.  And in a way, every character in the Truman Show could be us.  How many of us want control the way Ed Harris has control?  How many of us are the loving wife ( or husband ) who is happy on the outside and stark raving mad and downright miserbable on the inside?  How many of us want to tell the world that something is wrong with it the way Truman's one and only true love wanted to tell him?  How many of us are the consumate actor when we need to be just like Truman's best friend?  And how many of us are Truman, a guy that knows something is wrong with his\/her life but has no idea what or how to fix it?  I think we are all like these people sometimes.  And that is what makes The Truman Show as brilliant as it is, because it is twisted but so is life.  If you haven't seen this film I strongly recommend that you do, and if possible watch it back to back with American Beauty.  Both have a lot to say about society in general, they go about it in different ways but it is essentially the same message.  It's never to late to start over.

Like all of a sudden Jim Carrey's face was going to explode with laughter and he was going to break into fits of absurdity the way he did when he talked with his butt.  And if that is the hang up you have with this film, then I pity you because there is so much to this film that it could make you look at things a little closer.The Truman Show is what seems to be the story of a man that has lived a make believe life.  We all know what it is about and if you don't then this review is not the best one for you, skip down in the IMDb and there are many great reviews about what Turman is in the narrative sense.  I want to touch on something else and it is something that I hope other people can see as well.The Truman Show can be a metaphor for anyone's life, especially us that dwell in wealth of the Western Culture.  Because the one question arises in this movie that doesn't let go of you is a scary one, and that is  What is real?   I'm not talking in the literal sense the way Truman has it.  His life is not real in the sense that he is there for everyone to view and take pleasure from.  But when I ask  What is real?  I mean what in our life is real?  I'm sure that you can get a myriad of responces to that question but after seeing this movie it makes me question every single one of the answers that I can come up with.  The Truman Show asks you to open your eyes and look around you.  Is what you see pleasing?  Do you have the white picket fence, the two car garage, the double income family, the kids that are going to make you proud and go to college, good friends, a few pets, an okay boss, a sense of security, a faithful spouse, a nice car, money in the retirement fund and so on.  Well do you?  If you do, is it possible to fathom that it could all be a sherade, that it is all a mirage?  That white picket fence could get destroyed by a tornado or vandals, your two car garage could get destroyed by a fire, your double income family could be reduced to nothing if one of you is caught cheating or there are budget cutbacks and someone loses a job or becomes expendable, the kids may not want to go to college, they may get pregnant or make someone pregnant and want to work in a hardware store for the rest of their life, your friends may not like you very much and just put on an act for propriety sake, in fact one of those friends may be sleeping with your wife or husband, your pet may get run over by a car, your boss may despise you, the stockmarket could crash and all of your sense of security with it, your nice car is just a machine to get you places and the retirement fund could be gone tomorrow, you never know.  The whole point to this is that The Truman Show wants us to look a little closer at what it is that is important to us.  It shows and tells us in a round about way that we have become strange and demented when we prioritize the things in our life the way we do.  And in a way, every character in the Truman Show could be us.  How many of us want control the way Ed Harris has control?  How many of us are the loving wife ( or husband ) who is happy on the outside and stark raving mad and downright miserbable on the inside?  How many of us want to tell the world that something is wrong with it the way Truman's one and only true love wanted to tell him?  How many of us are the consumate actor when we need to be just like Truman's best friend?  And how many of us are Truman, a guy that knows something is wrong with his\/her life but has no idea what or how to fix it?  I think we are all like these people sometimes.  And that is what makes The Truman Show as brilliant as it is, because it is twisted but so is life.  If you haven't seen this film I strongly recommend that you do, and if possible watch it back to back with American Beauty.  Both have a lot to say about society in general, they go about it in different ways but it is essentially the same message.  It's never to late to start over.

And I will stand resolutely in defense of Alien 3 as the best of the four films in the series, despite its flaws.Alien 3 has met with so much resentment because of its Babe Pig in the City factor-- those people who adored its predecessor were expecting a sequel that would simply EXPAND upon what they had come to know and to love. And, like Babe PitC, Alien 3 demands MUCH more of its audience because of its complex elements of tone, symbolism, and theme-- which are beautifully developed to an extent that is rarely seen on film.Alien 3 takes the Hey, we can take on these nasties! premise of Cameron's overblown installment and slams it firmly through the desolate infrastructure of Fury 161. This movie is quite possibly the most complete example of cinematic nihilism ever commited to film, and, needless to say, that kind of undertone doesn't exactly fit well with the tone of Aliens. The universe of Fury 161 is one in which there is no Force, no Mother, nor even a simple machine gun to which Ripley and the inmates can turn for defense against their hunter. And, unpleasant as the thought may be, that is the universe in which WE exist. Alien 3 doesn't try to dress anything up in a neat little package-- it wants you to see things for the way they really are. That's why so much has been made for the Alien as the AIDS virus interpretation of this film-- there are numerous layers and various avenues of interpretation that exist within the subtext here, and NONE of them are particularly encouraging.A prime example (and I'll just give one; I could list countless more...) of the complexity of this film is the scene in which the newly-gestated dog-alien mouths Amen to Dillon's powerful elegy. Just TRY to find such symbolism or complex elements of theme in Aliens. You can't, because they aren't there! Aliens is a great ESCAPIST movie-- but Alien 3 comes close to being a truly GREAT movie.Ok. I could go on far beyond my 1000 word limit on the attributes of this gorgeous film. Let's get to the nit-picks that keep it from being a 'perfect movie'-Although it is completely necessary for the thematic development of the film, it still bites that Newt and Hicks get killed off.

The most conspicuous being Ripley's address to the last surviving inmates They the company... they think we're CRUD. I honestly thought that was an EDIT for TV the first time I saw it. Then, when I bought the video, it turns out that she ACTUALLY says that. This is where a good script editor would've been nice.-At a couple of instances, the alien looks VERY fake. The alien f\/x from both Alien and Aliens hold up very well-- these aren't going to do the same, unfortunately. But this only mars a few scenes, particularly in the tunnel-chases.-What exactly are we supposed to SEE on Ripley's CATScan? Because you can't see anything but a grainy, purplish blob that doesn't look like ANYTHING. But the effect is still established, so no major harm done.-It isn't exactly clear just WHAT was on the Sulaco with the four survivors-- an alien and an egg? Two eggs? An already-hatched facehugger and an egg? THIS is the serious grievance that takes away from the film's overall effect-- everything else is forgivable because it doesn't detract from the plot or the thematic development. Rating 9 out of 10.

It stars Judy Garland and James Mason, in my opinion two of a handful of truly great actors, and Garland's own tragedies gave the story an extra frisson and force.  It makes the greatest ever use of Technicolour, intense, excessive and emotional; and its subject matter shook George Cukor out of his habitual gentility into his best direction, unafraid for once to be vulgar.  It is a melodrama, it is a musical and I love it to bits.  So you can imagine how initially this original felt inferior in every way.  There was no musical numbers to take the load of emotions too intense to be verbalised.  Janet Gaynor seemed like a mouse compared to Judy's tornado.  Fredric March was a wonderfully versatile actor, particularly good in comedy, but James Mason, behind his trademark suavity, sadism and insanity, always had a sadness and resigned loneliness, a great generosity of spirit that was just right for Norman Maine.  Worst of all, Wellman's direction was far too discreet and distant, making the storyline seem rather childish.And yet, as it began to build momentum, A STAR revealed itself to be a very wonderful film, quite different from its remake.  For a start, it's as much a comedy as a tragedy, and there are many funny lines.  The film is very bitter about Hollywood, and the sacrifices necessary for fame, as one might expect from a script co-written by Dorothy Parker, although it lacks the attention to detail that would have made the film truly corrosive.  There is a seething cynicism that provides an interesting counter point to the film's weepy elements, without ever betraying them the film opens and closes as a script, laying bear the artifice and manipulation we are about to see, mocking us for succumbing to the very canker it wants to expose.  There are subtle attacks on Hollywood anti-Semitism - the very ethnic Henckel becomes WASP-worthy Norman Maine.  Lionel Stander ('Moidah' Max from HART TO HART) is a very bitter publicity agent whose treatment of Norman towards the end is truly hateful, yet, we must admit, very funny.Far from being childish, the film is very mature, and is the most sensible and sensitive film about alcoholism until LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  There is no judgmentalism, no trite explanations.  The great tragedy is precisely this mystery why should Norman - so attractive, so talented, so popular - give up everything at the height of his powers.  It suggest demons that are way out of the depth of conventionally pat Hollywood narratives.  Also sex is quite frankly present, and they got the shower sequence - where March is quite clearly naked - past the Hays Office is a mystery and a delight.A STAR is a sublime melodrama, building up to an unbearable tragic pitch.  Even if you know what's going to happen, it's hard to resist the tears.  This is principally due to the magnificent acting.  Gaynor is truly great, convincingly maturing from a callow, ambitious, small-town girl, to a great actress who must helplessly witness the dissolution of the man she loves.  March is truly heartbreaking, a worthy partner to James Mason.  Norman is so patently warm, amusing, loveable, loving, that it's unbearable and unfair to watch his decline, his loss of control.  As forces beyond his control topple him, he may lose his public dignity, but never our respect.  Our world can't be all bad if it can find room for this masterpiece and its even better remake.

Lionel Stander ('Moidah' Max from HART TO HART) is a very bitter publicity agent whose treatment of Norman towards the end is truly hateful, yet, we must admit, very funny.Far from being childish, the film is very mature, and is the most sensible and sensitive film about alcoholism until LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  There is no judgmentalism, no trite explanations.  The great tragedy is precisely this mystery why should Norman - so attractive, so talented, so popular - give up everything at the height of his powers.  It suggest demons that are way out of the depth of conventionally pat Hollywood narratives.  Also sex is quite frankly present, and they got the shower sequence - where March is quite clearly naked - past the Hays Office is a mystery and a delight.A STAR is a sublime melodrama, building up to an unbearable tragic pitch.  Even if you know what's going to happen, it's hard to resist the tears.  This is principally due to the magnificent acting.  Gaynor is truly great, convincingly maturing from a callow, ambitious, small-town girl, to a great actress who must helplessly witness the dissolution of the man she loves.  March is truly heartbreaking, a worthy partner to James Mason.  Norman is so patently warm, amusing, loveable, loving, that it's unbearable and unfair to watch his decline, his loss of control.  As forces beyond his control topple him, he may lose his public dignity, but never our respect.  Our world can't be all bad if it can find room for this masterpiece and its even better remake.  Well, until we remember Mecha Streisand that is. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"29 September 1999","score":"","review":"  After over two years of hyped-up, special-effects driven movies, it looks like real movies are finally making a comaback. The latest addition to the list of quality films comming out lately is American Beauty.The movie presents us with what seems like the ideal setting for any American a life in the suburbs with a middle-class nuclear family. But we see that undeaneath the surface, things are not as ideal as they appear. Kevin Spacey is a man working a job he hates with an overbearing, slightly psychotic wife and an angst-ridden teenage daughter. Their new neighbors are an ex-marine, his teenage son who videotapes people and his really passive, unemotional wife. Thrown into the mix is the daughter's nymphomaniac friend who ends up inspiring Spacey to change his life, in a number of rash, illogical and not so wholesome ways.Over the course of the movie, we see that there's more to each and every single one of these people than meets the eye. And some of these aspects are more obvious than others. Each one of them has some sort of secret or dark side of their personalities that they try to hide under a facade of normality. None of these people are happy with their lives or themselves, although they try to cover it up as best they can. Their feelings and insecutities continue to build up inside them right up until the film's bittersweet conclusion.Although none of the characters in the film could be considered likeable, they aren't presented in such a manner that the viewer can't muster up some degree of sympathy for them. All the elements of this film come together. It's very well directed. They acting is top-notch (even if Annette Benning threatens to go a little over the top on occasion), the script and dialogue are of top quality and the score is really good. My only complaint about the film is the opening line where Kevin Spacy says Within a year, I'll be dead. This gives away stuff that the audience would rather not know and slightly lessens the impact of the film.American Beauty is the best movie I've seen this year so far and I certainly do not hesitate to recommend it. The somewhat downbeat nature of this film may keep it from getting nominated by the Academy Awards, but I really hope it will.
