It is film built on memorable quotes and moments from Oscar-winning One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest adapter Bo Goldman as well as one unforgettable performance.Though its length deflates a lot of its punch, there's a great humor driving Scent of a Woman. Pacino's portrayal is magnetizing and reckless -- the master of on-camera shouting perfecting his craft. You laugh because he makes you uncomfortable, he's blind and his dialogue is, well, frank. He speaks his mind because he's not afraid of the consequences. He enjoys the pleasures of life, particularly women, he drinks without abandon and yet there's an uncanny wisdom in everything he says or does. Sometimes an exceptional character study can make a movie and Pacino's Col. Slade certainly does.The film is about how a young man at a prestigious east-coast boarding school (Chris O'Donnell) ends up taking a random babysitting job to earn some cash during Thanksgiving break as opposed to forking out for the plane ticket back to Oregon. His assignment is of course Uncle Frank, who flips the weekend upside down when he swoops off with him to New York City where Frank has some plans to live it up -- and teach the young Charlie a thing or two.Unlikely friendships are the stuff of many great films and although Scent of a Woman really pushes these two clashing personalities together, it's not without the best of intent. Charlie's subplot is that he's leaving a big scandal behind at school during the break in which he has was interrogated by the headmaster as to who pulled a big prank. (The other witness is his friend George, played by a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman.) The headmaster has hung the threat of rescinding Charlie's recommendation to Harvard over Charlie's head and it his decision of whether to snitch becomes the moral dilemma that Frank will eventually assist him with.There are great scenes in Scent of a Woman from the ruckus at Thanksgiving dinner when Frank takes Charlie, both uninvited, to his brother's house where the relatives don't think much of him to Frank teaching a young woman to tango or at one point driving a Ferrari despite being blind. Memorable moments they are, but all relevant and all worthy of every second being drawn out? No. Director Martin Brest (Beverly Hills Cop) could've cut at least a half hour from this film. Each scene concludes after the audience has already figured out what will happen.The things that Frank teaches Charlie (and of course vice-versa) are lessons of great moral significance. There's no denying you could quote this film over and over again whether it's Frank shouting Hoo-ah! or his there are two kinds of people in this world speech. At the same time, scripted wisdom is not what makes a film great and that's why greatness eludes Scent of a Woman. What we learn from the film we do not learn through empathy or in an organic or home-grown manner.

They may not breathe, or bleed, but they are not truly dead. The researcher and the company he works for hope to use it as an anesthetic.The film started as a book of the same name by anthropologist Wade Davis, who is probably the world's authority on voodoo and zombies. Discussions were made to have Peter Weir direct and\/or Mel Gibson star, but obviously this never happened. The script found its way to Wes Craven, and Bill Pullman (at that point a young rising star) was given the lead.Author Wade Davis was on set from the very beginning and wanted to make the best film he could regardless of who the director would be. He notoriously did not like the way it went, and Bill Pullman says that both he (Pullman) and Wes Craven were disappointed, too, because they wanted a more serious angle and the studio (Universal) was pushing for a horror story. In retrospect, Davis seems to have become more accepting of the film and does not hold it against Craven. In fact, he praises many of the scenes for their authenticity, especially in comparison to other attempts at making voodoo films.The filming took place throughout 1987, and the political tensions were getting nasty in Haiti. Dictator Jean-Claude Baby Doc Duvalier becomes part of the plot, which makes this not just an anthropological horror film, but a political one, too. If people are able to look past the horror aspects, there is actually an important cultural document here.While the film is quite interesting for a variety of reasons, it starts off slow, and does not really pick up until the second half. Bill Pullman's character is the only one you are going to get to know from this film, and the only character who gets a lot of development. The natives seem very flat, and most just come across as wanting to kill Pullman. In a way, this makes sense, because this story is essentially told from his point of view. Bill Pullman reflected years later, I don't think any other movie I've done is as adventurous as this one.

It deals after all with an issue - inter-racial marriage - that's pretty commonplace today, and that few people would bat an eyelid over. One has to acknowledge, of course, that in the context of the era in which the movie was made - the mid-60's, when racial tensions in the United States were very high - this was a courageous movie. Strangely, considering how much the world has changed since 1967, the movie still packs a punch. Inter-racial marriage may not be a big deal anymore, but society still does - and probably always will - deal with the problem of acceptance of those who are different in whatever way, and of how easy it is to be accepting when one is only dealing with the problems of trying to get others to be accepting.That's the real tension of the movie. Spencer Tracy and Katharine Heburn play the Draytons, parents of Joey (Katharine Houghton). The three are a well to do, white liberal family. Mr. Drayton is a newspaper publisher whose paper has crusaded for liberal causes forever. Suddenly, their zone of liberal comfort is put to the test when Joey returns home from a Hawaii vacation with John (Sidney Poitier) - a successful black doctor - and announces to her parents that they're going to be married. Suddenly, being liberal isn't a matter of ideology anymore - now it's personal. Added to the mix are a black housekeeper who doesn't like what she perceives to be John marrying above himself, a Catholic monsignor who's totally understanding, and John's parents, whose reactions for the most part mirror those of the Draytons. The performances in this movie are absolutely first rate. No one could be criticized, and there are a number of powerful moments as the various characters interact with each other. The most powerful line of the movie - to me, at least, as it demonstrated the dream of society transforming - was John saying to his father you think of yourself as a coloured man. I think of myself as a man. Throughout the movie there are several of those thought-provoking moments. Interestingly, while dealing with a tough and delicate subject, the movie also managed to be quite light- hearted at times, especially the scenes in which John tries to break the news to his parents but can't muster the courage to do it.Spencer Tracy's closing monologue, as Drayton announces his acceptance of the marriage, is perhaps a bit too preachy (although well-stated) and, frankly, I could have done without the dancing delivery boy!

No one says its right, it just is. The Mission deals with the tragedy of such a situation in South America in the 18th century.Slavery was in the mix here however, practiced in the open by the Portugese and winked at by the Spanish where their king's writ ran. The area were concerned with in South America in 1758 is that area of the Amazon headwaters where the boundary between Brazil and Peru is not really to clear. Christianity was a both a savior and destroyer of animist Indian tribes back then in both American continents. It certainly did have as a message that their culture and beliefs were altogether wrong and have to change. But there are also numerous recorded incidents where priests and we are talking about the Catholic Church here put their lives and reputations on the line to defend these primitive societies from the evils of the civilization they were bringing.Such an admirable priest is Jeremy Irons in The Mission. He's aided and abetted by Robert DeNiro a former slaver who became a monk, renouncing civilization after killing his brother Aidan Quinn in a fight over a woman. The tribe they are working with and actually gaining trust and even some converts has been earmarked to be captured and used as slave labor over in Portugese territory.The Mission is told in flashback as Cardinal Ray McAnally is writing a report to the Pope of what is happening in South America. And in many ways what is still happening there.The Mission got seven Oscar nominations including best picture and won the Oscar in 1986 for best cinematography.

The area were concerned with in South America in 1758 is that area of the Amazon headwaters where the boundary between Brazil and Peru is not really to clear. Christianity was a both a savior and destroyer of animist Indian tribes back then in both American continents.

And the criticisms are all valid. The movie is a departure from the earlier films in the franchise (even its predecessor BATMAN FOREVER) and doesn't take the hero seriously. It is as close as any of the films come to the camp of the 1960s Adam West TV show, and it's like watching a live-action Saturday morning cartoon.With that in mind, though, the film is probably the most kid-friendly in the series. It's light and silly and the action is ridiculous. Any darkness from the previous films has dissipated, making room for colorful sets and good-humored cartoony fun. Adults may look at this film and shake their heads, but I have a feeling that kids will find it quite enjoyable, for the same reasons they enjoy Saturday morning action\/adventure cartoons.So what's so silly and cartoonish about BATMAN & ROBIN?Mr. Freeze leads a gang of raggedy hockey thugs. Batman rides a rocket headed to outer space. There's sky surfing. A wild-haired mad scientist entertains an assemblage of leaders from the evil nations of the world. Two villains disguise themselves in fluffy ape costumes. Mr. Freeze sky-dives with a set of metallic glider wings. Batman carries around a Bat-credit card. (Good thru Forever.) Mr. Freeze wears large polar bear slippers and conducts his goons in a chorus of the Snow Miser song. Arkham Asylum is surrounded by green lightning. Poison Ivy is always accompanied by sexy saxophone music. The dialogue is riddled with one-liners, puns, and innuendos. Everything that comes out of Mr. Freeze's mouth is a corny cold-related pun. The movie even uses some cartoon sound effects (bonks and whizzes) in the action scenes.All of that stuff really happens. The tone of the film is pure fun, with larger-than-life sets, wild action sequences, and light-hearted dialogue.While kids might like the cartooniness of BATMAN & ROBIN, it's still a pretty bad movie. A far-inferior follow-up to the already less-than-perfect BATMAN FOREVER. And it's not just the campy tone.Arnold Schwarzenegger is terrible in this movie as Mr. Freeze. His character is always making puns and acting crazy, but between Arnold's thick accent and his horrible line delivery, the whole performance is cringe-worthy.Uma Thurman is over-the-top as the seductress Poison Ivy, but at least it seems like she's having fun hamming it up. Her speech patterns are odd, but kind of fun in a who cares? it's a cartoon kind of way. I wasn't a fan of some of her various costumes, though.If one thing ruined the movie more than anything else for me, it was probably Alicia Silverstone (CLUELESS) as Barbara\/Batgirl. I thought she was terrible and unnecessary. Also, she's Alfred's niece in the movie, rather than Commissioner Gordon's daughter. She's a motorcycle rebel like Robin, a cyber hacker, and she's from England but has an American accent.Chris O'Donnell is pretty solid reprising his role as Robin from BATMAN FOREVER. He's joined by a dark-haired George Clooney as Batman\/Bruce Wayne. Clooney doesn't add anything special to the role, but he's alright given the silly nature of the movie. (His suave Bruce Wayne is a far cry from the tortured soul whose parents were gunned down right before his eyes. Does he even remember?)Batman and Robin have a fun dynamic. Not quite father and son, but more older brother and younger brother. Batman is always reprimanding the impetuous and inexperienced Robin. (This is why Superman works alone.) Poison Ivy's seductive love dust has the Dynamic Duo fighting amongst themselves over her. By the end, Batman must learn to trust Robin.Schumacher takes his visual style from FOREVER a step further, with more black light painted-face gangs, more neon signs, and more grandiose human body-based architecture.The acting is alternately wooden and hammy. (The two researchers in the finale are way over the top and the mad scientist is truly horrible in his scenes.) The sets are colorful (blue for Mr. Freeze, pink and green for Poison Ivy) and seem to come right out of comic book illustrations or cartoon shows, lacking any atmosphere that would give the movie a real feeling.In terms of the greater story, the film does try to have a serious side, with Alfred's failing health and the tragic story of Mr. Freeze and his wife. But, as others have noted, the film doesn't strike the right balance and the attempts at seriousness don't hold the silliness in check. Since the movie seems so totally silly, the serious parts seem out of place.Interestingly, in the DVD commentary, director Joel Schumacher mentions the corporate pressure to make the new Batman film more kid-friendly (in response to parents' complaints that the previous films were too dark) and more toyetic from a marketing standpoint (which explains all of the different costumes, vehicles, and accessories that could be, and were, made into toys). If the goal was to make a kid-friendly Batman adventure romp, then they succeeded.BATMAN & ROBIN is not a great movie, plagued by weak acting and ridiculousness. But it is very much like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon, and when viewed through that lens the movie makes more sense. It was made with the kids in mind, making fun a priority over depth.

Basically it is an all black contemporary musical version of Georges Bizet's legendary opera Carmen, also based on the Broadway musical production. The story starts at an all black army camp where Cindy Lou (Olga James) has gone to see her fiancée Joe (Harry Belafonte), but their reunion is spoilt when Joe is ordered to take civilian parachute maker and man eater Carmen Jones (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dorothy Dandridge) off the base. Carmen sets her sights on Joe, knowing his engagement and due to go into pilot training for the Korean War, and he does succumb to her charms, forgetting completely about Cindy Lou. Because Joe did not hand Carmen to the authorities he is put in prison, and while she waits she hangs around in Billy Pastor's jive café, where she meets besotted boxer Husky Miller (Joe Adams). She is initially uninterested, but her friends Frankie (Pearl Bailey) and Myrt (Diahann Carroll) convince her that she can't turn an invitation from Husky's manager to see him fight in Chicago. When Joe turns up quickly getting into a fight with Sergeant Brown (Brock Peters) for hitting on Carmen, she goes to Husky's training camp, where her friends try to convince her to forget about Joe and go with the money by staying with Husky. Later, Carmen gets her cards read by Frankie, and with the Nine of Spades representing death, she is convinced she will die soon, so she decides to dump Joe for the luxurious lifestyle with Husky. Cindy Lou comes back looking for Joe, but he is still in love with Carmen and rejects Cindy Lou with disdain. The night of Husky's big fight has come, and Joe turns up trying to convince Carmen to take him back, and when she rejects him the cards prediction turns out to be to true when he kills her. Also starring Roy Glenn as Rum Daniels and Nick Stewart as Dink Franklin. Dandridge is fantastic as one of the ultimate Femme Fatales of the cinema, the story is good modernised conventions of opera, the songs (especially Dat's Love, Beat Out Dat Rhythm on a Drum, Stan' Up and Fight, and Dat's Our Man - music is also the Overture) have been written around the great classical music, it is a very watchable musical melodrama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Herschel Burke Gilbert, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical\/Comedy.

Sean Penn's performance as a young and disillusioned army Sergeant in the Viet Nam war is absolutely perfect. He is utterly believable as Sgt. Tony Meserve, basically just a kid who loses the only person he cares about fighting a war he doesn't want to be in and then just doesn't care anymore. As he says, Sometimes you hate the enemy so badly... He is angry at the war, he is angry at the enemy, he is angry at the army that sent him there. He is just angry. He decides to fight back and take his own little personal revenge against the enemy, focusing it all on one girl, whom he plans to rape and abuse at their discretion. Surrounded by boys no older than he and far less intelligent and dominant and one man who is obviously unbalanced and violent anyway, Meserve's act is perceived as far larger and more grand than it actually is. The only hold out is Eriksson (played brilliantly by Michael J. Fox), a young family man who has not been in country long enough to become so jaded. There is a pivotal scene in the movie where Eriksson believes he has found a kindred spirit in Diaz (played by John Leguizamo), only to find that Diaz is weak and will not stand against the ridicule from the other men.Eriksson is true to his convictions and does not participate in the rape of the girl and so he is labeled a traitor and not trustworthy by the other men. He is threatened, attacked and abused by the other men but does not deviate from his course. He vows to bring the men to justice for what they have done and for what he allowed to occur, not through his action but through his INaction. There is a very moving monologue by Eriksson in which he makes a statement on whether what you do before you die matters more or less because you could die soon (paraphrase), ...everybody's acting like we can do anything. Because we might be killed at any second, maybe we gotta be extra careful what we do. Because maybe it matters more. Maybe it matters more than we even know. This film is a statement about war, yes. But it is also a hugely profound statement about people and what we can become if we are exposed to a society with no rules for too long. If we are exposed to too much violence for too long. The fact that it is based on a true story only reinforces this statement. It is also a statement on how allowing something to happen makes you just as culpable as those who actually participated. There is, perhaps no such thing as an innocent bystander. This film also speaks about the apparent futility in righting a wrong sometimes and how it can be quite difficult to be a good guy in the middle of a bad business.

It's a good title - the two principals get into a fender bender when they inadvertently cross lanes on a highway. Yet the lanes aren't really those of a road, rather they are the career and life paths that the two character seems to be following unquestioningly.The crash leaves both men late for a court appearance, a nice conceit in itself, given that the law is a practical civic expression of majority morality. The unsatisfactory outcome of their morning in court sets in motion a reactive game of tit for tat in which each blames the other for their misfortunes - but their own failings rise to the surface with alarming clarity. It's a good blend of action and revelation, although to effect the entire thing in a day stretches credulity to its limits.Affleck's flash-n-fresh lawyer Baneck is solid but not quite as good as Samuel L Jackson's Doyle; both labour manfully under the compressed schedule of episodes.
