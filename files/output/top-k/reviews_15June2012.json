[{"date":"15 June 2012","score":"","review":" Nutty Professor 2 The Klumps is sequel to the remade version of The Nutty Professor. The movie is about nice Sherman Klump who is about to be married to an entirely person from the first movie and tries to make his sleek and evil alter ego a separate person. He succeeds, but finds himself getting dumber and dumber just as he's about to make a presentation about a new thing he created, which ends up horribly inappropriate. The plot is remotely interesting, but ridiculous and meaningless. It's fine that if a sequel isn't as funny as its predecessor, but filling every scene with a forced sexual innuendo or a bathroom joke is not good, it's just wrong.The first movie had the same kind of material, but there were other jokes that were used. Just watch the first movie, the original Disney version, or even the classic Robert Louis Stevenson book Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde. My Rating *\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"15 June 2012","score":"","review":" Nutty Professor 2 The Klumps is sequel to the remade version of The Nutty Professor.
