A modest showing at the box-office soon led to rampant word-of-mouth with it's VHS release, and soon enough, around the early 2000's, everybody seemed to responding to questions with yeah, baby!. While it's hook is a mixture of (very accurately) spoofing 60's kitsch spy movies and outright silliness, Myers' Powers is winning thanks to the puppy-dog appeal of it's creator.After seeing his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers) escape his clutches by cryogenically freezing himself and escaping in a Big Boy-shaped space rocket, Austin Danger Powers joins the likes of Evil Knievel and Vanilla Ice and freezes himself for 30 years. When Evil returns, planning on stealing the world's nuclear weapons, Powers is thawed out and is unleashed into a changed world. No longer are people experimenting with mind-altering drugs and having care-free, unprotected sex, and Powers gets lumped with his ex-partner's buzz-killing daughter Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley).Myers seems fully aware that the 1960's were camp enough already to raise laughs, so the film spends a lot of time paying homage to the likes of the hyperactive energy of A Hard Day's Night (1964), the big- boobed laden, pervy fun of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970), and even the ultra-chic photo-shoots of Antonioni's classic Blowup (1966). These scenes are surprisingly spot on, and Myers is in his element running away from an army of screaming girls to that now-iconic theme song. Of course, the film spends the majority of the film in the 1990's, and Powers seems incredibly out-dated, and people now notice his terrible teeth.Most of the laughs come from the clever observations made of the early James Bond movies. Anyone who remembers Honor Blackman's ridiculously named Pussy Galore from Goldfinger (1964), will get a laugh from the character named Alotta Fagina, or Dr. Evil's shoe-throwing henchman Random Task. Or for anyone who has seen any of the Sean Connery Bond's, will no doubt be amused at Dr. Evil's insistence on placing Powers in an easily-escapable and elaborate death device and refusing to even watch the deed, much to the annoyance of Evil's son (Seth Green). The rest of the laughs are hardly clever - they tend to derive from Myers gurning or daft innuendo - but this is a silly and effortlessly humorous 90 minutes, full of quotable lines that are no doubt as dated as Powers' outfits.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It's surprising to think that the second of two inspired characters thought up by Mike Myers, the flamboyant, sex-crazed super-spy Austin Powers, took so long to catch on.

However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by Warrick Davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire's all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke's final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO. Frank Oz's Yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. And yes, there's also John Williams' music.All told, while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.In 1997, George Lucas re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) Special Editions, which featured added-in effects and\/or shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three, RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) Jedi Rocks musical number in Jabba's Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. However, I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on Naboo, where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming, Wesa free!), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However, if you're watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the definitive editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga (as Lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.

When it started it was absolutely stunning, the styling, the sensuality, the effects (for 1992), great imagery. And then suddenly it seems like the budget was gone, they cut vital parts from the movie (ok Prince Vlad is Dracula but we never see the transformation) and they finished it quickly. From the moment Jonathan and von Helsing burn the earth the movies turns fully the other way from high quality to 1930's board-carton special studio effect. The storyline is brought quickly to an end, the chase and fight that should be the climax is just a joke so cheap it was made. Even in 1992 this was probably laughable, maybe good for the 1930's. And there are many more, Dracula should rest in his own ground, but why then is he hanging like a bat on the ceiling at night (why is it still in boxes), when he is supposed to be most active?

I can understand both views, but after watching this twice, I am sorry to say I cannot come to the conclusion that this is a good movie. And it has nothing to do with how close it is or isn't to the books.To start with the positive side of things, the score is magnificent. In fact, I like it more than the music from the much-loved Peter Jackson LOTR trilogy, probably because it's less gloomy and bombastic. It just exudes fantasy and adventure. The animation is mostly solid and I enjoyed how Bakshi employed rotorscoping with the more sinister characters.However, even though the animation and rotorscoping are good on their own, I do not think they blend well. The mix of realistic characters, more cartoony characters, and the rotorscoped characters make for a messy, rushed aesthetic that feels more annoying than cutting edge. I think the rotorscoping worked much better in Bakshi's previous fantasy film, Wizards (1977), since it was only a mix of non-realistic characters with rotorscoped demons and monsters.The editing is sometimes awkward and the characterization choices are sometimes borderline strange (in Sam's case, it was downright abominable; OH HOO-RAYYYY!!). Some of Gandalf's antics are unintentionally funny. The pacing is atrocious and there are stretches where you find yourself groaning and checking your watch every other minute.In conclusion, the film just feels unfinished.

And seeing The Mark of Zorro (1940), one can see plainly how it could inspire. It looks like a smaller production than 1998's The Mask of Zorro (only a one-letter difference in the title), but The Mark of Zorro has solid production values and plenty of life and action anyway. It thus does as much justice to the character of Zorro as Zorro did for California.Tyrone Power plays Don Diego Vega, a master swordsman who returns to California from Spain, only to find his governor father overthrown and replaced by a tyrant. Power succeeds in portraying a character with a double life, a foppish Don Diego Vega and a heroic Zorro. One thing I thought was a little lacking was why he chose to take the form of a masked bandit or why he chose the name Zorro. And doesn't the fact that Zorro explicitly wants his father back on the throne make Don Diego Vega a little suspicious? On the other hand, the way he acts unmasked would take a little away from any suspicion. The film has plenty of swashbuckling action scenes that offer excitement without gore; with a dash of romance and sex appeal (Zorro falls in love with his enemy's beautiful young niece, kind of like how the new Zorro loves his enemy's adopted daughter in the 1998 film).

So overdone are the effects, that watching this movie reminded me less of the first trilogy than of Cool World, Bakshi's misfire mix of live-action and animation. In this entry, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor), only a student Jedi, travels with his teacher to the planet Naboo on a mission of mercy. Jedi Qui-Gonn Jin is older and wiser than Kenobi, but both are dispatched to prevent the invasion of idyllic Naboo by the droid armies of the trade federation. When this fails, the two save that planet's leader, the elected Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), and retreat to the safety of Corsuscant, the home of galactic senate. Heavy damage forces them to make an unscheduled stop on arid Tatooine, where they enlist the aid of a young Aankin Skywalker, a boy slave with the potential to become a Jedi master. Safely reaching Coruscant, Amidala finds only bureaucratic indifference to her world's plight. Returning to Naboo to lead the fight against the federation, Amidala and the Jedi's enlist the aid of the Gungans, amphibians who live in large cities secreted in Naboo's oceans. While the naboo battle the federation on the ground and in space, and Amidala leads a desperate charge directly into her occupied capital, the Jedis are forced to confront an evil Jedi, an emissary of the long-thought-dead order of the sith Jedi and closer to the power behind the federation than the craven Federation viceroys. Actually, the plot doesn't sound half-bad, if that's enough after a 16 year wait. Less generous might compare it to a mediocre add-on level for the Star Wars computer game, Jedi Knight. The characters are incredibly one-note in comparison with the heroes of the older films. Even the Jedi seem interchangeable with Obi Wan seeming as effortless in his moves as Qui-Gon. The older Jedi is also pretty monochrome considering the dialogue hinting at a rebellious streak (he clashes often with the Jedi counsel). The characters themselves speak in hushed tones and drop names that are familiar to Star Wars fans but will probably baffle anybody else. There's no rebelliousness to any of the characters - where's Han Solo in all of this? The controversies of the alien characters' very human ethnic traits probably wouldn't have come to the for if the human characters themselves had enough character of their own and embodied some of those negative traits themselves. In the older films, we probably wouldn't have noticed the orientalisms of the greedy Watoo or the craven Federation honchos, or minded the comic relief of Jar Jar Binks. Hey everybody's an idiot, everybody makes mistakes, that was what the first trilogy seemed to say. And there's no menace either. Darth Maul is no Darth Vader (though his moves would put the latter evil lord to shame, a true dark lord seldom needs to prove that), and certainly he gets no fun lines (apology accepted....) The underlying evil is the mysterious Darth Sidious who appears mostly in the form of a hologram beamed to the federation viceroys. But Sidious (whose probably isn't sufficiently mysterious for true star wars fans) doesn't seek to cow his minions either. He issues commands which the viceroys would probably have issued anyway. And there's none of the irony of the first films which here should centre around the manoeuvrings of Senator Palpatine. That name enough lets fans know what's going on, but his insistence that political circumstances require drastic changes should be enough to set off anybody's warning bells no matter how apparently benign his intentions.

This is one hell of a masterpiece, from cinematography to acting, directing and script writing, a 9\/10 for this genius film art.

Some may call 'The Celebration' a black comedy, which according to Wikipedia, fits the definition In black humor, topics and events that are usually regarded as taboo&#x85;are treated in an unusually humorous or satirical manner while retaining their seriousness. But the film also falls under the broader category of farce a farce is a comedy that aims at entertaining the audience through situations that are highly exaggerated, extravagant, and thus improbable&#x85;Farce is also characterized by physical humor, the use of deliberate absurdity or nonsense, and broadly stylized performances&#x85;Furthermore, a farce is also often set in one particular location, where all events occur.If one accepts Eric Bentley's definition of farce where one is permitted the outrage without the consequences, then Vinterberg has broken the societal taboos of pedophilia by asking us (in effect) to consider that the consequences of such a transgression might not be as bad as one thinks. Indeed, when Christian spills the beans at his father's big birthday bash that he was molested by his father as a child, the outrage is certainly there for all to see-but the consequences are hardly what the viewer is expecting.'The Celebration' reminds me of a much darker version of 'Seinfeld'. The four 'Seinfeld' buddies are deeply flawed human beings, but once they come across a much darker force (The 'Soup Nazi' as one of countless examples), they must prepare themselves to do 'battle'. The end result is that our 'heroes' may end up a bit 'bloodied', but their far more neurotic counterpart, must inevitably receive his\/her comeuppance.Hence, Helge's children, Christian, Michael and Helene, are cast as the protagonists, who inevitably must take their 'evil' father down. But along the way, they too, with their serious flaws, are exposed as pyrrhic victors. Perhaps the most flawed of the three children is Michael. Immediately we see what a hothead he is when he kicks his wife and children out of the car, to give his brother a ride, driving up to the family-run hotel where the celebration will take place. Later, he flips out completely, berating his wife for forgetting to pack his favorite shoes, that he was planning to wear at the party. If there's one wrong note in the film, it's Vinterberg's decision to cast Michael as an out and out racist, after he sings a racist song, disparaging Helene's African-American boyhood. The whole idea here is to highlight the characters' limitations, not make them unsympathetic!Vinterberg also hints that Helene has not lived up to her expectations. When she finds a suicide note belonging to Christian's twin sister, Lisa, who killed herself a couple of months before, she ineffectually hides it, afraid to reveal its contents to anyone. Helene's mother, Else, expresses her disappointment in her surviving daughter by alluding to her failed career choice as a singer and her flirtation with socialism. Else's racism is much more subtle when she claims Helene chose 'anthropology' over 'law' (a dig at Helene's black boyfriend).And finally there's Christian, who Helge reveals during one of their 'one-on-one's', has a history of psychiatric problems and failures of relationships with women. While a victim of sexual abuse as a child, Christian can only ineffectually lash out at his parents in front of friends and family members. Even after his initial claim of abuse, he comes back for 'more', castigating his father again and then his mother, claiming she was a witness to Helge's pedophilia and did and said nothing. The whining Christian ends up being tied to a tree by Michael, as the younger son believes his mother's story that Christian is a teller of 'tall tales'.Soon, however, the far more disturbed Helge gets his comeuppance. After the toastmaster reads Linda's suicide note (given to him by Helene at Christian's behest), the deceased daughter implies she was also molested by Helge (as part of a dream, she says). Helge finally owns up to his behavior, by outrageously stating that was all Christian was good for. But instead of anyone calling the police, the consequences are minimal for the family patriarch. That evening Michael administers a non-lethal beating; in the morning he beats a hasty exit as Michael asks him to leave the breakfast area&#x97;with the further proviso that he will be not be seeing his grandchildren ever again.As for Else, she declines to join her husband 'in exile'. Some internet posters have stated that she too deserved Helge's fate. But consider this at the time the abuse occurred, what could she really have done? If she had went to the police, would anyone have believed her? Or if she tried to leave with the kids, what kind of financial support would she have had and wouldn't have Helge done everything in his power, to prevent her from taking the kids?You may have noticed, of course, the low quality of the film's production. That's of course due to Vinterberg's allegiance to the Dogme 95 Collective school of filmmaking, which Vinterberg was one of the founding members. We all remember what this silly avant-garde movement was all about no props, no music, a hand-held camera, filmed on location, director getting no credit, etc. In short, Dogme 95 was just another word for 'low-budget' and a well-meaning attempt by independent filmmakers to achieve parity with the big-budget studios.Vinterberg's real achievement here is extending the genre of black comedy into a new realm. Taboos are refreshingly swept aside with a 'happy ending' (the antagonist is dealt with by his family not the police; facing ostracism instead of a criminal sentence).

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"4 August 2014","score":"","review":" From the director of Lethal Weapon, Richard Donner gives us movie that truly spells Ridley Scott. Ladyhawke is a layered movie that relies on more than one genre. It's a film filled with love and romance backed up with a fantasy story with medieval setting with witchcraft and animals where evil curses are prominent thanks mainly to jealousy brought on my a man of the cloth trying to keep young lovers apart from each other. In other words it feels like Romeo and Juliet romantic story with a fairytale theme behind it.Right from the beginning, the first thing that will stun you is the tantalizing visuals. The Italian landscapes are real visionary treat and the historical settings are what makes this movie more historical in details. Everything looks real in terms of locations, the castles, the towns, the ruins and the courtyards all look and feel authentic. The visuals all groovy looking as every shot has a postcard image that will make your eyes water. The dawns and dusk of the Italian countryside will likely take your breath away.Of course the beautiful setting has a weakness and that is the setting looks too immaculate. Granted this is a fairytale and nothing has to be real, however being that this is a medieval period piece film, I expected some rough roads, bumpy trails and maybe a little bit of mud. Everything looks too pristine, the buildings look way too maintained and for a rural area, the countryside looks way too clean, even the costumes look prim and prop. I am a neat freak in real life, but for a medieval picture I was expecting a bit of filth to match the period.Another big turn-off is the musical score selection that Donner provides is quite odd. I would of expected like a symphony orchestra background that would go well with the setting of the movie. Instead, Donner gives us a 1980's sounding score complete with synthesizers and electric guitars almost like what Ridley Scott did with the movie Legend. It just doesn't sit well compared to the authentic backdrop of the settings and loses the effect of the story marginally.The casting choices are virtually spot on, especially the casting of Rutger Hauer and a young Michelle Pfeiffer. Hauer was best performer in the movie. He looked really awesome in that Jedi like robe along with a traditional heroic costume and a red lining and a black steed to ride on making this man look and appear like he's well off.

She has the physicality of an angel that fits right with Hauer's knightly appearance. They make the perfect couple and they seem very believable that they could transform into a wolf and a hawk (Ladyhawke...need I say more?) The biggest miscast in this movie is the casting choice of Matthew Broderick. He was the major Achilles heel in this movie. His demeanour is annoying along with that mousy squeaky voice and constant nervous ramblings is more appalling than nails on a chalkboard. I just wanted to wanted to ring his neck for every time he made those stupid facial expressions.The plot needs time to adjust. I mean Navarre (Hauer) is a wolf at night and Isadeau (Pfeiffer) is a hawk by day, leaves little for explanation. There are no strange transformations and the characters just fade into their animal forms which is quite captivating in its low-key perspective. I thought the plot was overdo because the story is very thin, it's really about Navarre getting revenge on the Bishop (John Wood) for putting an evil curse on him. That being said I think that in this two hour film, there's a substantial amount of padding when there really didn't need that much and it can be mundane at times making it feel all style and no substance at times. Which isn't bad but some editing could've been needed in some areas.Overall it is a gorgeous movie with a picturesque setting and all the Italian landscapes are very sublime.

","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2014","score":"","review":" From the director of Lethal Weapon, Richard Donner gives us movie that truly spells Ridley Scott. Ladyhawke is a layered movie that relies on more than one genre. It's a film filled with love and romance backed up with a fantasy story with medieval setting with witchcraft and animals where evil curses are prominent thanks mainly to jealousy brought on my a man of the cloth trying to keep young lovers apart from each other. In other words it feels like Romeo and Juliet romantic story with a fairytale theme behind it.Right from the beginning, the first thing that will stun you is the tantalizing visuals. The Italian landscapes are real visionary treat and the historical settings are what makes this movie more historical in details. Everything looks real in terms of locations, the castles, the towns, the ruins and the courtyards all look and feel authentic. The visuals all groovy looking as every shot has a postcard image that will make your eyes water. The dawns and dusk of the Italian countryside will likely take your breath away.Of course the beautiful setting has a weakness and that is the setting looks too immaculate. Granted this is a fairytale and nothing has to be real, however being that this is a medieval period piece film, I expected some rough roads, bumpy trails and maybe a little bit of mud. Everything looks too pristine, the buildings look way too maintained and for a rural area, the countryside looks way too clean, even the costumes look prim and prop. I am a neat freak in real life, but for a medieval picture I was expecting a bit of filth to match the period.Another big turn-off is the musical score selection that Donner provides is quite odd. I would of expected like a symphony orchestra background that would go well with the setting of the movie. Instead, Donner gives us a 1980's sounding score complete with synthesizers and electric guitars almost like what Ridley Scott did with the movie Legend.

I saw Star Wars as much as the films I saw the second and third most often in a movie theater, which would be, of course, The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi. I even sat through the movie twice in a row, the first time so I could pay attention to everything that happened in the lower left quadrant of the film and the second time so I could watch the lower right quadrant.Watch the film again for the first time in several years three things stuck out in my mind as to why this film got us so excited way back when. The first, as noted above, was how there was so to look at in this film. Nobody ever laughed at the alien in the sunglasses trailing after the good guys at Mois Eisley, but in addition to the all the weird looking aliens in the Cantina and throughout the film there was the way this galaxy far, far away looked like it had been lived in. The idea that the Millennium Falcon is not only the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy but actually looks like a hunk of junk mattered. Even the wacky white armor of the Storm Troopers meant something to us, even if we questioned its functionality. You could reduce Han Solo to his grin, Princess Leia to her hairdo, and Luke Skywalker to his lightsaber, because the costumes and art design were things we had never seen before. Of course, Darth Vader being able to think people to death was pretty impressive.The second is that if there is any one thing that made Star Wars move than a B movie made with an A budget it is the musical score by John Williams. The composer had won his first Oscar two years earlier for Jaws and was also nominated for Close Encounters of the Third Kind when he won again for Star Wars. One of the things we did because we could not go and sit in the theater watching Star Wars all day was to listen to the double-album for the movie's soundtrack (yes, I probably listened to this soundtrack more than any other in history than did not require singing The Time Warp or any other song). I do not know how much of the movie is scored to music, but it has to be an extremely high percentage, albeit short of what you would get with a silent film. The only movie score that I find comparable is the one Ennio Morricone did for Once Upon a Time in the West, especially in terms of have motifs associated with characters.The final thing that made this movie great was the entire final sequence where the Rebels attack the Death Star. The X-Wing fighters are still the coolest I have ever seen, despite what we have seen from Battlestar Galactica to Farscape and everything in between. I would really love to see the complete original template George Lucas put together for the special effects crew spliced together from World War II movies. Not only do we have the drama of the Dam Busters runs on the Death Star, but the sequences provides a number of memorable characters, most of whose names we never learn Red Leader (Drewe Henley), Red Two (Dennis Lawson), Red Four (Jack Klaff), Red Six (William Hootkins), Gold Leader (Angus Mcinnis), Gold Two (Jeremy Sinden), and Gold Five (Graham Ashley). Everything that happened was so vivid that when listening to the lengthy Battle of Yavin cut on the soundtrack I swear we could recreate every shot in our minds.Perhaps the best way of describing the impact of Star Wars is to say that it must have been similar to what happened a generation or two earlier when Dorothy opened the door to Oz and the screen went from sepia tones to Technicolor. It was an introduction to a whole new world. Even if we never saw a Saturday morning serial we could appreciate the idea of a roller coaster type of ride where Sand People attack, the Millennium Falcon has to escape the Death Star, and the Rebel base is almost within range.In terms of the controversy over the way George Lucas has tinkered with his 1977 film, I have already bought into the idea of the director's cut, so it is hard to fault the director for having a slightly different definition of that from others. I remember how outdated the special effects looked three years later when Empire came out, so updating them makes sense to me. The scene with Jabba sets up what happens in the rest of the original trilogy and I think the scene with Biggs before the attack is important simply because I think the idea that the last person killed is Luke's best friend. Besides, I have the film we saw in 1977 preserved in a letterboxed edition on laser disc and can still watch it whenever I want.Actually, what surprised me the most with this final version of the original Star Wars movie was how tacky the attempts by Lucas to retroactively fix his character's flaws. To be clear that Han Solo is not a cold blooded killer Greedo now shoots first, although he is an incredible bad shot, especially from four feet away. Then there was the shock that Leia no long kisses Luke on the lips For luck before they swing across that chasm. Now it is a chaste little peck on the cheek.

One of the things we did because we could not go and sit in the theater watching Star Wars all day was to listen to the double-album for the movie's soundtrack (yes, I probably listened to this soundtrack more than any other in history than did not require singing The Time Warp or any other song). I do not know how much of the movie is scored to music, but it has to be an extremely high percentage, albeit short of what you would get with a silent film. The only movie score that I find comparable is the one Ennio Morricone did for Once Upon a Time in the West, especially in terms of have motifs associated with characters.The final thing that made this movie great was the entire final sequence where the Rebels attack the Death Star. The X-Wing fighters are still the coolest I have ever seen, despite what we have seen from Battlestar Galactica to Farscape and everything in between. I would really love to see the complete original template George Lucas put together for the special effects crew spliced together from World War II movies. Not only do we have the drama of the Dam Busters runs on the Death Star, but the sequences provides a number of memorable characters, most of whose names we never learn Red Leader (Drewe Henley), Red Two (Dennis Lawson), Red Four (Jack Klaff), Red Six (William Hootkins), Gold Leader (Angus Mcinnis), Gold Two (Jeremy Sinden), and Gold Five (Graham Ashley). Everything that happened was so vivid that when listening to the lengthy Battle of Yavin cut on the soundtrack I swear we could recreate every shot in our minds.Perhaps the best way of describing the impact of Star Wars is to say that it must have been similar to what happened a generation or two earlier when Dorothy opened the door to Oz and the screen went from sepia tones to Technicolor. It was an introduction to a whole new world. Even if we never saw a Saturday morning serial we could appreciate the idea of a roller coaster type of ride where Sand People attack, the Millennium Falcon has to escape the Death Star, and the Rebel base is almost within range.In terms of the controversy over the way George Lucas has tinkered with his 1977 film, I have already bought into the idea of the director's cut, so it is hard to fault the director for having a slightly different definition of that from others. I remember how outdated the special effects looked three years later when Empire came out, so updating them makes sense to me. The scene with Jabba sets up what happens in the rest of the original trilogy and I think the scene with Biggs before the attack is important simply because I think the idea that the last person killed is Luke's best friend. Besides, I have the film we saw in 1977 preserved in a letterboxed edition on laser disc and can still watch it whenever I want.Actually, what surprised me the most with this final version of the original Star Wars movie was how tacky the attempts by Lucas to retroactively fix his character's flaws. To be clear that Han Solo is not a cold blooded killer Greedo now shoots first, although he is an incredible bad shot, especially from four feet away. Then there was the shock that Leia no long kisses Luke on the lips For luck before they swing across that chasm. Now it is a chaste little peck on the cheek.

I saw Star Wars as much as the films I saw the second and third most often in a movie theater, which would be, of course, The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi. I even sat through the movie twice in a row, the first time so I could pay attention to everything that happened in the lower left quadrant of the film and the second time so I could watch the lower right quadrant.Watch the film again for the first time in several years three things stuck out in my mind as to why this film got us so excited way back when. The first, as noted above, was how there was so to look at in this film. Nobody ever laughed at the alien in the sunglasses trailing after the good guys at Mois Eisley, but in addition to the all the weird looking aliens in the Cantina and throughout the film there was the way this galaxy far, far away looked like it had been lived in. The idea that the Millennium Falcon is not only the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy but actually looks like a hunk of junk mattered. Even the wacky white armor of the Storm Troopers meant something to us, even if we questioned its functionality. You could reduce Han Solo to his grin, Princess Leia to her hairdo, and Luke Skywalker to his lightsaber, because the costumes and art design were things we had never seen before. Of course, Darth Vader being able to think people to death was pretty impressive.The second is that if there is any one thing that made Star Wars move than a B movie made with an A budget it is the musical score by John Williams.
