Lord Farquaau (John Lithgow) is the short, repugnant ruler vying to be crowned King.  Farquaau who¹s been banishing all fairy tale folk out of his realm to make way for his vision - industry (A visual joke at one of Dreamworks animated rivals popular theme parks and merchandising bonanzas, the joke was good for a second until falling as flat as the screen it projected on). Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy round out the top billed cast as the token damsel in distress and talking animal sidekick, a donkey.  With some visual reminiscent of the Bros.

His donkey had the best lines and always the best delivery.  If only it was the donkeys¹ movie to carry and not Mike Myers as an ogre.

The three little pigs break dancing, the Gingerbread Man under interrogation, even tired jabs at Pinocchio seemed funnier and worthy a guffaw.  The fart, ear wax, booger, ass humor of the ogre\/donkey rapport registered a lackluster harumpff. Considering the time and talent spent on the production of these types of films, one would hope the creative process would give way to fresh thinking, new ideas, and most important strong, impressive entertainment.

Most of the actions which are critical to the plot are those involving Joe's search for his parents.  The fact that Joe does not understand where his home is seems trite to me, and lets face it, if I were shacked up within a hundred miles of Brittney Daniel, I would probably know where my home is at.  Another thing is the Dennis Miller comments. Although I can agree with that Dennis Miller can be funny from time to time, his portrayal of the jackass radio host is a far cry from Howard Stern (whom he immitates very poorly.)  The way that the director sets his character up, the viewer actually begins to hate Dennis Miller.  I saw the movie at the theater, and at times there were yawns and growls coming from the other viewers simply because we had to hear more Dennis Miller.  The lamest part of the plot occurs when Joe finally finds what he is looking for, and spends about two minutes resolving what takes an hour and a half to build up.  The one thing which saves this movie is not Dennis Miller, nor is it the pretty Brittney Daniel, who is in the film for about a total of ten minutes, it is Christopher Walken.  Christopher Walken's character Clem is absolutely hilarious.  So basically I paid 8 dollars to see three minutes of Christopher Walken saying hilarious things.  I'm sorry to say this, but the movie would have been better off as an SNL skit.  I'm also sorry to David Spade who is normally an above average actor.  If you want to see good David Spade, go to the video store and rent Lost and Found  I feel this film falls flat for one reason, David Spade is not playing the role of the sarcasim machine, but rather Dennis Miller is, and this does not gel because David Spade does sarcasm with the best of the best.

The reason that they stand out so much is that in the multiplexes in which they are shown, the cause of their difference to the family comedies and juvenile violence, is by actually having something called 'Character Development'.This would appear to be a foreign issue to the majority of film makes. But luckily for some cinema goers, it is not a foreign area for people like Edward Yang. 'Yi Yi' is an exquisite observation of a family in which all the ages are represented at varying stages of life. From the father struggling to retain his sense of thinking that work is still important, his wife struggling with the illness of her mother. And his children learning in their own ways about what life has to offer, both of which like everyone else in the film are superbly acted.Life rolls through every one of these characters and the annoying stereotypes that to a certain extent ruined American Beauty, for me anyway, are not here. Every character is superbly drawn and fantastically beautiful. For some people no doubt this film would be hell. Three hours of dialogue and a story which purports to show nothing more than life being lived. It is a great example of the art of writing however, that the characters remain with us long after the film has finished.Although the entire cast was terrific one performance, for me, rose above the norm. It was Issey Ogata in the role of the cutting edge games designer Ota. His speech of our fear of newness when surely every day is unique really did take my breath away. It is a superbly shot film but the editing is excellent. So many times there were cross-fertilisation of ideas and story strands. When we could see the same relationship being played out in three very different stages amongst the members of the same family.People may complain that maybe not a lot happens, that people don't really go anywhere and nothing is resolved. To me, however, this is a slice of life. Of all of our lives as we try to make sense not only of those around us but of ourselves. The closest recent film that i have seen to this is 'Magnolia' and while i would certainly recommend that whole-heartedly, there have been very few films that i have felt so accurately portrayed people as being people as 'Yi Yi'. This is a film that reminds me of how good films can be. It also reminds me of how lucky I am to be able to enjoy and appreciate being moved by three hours of skill and effort. Simply breathtaking.

Not only it is probably the best of its kind but it DEFINATELY surpassed the horrible , boring Alien ( I know I may get shot for that ) Ridley Scot 's film has a couple of CLASSIC moments (e.g. the facehugger on Kane 's face , the chestbursting , the death of Ash and the explosive finale ) but otherwise it is a BORING BORING BORING picture , slow and manytimes inbearable . Just think of it . If the story of Aliens was used for the first part and vice versa everyone would regard Alien as a mediocre sequel ( just like Alien 3 ) . Think of it . Alien was definately a classic because it simply happened to be the first in the row . But classic does not necessarily mean good . This  does not mean that the James Cameron version has not its flaws. Basically the script takes the idea and reproduces it ( more aliens , more weapons etc ) There are many similarities as well in the basic plot ( a double -faced traitor , an explosive finale , the alien comes on board , the alien is neutralised in precisely the same way )I would dare to say at all cost that it is  simply a rehash (or a remake why not ? )  . So what makes Aliens so special ?First of all the direction . I believe this is definately Cameron 's best job to date . The SFX are something beyond excellent they are convincing . You really BELIEVE that these creatures exist . Especially in the final breathtaking scene ( I won 't reveal it here ) . All I can say is that you will find yourself HOOKED in the screen . I don 't think that there is a most convincing fake scene , not in an action film but a movie generally . Sigourney Weaver is an ever - reliable actress and she does her best here .

She was BORN to play Ripley !!!Some story elements Ripley wakes up after 57 years of hypersleep when she is rescued by blind luck .

Even in a cliched and hokey episode of The X-Files gone south, which is basically what the new Sam Raimi &#145;thriller' is. Granted, there are some  exquisite shots and the occasional genuine thrills, plus the presence of Ms. Blanchett, but there are just too many cons outweighing these pros.Basic premise Blanchett is Annie Wilson, a struggling widow who relies on her &#145;gift' (ie. an eerie ability to psychically tap into events via crazed and bizarre camera angles), for financial support, earning her some loyal friends and customers, including battered housewife Swank and the oh-so-unstable Ribisi. This &#145;gift' however, earns Annie more conservative, anti-witch propagandist enemies than friends, in particular the wife-beating Donnie. But when young socialite, fiance to the school principal and town bike goes missing, these enemies turn to her for help faster than you can say trust no one.The general story (loosely based on writer Billy Bob Thornton's mother) is not exactly unchartered territory - one of the aforementioned cons.The next is casting. Despite the wonderful Queen Cate and Keanu Reeves in a genuinely vicious performance as a violent wife-beating murder suspect, pretty much all else is lost.Firstly - Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes as a couple? It just is not believable. Katie - a sweet girl she may be - I continue to believe is no gifted actress, yet quality directors continue to cast her. As for Kinnear, his loving school principal just doesn't fit. Nor does Giovanni Ribisi, reprising his role of the creepy nut-case he seems to play in every second film (Saving Private Ryan the one wonderful exception) - only here, the character seems utterly pointless - having no relation to the basic plot what-so-ever.Hilary Swank, who was so brilliant in Boys Don't Cry, goes to absolute waste here, sidelined to the cliched role of the battered, yet ever-loyal wife to Reeve's abusive Donnie.Then there is Raimi's direction. It is somewhat lacking throughout the film. You don't really notice it - it is as if you are just standing by, looking at the film rather than actually watching it. Raimi does however, adopt some schlock techniques from his The Evil Dead days; gratuitous close-ups of a dead naked Joey - uh, I mean, Jessica and some sporadic gore, (usually in the form of a dead, naked Joey).Raimi's last effort, A Simple Plan, was a wonderful example of lucid, minimalist direction. Shots were beautifully composed and he made one really fine film, but with The Gift, there is too much &#145;Evil' and not enough &#145;Plan'.But if you are easier to please than me (and you probably are, almost everyone is), and can get past these cons (especially, but not specifically, Kinnear and Holmes), then you will probably be mildly entertained for a couple of hours.P.S.

Always in the top 5, lots and lots of positive comments. I personally know many people who call this their all-time favourite.I wont go that far, but it gets highest marks from me. Just see it. It is the simple tale of Andy, the wrongly-convicted straight-laced accountant and Red, the aging murderer he befriends in prison. They both enter and leave different people, and to truly appreciate this film, pay careful attention to that plot point. Who they are when they enter and who the are when they leave.This is not a perfect movie. It could have lost 20 minutes without taking away anything, and some of the dialogue is trite.

The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.Most people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining.

It's something Hollywood writers picked up on a long time ago, and has made for some of the great moments of cinema.   Nurse Betty can now be added to that list.  A tale of people obsessed with others lives, real or imagined, that is quirky and different enough to leave a lasting impression.  I would even go as far as to say it is the best movie I have seen this year - fresh, darkly funny, enthralling, original, magical, clever, and with stand out performances from the cast. Let's start with Renee Zelwegger as the Betty of the title.  It's actually hard to know where to start she's so good.  Her character exudes home baked goodness, with an air of naivety and innocence that emanates from those beady little eyes.  Couple the expressive eyes with body language that is scarily real and you have one of the stand out performances of the year. It comes as no surprise that the role has won her numerous awards and should have been nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars. When Betty see's her husband rubbed out by a couple of hit men, she recedes into the imaginary world of her favourite soap opera, Reason to Love.  She hits the road to find her true love, Dr. David Ravel, the shows ace heart surgeon.  Close behind are the hit-men, hoping to find a mystery package in the boot of her car. So Nurse Betty becomes a road movie, with a host of interesting characters along the way.  Everyone Betty meets is enchanted by her child like innocence, and not long after, rattled by the pursuing killers.  An interesting yin and yang plot.  Not that the hit men are your usual ruthless thugs.  In fact, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is a gentleman in the truest sense of the word.  He enjoys sunsets and classical music.  Plus he has a good work ethic, which he is doing his best to instill in his student, the over zealous Wesley (Chris Rock). Freeman, as is to be expected, is wonderful in his role, imbuing his character with a casual reality.  The obsession he develops for Betty is handled with a finesse that makes it believable.  The real surprise is Chris Rock in his best performance to date.  When he opens his mouth, you expect his usual maniacal, 90 to the dozen impossible to understand dialogue. Instead, he delivers a refreshingly restrained performance with just a hint of edginess. In what I'd have to say is a salute to Back to the Future, Crispin Glover plays the role of journalist, Roy, every bit like his earlier character, George McFly.  Even his hairstyle is the same.  One of his lines in Nurse Betty is stolen (for want of a better word) directly from BttF.  He has the home grown mid-west country boy down to a tee. Bottomline, to be able to make a truly witty, albeit dark, comedy out of a widow's post-traumatic obsession with a soap star is an accomplishment in itself.  The fact that the characters all seem so real is an added bonus. Nurse Betty is a real treat, and stands miles ahead of a lot of recent fare. I've heard it described as  &#145;Forrest Gump meets Pulp Fiction' and would have to say that's pretty accurate.  While romantic and often sweet, it is punctuated with violence and occasionally frightening.  But don't let that scare you off - Nurse Betty should be top of your must see list.

There are timeless, awesome, skillful films worthy of their Oscars and accolades. GIII does not make my top 25.That's not to say it is a bad film. It is quite good. But take away these rich, wonderful characters and links to the previous classics and you have a long and confusing film.The plot is well known - patriarch Michael Corleone's attempts to buy his way out of the criminal empire he built and ruthlessly ruled, thwarted by his enemies and his bloodthirsty, power-hungry nephew Vincent(brilliantly played by Andy Garcia), who is poised to take command of the family business. There is also the strong theme of Michael's guilt for his past offenses, most notably the murder of his brother.It is a sad a grim tale, with what I thought was a very satisfying ending. Without spoiling, lets just ask this question - does a life long criminal and murderer deserve any better?The movie's best scene takes place when Michael sees the wise and powerful Cardinal Lamberto and receives a reluctant absolution of his sins. I love this scene because the Cardinal understands him so well, and knows that he can be more than he is, but won't.The movie has a flaw which comes very close to ruining it completely - and that is of course the infamous casting of Soffia Coppola in the pivotal role of Michael's daughter, Mary. A great deal of this plot revolves around the passionate, dangerous love of Vincent and Mary and it simply does not work. She lumbers around on the screen like an amateur and destroys every scene she has. I never bought in for a second that Vicent cared at all about her as anything more than a trick.All that said, Diane Keaton, Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna all offer wonderful supporting roles. Talia Shire shines again as Connie. The script is great and the theme of the trilogy is very clear - don't take sides against the family. I value this film a great deal primarily because it does a great job of winding up the story of Michael. Do not see this first, see the three in order.***1\/2 out of ****.

But take away these rich, wonderful characters and links to the previous classics and you have a long and confusing film.The plot is well known - patriarch Michael Corleone's attempts to buy his way out of the criminal empire he built and ruthlessly ruled, thwarted by his enemies and his bloodthirsty, power-hungry nephew Vincent(brilliantly played by Andy Garcia), who is poised to take command of the family business. There is also the strong theme of Michael's guilt for his past offenses, most notably the murder of his brother.It is a sad a grim tale, with what I thought was a very satisfying ending. Without spoiling, lets just ask this question - does a life long criminal and murderer deserve any better?The movie's best scene takes place when Michael sees the wise and powerful Cardinal Lamberto and receives a reluctant absolution of his sins. I love this scene because the Cardinal understands him so well, and knows that he can be more than he is, but won't.The movie has a flaw which comes very close to ruining it completely - and that is of course the infamous casting of Soffia Coppola in the pivotal role of Michael's daughter, Mary. A great deal of this plot revolves around the passionate, dangerous love of Vincent and Mary and it simply does not work. She lumbers around on the screen like an amateur and destroys every scene she has. I never bought in for a second that Vicent cared at all about her as anything more than a trick.All that said, Diane Keaton, Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna all offer wonderful supporting roles. Talia Shire shines again as Connie. The script is great and the theme of the trilogy is very clear - don't take sides against the family. I value this film a great deal primarily because it does a great job of winding up the story of Michael. Do not see this first, see the three in order.***1\/2 out of ****.

It's a horror film, yeah, point taken, but it's just so different from all the others like Scream, I know what you did last summer, Halloween etc.You don't actually 'see' 'death' and I think that makes it really special. It makes you think about things, such as fate, and actually freaks you out a lot, as the whole scenario seems quite logical, unlike most other horror movies. It is original, chilling, and extremely entertaining. It doesn't over do it with the special effects either, and this shows that James Wong and Glen Morgan actually put a lot of thought into how to make things look as realistic as possible.The acting in Final Destination is fantastic. The first time I saw this movie I was left thinking what a great actor Devon Sawa is. You could completely empathise with his character, Alex Browning. In fact, all the actors were brilliant. They could really convince you that what was happening to the characters was real, and that was really spooky. The movie has a great ensemble cast, some of which will be instantly recognised from other popular TV shows or films, such as Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek) Brendan Fehr (Roswell) and Seann. W. Scott (American Pie, Road Trip, Dude Where's My Car)Final Destination is full of action, and the first fifteen minutes really do get you hooked. It's not like most other movies where it gradually builds up to the action, this movie just has short sharp adrenaline pumping blasts of it, and it's great. There are some excellent 'jump' scenes aswell, which immediately re-grab your attention so your mind never wanders.The movie doesn't have much of a soundtrack, but to be quite honest it doesn't really need it. The atmosphere is pulled off fantastically by the eerie musical score composed by Shirley Walker, and totally fits in with the scenes.Some people might say that Final Destination is just over-rated and ridiculous, but I disagree. It is because it goes just far enough to make you believe, and disbelieve it at the same time. The deaths could actually happen in the home or whatever, but for them to happen is a chance in a million. Yet, they could still happen.Okay, Final Destination isn't one of the most famous box-office smash hits in the world like the Matrix or Gladiator, but I don't really care. As far as I'm concerned this movie is just an unsung hero, and people who rate this movie as being 'awful' just don't know how to appreciate a masterpiece. After all, who needs Oscars when this film is as good as I think it is already?
