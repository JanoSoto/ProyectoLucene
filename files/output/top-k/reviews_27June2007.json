[{"date":"27 June 2007","score":"","review":" Shrek came out right around the time of the movie Final Fantasy. I remember because there was a newspaper article that was published menitioning the detail of the animation in both movies. I must concur with the article. I could not watch the movie without being thoroughly amazed at the physical detail of Fiona. Yeah, yeah, the movie was good too, but did you see how well they constructed Fiona? It was fantastic.Besides that, the movie had a humorous take of fairy tales. The humor was greatly assisted by the talented Eddie Murphy. As annoying as Donkey was, he was a superb addition. Shrek was good, and it is fortunate that it was good because now there is another animation outlet for the three years that Pixar takes off between movies.

I first watched this movie as a young child, and I was surprised to find out that my parents and my aunt had liked it (I thought computer animated movies were for kids back then). But do you think that Shrek won the ''Best Animated Movie of the Year'' award because of it's gross humor (farts, burps, spitting, etc...)? I watched Shrek again just a few days ago, and I think it won the Oscar for it's originality spoofing the well-known fairy tales you know. So all in all, Shrek is a great movie for everyone!
