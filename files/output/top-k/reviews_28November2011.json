They meet online, anonymous, and start emailing. It creates a charming love story where the star players don't know they have been chosen.The director knows what they are doing. We see Kelly and Fox as people that do the same kind of things every day and could possibly have become the best of friends, if only their books stores weren't competing. That is what makes this film completely unique. They would both wake up awaiting emails from each other, and going to bed safe in the knowledge that there will be an email when they wake up. When they meet in person they get alone perfectly fine, till the information that he is the head boss of Fox's Book store. A big chain of book stores everywhere, putting Kelly's little Shop Around The Corner out of business.Most people nowadays believe that email is old fashioned and slow, but it suited them just fine. Nice fairly long emails let them be honest with each other with no personal details. They fell in love with each other using only their personality traits, that is another reason his film is so unique. Normally, when we meet someone, we see their clothes, hairstyle, face, as things scoring or losing points for them. These things did not stand in Kelly and Fox's way as they do others.You've Got Mail is a sweet, funny romance that has a lot of charming moments in it. It is a must see for someone who prides themselves on seeing romance movies. It holds all the key factors, and has je ne sais quoi. It gives you those good little tingles all over when you watch it.

It made very little sense. It really was a thoroughly confusing mess. That movie was an English-language remake of this Spanish-language one. If nothing else Open Your Eyes at least makes more sense than Vanilla Sky did. Oh, there's still plenty of confusing stuff here but director Alejandro Amenábar manages to pull it together much better than Cameron Crowe ever did in the remake. The fact that I think the story makes much more sense when presented in a language I don't even understand is about as damning a statement as can be made about Crowe's film. Open Your Eyes is clearly the better film of the two. But it comes with its own frustrations. Maybe this story was just a little too convoluted to ever make a thoroughly enjoyable movie out of.Open Your Eyes is a movie which delights in messing with your mind. This is a movie which demands that you be fully engaged when watching it. Turn off your brain and start daydreaming and you'll be lost. The movie's main character, César, has plenty of disorienting experiences which can leave the viewer feeling more than a little disoriented himself. It's a hard movie to pin down. It flashes back and forth in time, it raises questions about what is real and what is imagined. It takes you right inside César's head. Unfortunately César's darned near lost his mind so going inside his head isn't going to give us much clarity.It's best to not say much about the plot because whatever joy you get from this movie will likely come from your attempts to unravel the plot for yourself. If you've already seen Vanilla Sky you unfortunately pretty much know everything. The ending of Vanilla Sky was such a letdown, and made so little sense whatsoever, that as you watch Open Your Eyes you can't help but have very low expectations. You're waiting to be let down and to be thoroughly baffled. Happily Amenábar's ending is a little more focused than Crowe's was. Where Vanilla Sky went completely off the rails Open Your Eyes takes some strange twists and turns but you can follow along if you try. The movie asks you for some serious suspension of disbelief but at least it doesn't throw so much stuff at you that it becomes utter nonsense like Vanilla Sky did. Give some credit to Eduardo Noriega whose performance in the lead role of César is much stronger than Tom Cruise's corresponding star turn in the remake. And this movie's Penélope Cruz also comes across much better than that movie's Penélope Cruz. Strange how the same actress playing the same role can be so much better in one movie than in the other. Maybe it's her comfort level with the language, maybe it's just that she's surrounded by a better movie than she was in Vanilla Sky. Open Your Eyes is not a great movie, a little too convoluted for its own good. Somewhat slow, not always as dramatic and engaging as you would hope. But all in all the movie does have an intriguing story which, if you can wrap your head around it, makes the movie worth seeing. For whatever flaws the movie may have you can understand what Crowe saw in it. Too bad he made such a mess of it when he got his hands on it.

Directed by Joe Pytka, it stars NBA legend Michael Jordan, as he teams up with the Looney Tunes, to play in the Ultimate Game that decides the fate of these cartoon characters. It (the film) also features other NBA stars like Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, and so on. This was a Live- Action\/Animated film, unique among its kind, following the other famous Live-Action\/Animated film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?.Although it received widespread acclaim from its younger viewers, people ultimately came to see Michael Jordan play basketball with the Looney Tunes, not to see him act. The real live athletes\/actors, especially Jordan, were at best good, if not decent. These guys make their living playing sports, not reading scripts. To say, when it came to acting, they wouldn't win an Oscar. However, there is no doubt in anyone one's mind that the only person meant to play the hero in this movie would be none other than Michael Jordan. He doesn't possess the proper acting skills that a hero should have but his personality and the fact that he is who he is suits him best to the action of the film. Some critics claimed that MJ would eventually be featured in a full length film, this being the one. Michael Jordan, at the time, possessed a certain aura, deeming him to be the best basketball player at the time, if not in history.In the same way people wanted to see MJ play basketball with the Looney Tunes, people wanted to see how the Looney Tunes would fare in a full feature length film. Scenes involving them spared no detail, as the personalities that we have come to know and love like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck are marvelously created and adapted to this movie. At certain points of the movie, the acting of the characters, especially the dialogue that went on with, was whimsical and clever at the same time. The personality and the acting of the Looney Tunes were best suited for the film, being that these characters would easily adapt to the plot of the film better than those of the Disney Brand. In one scene, there was a reference to Pulp Fiction and another scene where they made jest of Disney. In comparison to their famous short length cartoons, the Looney Tunes characters had to stretch out a bit more of their talent. New jokes and references were made, as they had a lot more screen time than they are accustomed to. The Looney Tunes had rougher acting than the real live actors because there was the demand the children put on them. Though there were references that were only understood by older audiences, the cartoon characters were put there to capture the attention and hearts of the children. Although they've included some of the classic acts of the characters, more had to be done because of the longer screen time they had.Overall, the film was great for younger audiences and, at the time, a technological marvel, as it combined the use of live action and animation to act as one. As a result, when it came to acting, it wasn't Oscar-winning material, but it sure captured the love of many children. I'd say that the athletes and characters gave the movie a bit more hype than it should have. I rate the film an 8.5 out of 10.

I'm not surprised to read the Jake Eberts helped finance this as he as did with Dances, and Star Wars to name a couple others. Why is it so hard for a studio to imagine potential greatness and the spectacle of an epic done right? I imagine things are even worse now for anyone not pitching something involving a comic book hero, a flock of animated penguins, or a project not easily formatted for 3D. Thank goodness for Richard Attenborough and the countless others who worked together to make this unforgettable epic.There is not much more praise that is needed for this film. Ben Kingsley plays the man known to his people as the Great Soul. A man who would shed light on the injustices imposed by the British Empire on their Indian subjects. For a time, he almost brought the empire to its knees. And he did it without striking a blow or publicly inciting others to do so. In some scenes where Gandhi hears of violence carried out by protesters loyal to his cause, he seems deeply hurt. Hurt that someone could do harm in his name. And once the British finally hand over India to its own people, Gandhi must face an even tougher task. How can he get Hindus and Muslims to live side by side in peace?

To those people I say, Hey... they can't all be perfect. The Beach stars Leonardo DiCaprio, infamously snatching the role from Boyle favorite Ewan McGregor causing a dramatic fallout between the two, as Richard, a young guy who, while visiting Thailand, gets his hands on a map that leads to a mysterious island rumored to be a paradise. Richard meets two French tourists in his hotel and asks them to set out with him to find this elusive paradise. From here the film branches out into part romance, part adventure, part psychological thriller. It never really catches its footing and it never steers in a clear direction. It's not a disaster but it isn't an excellent film either.There isn't much about The Beach that is noteworthy or memorable. It isn't terrible in any one department, it's just lacking in all departments. Visually it isn't anything terribly special. This may be because of the high expectations I have from eccentric visual mastermind, Danny Boyle. The Beach lacks his nuanced flare and incredibly unique quality to the style. The music selection for the film is admittedly neat, but the visuals are sub par in comparison.But where The Beach really lacks is its poor script and uninteresting characters. There's nothing very compelling about this story and the characters don't engage your mind and nothing special really happens. The dialogue is often silly and unnatural and there are too many unrealistic changes of character tone. There are amateur mistakes being made here, such as when a character is fine one second but then gets overly angry just so that something irrational will happen in order to move the story along. The Beach doesn't flow naturally and a lot of what happens feels very forced. The acting is nothing special either. Tilda Swinton's role is really the only one worth mentioning, considering DiCaprio isn't much more than a pretty face in this movie. All of these faulty elements to The Beach certainly could have been much worse, but they don't make this film anything special.To see a film of this low calibre from an auteur like Danny Boyle is always shocking, but it's simply what happens. They can't all be winners and The Beach is proof of that. But I can only rejoice in the fact that I can so easily forget about this dull little film by watching 28 Days Later..., 127 Hours, or Slumdog Millionaire instead.

Since the days of Master of Suspense&#x99; Hitchcock, writers and directors have been looking at new ways of doing it. The approach of Roman Polanski and his co-writer Gerard Brach takes on a languid, brooding pace, as oppose to the breakneck action and suspenseful pacing typical to the genre.Brach and Polanski have always typically written movies that just about conform to usual narrative and genre conventions, but filled with a kind of bleak fatalism that seems counter even to darkness of film noir and its descendents. In his travels the hero of Frantic has encounters that are depressing in their familiarity. Unhelpful authorities are of course a staple of any kind of DIY crime-solving thriller, but what is so chilling here is not just the indifference of the authorities, but the believable nature of their indifference. And this is very typical of Frantic; it doesn't often step outside of plausibility for the sake of excitement. In your average thriller, when the Liberty figurine falls from the roof, it would have been picked up by a Mossad agent (or someone) before Harrison Ford and Emmanuelle Seigner could recover it, and a chase would have ensued. Here it is simply an annoying fumble that emphasises the amateurish nature of the lead characters.Given that then, how does Frantic manage to thrill and engross its audience? Quite simply, with the way it is shot. Polasnki unsettles his audiences with a camera that often shuffles around at a pace at-odds with what is happening on screen. When Ford runs into his old friends at the airport, they are full of bubbly bustle, but the camera creeps around, most unnervingly. The few action scenes tend to be played out with fewer cuts then would be expected, giving them an excruciating real-time feel. There's always a strong sense of helplessness in Polanski's images. The last glimpse we have of Ford's wife before she is kidnapped is from inside a shower, through a narrow doorway &#x96; and it is she who exits the shot, not the camera that leaves her. There are a lot of set-ups like this throughout the movie. They look so confining they give us a palpable urge to step out of the space, but the camera confounds us by staying put. The frustrating wrongness of Polanski's shots really helps to involve us in the emotions of the story.Frantic is not without its flaws. Harrison Ford is far from his best here, although he's not really given room to act well by the script in any case, except in the scene where he phones his children, in which he is adequate. The story is packed with a lot of rather obvious symbolism (the little Statue of Liberty is hardly a MacGuffin in this respect!). And yet, in the grander scheme of the movie, these are minor issues. There is ultimately a surprising amount of beauty and humanity in Frantic - the aching Ennio Morricone score, the sudden revelation of anti-war themes in the final act.

The set up is Harry meets Sally when his current girl friend says Sally All bright will give him him a lift back home. It is long car ride and when she says your girl friend said you have a dark side you engage with the situation even more. Like Billy Wilder before him Rob Reiner has an expert writer; Nora Ephron creating a classic structure for a classic romantic movie. There are standout moments -- the café scene--the late great Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher bonding together instead ofclicking on the blind date that Harry and Sally had set up-- Man talk beween Jess and HarryWhere he asks Harry if he made a woman meow and the New year's Eve denouement with Frank singing 'It had to be you' - this has to be one of the most classically romantic movies of all time.

The cast, especially the daughter, are amazing...how she can convey so much through that mask with just her eyes is just wonderful and tragically scary at the same time! Most importantly, the story is well thought out and presented. I love films that make me at least feel a bit of a connection with the 'bad guy'.

He helped change the equation with the blockbuster Diehard. He made sitting around in a submarine exciting in Hunt For Red October. He also made Predator, a great action vehicle for rising star Arnold Schwartzenwhatever. Last Action Hero was in reality a different genre than another Hollywood action flick, and is both successful at the attempt and at fault at the execution. McTiernan helped reinvigorate the action genre by turning the action hero into a normal guy in Diehard. Similarly, the man who saves the day in Hunt for Red October is just a CIA analyst who reluctantly gets involved. For Arnold, he had done over-the-top Total Recall and been nearly invincible in Terminator 2. For this director\/star pair, it seemed like the next step in 'taking it to the next level'. Both probably realised that any action film that tried to top the last big action film would become a self-parody. So they deliberately poked fun at the ridiculousness of the genre. However, that made the film no longer a big Hollywood action movie, it made it an experimental film, almost like a Godard film.Playing with the characters, the story conventions, the glitzy production sets, the always great looking actors, etc., the scriptwriters managed to pigeon-hole every cliché into this screenplay, and for the most part it looks like the filmmakers had a ball doing it. The folly came with the primary character being a 13 year old (or so) kid. He was played a little too cliché as well, not realistic enough for supposedly being from the real world. Then there was the whole gimmick of transporting to the movie world via a magic ticket. That really had little inspiration and should have been more indistinct (a worm hole, the kid is really dreaming, etc).What works, ironically, is that however over-the-top the crimes the bad guy commits in the movie world, he seemingly can get away with much more in the real world (at least in the tougher neighbourhoods in New York). The other statement (which reshoots probably backtracked on) is that people actually get hurt in the real world when they go through a plate glass window, or get shot by a bullet. It is easy to see why the movie was not well received. The main objective of a summer movie-going audience is to forget about the troubles of the real world, and basically take a roller coaster ride for 2 hours. The moment the blood or pain we see on the screen is supposed be real, it is no longer fun.For the first 2\/3 of LAH, we are given that roller coaster ride that would later be the norm for director Michael Bay. Flying cars, explosions every few minutes, and bad bad bad dialogue. I found myself smiling along during the wink and nods at the movie clichés, but only to get annoyed when the kid started griping about it constantly. The old theatre guy also felt a bit uninspired. I think McTiernan should feel lucky he was able to get away with making this film, because the world is a better place for it.

That should not necessarily suggest that it is the best film, but definitely the most interesting. What I mean by that is, the actual plot of the film and the undertones therein are what truly spoke to me. Obviously on the surface this is a film about bank robbery, cops and robbers, and a sordid love story. However, underneath all that is where the true story comes to light. To be more to the point, the part of the film that truly interested me is when Bonnie and Clyde achieve their folk hero status. That is the part that interests me most because it is when they achieve that status that true trouble begins to befall the duo. This showcases the inherent duality, and the complexity that is comprised in the human condition. It would be impossible for Bonnie and Clyde to reach such a level of notoriety without the interest of the general public, but at the same time, it is the public that demands their capture. Such a duality also runs parallel to the story itself, and is typified by the main characters themselves. What I mean is, Bonnie and Clyde are at one point very much alike, but yet, still very different. But I digress. The film itself is very well done, albeit a bit over the top at certain points. The robberies and chase scenes are not quite mediocre, yet I would hesitate to say that they were outstanding or magnificently shot either. They function to serve the purpose of furthering the films plot. On that note, one aspect I did enjoy was the actors that were cast in the film and the different ways they interacted during the plot's unfolding. Obviously as the top-billed actor\/actress, both Beatty and Dunaway deliver great performances, with my only persona; gripe being Beatty's regional twanged accent that he struggles to carry throughout the film. Additionally, both Gene Wilder and Gene Hackman are nothing short of superb. Hackman is enjoyable in his portrayal of Clyde's brother Buck, as is Wilder in his Cameo performance. The film, while obviously fictionalized, does a good job of blurring the line between reality and ficti, thus creating a more complete misc-en-sene, and thus a more realistic viewing experience overall. However, when attempting to make light of such real, dark issues, real consequences must allow be discussed. The crescendo of the film, its closing scene, turns the whole film into seemingly nothing more than an allegorical tale designed to impart the lesson that a life of crime is bad. Well, it is safe to say that most people already knew that. I, for what it's worth, think that the ending could have been handled differently, but that's just me.

Somehow it succeeds on all levels.Omar (Gordon Warnecke) is a young Pakistani living in England and caring for his alcoholic, very ill father Hussein (Roshan Seth), once an important journalist whose left leanings haven't gone over very well in Britain. His wife committed suicide by throwing herself onto the train tracks outside of their home. Hussein intends for Omar to go to college, but in the meantime, he wants his brother Nasser (Saeed Jaffrey), who runs many businesses with his right hand man Salim (Derrick Branche), to give Omar a job.Omar is ambitious and eventually asks his uncle to let him run the filthy, graffiti-ridden laundrette and make it profitable. Omar sees an old school friend, Johnny (Daniel Day-Lewis) on the street; Johnny has fallen in with a neo-Nazi group. However, the two reconnect, and Omar convinces Johnny to work with him at the laundrette. They rip off Salim during a drug deal to get money and make the place quite fancy. And Johnny has no compunction about seducing Omar.One of the things that makes this film fascinating is the treatment of the gay theme, which is not really treated as a theme at all but merely as information about these two young men. Omar doesn't come out to his family, no one catches them in the act and is shocked, no one beats them up because they're gay, no one is killed because he's gay, and no one commits suicide because of it. If Omar doesn't tell his family, it's because it's none of their business. He's under pressure to get married, but he doesn't do it. What he will do in the future, obviously, is unknown, but he'll risk losing Johnny so he may never give into the pressure.The story is more about people living in a country that isn't their own and attempting to make it, which was the promise of the '80s under Thatcher, and it's about a class system that looks down on poor whites like Johnny. It's also about racial hatred and the violence it causes.The film is peppered with interesting characters Nasser's glamorous white mistress (Shirley Anne Field), Nasser's daughter Tania (Rita Wolf), and the volatile Salim.The film is beautifully photographed, particularly in the romantic scenes...Johnny kissing Omar in the alley is but one example.The acting --- well, what can be said about acting where Daniel Day-Lewis has a supporting role? It's bound to be good! This film was released on the same day as A Room with a View, and when critics saw Day-Lewis in two such different roles, they were mightily impressed. With his weird hair and low-class accent, Day-Lewis is a likable Johnny, unashamed of his sexuality and trying to get away from a life of violence. The handsome Warnecke is a sympathetic Omar, and Jaffrey and Seth give vivid portraits of two diametrically opposite brothers, one interested in money and flaunting it, the other a beaten-down, sick man of principle. Rita Wolf is a feisty Tania, and Shirley Anne Field is delightful as Rachel.Excellent film that I'm sure resonates even more if you're British or, better yet, an immigrant in Britain.

After watching this movie, one can leave feeling that they have been entertained and also shown what can happen when you let your guard down and trust others just because of the way they look. Yes, appearances can be deceiving and this movie shows how.

I put two other movies along side this one in this category - Down Periscope, with Kelsey Grammar and, once again, Harland Williams, and Bushwacked with Daniel Stern (City Slickers). These 3 movies are simply hilarious and are excellent selections to play for others, since they probably haven't seen them, and they're perfect for playing when families are over, because the kids and the adults all enjoy them.Harland Williams is a phenomenal actor and is a perfect fit for his role in this movie - his only starring role in a movie, I believe. It's such a shame that he hasn't starred in more movies and that he's been in so many duds. It seems like he has become a solid bit-part actor, which is such a waste of his talent. He was excellent in Down Periscope, where he made sounds like a whale. His facial expressions and ability to make odd sounds are simply amazing.Rocketman has a superb cast and many memorable parts and lines. I especially like the opening segment where Kelsey Grammar is teeing off, and the fart segment, which I know is the tried and true crude humor attempt, but it just works - even better than the famous fart segment of The Nutty Professor! The love story is very nice and the Wish Upon a Star song is a real Disney moment. This is an excellent family Great film!

It's like a big expansive painting stretching across the wall where you can admire and even love certain small things about it - Rod Steiger's electrifying performance, Klaus Kinski's ten minutes locked on a train using nothing but his eyes, a scene with Alec Guiness' narration that is like narration having a conversation with a character in a room (when he's talking to his half-brother, or reminiscing about it) which I found really fascinating, and some of the photography is wonderful - though on the whole it's lacking a certain something.Doctor Zhivago is pretty to look at, of course, and yet a little dull at its core (a love triangle should have just a little more 'umph' to it. And maybe it does, but I didn't feel it on the first viewing). Not to mention since its release the also epic 'Reds' by Warren Beatty took on history and romance in a much more fascinating package. If you're in the right romantic mood it may hit just the right spot (certainly that love theme by Maurice Jarre, purportedly inspired by a weekend of love-making the composer had with his wife).

Her soap acting rendered futile and raging at the seeming dithering uselessness of all hospice personnel in uniform (nurses, physical therapists, doctors, psychiatrists), May-Alice moves back to the family home by a Louisiana bayou in a clear attempt at drinking herself into oblivion.

Then there is the Louisiana landscape and the comic portraits of an assortment of Alice-May's visitors, and a repressed but tender romance which materializes with an old acquaintance. To the back of the house, there are verdant and soothing wetlands teeming with herons, alligators and snakes while towards the front, the track which leads to it is dusty and decidedly un-photogenic with what I can only presume to be factories, pumping affluents into this seemingly serene lake. This two-tinged sepia is present everywhere in the movie. This many-layered portrayal of a story of two women is marked by engaging performances all-round and a screenplay which does not veer into the realm of the tear-jerker.
