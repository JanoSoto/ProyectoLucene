There WAS some stop-motion footage thrown in, probably it's for old time's sake.Still, this is a better, more memorable movie than Selick's last one, and certainly not nearly as bad as the miserable box-office returns and scathing reviews would lead you to believe.  Yes, the film has its flaws, but if you were to judge from its reception you'd think it didn't have ANY virtues - which simply isn't true.  There's Brendan Fraser, for a start.  How can you not like Stu Miley, or the way Fraser plays him?  (If you want to see Fraser's charm wasted, see Bedazzled.)  At one point Stu is forced to temporarily occupy another body (Chris Kattan), and we instantly transfer our affections to the new actor without giving the matter a second thought - which is more remarkable than it sounds, and shows that Fraser really had been WORKING to get us to like Stu.Then there's Downtown, which you must admit, looks good.  It's more of a visual hodgepodge than Selick's previous two worlds (the first of which owes its look largely to Tim Burton), partly because it was realised through an ill-chosen mixture of costume, CGI, stop-motion and set design ... our eyes must constantly adjust, yet the overall look is strong enough to make it worth the effort.As for the film's flaws, well, they've been greatly exaggerated.  I suppose there were (as several American critics complained) some bodily-function-based jokes, but I can't recall that many - certainly not as many or as witless as in Shrek, and besides, at least some of the jokes in Monkeybone are actually funny.  That's because they're character-based, and not solely reliant on the alleged shock value of someone suddenly farting or burping.All that's really wrong with Monkeybone is that it lacks the brilliance a premise this bizarre demands.  Yeah, well, big deal.  So unlike Selick's first feature it's not a masterpiece.  It's still an entertaining, competently made film with a good, solid story, more than inventive enough to justify having been made.

But then again I was easily impressed by anything that was science fiction. After all, another favourite film of mine at around about the same time was Lawnmower Man, and when I recently watched that again I wasn't very impressed. (Why couldn't that guy just close his eyes?)I watched Terminator 2 with pretty much the same expectations, but found that the movie was both better, and not as good as I remembered it. For someone else who is a first time viewer of the Terminator franchise, this movie would seem great, but others may notice that it is a general revamp of the themes (and ideas) of the first Terminator in 1984.I watched it and was given the impression that the film was made largely for special effects rather than storyline. The storyline was good, especially with a Terminator playing a central role, giving its points of views and behaviour towards a human world. My problem is that it seemed to have many of the story components of the first film. For example...1. The Terminator wears 'tough guy' clothing - however a Terminator wearing a priests uniform, or a bright green jumpsuit with sandals would look stupid.2. Mimickry of the main characters parents - This of course is what the T-1000 was built for, but mimicking Johns foster parents was just too close to the mimicking of Sarah's mother.3. The tanker chase - Very obvious parralel.4. Terminators running a rampage in a police station\/criminal hospital.5. The bike crash\/helicopter crash leading on to the tanker chase.All this gave me the impression that James Cameron was using Terminator 2 as a means to do what he wished he could have done in Terminator 1 if he had a much bigger production budget. I don't think he needed to do this, as Terminator 1 stands on its own two feet very well, especially for such a small budget.Of course, there are many Terminator fanatics out there who would fervently disagree with everything I say. That is the problem when you give criticism to a cult film. You can attract some whackos, who don't seem to realise that it IS just a film, no matter how much they enjoyed it. There is nothing wrong with being a big fan of a movie, even to the point of obsession, but defending it like it is a religion is not healthy.I will say what I liked about it, however.There were parts in it which were exceptional, especially with the paradox regarding technology from the future being used as a template for SkyNet - the creator the the technology in the future. I loved Sarah Connors dream sequence, which was very disturbing. And verbal exchanges and behaviour of a (mildly) benevolent terminator - I loved that. It's pedanticly malevolent attitude towards the value of human life, and its final appreciation for it by committing suicide (self-termination) was excellent. Arnold Schwarzennegger really did give one of his best performances in his movie career. And his dialogue was very well thought out, giving authenticity to his robotic mind.I feel that this film could have done more. It could have had a better plot. Apparently, Cameron was going to have an elaborate beginning sequence set in the future, with the actual raid on SkyNet time-displacement facilities by John Connor, the transportation through time of Kyle Reese and the discovery of a second terminator being sent through time. He should have filmed this - This would have helped set apart the first film from the second. It certainly would have given the die hard fans a lot to cheer about, including myself.I can't get used to the change in Sarah Connors character and behaviour. Although she was obviously affected mentally from the first attack in T1, at the end of the film she seemed calm and resolute. In the second she was barely sane, and foaming at the mouth half the time. This was novel at first to see such a change, but it did wear a bit thin. I don't think Linda Hamilton is suited for Tough-Girl roles, like, say Sigourney Weaver. She should have played the quiet intelligent type... Yes tough, but not so bezerk and wild eyed.This Terminator 3 business is, sadly, more than likely going to be a big joke. Johnathan Mostow is a good director, so there is hope there, but the scriptwriters have written some real garbage in the past. If you don't believe me, hire 'The Net' and watch for the microwave scene. If it's going to be as bad as I think it will, what it will do is cheapen the first two movies. It will probably do well in the first week or two but (like Jurassic Park 3), fall in popularity as word spreads that the movie is just popular science fiction trash. What a shame... I have my doubts about T4 - unless Roger Corman buys the rights to it when they are selling at bargain basement prices.Can I quantise how much I enjoyed T2???7.8 out of 10 (9.3 out of 10 for T1)Worth the hire - maybe even to own.

That theme of hope is what brings the film to its final realization, with Stevo's acceptance of the fact that he lives in a world where hope is, in fact, possible.

Like me, a lot of couch potatoes would probably think  Oh, that's the girl who was in that movie about the cute robot. True, Short Circuit (1986) was fun to watch, but this is a very different story. It is also a far cry from Buried Alive 2 (1997), which I remember cured my insomnia one night. I suppose HA is what is called an art house movie. It strikes me that one look at a synopsis of the script would have most distributors feeling in need of a drink. (I could be wrong of course!). This is a rather bleak tale of friendship and lesbian love, arising out of a chance encounter between an assistant photo editor and a long lost art photographer in the building where they live.Initially, I started watching this one one morning for the sake of something to do while a work crew was relaying the floors in my kitchen and bathroom, so the soundtrack was punctuated by a certain amount of unscripted percussion. I quickly realized I was getting interested. There is stuff in HA for people to dislike if they are so minded. Hard nosed types could say there are too many losers in it to be worth bothering with. Someone with strong religious convictions could feel distaste at its perceived decadence. Drug takers, failed talents, useless men and the spiritually lost can all be found in this movie. I reckon Lisa Cholodenko's film is an audio - visual think piece rather than an entertainment. This whole thing smacks of deep personal commitment from its director. I notice she also has the writing credit.The mature and rather gaunt Ally Sheedy in this movie is excellent as Lucy Berliner, the once famous photographer who vanished to Germany years ago and has since returned to self - imposed obscurity.

It wasn't that the movie had no promise, but I think I can say that without the star power that it has, it wouldn't do very well.  Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and Alfre Woodard star in this film about a space-man and his last days on Earth.  The majority of the film takes place in a psychiatric ward in Manhattan.  Here, we meet a selection of quirky inmates and a few semi-defunct psychiatrists.  The story unfolds as a new patient--Prot from K-Pax (played by Kevin Spacey)--tells his story to a psychiatrist (Jeff Bridges).  I would describe more of the plot in detail, but there are several key-points that shouldn't be shared to those of you who haven't seen it yet.  So, in respect for the future movie-goer, I'll jump right to a review.  The movie was clever and sometimes cute.  But, looking at the movie in its entirety, that's about as much as you get.  There are no funny feelings in your tummy, or damn! moments.  All you really get are a series of subdued, mediocre moments.  Much of the drama is downplayed, and is only occasionally heightened by an upward swell of the music or a closeup of Spacey's contorting face.  However, the movie has many fine qualities which must be explored.  The technical aspects--ie, the editing and cinematography--are interesting, and sometimes brilliant.  Also, the score marvelously enhances the cryptic yet spacy (no pun intended) atmosphere of the film.  Add to that a new written\/produced\/performed by song from Sheryl Crow and you have a nice overall movie-going experience.  I would, however, have to ask that you go into this movie with mid-grade expectations.  It was enjoyable, but it lacked the umph that we've come to expect from talents like this.  In addition to this, Alfre Woodard is in a completely thankless role as the head psychiatrist.  Although she exudes the same sophisticatd pinache that she would normally, her part is  underwritten and largely superlative. It sounds like I'm completely bashing the film, but believe me I'm not.  It was enjoyable, and, it would be a great Friday-night-at-the-movies experience.  But, if you're expecting something, I don't know, stunning, you may have to settle for high class mediocrity.

I was too young to see this in the local movie house, but it made it to television a couple years later and was a regular staple, along with Castle's other pieces, on Saturday afternoon shows such as Chiller.  I probably watched HoHH dozens of times as a kid, and it gave me some very serious nightmares back then,  but it seemed to vanish from the small screen for a very long time.. finally, I caught it last night, commercial-free on Turner Classic Movies, for the first time in at least 25 years.Viewed with an adult's skeptical viewpoint, this is really a pretty awful film. It tries so hard to be horrific, but it's hard to watch Vincent Price, a much missed, very cultured and smart guy (read his biography some time) and not think he had one really good time making this film.. it's absolutely one of his best performances in his long career.By now you probably know the plot, but briefly, a wacky millionaire rents a big old spooky house for a night and invites five people he doesn't know to spend the night there on a dare, telling them if they make it through alive to the next morning he'll give each of them $10,000.00. Hey, that was big money in 1958.The guests all arrive in hearses, and quickly get to know each other, but why were they invited?  None of them know.The house itself, a strange architectural style, looking almost like a fortress from the outside, is quite Victorian on the inside, and reminds me a lot of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.. velvet curtains and wallpaper, candle-filled chandeliers, big old wooden doors everywhere, lots of creepy dark corners, not the kind of place you'd want to spend the night alone, especially not after its owner tells you it's haunted, and that there are a couple of unaccounted for heads bouncing around the place..Okay so what makes a bad film so good?An awful lot of screen time is spent following the seven characters (the five guests, Price and his bitchy wife who wants his fortune) go in and out of bedrooms, up and down hallways, down to the basement, into closets, behind mysterious curtains.. it seems like none of them can stay put for more than a couple minutes at a time. You will get to know this house, or at least parts of it, quite well, as the camera tracks and pans around the same rooms and hallways an endless number of times. C'mon.. just lock yourself in your room, read a book, wait till morning and collect your money.. but NoooOoOooo..And then there's the basement, which, oddly enough, has a huge vat of acid under the floor.. closets with secret spaces between the walls, lights that go on and off by themselves, doors that open and close for no reason.. eeek!And oy the screaming. A sexy young female character named Nora, apparently one of Price's steno pool girls invited quite by random to the party, screams and screams until you'd think her tonsils are going to fly out of her mouth.  She makes you wonder where the poor girl gets the strength. Nora is the epitome of every 1950s horror movie screaming girl you've ever seen, but again, wonderfully portrayed.And if you thought any one of these characters should lock herself in her bedroom until down, Nora would be the one you'd pick. Does she? Hah! Fat chance!  Handsome leading man Richard Long obviously has eyes for Nora, and she for him, but just when you think there's a remote chance for an embrace and a kiss, something horrible happens again..Blood dripping from ceilings. An old woman who floats across the floor.

I just watched 28 up, 35 up and 42 up all in about a week's time, so there are a lot of things to talk about within the entire series, rather than just in this one particular film. But I'll do my best to focus on 42, since that is the film I am commenting on.As a film on its' own, 42 up is probably the most interesting of the series as far as watching the people change physically over the years goes. Each subject filmed at the six different stages appears (except for those that had dropped out of the program) and you get to see how they have transformed over the years. 42 is also great because you also get to see how film techniques (& stock) have evolved over the years along with the people. In the present time, the film looks beautiful and rich in color while each successive film appears murkier and murkier over time until you get the original black and white of 1964. The problem with 42 Up, if you were going to watch just this one film, is that because there are so many flashbacks of people at various stages, this leaves little room for getting to know them better (during a 2 hour time frame). I have talked to people who say, I am just going to watch 42 up because they give you all the background stuff anyway.. I say NO!.....For a richer experience, and this is what I did so you can take it for what it's worth, watch 28, 35, and 42 up at least so you can get to know these people fully at each stage. There are crucial things that happen to these people in 35 for instance which does not show up in 42.(Neil!!John!!)

Taken as a whole, they are amazing to watch..and the suspense in wondering what happened to each over the next seven years is truly there if you start early in the series. So watch some of the others before you watch 42 to get the full effect. On to the characters..who are real people. Their stories are so beautiful to watch unfold over time it is truly amazing they were captured at each stage as they grew up. And you can even get the feeling by the end how large their lives really are and that they extend way beyond the borders of the film which the filmmakers obviously knew and luckily never once tried to pretend that they could completely capture the essence of a person on film. You just get tiny snippets of who these people are yet by the end you can't stop thinking about them, they become a part of you.

What happened to him??? 2) Are there any other projects going on like this in America or on a global scale?

Quite honestly, Its not easy to make sense of the ending, you might be left confused. I wasn't, I made a conclusion that made sense to me and I told myself This is it. Then minutes after that, I thought again, and I realized Well maybe this is the ongoing creativity about this movie, it continues to surprise you even after its finished. So maybe the ending was planned not to make sense!The music is something I really liked about this movie. The tune that kept repeating did add another dimension and was quite brilliant. The Director did a great Job. Guy Pearce was actually quite good, even though I thought at times ... Bruce Willis? Anyhow, give Guy the credit he deserves. Writer and Director Christopher Nolan takes full marks from me.Live it backwards for once, You will be surprised with the results! 9\/10  ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"25 October 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  It is very hard to totally agree on how brilliant Memento really is. It is not your average Hollywood movie. This is by all means an intense & horrific ride. A complex journey to a man's erased memory! If that all is not enough... make sure you fasten your seat belts ... because you are going to experience it backwards!Guy Pearce (Leonard) is more than just a shattered man grieving the loss of his wife. He is man with a memory that gets erased in seconds, and all he is left with is his old memory. Therefore, his dilemma is clear, The last things he always remember is the raping and killing of his wife. His is faced with that, due to a case of absence of short-term memory. How can such a person with enormous rage and little ruse face his life?He tries greatly, but does he succeed? I will not give it away. You will live with him his case ( The movie starts from the end, and you have no idea what happened before, same as Leonard ). This is one beauty of this movie, because its totally unpredictable. There are many twists to keep you eyebrows raised! Leonard is taking control, just follow him. You will learn on the way everything about his Tattoos & Polaroid's.

The baby was raised by birds, and now it's hard to tell if he's foul, or fowl. His sad saga is only one of the many threads that tangle the plot of Tim Burton's partially successful, but really bad, sequel to his 1989 Batman.  In Returns, we're given three villains for the price of one, but more is not always better. Any one of them could have carried his, or her, own movie, but here they just keep stepping on each other's toes (paws? claws?). The paws are provided by the marvelous Michelle Pfeiffer, as Catwoman. She gets the funniest lines and knows just what to do with them. She is spectacular in her basic black, home-sewn catsuit and her spike-heeled boots. The bullwhip is the perfect accessory to complete the outfit. Too bad the script can't quite figure out what she represents. DeVito is fine, but his birdman of Gotham, badly in need of a visit to the dentist, grows a tad wearisome. Christopher Walken completes the villainous trilogy as Max Shreck (great name), the unscrupulous businessman whose greed may be the downfall of Batman's hometown. He wisely, and skillfully, plays it down.Oh, yes, before we forget--there is what seems like a cameo appearance by Michael Keaton, as the caped crusader himself. The story is overly complicated, the transitions between story lines rather bumpy and the characters (with the exception of that darn Cat) don't really grab our interest. Still, the movie is a visual marvel, great at putting its money where our eyes are, and that's no guano. Would love to see more of Pfeiffer's kitten with a whip in future installments. Don't miss the credits at the end of Batman Returns, to see who plays the Penguin's daddy.
