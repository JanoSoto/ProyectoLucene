From there the party progressed and the Alicia and Devlin drank a lot until she was drunk.  They went for a drive and she was totally hammered. This is where part of the plot began to unravel, because on the ride they got pulled over.  She was suppose to be arrested since it was her second charge of drunk driving but Devlin showed the cop an ID and let her go. It turns out he was a government agent and he needed her for a job.  This is why he was at the party, because he needed her to go to Brazil to work undercover to catch a man named Sebastian.  There were two reasons for her to be used.  The first one was that her father knew Sebastian and the second was that he had a crush on Alicia.  So she gets sent down there to pretend like she is interested in him.  From there she begins to find out many different things about this man and his acquaintances.  However, Sebastian is very suspicious of Devlin and wants Alicia to marry him to prove her love for him by marrying him, so she does.  However, through the beginning of the story Devlin and Alicia both fall for each other and have a hard time with this entire scenario.  It turns out they were planning something big that has to do with uranium, but they never really sad what the uranium was for. Through the course of her undercover work Sebastian and his mother found out about her working for the government, because she had to steal a key to find out what Sebastian and his comrades were up to, and Sebastian noticed the key was gone at a dinner party when he went to the cellar to get more wine (this is where the uranium was).  After Sebastian and his mother found out about her they began to drug her to death.  The reason that he and his mother did this was because early in the film one of the other acquaintances almost gave away the secret when he noticed a bottle of wine.  Which was hidden in wine bottles.  After this event the others decided that he needed to be killed to make sure no one found out.  They were all very suspicious about everything, and Sebastian and his mother were worried they would be killed if the others found out.  So Sebastian and his mother did not want the other guys to find out that she was a government spy.  After Alicia begins to be poisoned she soon gets so poisoned she is bed ridden, and she realizes that the Sebastian and his mother know she is a spy.  So they keep on poisoning her so the others won't find out.  After a few days had gone by Alicia had not checked in with Devlin and he went looking for her, and found her in a bed near death.  From there he takes her out of the room and finds Sebastian on his way up the stairs and says to let him take her or he will tell the others what has been going on, so Sebastian begins to play along like they are going to take her to a hospital.  So they start carrying her down the stairs like they are going to take her to the hospital with Sebastian.  Once Devlin and Alicia are in the car he does not let Sebastian in the car, because he knows that the others will kill him, and that is how it ends by Sebastian walking back into the house where the other guys he is working with are.  The plot develops very slowly, and when you think you will find out what is going on they don't tell you.  Since they never said what Sebastian and the others plot was it made me jumpy all through the film. Now, there are many obvious social and political issues in this film.  The social issue is if you are a criminal do not trust a girl that hated you before, and now will marry you.  It was stupid because Sebastian's mother had a feeling the whole time something was not right, and she was right. Secondly being a criminal gives people major paranoia; I mean they killed the other guy just for pointing at a bottle if wine and looking funny. People who are criminals are very paranoid so you better not become one. The political issues are obvious this film showed that the government can do a lot of things people would never expect to be possible.  They were able to find this woman and get her to do some very dangerous things to catch some really bad men.  The reason I think they never said what they were doing was because uranium is used in atomic weapons and at this time that was a big thing, so I guess Hitchcock expected us to understand.  Also, Hitchcock is well known for making films that grab you attention just like this one did. Another big political or social issue was when they showed Alicia driving drunk.  This is a big issue now a days and they showed her getting caught, because think of the ramifications if she did not get pulled over.  In movies and television they need to show people who do bad things getting caught, or more people would commit crimes.  Even if in the real world they get caught, stopping crimes before the start is a big issue in my mind. It is like if they didn't show her getting pulled over some people may have driven drunk and killed someone, which happens all the time.  In the end they showed the Sebastian walking to his death, from the hands of his own people.

Why do I constantly have to listen to film snobs complain about good movies?  This movie doesn't offer much.  Where is the metaphor, the art, etc.  Tommy Boy isn't the best film in the world, but it sure does amuse me.  Stupid humor or not, this movie has a laugh waiting around every corner.  The acting is good and the timing is better.  There is even a heart felt sweet story going on.  It's a great buddy movie, and a great comedy.

To drive this point home, the narrative is edited together in interconnecting circles.  The story is told from two perspectives, Ana and Otto.  The stories go off in each perspective, focusing on one or the others point of view (occasionally both at the same time) and eventually coming back together.  A good way that I understand it is like a chain link fence.  Each circle makes its own rotation, but the links all meet at common points and you can continue on to the next link, circling around and around.  Or it could also be looked at like an infinity knot.  Maybe you think your getting somewhere but really you just keep circling around in an endless figure eight.  Lovers of the Arctic Circle tries to convince us that this is what life, and endless circle of coincidences.  As philosophy I find it less than convincing, but as a film it comes off great.  There are rare films that can't simply be viewed by a passive audience.  There are films that strive to be much more engaging than popcorn for the mind.  This is one of those films.  From the opening we know that this movie is going to be a challenge to the viewer. We see a crashed plane, we see brief images flashed before us, and then it jumps to a little boy.  We expect to have the opening imagery explained to us, but it isn't.  Instead we begin the narrative of Otto as a child, and how he first meets Ana.  It is easy to forget the image of the crashed plane.  Even when the imagery of pilots is brought back up in the narrative, you don't think back to the opening, only in the end when we see the same image in a newspaper do we realize we've come full circle, or at least that we're on a circular trip from the beginning.  Pardon me if I ramble, but this movie leaves so many things to be discussed that it's hard for me to organize my thoughts.  Of course I ramble anyways, wait, there I go again. So anyways. Lovers of the Arctic Circle definitely pulls off cyclical editing extremely well, it is the highlight of the film for most viewers (especially the first viewing when it is such a shock to the system).  On subsequent viewings, it is much easier to analyze other parts of the movie, things that you don't think about at first because you are so caught up in figuring out if Ana is dead or connecting the dots between things or finding small details to theorize the meaning of (for example as time moves on, Otto's hair is always getting longer, while Ana's gets shorter).  But there is a lot of other things to think about that aren't cyclical, things you think about most `normal' movies.  For example the characters; how well were they put together\/pulled off?  I think in this film the answer to both questions is excellent.  The actors all do very good jobs (especially the two leads) at conveying the reality of emotions displayed.  The ferocity of Otto's anger when his mother dies is intense (this is helped out by the shaky handheld camera, bringing us closer to the explosion) and the close ups of Ana after Otto leaves really show you the depth of her pain, blaming herself. Other good moments are the expressions on the faces of Otto and Ana while sledding towards the cliff, and the look in Ana's eyes after she is hit by the bus. It is very hard to express emotion through the eyes alone, but the actress definitely pulls it off in this important shot that gets repeatedly shown. The music was outstanding.  The low deep tones played throughout the film give it a morose tone.  Not to say the music is morose, it ranges in feeling, but there is always a subtle moroseness to it.  Even the overtly happy tune played in the beginning and in the final scene from Otto's POV (yet another circle) has a somber undertone, even before we think everything is going to work out, there is a sinking suspicion that we are in for sadness, and I attribute that feeling to the music.  My only gripe with the movie was the pacing.  Maybe I should complain about the scope of the picture being too broad, but I thought towards the middle of the picture (after Otto runs away) the story dragged.  The director did his best to show as much as possible of the main characters lives and keep it moving, my favorite example of this is the scene where Otto tells his various meaningless girlfriends about how his mother died in one continuous story that spans girlfriends, apartments, and years.  But unfortunately, I think it still drags at points.  It could be argued convincingly either way as to whether we needed to see as much of the in-between being together lives of Otto and Ana to get the right emotions when they finally see each other again.  I personally think it was probably necessary to show everything, there is no bad scenes that seem forced or of place in the narrative, I just found myself losing interest at that point in the movie.  I think it would have been better with fewer scenes and more montages.  Beyond this point, I find Lovers of the Arctic Circle to be an extremely fine film.

It was too cutesy to be artistic but showed the confidence Director Demme had on his film, because what went on before it was so powerfully and poignantly done. Tom Hank solidified unequivocally he was one of the finest actor of our time after this film and won an Oscar deservedly. The Maria Callas aria scene alone is as powerful and moving as any scene in cinema. As gripping as the train station scene in Schindler's List (or in any holocaust movie), it showed compassion,despair,joy,hope,sorrow and redemption all wrapped-up in one magnificent human moment.

How ridiculous. This is a film that was made to entertain young kids, and it's entertaining enough for parents to watch along with them. My little boy enjoyed it, but then he isn't much of an intellectual, since he's only six! Anything that makes him laugh is okay with me, though. Also, I have to say that people are WAY too hard on David Arquette. I'm not a serious fan of his, or anything, but I feel bad for the guy when people trash him. I have noticed that it's mainly men who are so down on him. Gee, I wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that he's married to one of TV's most popular, attractive, and highly-paid stars? He seems like a perfectly sweet, charming man who is having fun with his life and enjoys making silly films. He doesn't seem to take himself seriously, so why do so many people hate him? It's ridiculous. Oh, and just to let you know, he doesn't get film roles because of his wife. He was acting before he married Courtney Cox, and he is actually quite a talented actor. If you don't believe me, check out a little gem of an indie film called Dream with the Fishes. He gives quite an engaging and touching performance as a man on the verge of suicide whose life is changed when he befriends a terminally ill man, proving that he CAN do serious dramatic work. He just chooses not to. So why don't you people lay off of him? Not that he cares either way, I'm sure. He is having the time of his life. You go David!

It won 2 Academy Awards (Best Film Editing and Best Sound) and I can believe it. It is about 100 U.S. soldiers who were dropped down over a crowded market in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993 to capture two top lieutenants of a brutal Somali warlord, Mohammed Farah Aidid. Aidid's militia has been starving the Somali people by taking control of all the UN food aid that comes in and he is basically starving people to death (when he's not shooting them). The soldiers' mission was supposed to take an hour (many soldiers didnt even care about wearing a flak vest or not) but they ended up surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis fighting for their lives throughout the night, with many, many casualties as well as two seemingly-invincible Black Hawk helicopters are shot down. The acting is great, and Josh Harnett proves that he can play an aggressive soldier just as well as he can play different characters in other films (The Faculty, Pearl Harbor, etc.). The special effects are completely incredible, by far beating out the action scenes in Saving Private Ryan.

Lawrence(Peter O' Toole) on the Arab front during WWI. After a short prologue depicting Lawrence's premature death and funeral. We are cast back in time(more than 20 years) to Cairo, where Lawrence is about to begin the greatest adventure of his career his commanding officer instructs him to liaise with Prince Feisel(Alec Guiness) of the Bedou people, in a bid to make an 'appraisal' of the fortunes of the Arab forces in the struggle against the Ottoman Turks. A concise summary of the movie would outline five key events i)Lawrence's journey into Bedouin territory and his meetings with Feisel and Sherif Ali Ibn El Kharish (Omar Sharif) - Omar Sharif's entrance alone has become legend in the annals of movie history ii)The ardous trek across the Nefud Desert and subsequent attack on Aqaba iii)Lawrence's torture at the hands of the sadistic Turkish Bey in Deraa iv)The massacre at Tafas. v)The final success in Damascus.Robert Bolt's screenplay stretches beyond the typical fare of historical blockbusters by offering a graphic portrayal of Lawrence's character rather than depicting the combat in detail. When we first meet Lawrence, he is 'out of place' among his peers in the army - even his uniform is ill-fitting - a desire for greatness burns within him(`I cannot fiddle but I can make a great state out of a little city') and the opportunity to leave for Arabia is welcome relief from the tedium of cartography. His encounter with Ali(Omar Sharif) and the friendship that follows is crucial to the movie in that it offers a foil to the viewers against which they should draw contrasts to gain an understanding of Lawrence's psyche. Ali and his people accept Lawrence as one of their own, effectively adopting him as their leader - he wears Arabian clothes, eats their food etc. It would appear that this 'rebirth in the desert' appears to be Lawrence's true calling......until.... his capture in Deraa where his brutal treatment and degradation, causes him to becomes a sadistic, doubtful man with an insatiabe desire for revenge. Following the capture of Damascus, Lawrence beceomes redundant and leaves for England while the politicial resolution continues.`I never knew him well you know...', the words of General Allenby,Lawrence's commanding officer, at the movies opening. By the end of the picture, one wonders whetther they have gained any insight into this remarkable character.....do we really know him? Did he even know himself? Lawrence of Arabia is, above all else, a movie concerned with identity. Lawrence was a man who never truly 'found himself'. Detached from his compatriots-he labelled them as a `fat people' and followed with the line `I'm different'. He never really found peace among the Arabs either, brief happiness perhaps, but not peace. His happiness largly resulted from delusions of grandeur that were rooted in the godlike-status in which the Arabs held him. Indeed it was a mild hypocrisy that a man who believed that he was 'destined' for greatness would boldly declare that `Nothing is written!' before attempting the impossible(there is an ambiguity in this wonderful line which hints at an underlying scorn for the beliefs of the Arab people). Lawrence deterioration following his torture is well-contrasted against the reformed Ali(who initially appeared as a savage). Ali would now like to `learn politics' andis disgusted at Lawrence's bloodlust(`You speak to me of bloodshed?!'), while Lawrence `enjoyed' his execution of Gazim and no longer believes in taking prisoners in battle. Indeed Lean's illustration of the dark side of both men as well as such scenes as the one in which a mob scramble for a pistol would indicate that Lean believes that evil is an inherent part of man's nature. Another aspect of his character which was mildly referenced(and understandably so) was the possibility that he may have been homosexual. The total absence of female characters, his relationship with the young male servants and camp exhibitionism offer the audience slight hints regarding this. Obviously it would have been impossible to directly address this in a movie of this nature - it was an era when homosexuality sneered upon and creating an overtly gay hero would have been commercial suicide. But again this reinforces Lawrence's inability to define himself. As a final note there is one scene in which a motorcyclist shouts `WHO ARE YOU?' across the Suez canal with Lawrence standing in shot....the voice is that of David Lean.As a spectacle few movies rival Lawrence of Arabia, special effects are non-existent because the set-pieces were performed for real....trains were derailed...hordes of camel riders stormed across the sand(which was kept immaculate on a minimum of takes) etc. Shot in cinemascope with a predominantly left to right camera movement the viewers get a genuine sense of a cinematic journey, added to this is Maurice Jarre's sweeping score inspires awe in the viewer for the vast desert landscapes. The glorious cinematography and spectacular set-pieces enrapture rather than overwhelm the characters on screen. And what characters they are....aside from O'Toole(whose performance is one of the greatest of all time) and Sharif, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quayle and the ever wonderful Claude Rains complete an astonishing leading cast. I could talk about this forever so I should probably shut up.Lawrence of Arabia could not be made again, a studio would not allow a blockbuster to be released without a female lead, the effects would be digitised to cut down on cost, it's running time would be butchered, an newcomer like O'Toole would probably not obtain the lead etc. etc. Shame really.

They decide to kidnap a young Japanese girl, whose father is the president of a multi-million dollar film company, and he happens to go bankrupt only a day before the girl is kidnapped so he is unable to pay the ransom. The boss of Smiley's gang (who pays them for their missions) turns out to be the young girl's godfather, so he sends out many, many men with guns to kill Smiley and his friends. All of the action scenes are shot horribly and all of them are in blurry slow-motion which makes it very hard to see what is happening. This movie is so fake and unbelievably stupid that I had a hard time sitting through the whole thing. It is basically a Disney film with guns and people getting shot (with no visible bullet wounds or blood showing). It has no humor for people seeking laughs and no action for people seeking excitement.

But it is anything but that. There is nothing funny about it at all. The gang of hitmen, led by Melvin Smiley (Wahlberg), do many missions for cash that are mostly about killing mob leaders and such. They decide to kidnap a young Japanese girl, whose father is the president of a multi-million dollar film company, and he happens to go bankrupt only a day before the girl is kidnapped so he is unable to pay the ransom. The boss of Smiley's gang (who pays them for their missions) turns out to be the young girl's godfather, so he sends out many, many men with guns to kill Smiley and his friends. All of the action scenes are shot horribly and all of them are in blurry slow-motion which makes it very hard to see what is happening. This movie is so fake and unbelievably stupid that I had a hard time sitting through the whole thing. It is basically a Disney film with guns and people getting shot (with no visible bullet wounds or blood showing). It has no humor for people seeking laughs and no action for people seeking excitement.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"10 May 2003","score":"","review":"  A victim of serialization, Jason just isn't a scary concept anymore. So it shouldn't be surprising that the movie itself isn't scary, or frankly even watchable.The concept of the omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient bad guy is quite old, dating back to Laurel and Hardy meeting the Mummy. As a basis for true horror it simply lacks power.This is because horror stories must have rules. A movie can not be compelling or suspenseful if the villain has no defining boundaries, no weaknesses. Zombies can be decapitated. Vampires can be staked, broiled in the sun, sauteed with garlic. Werewolves catch a silver bullet. But what kills Jason?As ten movies have slavishly documented, apparently nothing. In this film he absorbs thousands of bullets and remains standing. He is a marksman with his machete, capable of piercing your heart at 1000 yards with a tomahawk throw. He has the strength of whatever number of men necessary to complete the superhuman feat being filmed. If decapitated, he becomes a computer virus, then morphs into some Borg creature. This guy's like a frickin' Go-Bot.The original story was, I believe, about a boy who drowned at summer camp and came back from the dead to exact revenge. It was an effective scary movie, setting very good tone and just being generally creepy. How has this concept morphed into a story about a cybernetic killer on a spaceship?Adding insult to injury is the slipshod manner in which the story is presented. The sets are fakey, the actors low-rent pretty faces who cannot even keep from smirking. There is little gore, and no innovative or particularly gruesome deaths. The one-liners are just not funny. In fact, the jokes scattered throughout the movie are all unfunny, and do nothing to help the already uninvolving atmosphere.I'm simply left wondering what is the point? The movie fails to scare, so it's not a horror film. It fails to generate laughter, so it's not a comedy. It couldn't be drama if that was Glenn Close behind the hockey mask. There is simply no reason for this movie to exist. It has no audience, except people who can be suckered in by the name brand.Lest I sound too critical, I will state that there is one scene - one - in the film that worked. Do not read ahead if you don't want it spoiled. At the end, one of the characters has the brilliant idea to decoy Jason at a critical moment by projecting a holographic camper in a sleeping bag for him to kill. That made me laugh. He may be a sellout, but Jason sure hates them campers.  ","genre":null},{"date":"10 May 2003","score":"","review":"  A victim of serialization, Jason just isn't a scary concept anymore.
