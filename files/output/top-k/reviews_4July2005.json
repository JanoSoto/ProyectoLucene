With a brilliant over-the-top performance by Jack Nicholson as the Joker and beautifully dark set-designs that captured the true essence of Gotham City, made Batman a huge hit. A sequel was bound to happen and it did in 1992 but did it live up to the expectation of the first Batman?Well, to be honest it comes down to opinion, while the first Batman may be the more popular choice of the two, there's no denying Batman Returns has evolved the Batman story wonderfully and while the first Batman may have aimed at kids and young adults, Batman Returns isn't aimed for kids or going for Box Office millions like the first film. It seems with Batman Returns director Tim Burton had far more influence over this film than the original.Batman Returns is a dark, gripping and almost eerie film that doesn't contain the same atmosphere as the first Batman, Batman Returns is far more darker and the scenery helps suggest this. Gotham city is covered in snow and skyscrapers are fully placed around the city. Although, it's quite stunning to view these great sets, it's almost beautiful in that Tim Burton fashion. Movies like Sleepy Hollow, The Nightmare before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands feature wonderful sets that are amazing to view and with Batman Returns it's no different.Performances in Batman Returns are all very good. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and delivers a far more deeper and darker performance than his earlier performance. Although, in Batman Returns we learn more about Batman, it doesn't mean Keaton makes Batman more acceptable or open, quite the opposite as in Batman Returns the Batman character is less appealing but more compelling in a peculiar way. The reason for this is because of the way Keaton has made the character more concealed with his emotions and makes us want to observe the character more and really watch his reactions. Michelle Phiffer and Danny De Vito give great performances as Batman's duo adversaries. Although neither performance reaches the extent of Nicholson's  The Joker, they still dig into their characters and manage to produce two very good performances that allows the viewer to not only be entertained by Batman's enemies but also be interested in their own story and how the characters evolve throughout the film.Overall, Batman Returns arguably isn't as good as the original but nevertheless still is a very good film and helps reminds us that Batman isn't a colourful and action-packed movie like Spiderman, The Hulk or The X-men, but a far more deeper and dynamic film that stays true to the characters and the story, unlike Batman Forever and Batman and Robin., the following sequels. I personally don't enjoy super-hero movies but with Batman Returns it's different and being a fan of Tim Burton, it's a pleasure to watch his dark and eerie style capture the real essence of Batman in Batman Returns and the snow-filled sets of Batman Returns, I found to be quite amazing and enjoyable to view, vintage Burton.

Since I saw him in a movie I've said I never finished watching (State and Main), I have been in love with his way of working; his body language and mostly his voice. While I may sound exaggerated, it's something I'm trying to do, and it gets me to peculiar places; like Next Stop Wonderland.Hoffman is not an important player in the film, even when he appears at the beginning. As Sean, he is dumping his girlfriend, Erin (Hope Davis), the most important player in the film. How the filmmakers have created Erin is remarkable. It had been a long time since I've seen a well-rounded character like this one. She's eccentric, tough, and now extremely depressed as abandoned by the man she loves. She spends her lonely days reading random phrases in a book written by her father. She loves that.However, her elegant mother Piper (Holland Taylor) puts an ad in the newspaper, proposing a single, outgoing, charming and likable woman looking for a couple. That's not me mom&#133;That's you!, Erin tells her mother gently. Now Erin finds herself with calls and messages from men whose ages start in 30 and end in 50; no advices from her gay friends.Continuing, Erin encounters different guys in one bar, and they try to win her with metaphoric phrases, without knowing the authors she knows by heart; cultured comments she knows are clichéd, and in one case sweet talking that ends up in a wedding ring falling out of a wallet. This scene shows the comedic talent of director Brad Anderson, and his writing collaborator Lyn Vaus. They also show other talents, like the dramatic one, as they keep their characters realistic enough so we understand how they feel when things occur to them.Some guys are making a bet to win Erin. One of them is Alan's (Alan Gelfant) brother. Although this seems like the other side of the world, it's in the same city where this Alan works in the aquarium as he studies to become wiser about that. He's already an old man, but is cultured as no one around him, and passionate about what he does (kind of like Erin, right?). Even when Erin and Alan are so similar; each of them doesn't know the other exists.

That's why Hope Davis shines in this role, which is comedic and different to what we usually get from her. Besides, she got into the park, and so did Alan Gelfant, who talks and looks like a young Sylvester Stallone but with more comedic gifts than the latter would ever dream of.Don't bother yourself asking if these two characters belong together because thy do. But at 100 minutes of film, Brad Anderson stops in Wonderland and encounters the leads. But he is so original and so far away from typical film-making that he won't give you what you're expecting for, like everyone does. He will leave it to your imagination.

De Niro is subsequently convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison, the film starts upon his release. Cape Fear (1991) is a remake of the 1962 movie featuring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. These two actors are now replaced with Robert De Niro and Nick Nolte as Max Cady (ex convict) and Sam Bowden (yuppie lawyer) respectively. Mitchum and Peck both feature in cameo roles which will undoubtedly please fans of the original. During his 14 years in prison Max Cady educates himself as a lawyer and in the words of the bible. He also develops a formidable six pack and muscular physique with which he presumably wishes to use as a tool in exacting his revenge on Bowden and his family. De Niro, known for his ability to transform himself physically (Raging Bull) does well in creating a physically intimidating character with an equally menacing performance. Cady frequently quotes from the bible and has carefully planned his revenge against Bowden aiming to break up his family emotionally before physically killing them. De Niro's performance as a psychopath is excellent and undoubtedly steals the show. Nick Nolte (surprisingly thin and clean cut) is also good as the defence attorney who has made questionable decisions in his career and family life. The relationship between Nolte and his wife (Jessica Lange) is well depicted and in a realistic manner. A very young Juliette Lewis is consistently annoying throughout the film (and in all her films) but is probably well cast for Scorceses' view of a less than angelic daughter. Scorceses' remake is quite stylish and makes some interesting use of black and white\/ X ray close ups of the characters at certain moments of the film. The score is also very good with a thunderous and chilling tune symbolising De Niro's malevolent and dangerous character. Overall, Cape Fear is quite an entertaining movie but nothing special and feels like it is a little too long. The finale of the movie (filmed on Bowden's boat at Cape Fear) is dragged out and uses the Terminator model where the villain just keeps coming back. This loses steam after a while and was probably unnecessary. Not a great movie but worth watching for De Niro's performance alone. Note should also be given to the Simpsons parody of Cape Fear which for any one who has seen the movie is intensely amusing.

Sure it has some nice things to offer and yes I had some fun watching it, but overall it isn't all that special, making it deserve such a high score (a 7.7\/10 right now). Perhaps it is because I'm not familiar with Texan small boarder town politics. I don't know, but when some small changes would be added to it, this would be a story that could have been told everywhere, not just in Texas or even the USA and that's also it's biggest problem in my opinion. Despite the location it wasn't too special.When the 40-year-old remains of a dead man are found on a former shooting range, Sam Deeds, the local sheriff is called to investigate this murder. As he digs deeper into the past, it's getting more and more obvious that his father, the legendary former sheriff Buddy Deeds, has had a lot to do with some dark town secrets, which the older inhabitants prefer not to be revealed. While he puzzles out the long-past events, Sam also tries to restart a romance with his old high-school flame, but in a town where nothing is what it seems, that can be a very difficult thing to do...What I liked most about this movie was the fact that the characters had some depth. What I fear most about many movies is that the characters are too easy to understand, making you know everything about them too quickly in the movie. That's certainly not the case with this movie. Even at the end of it, you'll get some surprising information about some people. I'm not going to tell you what that is of course, because I don't want to spoil the fun, but it sure works. But despite the fact that the characters have been well developed, it doesn't save the entire story of the movie. Somehow it all looked a bit too stereotypical and obvious.Despite the fact that this movie doesn't have any real big names in the cast, the acting certainly is OK and the same can be said about the direction of John Sayles. What he did with this movie wasn't exactly the most original approach possible, but it worked and that's what counts. Overall I liked it enough to recommend it, but it just isn't worth the actual rating. I would rather like to give it a 6.5\/10.

Once you see Star Wars (or Episode IV, for all you Special Edition lovers) at least 54 times, everything sort of drags on.

While Empire is VERY slow, it is easily the darkest and most enjoyable movie from the Original Trilogy, but for me, the least. As with Star Wars I'm gonna start the review with the Special Edition stuff. We don't need to see the VERY interesting approach to the Star Destroyer. The extra Wampa scene builds MUCH more tension than the original. And making Luke scream like a baby was Definitely cool. So, like the original Star Wars DON'T BUY OR WATCH THE SPECIAL EDITION! Again, I am proud to be the lucky owner of the original 3 movies unwrapped, and in mint condition after my success on ebay. I think it is obvious that The Empire Strikes Back is the darkest, including the fact that it has the stunning (MAJOR spoilers ahead!) I am your father! by James Earl Jones. As for the acting in this movie, second strongest, (Return of the Jedi has the strongest,in my opinion). Best actor\/actress here- Frank Oz as Yoda. Well, he didn't really act, but oh, well. Againg, the effects in the Original Edition don't stick out like a sore thumb like in the Special Edition. The sets have gone a small, almost unnoticeable change They don't look used! While many may argue that snow and woods can't look used (and I agree with them), Cloud City certainly can, and I think that there wasn't a scuff mark until the Stormtroopers attacked! Again, the music is GREAT! This time, my second favorite track, The Imperial March is introduced, and my fifth favorite, Yoda's Theme is introduced.

Sci-Fi's golden age started with the likes of George Pal's Destination Moon and When Worlds Collide followed by The Thing in 1951. The Thing was the first of many alien invader movies to follow latter into the 1950's.This movie is about a group of air force guys that go up to the Artic with a journalist to investigate a possible meteorite crash. They join up with a team of scientists at a research station. When they arrive at the site, they discover it to be a flying saucer that is submerged under ice. They destroy the saucer in their attempt to recover it but they do find a body in a block of ice near the saucer. The block of ice is brought back to the research station. The block of ice melts while one of the guys is supposed to be watching it and the creature gets out. The creature starts attacking the men. He is discovered by Dr. Carrington (Cornthwaite) to be a plant creature with intelligence beyond that of humans. It becomes a threat to the people and even a possible threat to mankind so Captian Hendry (Toby) and his men try to figure out a way to destroy it. However, Dr. Carrington wants to study him and learn from him so he secretly thwarts their attempts to destroy the creature.Very good monster movie reminiscent of the old Universal monster movies from the 1930's. The cold arctic setting is wonderful and looks very realistic. This film is loaded with suspense. The monster is rather illusive so one does not know when he is going to show up. This unknown is what makes this move so suspenseful. On the down side, their is some useless filler in this movie. For example, the romantic scenario between Captain Hendry and Nikki (Sheridan). Also, when the monster does appear they never really seem that terrified. Lets put it this way, they are never as terrified as they appear on the DVD cover! Also, the silly one liners and jokes weaken its horror element. It gets too talky. But overall I do like the movie and a 1950's sci-fi collection is definitely not complete without it.

The narration credited to Vittorio Cramer continues as the viewer is informed that the Martian race is looking to relocate & the only suitable planet is Earth, the others are either too cold, too hot or are in a constant state of day or night. Earth appears perfect to the Martians who don't like to share... Somewhere in California just outside of Los Angeles what appears to be a meteorite falls from the sky & crash lands on Earth. While on a fishing trip top scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry) is asked to investigate but tells a local bird named Sylvia Van Buren (Ann Robinson, no not that one) that the meteorite is too hot to go near at the moment & invites himself to a square dance party with her that very night. Three men, Wash Perry (William Phipps as Bill Phipps), Salvatore (Jack Kruschen) & some other guy whose name I don't remember or more likely never mentioned, are left behind to guard the meteorite & soon notice a round hatch unscrewing itself from which a antenna thing pops out & incinerates them. Reports of similar meteorites landing all over Earth flood in as the military are called, Colonel Ralph Heffner (Vernon Rich) & General Mann (Les Tremayne) liaise with Dr. Forrester about any potential alien threat & let Miss Van Buren make tea & cakes for the soldiers just like a 1950's woman should... Soon enough the Martians decide to launch their attack & nothing the army has seems able to even dent their flying machines, not even an atom bomb. Scientists quickly predict that unless a way of stopping the Martian attack is found they will have taken over the entire Earth in just six days times...Directed by Byron Haskin The War of the Worlds is surely the Grandfather of all alien invasion films. The script by Barre Lyndon based on the H.G. Wells novel is quick to set things up with a lengthy narration that excludes the need for long scenes of exposition later on, a very good move. Before long Martian spaceships are destroying our planet with ruthless efficiency, unfortunately this point is where The War of the Worlds almost slows to an absolute halt as the script then concentrates on humanities (well a group of soldiers & scientists) attempts to find a way of defeating the Martians. The Martians then make an appearance again ten or so minutes before the end which I personally think works terrifically well. There are a few expected 50's stereotypical characters here like Van Buren who is just there to scream & provide the love interest although the blossoming relationship between Van Buren & Forrester isn't as in your face as it could have been & doesn't dominate. The sequence inside the farmhouse when we actually see a Martain for the first & only time is quite creepy & effective. The Martian itself is seen briefly & looks OK but for the majority of The War of the Worlds the Martians themselves are not needed as their ships do all the damage. The ships have a certain elegance about them even if they look a little basic by todays standards, I could do without all the 70's cheap computer game like Space Invader sound effects though. The special effects are a million miles behind the likes of todays multi million Dollar CGI productions much like the Steven Spielberg War of the Worlds (2005) remake but they hold up reasonably well as long as you cut them some slack & I've sat through a lot worse on much later & much bigger budget productions. The acting is as wooden as most 50's Sci-Fi unfortunately but The War of the Worlds has a strong enough story & provides enough entertainment to overlook this aspect. Cinematography is OK if a little bland & as a whole Haskin doesn't seem like a particularly adventurous director with the whole production coming off as a little too by-the-numbers on occasion. Overall I liked The War of the Worlds a lot, it provides good clean fun entertainment throughout it's pacey 85 minutes running time.

Rounding out the main characters is Holly Hunter who, as Jane Craig, is a talented news producer who gets attracted to both men. Her mission, if she decides to accept the impossible, is to choose sensitivity and honesty, or go for sex appeal.SPOILERS. The business part of the story is the need for cutbacks that for the most part means older employees will be dismissed, and replaced by younger, lower paid employees. Jane gets a big break with a promotion, but Aaron decides to quit while I still have the ability to cry. Tom gets sent to London, a seasoning move for bigger things. Tom and Jane seem destined to remain together, he invites her to a week of vacation before his new assignment, but at the airport she tells him No, all because she found out that an earlier interview contained fake tears that Tom had emoted after the interview was over, just like any actor would.

Trish and Tommy meet the renters, and run into them the next day skinny-dipping at Crystal Point with local twins Tina and Terri. When the Jarvis' car breaks down, Trish and Tommy are helped by Rob, a passing camper.That night there is a drunken party at the rental house. When her boyfriend Paul starts dancing with Tina, Samantha goes for a swim - and is killed. Paul has second thoughts and goes out looking for her. Terri goes after Jimmy, and Jason kills Paul.
