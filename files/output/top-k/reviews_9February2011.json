Most people I talk too told me that it's a new James Bond movie. So I borrowed the movies from my boyfriend and watched them this week. Starting off with The Bourne Identity and what a way to start. While I didn't find the film as exciting as I would expect it, it is a very well done action movie. The choreography was awesome and Matt Damon makes for a very strong male lead. His character is the only thing that kept me going through the movie, we start off not knowing who he really is and want to find out with him what happened to him, who he is and why he's wanted dead or alive, though preferably dead. As he goes through heck to find out what is going on and only having one person on his side, a woman who is probably only with him just because he's hot, he finds out that he's almost like the Superman assassin. James Bond would probably say Well, at least I still have my sexy weapons and lines of hot women waiting to jump my bones.A fishing boat crew finds an unconscious man adrift in the Mediterranean with two gunshot wounds in his back. When he wakes up, the man comes to realize he suffers from amnesia, having only one clue to his identity the account number to a safe deposit box provided by a tiny laser projector. Traveling to Switzerland to find the corresponding bank, the man discovers he is skilled in advanced hand-to-hand combat when he instinctively defends himself from two policemen. He arrives at the bank and finds the deposit box contains a significant amount of cash and several passports with his photo, but with numerous aliases. He assumes the name Jason Bourne. A few blocks away, he induces Marie with $20,000 to take him to Paris to the address on his Bourne passport. Meanwhile, back at CIA headquarters the head of Treadstone, reveals to his supervisor, that Bourne was the covert operative responsible for a failed assassination attempt. Intending to sever all connections between the CIA and Wombosi, Conklin sends three highly-trained assassins to kill Bourne. The only thing these movies fall victim too is the shaky cam effect, I understand it's meant to make the audience feel tense but it's not needed for 90% of the movie. Also I wished they had picked a different actress to play Marie. Nothing wrong with Franka Potente, she's a fine actress but she just didn't really capture me as Marie and made her character into such a clich√©. Plus their love story isn't really that necessary and very random. However like I said this is a very interesting story and I'm glad that I decided to check these movies out. I really loved the car chase scene, it's rare we get a good one any more and it was handled so gracefully that made it so exciting. I'm so curious if Matt Damon did his own stunts which is probably unlikely however those fight scenes were just awesome and again done with such style that it made the film worth watching. The supporting cast holds up very well with Chris Cooper and Julia Styles, I'm sad that Chris Cooper didn't make it for the other movies because his character is so dark and a great villain, but the show must go on and other great villains will be introduced as we find out more about Jason Bourne.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 February 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One trilogy I had been dying to see is the Bourne trilogy, so many people just love these movies and I've heard nothing but positive reviews about them.

When you look at it from an entertainment point of view, the film fits the bill perfectly and offers both a substantial love story for the girls, and a great build up of action for the guys that occurs around the last hour or so of the film.I also give credit where credit is due, I do believe it does have a good fictional storyline full of emotion, and Cameron intertwined the factual characters in the story rather nicely. Also the sets are incredible, replicating Titanic almost to a T. The special effects were also incredibly well done, and at times quite astounding. Cameron also does a fairly good job at recreating the atmosphere of that night, with an excellent score to back it up composed by the very talented James Horner. From a critical point of view, from someone who is quite obsessed with the subject, the film is a tad unoriginal. Not because I've seen this story done before, but because certain story elements just are. For one, the story itself is a standard Hollywood formula, possibly too Hollywood for my liking. Repeating the tale of star crossed lovers\/two people who can never be together because they are from different worlds. Two, because it channels both the 1943 Nazi propaganda film Titanic, and the 1960 MGM film The Last Voyage. Maybe it was coincidental, but nevertheless it seems to be a re-imagining. In the 1943 version Henry must go back down to steerage to find his brother Bobby who was arrested and imprisoned in a cell. As the hallway continues to flood Henry finds an axe to break down the cell door.In The Last Voyage Cliff Henderson and Hank Lawson are in the dining room as she begins to flood with water.I guess nowadays many film ideas are are recycled, but at the same time some credit should be given to both these films.On another note entirely, James Horner's score is quite possibly what makes this film so emotional, unfortunately I feel that too much of this film rides on the coat tail of the love story and the music score. What should be the main focus (the story of the actual passengers and crew) is too overshadowed by the love story; you may want to ask yourself what is really moving me to tears? Take away the music and much of the emotional impact is gone, as it is with most films. Personally I believe a film should be able to stand on its own by impacting the viewer without the accompaniment of music. Don't get me wrong I love a good score, but the film should not have to rely on it like a crutch, which I feel at times the film does.The love story takes away also, as it too overshadows the factual passengers and crew. At times you get so caught up in the fictional storyline that you forget about the true story. Again the film should have been able to have stood on its own without the love story, but it acts as a major crutch. I know it was not their intentions to overshadow the true story, but nevertheless it happened unintentionally. However, there are some very emotional scenes when James Cameron does his tracking shots, as you see all of the passengers running towards the stern, and jumping off the decks of the ship. Cameron does this successfully and makes the viewer put themselves in a position to imagine what it must have been like for all of those people, and what it would have been like to be on that ship yourself during the Titanic's final moments. Aside from that, I must point out that the last song the band played on the ship is debatable, some claim it was Nearer my God to Thee, while others claim it was a waltz known for short as Autumn. No matter what the final song was, the fact that James Cameron played the Bethany version of this hymn, is inaccurate. Cameron possibly used this because of how recognized this version is, but if you are going to tell a true story I believe you should tell it accurately. If anything the Horbury version of this hymn would have been played as depicted in the film A Night to Remember, as an eye witness vividly remembers this version being played sometime that night. Otherwise it would have been the Propior Deo version of the hymn.Lastly, the final two things I have to mention. One is the portrayal of First Officer William Murdoch, he did not commit suicide as he was spotted in the water by wireless operator Harold Bride. Two the Break Up of the Titanic is a question of debate, as new evidence and theories are arising which would contradict the portrayal of the break- up in the film.In my final thoughts, it's hard to bring a true story to the big screen without having a fictional story to support it, because let's face it, for some the love story is the only thing that interests them. When in all actuality this story has so much to offer without the use of fiction. Titanic was a ship so technologically advanced for it's time, so big and powerful that man believed that they were victorious, dominant, and on top of the world. However one night changed the fate of the world forever, the tragic true story of the Titanic and its passenger and crew will forever be a story of morals, including the ignorance of man.James Cameron's film Titanic is still a great motion picture aside from it's flaws. It may be overrated but you be the judge.

Most music artists who are at the top of their game just love the money that's coming in, same with their agents, lawyers, family and groupies, so what better way to look like they're trying to be honest with a life story than release a silly movie? Prince, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Madonna, 50 Cent&#x85; they've all been apart of this trend plus more. To think at a time in the early 90's Vanilla Ice was huge with his hit single Ice Ice Baby and was pretty unstoppable for 15 minutes. But given credit due, it's a catchy tune and one of the most successful songs of all time, one of the best selling rap singles as well&#x85; word. So to capture in on his roller coaster of success he apparently made a movie about how he keeps it real with Cool as Ice. This is a personal love letter from him to himself, just how awesome he is and that everyone around him just judges his looks and they're all wrong, that he's a nice cool guy. The acting, the editing, the story and all around this was just a disaster waiting to happen.The leader of a motorcycle gang Johnny falls in love with a small-town girl Kathy. He is a rebel without a cause and no adult takes him seriously for some odd reason despite his appropriate wardrobe that includes a spatchula hat and hamburglar shorts. Kathy finds out that her family is involved in the Witness Protection Program, they are being pursued by corrupt cops. Her father thinks that Johnny is part of the corrupt cops and forbids Kathy from seeing him but her heart of stone will be melted with ice! Wait, how does that even make sense? Yeah, that's the plot.You know lately I've been on this trend of watching movies that are so bad they're good again, I think Cool as Ice while very stupid falls easily into this category. There are classic lines such as Drop dat zero and get with da hero! and I'll see you tomorrow&#x85; You're seeing me now. It's funny how the love story is so awkward, Vanilla Ice is virtually a stalker who won't leave this poor girl alone and yet somehow she goes from completely hating him to loving him and saying how the world judges him wrongly despite the fact that the way they met is by him nearly killing her(though by a stupid accident). The editing is just a joke and must have been a college project because it just can't seem to keep a common theme other than let's see some Calvin Klein poses by Vanilla Ice. There's this random scene where Johnny and Kathy are getting to know each other at the construction site and randomly they're slow motion chasing each other throughout the site and dance music is playing in the background back to them talking back to them chasing in slow mo back to them kissing back to&#x85; well you get the idea.The characters are bland and very clich√©. I was expecting the adults to have some kind of a silly over the top British accent with a cup of tea as the motorcycle gang rolls into town and say my gosh! Who let those rascal hooligans in our neighborhood?. Like I said the acting is just horrible from pretty much the whole cast. The only reason this movie is enjoyable on any level is because I think at the time Vanilla Ice took this very seriously. This movie is beyond dated and silly and Vanilla Ice is as white as wonder bread with mayo being eaten by a republican.

Highly unlikely, right? Well Die Hard 2 banks on this implausibility and practically recreates the first Die Hard. The film is littered with silly lines about how crazy it is that this is happening all over again. And yes, I agree, it is crazy. So why make a movie about it? As you should have guessed by now, Die Hard 2 pits hard boiled cop John McClane against a group of terrorists once again on Christmas eve. These terrorists have taken control over an airport and are threatening to crash the many planes waiting to land unless their demands for a military plane that they may use to fly out of the country are met. McClane won't see these terrorists get away with it and sets out to stop them, against the will of everybody else. His wife is also on one of the planes in danger, so that complicates things a bit. What ensues from here is a pretty ridiculous series of gunfights and explosions, none of which really has any kind of awesome wow factor to it like the first film did.The character of John McClane from the first Die Hard film was great. He was a mixed of crazy and intensity. He could keep his cool and fight through all sorts of pain while remaining freaking awesome. His hard boiled run-n-gun nature made him a memorable, and also very quotable, 80's action hero. I was glad to see Bruce Willis reprise this great role in Die Hard 2 until I began to realize something horrible. His character had been changed. The raw awesomeness that the original McClane possessed had been tossed aside for a loud mouthed and sort of goofy guy. Instead of taking charge with the intensity and determination the first McClane had, John McClane in this film just has this why me? attitude for the entire film. He just sort of runs around killing people in pretty lame action sequences and nothing he does in Die Hard 2 is remotely close to the badass stunts he pulled off in the first movie. Bruce Willis still does a good job, but he feels like a whole new character that I don't like nearly as much as Die Hard's John McClane.As for the supporting cast, there isn't a whole lot going on either. There are plenty of new characters as well as some returning from the original film. There are multiple obnoxious throwaway characters in this film such as an annoying news reporter who doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose in the film save for one particular scene. There's also Dennis Franz as police Captain Carmine Lorenzo, a cop that has a huge grudge against McClane for some reason. He is extremely annoying and his animosity towards McClane becomes ridiculous and silly when it gets in the way of life or death situations. Then of course there's the villain in Die Hard 2. William Sadler plays Colonel Stuart who leads the terrorist group, but in reality he hardly does anything. He's a wuss who sits back in his hideout and lets everyone else do his dirty work for him. Maybe this villain wouldn't have seemed quite as lame if the villain from Die Hard hadn't been one of the greatest villains of all time. Stuart is a crappy villain by himself, but when compared to Alan Rickman's portrayal of Hans Gruber he might as well be a disgruntled 12 year old with a nerf gun. There was a serious aura of fear and danger surrounding the terrorists in Die Hard, but the terrorists in the sequel pale in comparison and don't feel very threatening at all. It is especially ridiculous to watch them try to shoot. They might as well be wearing blindfolds.I've spent this entire review comparing this movie to its predecessor, so I will say that as a standalone film Die Hard 2 is an OK action film. It is nothing special, but it's nothing worth hating. I give it kudos for trying so hard to be a Die Hard film, unfortunately it just misses the mark in every category.

Today, however, I decided to log onto Netflix and see what was available to Watch Instantly. I looked under the Recommended for You section and saw the title of a film I had only ever heard of. I had never bothered to ask anyone what it was about; my parents had told me a while ago that it was a great movie, but naturally I hadn't listened (after all, it was rated R). I couldn't even make out the actors on the tiny image of the DVD box. All I recognized was the title Good Will Hunting. I was done with my homework, I didn't have anything constructive to do, and I was bored, so I clicked on the link that read, Play Movie. I'm glad I did.This film, written by two former Harvard students and great friends, is by far one of the most incredible films I have ever seen. From the opening kaleidoscopic views of physics equations to the final shot of a junky car heading west on the highway, I was intrigued, to say the least. To anyone who hasn't seen it, you don't realize the sheer beauty of these simple camera shots. To anyone who has, you know exactly what I mean. The story follows Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a janitor working at MIT who is far smarter than the mathematics professors teaching there. It is later revealed that he had a tough childhood, is an orphan, and never had a chance to go to a school like MIT, but by proving an incredibly difficult theorem he shows Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) that he has an amazing gift for mathematics. One thing leads to another, and the only way Will can stay out of jail for assault charges is if he gets therapy from Professor Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a teacher at a community college. Through this therapy, Will comes to realize that he has too much potential to throw away his life living in South Boston. This story runs parallel to Will's love life with Skylar (Minnie Driver), a student at Harvard University. This relationship could have ended up as a pointless plot addition to make the movie longer, but it actually becomes pretty vital to the plot of the movie and completely changes Will's life. The combination of a love story and the story of a genius who finally realizes his full potential makes a brilliant film.This film's story is amazing, but a great film doesn't only have a good story. A great film has a great story, great acting, great scenery, great music, and great symbolism. Good Will Hunting has all of these aspects, and more. The fact that this movie was written by two amateur filmmakers only emphasizes their movie-making skill, and the fact that they can actually act is what fuses the incredible plot to the rest of the movie. If anyone else had been cast as the lead roles of Will Hunting and Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), the movie probably wouldn't have captured all the aspects that make up this great film. It is a very good thing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck adopted these roles, but the inclusion of Robin Williams in this film takes it up a level. Williams' ability to perfectly transition from jokes to concern to even violence is a blatant sign that he is a great actor, and without him this film could not have succeeded. Aside from the obvious acting and plot aspects of the movie, Good Will Hunting is also stunningly symbolic. Whether Damon and Affleck meant to add so many symbols to the film or not, they did so seamlessly. I won't add any plot spoilers, but let me tell you if you can recognize the true meaning in films, you will devour this movie.I am grateful to Netflix, to say the least.

But there are many strange films out there and that a film is different doesn't necessarily make it a good one. Being John Malkovich is very strange but it is also just as good.The story is like completely insane but manages to keep getting more and more interesting the longer it goes. Never knowing what is to come next. The plot is exciting at all time but what I found a strong point was the characters. All the actors are great in creating characters as unpredictable as the rest of the movie. I feel there is no one that is really a good guy and neither a big bad one. Not a bad thing like many movies with characters one can't relate too, because here the roles have such substance an the interest for seeing what will happen and what move they make next keeps me on the edge of my seat at all time. Eventough this is a film that interest in all it's weirdness I feel that is more a character driven picture. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are so greatly unpredictable, hard to fully get a hold of and Catherine Keener is really disturbing but in a good way for the film. John Malkovich himself is great in making himself feel even more awkward than the audience about what is going on, he is funny and one even comes to get some kind of bond to him. Brilliant dark comedy, it is funny and interesting in all it's weirdness and disturbing, sad and will somewhat mess with your head specially the psychological aspects delivered by the characters. Unlike many weird films Being John Malkovich manages to deliver much more than just awkwardness. Charlie Kaufman delivers a script unlike anything else and director Spike Jonze with amazing performances form the cast creates a completely unique film. Everybody needs to experience Being John Malkovich.

Watching this film made me feel desperate and left me traumatized by what happened within the movie. It is one of those movies that stays in your mind and just somewhat, stays implanted in your mind.I really enjoyed this film and consider it one of the best works of Bergman. He emphasizes the color red in the film as he uses the color for almost everything, including the transitions using the color of red to fade so that it can help us to transcend into the character. There were many disturbing scenes throughout the movie, for example when Karin, the oldest sister uses the piece of glass to cut herself, was quite disturbing. However, I feel that, that scene showed much more meaning for the audience. I believe that scene was to show her husband what she really thinks of him and that she would rather cut herself than to have sex with him.One thing I really liked about this film is that it showed and made me feel somewhat desperate. It made me eager to know what was going to happen in the next scene and wanting more from the characters. The scene when Maria is desperate to reconcile with her sister Karin made me feel as if I was in Maria's place, feeling desperate with her. It made me connect with her easily as if I was her. When Karin told Maria that she always hated her showed me that sometimes that's what siblings are all about. I, too have a younger sibling and I know exactly what Karin and Maria are going through. It showed me that siblings can hate each other one minute, then reconcile the next, and it is never an ending cycle.This movie left a huge impression to me because I felt that I can connect in many ways within this film. I really enjoyed this film and this is by far my favorite movie from Bergman.

Glen or Glenda I'm surprised was made as it seems very edgy for it's time. At a time where it was more conservative and sex changes were virtually unheard of, this film pushes boundaries. Ed Wood of course is named as the worst director of all time and I'm curious why because while his films are bad at times, they have a lot of passion behind them and he was able to tell a story. He was an outcast of Hollywood and knew what it was like to be judged at all times, especially as this was his vision. But he was born to make movies and even though this movie is a big WTF he had a style no less and in some way you could consider this an art house film. I'm not saying that this film is all good, it's very sloppy and disorganized as well as there's some very questionable dialog green dragon on your door step and slow snails and dog tails, very odd. But like I said, this film was very ahead for it's time and still to this day carries a strong message.The film opens with Inspector Warren finding the corpse of a male transvestite named Patrick\/Patricia, who has committed suicide. Wanting to know more about cross-dressing, Warren seeks out Dr. Alton, who narrates for him the story of Glen\/Glenda. Glen is shown studying women's clothes in a shop window. Dr. Alton points out that men's clothes are dull and restrictive, whereas women can adorn themselves with attractive clothing. Glen reads about sex change operations in a newspaper, then meets with Barbara, his girlfriend, who asks if Glen's secret problem is another woman. Another transvestite friend of his, John, tells Glen how cross-dressing ended his marriage. A bizarre dream sequence, containing some weird pornography, follows. Glen then decides to tell Barbara the truth. She offers her angora sweater as a sign of acceptance.I'm curious if Ed Wood was still alive how he would think of our society where we are starting to accept homosexuality more and more. Also the term metro sexual and how males are a lot more feminine that we accept a man men who wear a little make up or get their eyebrows done. Who knows, maybe this movie helped as clearly in some way it did educate people about transvestites. I think the dream sequence is what really threw this movie off, I mean we have this weird girl getting whipped by a guy, then a strange strip tease and then a horrific rape scene. I don't think I would want to know Ed Wood if he did acid because I wonder what he was on when he was writing this script.Bela Lugosi is used as a narrator and almost like a God who pulls the strings of the people in the story. He does a great job with the dialog that he's given and is really frightening with the atmosphere. Watching this movie really brought me a lot closer to Ed Wood and his world. The movie Ed Wood is one of my favorite films of all time but I know a lot of it was fictional so I have to make the judgments on my own with what I think Ed Wood must have really been like. But supposedly this was the movie to watch that he said if you wanted to get to know him to watch Glen or Glenda. I would recommend this movie for those who are curious about Ed Wood or have an open mind to this edgy film.

The majority of the story takes place indoors, and involves only a handful of characters. Deep reds that dominate the color palette of the film only serve to heighten the negative experience of watching this movie, and the uneasiness that ensues continues to nibble on your comfort zone until the film ends. An uneasy feel in a film can be very efficient in driving the audience to disinterest if the filmmaker isn't careful, and that's the case in this film. In some instances Bergman REALLY pushes the boundaries of his audience's tolerance for getting out of their comfort zone, and in this critic's opinion, it's entirely unnecessary. Perhaps if Bergman hadn't made the film so nausea-inducing and filled with drama that failed to advance the plot, he could have more strongly conveyed the theme of appreciation for life and enduring through great suffering. The theme of sibling rivalry plays a big part in this film as well, and though I may be biased due to the fact that for most of my life I was raised an only child (with the exception of when I learned the ups and downs of having a stepbrother my own age), I feel like the petty rivalry between the sisters in the movie only serves to distract from much deeper issues like the nature of suffering and why life is worth living at all.

View on the filmDuring my first viewing of the film,I have to admit that I was very surprise by the excellent mature and patient directing of Hitchcock,which was very different to the style that I had expected,due to seeing spoof versions of famous Hitchcock films,where they made it look as if the camera would find it impossible to stay in one place.Thankfully Hitch is actually the complete opposite,with only using shots of Fergusions Vertigo during moments where the character is at some of his weakest moments.Hitchcock also uses the camera to show the destructive breakdown for each of the characters,With the truly unforgettable dream sequence Hichcock does amazingly well at showing how much damaged Madeleine has done to Scotties mental state,although Hitch shows that Madeleine also has to pay a price,with a very daring ending,that probably most directors even now, would not choose.Whilst I heard a few years ago about the now mis-quoted infamous quote about how Hitchcock through actors should be treated,with this amazing film,I think that it is very easy to actually see that Hitchcock wanted to get the best performances from the stunning cast.With the sadly underrated Kim Novak giving an astonishing performance as Madeleine,who she shows  may be struggling with a personality disorder,which Novak excellently shows to be slowly bubbling over into her life.Although he was much older than her in real life,James Stewart does amazingly well at showing the agonising desire that Scottie has for Madeleine,with all the brilliant scenes that him and Novak both share,being filled with an amazing intensity. Final view on the filmAn amazing classic,that can be watched again and again,thanks to terrific performances and stunning dream-like directing from Hitchcock.

Bergman tackles the inevitable thoughts of human existence. He explores the thoughts of death, isolation, relationships and suffering. They're all negative aspects of humanity, but Bergman doesn't shy away from it. Why not? Those thoughts that we have are inevitable and inherent to everyone. It's a part of human nature.Death is never easy to endure. The movie includes a household of three sisters and their maid. We have Agnes, who is terminally ill and suffers on her bed, and eventually dies midway through the movie. Although her sisters witness Agnes's suffering, they are surprisingly unable to support or communicate with Agnes emotionally. Both characters seem to be disgusted by her illness.Karin is unable to show any sort of emotion and despises human touch. Her relationship with her husband and sisters made me feel uneasy as they were full of tension. One of the most shocking scene to me was when Karin used a piece of broken glass to cut her vagina. Expectedly, she seems to somewhat enjoy the pain while she shocks her husband with it. Although Karin was physically in pain, it was another way of her to outlet her emotions without even expressing them. It hurts, but she is able to feel and metaphorically tell how husband how she feels about him. On the other hand, Maria embraces human touch, however without any aspect of humanism. Although she tries to get Karin to embrace her touch, she eventually stabs her at the back. I found her relationship with Karin interesting as the audience was able to see a complex, manipulative, love-hate type of sibling relationship.In contrast, Anna shares a nurturing relationship with Agnes and supports her throughout the horror she endures. Both characters have endured the most pain throughout the movie, yet they are the most sincere and positive characters. Agnes slowly suffers into the death, while Anna has lost her daughter. This made me feel appreciative of their characters as they had the most humanistic qualities, despite what they've been through (unlike Maria and Karin). A symbolic scene of Anna's dream is shown where Agnes is resurrected, however Anna is the only one that embraces her, whereas her sisters reject her.Bergman's extensive use of the colour red set an intense tone throughout the film. I subconsciously felt as if my inner emotions were being penetrated in association with the colour red. I would have felt differently if yellow was being used instead. His use of close up shots and silences were also effective as I felt a sense of raised emotional intensity. I felt the actors' internalization of thoughts and feelings. The human face was extensively used as if it was the soul. The fact that the movie occurred in the house also evoked a distress feeling of claustrophobia, as if the characters felt trapped. While those moments made the movie depressing to watch, I was also able to get a sense of hope. We are juxtaposed with characters of Anna and Agnes versus Maria and Karin, who all have different outlooks on life. Suffering, isolation and death is inevitable in life. If we have a positive outlook, such aspects won't be as difficult to endure, and we will eventually be thankful. We see this with Agnes and Anna, as they endure the most pain, but are still able to bring love and happiness. This message enforced on me as the movie ends with Agnes's closing line I am so grateful to life and all that has been given to me. We end the movie not only with sad thoughts, but a sense of hope and appreciation for the preciousness of life.

Time of the Gypsies is a film from Yugoslavia that explores the life of a Muslim gypsy named Perhan. Kusturica's portrayal of the Gypsies is as relatable as it gets - the fundamental core of humanism is exposed to the audience. We see the theme of betrayal, morality and tragedy, which are all aspects of life that we, humans, go through.Perhan lives with his close knit family, consisting of his sister Danira, his grandmother Khaditza and his uncle Merdzan. Perhan is praised by his grandmother at first, however he becomes just like Ahmed later on. He begins to enjoy the advantages of stealing and subconsciously loses a part of his moral consciousness to make money. He loses his trust in Azra. He never planned to steal or murder, but feels obliged to in order to prove his self worth. Even at times when he was morally incorrect, I was still able to sympathize to his character. Why? Because we see both the good and bad qualities in him. The downfall of Perhan allowed me to see the flaws in humanity and identify with him.His relationship with his grandmother and sister intrigued me and they seem to serve the purpose of being the centre of his moral consciousness, which was extremely relatable to me. At some point in our lives, we have someone we confine to for moral judgment. His grandmother seems to know what's right and wrong. Unfortunately, the betrayal of Ahmed leads to his tragedy. He murders Ahmed on his wedding, which eventually results to Ahmed's wife shooting him to his death. For me, the most tragic moment was when Perhan's son warned him to not leave the train station - yet he leaves anyway. It made me question his morality. Did Perhan make the wrong choice of killing? Nonetheless, it was done for a reason, and I did not think any less of his humanism.One of the most unique elements in this film to me was its incorporation of magical realism. It was my first time seeing a movie that portrayed magical powers with no fantasy elements, but rather in a simple and natural way. When we see Perhan use his telekinesis power or his grandmother healing others, it feels natural and ordinary. This made the contrasting elements of magic and reality indistinguishable.Through Perhan's experiences, I was able to relate to him as a character. I enjoyed the perspective of the Gypsies shown this film as I was able to associate with them, rather than view them as a societal misconception of a minority group. He represented the Gypsy community with pure humanistic qualities in a way that the audience can't help but empathize. This made the message of the movie universal Kusturica showcased the fundamental human relationships of family, lovers, enemies. He reveals the sacrifices, love, loss, tragedy and mistakes that inevitably occurs within those relationships. Like Renoir said, Everyone has their own reasons.

Time of the Gypsies is a film from Yugoslavia that explores the life of a Muslim gypsy named Perhan. Kusturica's portrayal of the Gypsies is as relatable as it gets - the fundamental core of humanism is exposed to the audience. We see the theme of betrayal, morality and tragedy, which are all aspects of life that we, humans, go through.Perhan lives with his close knit family, consisting of his sister Danira, his grandmother Khaditza and his uncle Merdzan. Perhan is praised by his grandmother at first, however he becomes just like Ahmed later on. He begins to enjoy the advantages of stealing and subconsciously loses a part of his moral consciousness to make money. He loses his trust in Azra. He never planned to steal or murder, but feels obliged to in order to prove his self worth. Even at times when he was morally incorrect, I was still able to sympathize to his character. Why? Because we see both the good and bad qualities in him. The downfall of Perhan allowed me to see the flaws in humanity and identify with him.His relationship with his grandmother and sister intrigued me and they seem to serve the purpose of being the centre of his moral consciousness, which was extremely relatable to me. At some point in our lives, we have someone we confine to for moral judgment. His grandmother seems to know what's right and wrong. Unfortunately, the betrayal of Ahmed leads to his tragedy. He murders Ahmed on his wedding, which eventually results to Ahmed's wife shooting him to his death. For me, the most tragic moment was when Perhan's son warned him to not leave the train station - yet he leaves anyway. It made me question his morality. Did Perhan make the wrong choice of killing? Nonetheless, it was done for a reason, and I did not think any less of his humanism.One of the most unique elements in this film to me was its incorporation of magical realism. It was my first time seeing a movie that portrayed magical powers with no fantasy elements, but rather in a simple and natural way. When we see Perhan use his telekinesis power or his grandmother healing others, it feels natural and ordinary. This made the contrasting elements of magic and reality indistinguishable.Through Perhan's experiences, I was able to relate to him as a character. I enjoyed the perspective of the Gypsies shown this film as I was able to associate with them, rather than view them as a societal misconception of a minority group.

The film deals with the surrounding events of a dying woman, Agnes (played by Harriet Andersson). Her two sisters Karin and Maria (Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullman respectively) are thrown together in their sister's estate at the last dying moments of her terminal illness.Ingmar Bergman made this movie while in an experimental period of his life. He extensively utilizes the color red throughout the film to create a symbolic meaning on many different levels. Perhaps one of the most meaningful interpretations is of blood and how it connects people together. Also the most memorable scene that will stick with you after watching this film involves blood, but in a more objective way.The film centers around four characters, the three sisters and the house maid, Anna (Kari Sylwan), all which seems to be famished for closeness and touch. However, it is only Agnes and Anna that appears to be able to express these feelings and their relationship is a heart-robbing one. In contrast, the relationship between Karin and Maria is very complicated. We get to know that Maria was favored by their mother and this envy stays with her sister all her life. Karin seems to almost interpret her sister's attempts to gain some emotional comfort between them two as something sexual. While Maria is just trying to satisfy both of their starvation for touch. The catharsis of their final confrontation is a mighty powerful one, and masterfully deals with the sometimes so contradictory relationship that exists between two siblings.There is a hint of an underlying tone of skepticism towards religion present. In a scene when Anna prays and in a way thanks the great lord for that he has bereft her of her child, she quickly starts to eat a red apple once she is done praying. This act entails to a somewhat mocking message. Even though she prays to the God she marks that she is not in need of him. Later in the film we see a priest that is strongly questioning the good lord's actions when he prays for a recently deceased, a very powerful scene let me tell you that.Ingmar Bergman does successfully capture in this film a cavalcade of emotions, conflicts, and humanity, which is all over the spectrum. I believe that it would be difficult to find someone that would not be moved, in one way or another, by this masterpiece. This is not one of his more complicated movies, and it is far from a boring one as well. The camera-work from Sven Nykvist that generated an Oscar for Best Cinematography does not steal any of the film's influence, but rather adds to the holistic experience that makes this piece of art excellent.

I easily place it within my top 100 films of all time. The story is very human, and while some reviewers think this picture is a critique of faith, particularly the Catholic Church, I do not agree. Yes colonialism had its problems and was a flawed vehicle for the Gospel, but the Indians came to beautiful faith genuinely. Also the priests had an abiding love for these Indians as people, not as mere numbers to add to their scrolls. Real faith is not something which can be forced. And in the end of the movie the Indians and priests give one of the most compelling and loving scenes of martyrdom I have ever witnessed on film. Yes it is sad how they are cut down, but they gain far more than they lose, and in doing so show that true faith cannot be destroyed. I should state that I'm a Protestant, but I have known priests, and the character Jeremy Irons plays reminds me of several dear priests I've encountered. DeNiro gave probably the best performance of his career in this film, the only other contender would be Deer Hunter. The scene when they reach the top of the mountain and the Indian cuts off the dead weight of the armor (symbolic of the guilt and anguish he'd be carrying over his brother's death) and DeNiro breaks down and expresses sorrow and finally joy it is truly sublime! Ennio Morricone's music beautifully complements the film (both in pacing and detail) and shows his preeminence amongst film composers! I should also comment on the film's lush cinematography. No wonder it won an Oscar for it. You are transported into the heart of the jungle. I recommend this film in the strongest possible terms. Please see it and you will not regret the time spent!

This film was one of the first films I have seen that introduced me to magical realism.Another part of the film that I really enjoyed was when Pehran moved away from his grandmother and left his sister in the hospital to make money. He was fooled by Ahmed and from there, he lives his own lifestyle and slowly climbs to the top of the food chain where then Ahmed appoints him boss. I enjoyed this part of the film because it shows the audience the daily experience and the daily life of Pehran. Pehran was my favorite character throughout this film because I saw how he started off in the beginning of the movie and how he progressed and became the man he did in the end of the film. It showed me what kind of person he became to be and how corrupted he ended up. Overall, this film was interesting and it shows the audience the changes a person can go through within their lives.
