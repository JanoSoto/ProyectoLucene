He has a dream about a black fella called Morpheo who wants him to play a computer game called 'Matrix'.In a nutshell, in order for Neil to play this computer game, he has to jump off a building and fire some guns in real life, before he's allowed to be plugged in to the computer.In the computer world he has a magic coat, which stops bullets and can make him fly. Basically Neil the office worker becomes Neil Matrix and has to fight off some robots in the computer game.But what Neil or Morpheo DON'T know is that the police are after him because of 'Matrix' (not sure why to be honest), but the police are like magic detectives in black suits and they have EXACTLY the same powers as Neil Matrix (and his magic friends).It's very hard to explain because of all the words in the film, but if you like films about magic men in coats playing computer games and getting chased by robots AND the police, then this is not to be missed.But Neil Matrix is the BEST character EVER played Keano Reeves (and that's saying something!!!1!'

This has better special Fx than IV, V and VI and definitely contains the best characters. Ewan McGregor steals the show though with his blazing performance as Obi Wan, as he fights off the empire.This time though the Empire are using robots! OMFG! You get to see the early stages of Darth Vaders childhood as Darth Maul, before he got his space suit. There's even a race through a desert and everything. This is set somewhere in space, so despite some scenes being slightly unbelievable (practically every scene with Natalie Portman) it's definitely a film you'll be talking about for years.Sadly the franchise slips downhill after number III, and you can't help wondering if Ridley Scott made the others just for the money.But who's to complain with a gem like this? 10\/10 Shits all over Star Trek.
