Alien invasions, intergalactic voyages, gruesome future visions, advanced technology.you name it, it's been done. As such, a lot of the older sci-fi films of yesteryear tend to have a much weaker impact when viewed today. THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a case in point. Yes, it's a likable and entertaining film, but it just doesn't have the punch of some of its better contemporaries. This isn't because screenwriter Barre Lyndon, producer George Pal, and director Byron Haskin had to update the HG Wells story (which didn't bother me, as other book-based movies of the time had to make big story changes) in order to keep the budget manageable, but rather that the movie's a little too genteel and occasionally silly.The plot, based on Wells' novel, goes like this Cylindrical asteroids crash-land on Earth (1898 England in the book, 1953 L.A. in the movie), containing murderous aliens from Mars armed with super-hot lasers that destroy everything in sight. Attempts to make peace with these maniacs fail, and the aliens launch a full-scale war on the human race in an attempt to take the planet for themselves. Obviously, updating the book meant the story had to be streamlined, and the film does this very well. The dark side of humanity is nicely explored in a wrenching scene where Gene Barry's character (a scientist in this; a reporter in the book) is beaten and overpowered by a mob when he tries to get to a secret lab in order to plan a way to stop the aliens. Instead he's forced to watch as the mob destroys his truck and equipment. The use of military strategy is good as well, as attempt after attempt to combat the aliens fails. And there's a wonderful nod to the book when the movie makes lengthy mention of how the Martians favor England as a vantage point. (As if that wasn't enough, one of the soldiers knowingly smirks when he talks about England being attacked.great in-joke.) But by far, the best scenes in the movie are the full-scale attack sequences. The first battle between the Martians and the U.S. Army is masterfully done, with nervy scenes of soldiers in flames and glowing disintegrations. The death of the preacher (another nod to the book) is menacingly handled. And the finale, where Barry frantically searches the churches of L.A. for his lover and friends while dodging the laser salvos of the rampaging Martian airships, is thrillingly staged. This exuberant climax trumps the comparatively weak resolution of the Wells book.And really, what more can be said of the Albert Nozaki-designed Martian airships that hasn't been said? With manta-shaped bodies and flexible laser mounts that look like mechanized cobras, these vehicles are a vast improvement over the book's impractical tripods, and the brass-with-green-neon color scheme is great. (The humming sounds they make as they're about to open fire are wonderfully ominous.) And the FX work achieved with them is excellent. Except for a couple of early scenes, the wires on the ships are nicely hidden by smoke and fog, and the force-fields are done splendidly. By far, these ships are the real stars of this movie.So what keeps this film from being more than just pleasant entertainment? Well, the whole farmhouse scene (another nod to the book) is pretty weak. The alien probes look like that light-up Simon toy on a big cable. Even weirder, the Martians have those probes for their faces (are they supposed to be cyborgs?). And when the lone Martian touches Ann Robinson's shoulder.he just stands there and does absolutely nothing, giving Barry the chance to whale on him with an axe. (This is an alien invader? I thought the Martians were supposed to be totally ruthless!) The square dance scene is a bit much (where did they get those period outfits, and shouldn't there be something much more happening going on in L.A.?). Robinson's character is way too much of a screaming stereotype. There's a lot of overripe '50s dialogue (the exchanges between Barry and Robinson). And the opening credits suck. There was WWI! Then came WWII! Now comes the war of the worlds! (Camp alert!) And the flashing stencil font was really unimpressive. Even in 1953, they could have done a better job. (Why didn't they use Cedric Hardwicke's narration as the prologue over a starfield?) And while Leith Stevens' score is very good overall, the theme music sounds more appropriate to a jungle adventure than a sci-fi apocalypse. But above all else, this film has a real been there, done that vibe to it. If you've seen other sci-fi movies before seeing this one, you've already seen it all. This movie could have used less corn and more grit, because it can't maintain the threatening atmosphere of its better sequences. It is, after all, a war movie, and could have been done with more punch and verve. It has fine set-pieces and some truly menacing moments, but the whole doesn't quite coalesce into a great film.This isn't to say THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a bad film. It's perfectly decent and watchable fare, and I'll gladly watch it again. But it isn't up to the level of, say, FORBIDDEN PLANET or THE INVISIBLE MAN, and its camp tendencies hamper its strongest attributes. Hopefully the proposed Tom Cruise\/Steven Spielberg adaptation will bring the proper grit to the story. (Oh, and setting the new movie in 1898 England would be ideal, too.)

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"25 January 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  In the past 30 years of sci-fi cinema, modern audiences have pretty much seen it all. Alien invasions, intergalactic voyages, gruesome future visions, advanced technology.you name it, it's been done. As such, a lot of the older sci-fi films of yesteryear tend to have a much weaker impact when viewed today. THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a case in point. Yes, it's a likable and entertaining film, but it just doesn't have the punch of some of its better contemporaries. This isn't because screenwriter Barre Lyndon, producer George Pal, and director Byron Haskin had to update the HG Wells story (which didn't bother me, as other book-based movies of the time had to make big story changes) in order to keep the budget manageable, but rather that the movie's a little too genteel and occasionally silly.The plot, based on Wells' novel, goes like this Cylindrical asteroids crash-land on Earth (1898 England in the book, 1953 L.A. in the movie), containing murderous aliens from Mars armed with super-hot lasers that destroy everything in sight. Attempts to make peace with these maniacs fail, and the aliens launch a full-scale war on the human race in an attempt to take the planet for themselves. Obviously, updating the book meant the story had to be streamlined, and the film does this very well. The dark side of humanity is nicely explored in a wrenching scene where Gene Barry's character (a scientist in this; a reporter in the book) is beaten and overpowered by a mob when he tries to get to a secret lab in order to plan a way to stop the aliens. Instead he's forced to watch as the mob destroys his truck and equipment. The use of military strategy is good as well, as attempt after attempt to combat the aliens fails. And there's a wonderful nod to the book when the movie makes lengthy mention of how the Martians favor England as a vantage point. (As if that wasn't enough, one of the soldiers knowingly smirks when he talks about England being attacked.great in-joke.) But by far, the best scenes in the movie are the full-scale attack sequences. The first battle between the Martians and the U.S. Army is masterfully done, with nervy scenes of soldiers in flames and glowing disintegrations. The death of the preacher (another nod to the book) is menacingly handled. And the finale, where Barry frantically searches the churches of L.A. for his lover and friends while dodging the laser salvos of the rampaging Martian airships, is thrillingly staged. This exuberant climax trumps the comparatively weak resolution of the Wells book.And really, what more can be said of the Albert Nozaki-designed Martian airships that hasn't been said? With manta-shaped bodies and flexible laser mounts that look like mechanized cobras, these vehicles are a vast improvement over the book's impractical tripods, and the brass-with-green-neon color scheme is great. (The humming sounds they make as they're about to open fire are wonderfully ominous.) And the FX work achieved with them is excellent. Except for a couple of early scenes, the wires on the ships are nicely hidden by smoke and fog, and the force-fields are done splendidly. By far, these ships are the real stars of this movie.So what keeps this film from being more than just pleasant entertainment? Well, the whole farmhouse scene (another nod to the book) is pretty weak. The alien probes look like that light-up Simon toy on a big cable. Even weirder, the Martians have those probes for their faces (are they supposed to be cyborgs?). And when the lone Martian touches Ann Robinson's shoulder.he just stands there and does absolutely nothing, giving Barry the chance to whale on him with an axe. (This is an alien invader? I thought the Martians were supposed to be totally ruthless!) The square dance scene is a bit much (where did they get those period outfits, and shouldn't there be something much more happening going on in L.A.?). Robinson's character is way too much of a screaming stereotype. There's a lot of overripe '50s dialogue (the exchanges between Barry and Robinson). And the opening credits suck. There was WWI! Then came WWII! Now comes the war of the worlds! (Camp alert!) And the flashing stencil font was really unimpressive. Even in 1953, they could have done a better job.

This was teh first Besson film I had seen at this point, and suffice to say, it is his best (Leon, and Le Grande Bleu comming in tied for second).Most stunning though is the plot. At first glance the plot seems like an excuse to have tons of actions scenes, but it's not that way at all. this is a love story, not an action film. But still, it's more then that. It's funny, it's got great one liners (Willis steals the show here), the timming is beyond quesiton some of the best I've ever seen (you'll ahve to see for yourself what I'm talking about).

Serleena's effects were annoyingly bad.This movie takes forever to get going, and when it does, it feels like more of the same, just regurgitated.When I'm done here, I'm going to go put a review down for the original, which I've seen many times, and will give an 8 out of 10 to. It's a shame that at 88 minutes (!), Men in Black II seems too long.  And I can't BELIEVE this movie made around $200 million in the U.S.!   Hollywood, Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones and Barry Sonnenfeld are laughing all the way to the bank.  We poor suckers...

Unfortunately, the makers of Titan A.E. didn't go far enough when developing their mature animated epic. I enjoyed Titan A.E. mind you (I own the DVD), but it to often got stuck in a rut of a story that's been done ten times over. Sadly, most of the supporting characters are stock and pretty predictable. Not even 20 minutes into the film, I had already figured out who was going to double cross who, and what the final outcome of the story would be.The script and music are juvenile.   the secret discovery is somewhat unbelievable.   The action scenes missed something, I don't know what it was, but they were simply not very interesting.The Drej. OK, they are bad, and blew up the planet. But exactly what are they afraid of? Several references to the Drej fearing what humanity could become.  There is no indication of what this fear is. Did the Drej think humanity bred too much and would overwhelm the universe? Would humanity evolve into energy beings and threaten the Drej? How come no one else seems to be threatened by humanity? And do the Drej blow up other planets because they fear something? If it sounds like I'm being to harsh on Titan A.E. (especially after I stated I liked and own the movie), it's only because I haven't gotten to the positive parts of the movie, which outweigh the negative. FACT Titan AE is one of the few sci-fi films that does not bore us to death with futuristic technobabble. It instead focuses on keeping the audience entertained with every scene rather than make them scratch their heads thinking what the heck is a graviton deflector pulse? This movie keeps it real, and at the same time, maintains a fantasy element. FACT Titan AE is an animated film without songs or talking cartoon animals. It is a movie that full grown adults can go see minus their kids without feeling out-of-place. Even better is that you can go see it with your kids because they'll enjoy it just aswell.. FACT The animation in this movie is ground breaking. Don Bluth and Gary Goldman mix traditional hand-drawn art with background computer animation to create an immersive environment that really pulls the audience into the world.   The space vistas are colorful, interesting and just plain gorgeous. The interactions between Cale and Akima (Drew Barrymore) are good, and the film moves along quickly. I also liked how the Drej remained mysterious and spoke in their own language. As I said at the beginning, Titan A.E. is an animated film geared towards those who are looking for something a little less traditional, and there are numerous scenes that point out that that attempt was made. The one memorable sequence is a game of cat-and-mouse played out in a field of giant, free-floating ice shards. Also  I cant see the beginning of this movie enough... When planet earth gets blown up, it literally is spectacular!! This one scene just about makes the movie. This is what the whole film should've been. FINAL FACT One of my good friends describes Titan AE as the most beautiful movie ever made. In a way, it's true.

Yeah it was a movie aimed at teens but this movie was much deeper than a teen movie. In most teen movies the main couple has a fight, makes up, and kiss right before the credits start to roll. However in this movie the couple, Lloyd and Diane, actually break up and they both emotionally almost break down. You see ALL the aspects of their relationship The initiation, the big first date, the sex, and all the other BS that they have to fight through before they really start to be a couple. That's the great thing about this movie, the depth. The thing I did notice about this movie is that it suckers its viewers. You THINK that you are seeing the average guy getting the girl of his dreams but in all actuality Lloyd isn't an average guy. He kickboxes, he is very loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about (Diane, his sister's kid, Corey), he is very selfless. He drove that guy around the city of Seattle all night just to drive him home safely. He visited Diane's father in jail even though he knew the dad hated him. Lloyd was a really good guy, a great guy, but he didn't believe it and Cameron Crowe wrote the Lloyd character so that we wouldn't get that right away and John Cusack executed the part so well.

Yeah it was a movie aimed at teens but this movie was much deeper than a teen movie. In most teen movies the main couple has a fight, makes up, and kiss right before the credits start to roll. However in this movie the couple, Lloyd and Diane, actually break up and they both emotionally almost break down. You see ALL the aspects of their relationship The initiation, the big first date, the sex, and all the other BS that they have to fight through before they really start to be a couple. That's the great thing about this movie, the depth. The thing I did notice about this movie is that it suckers its viewers. You THINK that you are seeing the average guy getting the girl of his dreams but in all actuality Lloyd isn't an average guy. He kickboxes, he is very loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about (Diane, his sister's kid, Corey), he is very selfless. He drove that guy around the city of Seattle all night just to drive him home safely. He visited Diane's father in jail even though he knew the dad hated him. Lloyd was a really good guy, a great guy, but he didn't believe it and Cameron Crowe wrote the Lloyd character so that we wouldn't get that right away and John Cusack executed the part so well. Cusack is awesome. Enough said about that. Another commenter said that they didn't enjoy the movie because of its lack of humor. Hello? This movie was supposed to be serious. It's a romantic comedy with more emphasis on the romance element. Case in point The boombox serenade with In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel, NOT PHIL COLLINS. That scene was the most brilliant thing I've seen in movies. I tip my glass to Cameron Crowe for coming up with that. A great thing about watching this movie on DVD is that you can still see the 80's quality video which shows that this movie is timeless seeing that all of the people I lent my copy to related to this movie or REALLY enjoyed.

I throughly enjoyed the writing of Anderson and Wilson (AGAIN!) and besides, who does this quirky subtle humor any better these days than Owen Wilson??  The film was as well acted as it was written and I must say for a first time effort from Wilson and Anderson I was very impressed.

I mean thousands will watch Luke Wilson in Blue Streak but I can't find 3 people who have seen him in this movie???

To say the least, I came away hating anything even slightly hobbit-related (notably because Frodo Baggins lost his finger-not something one takes well as a kid), so when Peter Jackson set out to adapt THE LORD OF THE RINGS into a film trilogy, I couldn't have been less interested. Then my family saw THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and enjoyed it, so I decided to give Tolkien one last try.I'm glad I did, because Jackson produced an entertaining, energetic movie (and an even better sequel) that wiped my bad cartoon memories away. I got a charge out of the sheer epic scope of the film, the lovely New Zealand landscapes, the outstanding production designs, lavish costumes, splendid makeup, colorful characters, and (of course) some great acting. Ian McKellan and the magnetic Viggo Mortensen carried this film as the wizard Gandalf and the exiled king Aragorn, respectively. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin were terrific as the hobbits Frodo and Samwise. Christopher Lee, as the corrupt Saruman, was at his evil best. Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving were excellent as Galadriel and Elrond. Orlando Bloom doesn't say much as the elfin archer Legolas, but his attitude, energy, and intensity still made him a blast to watch. It's always fun to see John Rhys-Davies, so I was tickled to see him as Gimli the dwarf. It was a huge treat to see Sean Bean, normally typecast as a villain, play a hero as the tortured and conflicted Boramir. (Somebody give this guy more heroic roles, please! He's got the chops for it!) Even Liv Tyler delivered a gritty, commanding performance as Aragorn's lover Arwen, especially when she pulled a sword on the ring-wraiths and dared them to attack her. (How often does Tyler EVER display such authority as an actress? This was a major victory on Jackson's part.) But best of all was Howard Shore's lavish, operatic score. I'm actually glad they didn't get someone like John Williams (who I like) to do the film; Williams' style is just too distinctive and would have been distracting. Shore's music fits the film like a glove.Having seen a lot of old movies that made big changes from the books they were based on, the liberties Jackson and his writing partners made aren't a problem for me. (It also helps that I haven't read the books, and am viewing the movies from a fresh perspective.) As many have pointed out, an exact translation of the book would either be impossible or would result in an overlong and boring movie that would alienate too many viewers. Besides, even the most faithful book-to-film translations have to make some compromises in order to adapt the material effectively (Richard Donner's SUPERMAN, anyone?). Some sections of the book had to be cut or reconceived in order for the story to translate to film. And like it or not, Aragorn's romance with Arwen (which is very nicely done on film) would not have made a lick of sense on screen unless Arwen's role was expanded and built up. Sorry, Tolkien nit-pickers, but you can rant about how you have to wait for a TRUE adaptation until you're blue in the face. You just want a movie that's nothing but a verbatim, word-for-word copy of what's on the page, and that simply is not a realistic or even financially viable option. Keep your selfishness at the door and stop giving Jackson grief for TRYING to please you and an audience of newcomers at the same time. He wouldn't have made these movies if he wasn't a fan of the books.That said, I don't think this is the greatest movie ever made, partly because I have my own favorite films, but mostly because this movie is still too new to make such a call. It needs to have more time behind it before we can judge how it'll hold up. And to be honest, the film's not flawless. The pacing's somewhat erratic, Billy Boyd plays Pippin like a crazed Lucky Charms leprechaun on acid, some of the dialogue is stilted at times, the editing on the fight scenes is sometimes too chaotic, and the shot near the end where Legolas just stands still and shoots arrows at onrushing orcs is mighty weak. (They could at least have had him moving around a bit..) But for all of that, the movie's a lot of fun to watch, and it certainly stands a chance of having the sort of timeless appeal enjoyed by the STAR WARS series.That, and it got me to enjoy something I'd previously hated. No small feat. That said, I'm dreading THE RETURN OF THE KING, largely because of the aforementioned finger loss. Hopefully Jackson will handle that scene in a way that isn't too gross? (A small request to the ladies While I am glad to see Orlando Bloom achieving breakout superstardom from these films, I feel Viggo Mortensen is getting unfairly overlooked. Please, give the guy his due, won't you?)
