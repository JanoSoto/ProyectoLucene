It's the least talked about films of Kubrick's resume, but should in fact be one of the most discussed for its sheer beauty and brilliance. Kubrick decided to adapt the 1844 fictional book called 'The Luck of Barry Lyndon' by William Makepeace Thackeray and the results were astounding. Not only did Kubrick's vision win critic and audience's praises, but it also won four Oscars and might be Kubrick's best looking film in his collection of work, which is quite the feat, considering every single one of his films is visually stunning.Hell, many critics and outlets have deemed 'Barry Lyndon' one of the greatest films ever made, and they wouldn't be far off the mark with that statement. But why does this film get the shaft from debates and film geeks like ourselves, spending hours discussing. Maybe it's perhaps the slow burn of this very long film, instead of Kubrick giving us a wild and adventurous tale of one man. Or maybe it's the fact that our main protagonist, Barry isn't such a great man from start to finish, thus disconnecting us with someone to relate to, not mater the time period. But I think that is one of the points here.Kubrick not only wanted to make a film that was similar to walking into one of the greatest art galleries of the world and spending hours looking at the gorgeous paintings, but also show us an objective look at a man's life and how he conducted himself in his own selfish ways, which leads Kubrick to hypnotize us for a couple of hours before smacking us in the face. It's quite a brilliant move on Kubrick's part. Told in two acts, 'Barry Lyndon' starts out with Barry's father being killed in a duel in Ireland. At this time he known as Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neil). After the death of this father, Barry falls in love with his cousin and makes several advances towards her, although she never reciprocates, because she loves the English military Captain.This angers the bratty and rude Barry and with his idiotic reaction to this, he is forced to flee his home and with no money and nowhere to go, he enlists in the British Army where he is shipped into the Seven Years' War. You'd think Barry would mature or think things through, but he doesn't and flees his post and regimen and ends up forced to join the Prussian army now. After the war, Barry is still a jerk and to make money, ends up becoming a cheating gambler with wealthy players. If his opponents give him grief or don't pay, he duels. Not exactly the best life.He soon has an epiphany and no longer wants to live a poor life of gambling, cheating, and stealing, therefor he decides to marry a rich woman so that he can live off her dime. He accomplishes this with marrying a very wealthy countess (Marisa Berenson). It's not too long that the countess realizes what kind of person Barry really is, who has now taken on her last name Lyndon, hence 'Barry Lyndon'. Barry openly cheats, steals, and does not love his wife, but only uses her for her money where he lives a life of debauchery for his selfish needs. The only person who seems to want to speak up or do something about Barry is the countess' son from her first marriage.And now we see all these issues and harm that Barry has caused come full circle as it weighs him down and causes him great humiliation, and rightfully so. What he has tried so hard to do, which is to clim the social ladder and keep his pockets full of money, suddenly come crashing down with his stupidity and childish actions. And the second half of the film focuses on Barry trying to confront these problems. This is not a redeeming story by any means as Barry never wants to better himself, but would rather keep up his shameful shenanigans for his own personal glory and wealth, which is coming to a stop quickly.Kubrick's vision for 'Barry Lyndon' is one of the most beautiful pieces of art and cinema out there. Each frame of the film could be paused, printed out, and hung up on your wall. It's that amazing. The use of natural light and classical music fully immerses you into this old world, and with award winning performances by everyone in the film, it's no doubt that Kubrick has concocted yet another masterpiece for himself and for us to enjoy and talk about. It's one of those films, like most of Kubrick's movies where if it is on television, you can't help but watch the whole thing all the way through. It's a film where you'll notice something different each time and take away something new with each viewing, which is something that doesn't come along too often.

Rewatching this now, I certainly think its the classic but by no means is it the best. There are plot holes in this movie that an aeroplane with Tom Cruise strapped to the side could fly through.Brian DePalma has a great style of directing this film. If I ranked the top 10 Mission Impossible franchise's best scenes, I think over half would be in this movie. Its tastefully understated in many places - not too over the top, and so much the better for it. No major gun battles in this film.Case in point, the film's iconic scene in the vault. Its so quiet the film could almost be a parody of 2001 A Space Odyssey. The cinematography as Cruise is lowered into the vault, and Rhames whispering hoarsely and nervously sets the mood perfectly. I almost died three times watching this scene - things as simple as a rat, a bead of sweat, and someone taking a pill could create so much adrenalin-fueled stress. DePalma moves all of his pieces skilfully into position to create maximum impact. I also give kudos to DePalma casting Academy Award nominee Kristen Scott Thomas and teen hearthrob Emilio Estevez in roles that were quickly killed off. The problem with movies these days is top billing of major stars is usually enough to spoil a movie - boy, I wonder if Samuel L. Jackson is going to die in Captain America 2. Here, killing off Thomas and Estevez made second billed Voight's perishing believable - and his return later in the movie more shocking.I found Tom Cruise solid in this movie - he's not the best part of it like he is in other films, but he's a solid anchor for the rest of the cast. Jon Voight is solid where the screenplay lets him be - see one scene where Phelps turns to face Hunt and approaches him like a zombie (with Hunt appropriately freaking out) only for him to give a racking cough. The cough breaks the tension and confirms that he's alive. I loved that scene a lot. Ving Rhames, Vanessa Redgrave and surprisingly Henry Czerny steal every scene they are in, with the screenplays well written dialogue dripping from their lips with sly charisma. I could hear that trio talk to each other all day.However, Mission Impossible falls apart on its story, which has chunks carved out with wanton abandon. Jim Phelps guns down his wife not two minutes after we the audience learn that she was his partner in crime all along. Why? Because Ethan (acting of his own accord) revealed Jim's presence and she dared to speak? Notes say that a love triangle was cut out of this movie (which makes sense considering another awkwardly placed scene where Claire comes onto Ethan with no set up or payoff). DePalma should have probably realised the climax made no sense without it. Other plot holes - its never fully explained why they have to go into the vault whilst Donloe is out of the room. Wouldn't it be easier to land on him and neutralise him, then take your time without worrying about heat, sound or pressure? - How did Ethan so quickly put together that Phelps was the villain? If they were supposedly so close why on earth was he so suspicious when Phelps fingered Kittridge? - How on earth did Ethan contact Max? Is there some magical email server where a domain name is whatever you want it to be? - What on earth did Kittridge mean when he suggested that he and Max would work out a compromise? I thought Max was the most wanted?Mission Impossible is largely messy, but if you don't concentrate too hard and just soak up some gloriously directed and wonderfully tense moments, you'll have a great time.

If they were supposedly so close why on earth was he so suspicious when Phelps fingered Kittridge? - How on earth did Ethan contact Max? Is there some magical email server where a domain name is whatever you want it to be? - What on earth did Kittridge mean when he suggested that he and Max would work out a compromise? I thought Max was the most wanted?Mission Impossible is largely messy, but if you don't concentrate too hard and just soak up some gloriously directed and wonderfully tense moments, you'll have a great time.

This also happens to be the first Hitchcock film I ever saw. From what I can remember I thought it was fine, but nothing really spectacular. Now having seen it for the second time, with a lot more film-watching under my belt, I feel like I appreciate it more for what it is, what it meant to cinema going forward, and as a part of Hitchcock's oeuvre. Like all of Hitchcock's films, it takes a simple premise, in this case a socialite who follows a potential boyfriend to his family's small hometown, and while there birds start attacking. On the surface, and for most of the people in the audience, this is probably enough and Hitchcock would probably have agreed. However, there is more to the film than the innovative score and still-impressive visual effects. THE BIRDS also works as a metaphor for the (apparently) rising violence in modern society. Along the way, a few themes are recycled from previous efforts such as SABOTEUR and PSYCHO, but the film I feel is the closest kin would be SHADOW OF A DOUBT. In that film, you have menace coming to a small town in the form of a person, and everything turns out alright in the end. Here, we see menace come to a small town again, but something even more innocent on the surface and more pervasive; and, in a rather pessimistic turn, the ending is left ambiguous. I'm not sure if Hitchcock intended the film to be read this way, but in a world where people are afraid of getting shot when out at the theater or, in a more abstract sense, being the victims of terror attacks, THE BIRDS couldn't be more thematically relevant today, perhaps even more so than when it first came out. And really, that's the beauty of Hitchcock. He was able to tap into the human psyche and fear in a way that few others can (or could). From a technical perspective, the film perhaps doesn't hold up as well, but you can hardly hold that against it. Sure, the visual effects aren't as believable as some modern CGI, but they're still rather effective. Yes, Hitchcock's reliance on rear projection can be distracting at times, but that's a feature of his work I've begrudgingly come to accept. What isn't so forgivable is the downgrade in acting talent from his previous pictures. Tippi Hedren is serviceable as Melanie Daniels, and does get a nice character arc, but she's no Grace Kelly or Kim Novak. Rod Taylor (Mitch) is a handsome face, and not a whole lot more; and hopefully I never have to see the child actress who plays his sister Cathy in anything else. By contrast, Jessica Tandy did well in her supporting role as Mitch's mother. What was most impressive to me was the experimental score (supervised by Bernard Herrmann) that was used in lieu of traditional orchestration. Often, some of my favorite moments in other Hitchcock films have been ones with little to no music, and the effect here of having a mixture of simulated and real bird sounds was chilling at times. There was also more ominous moments, like the well-known sequence that shows a children's jungle gym completely overtaken by a murder of crows and, of course, a literal bird's eye view of an explosion that shows the birds moving in for the kill. Overall, I can comfortably say that I liked this film a lot more on second viewing and it definitely ranks up with Hitchcock's best.

It was Oscar-nominated, runs for 6 minutes and the music in it also has a touch of Asian to it like his most famous work, even if this short film here really has no Asian background unless it's criticism against the working system there. Anyway, this looks somewhat futuristic as we watch a character who looks as depressing as depressed when he is off to his job just like every day. He gets pushed around by his superiors and it seems he is pretty unhappy with the situation. One day, he makes a great invention and turns into one of these superiors himself. But that rise comes with a cost. I have to say the animation was okay and the contrast between the real world and what we saw through these glasses was impressive. Yet it is too much of a generalization in my opinion that the demise in terms of character always comes with getting a better position in your company. All in all, I wished this could have been better. Osborne certainly has the talent for more than what he came up with here. The again, he still only was in his 20s and obviously improving.

Instead, this is more of an episodic film, based on a true story that is more melodramatic in nature with elaborate character development and a big glaring message about industry vs nature. Director John Boorman ('Deliverance', 'Hope and Glory', 'The Exorcist II') chose to film 'The Emerald Forest' on location in the Amazon rainforest, which gives us a beautiful glimpse at the native people, the wildlife, and its surroundings. This is one of Boorman's more direct stories he has put on film and the result is a satisfying look at what parents would do for their children.The first segment of 'The Emerald Forest' has us meeting a chief engineer named Bill (Powers Boothe), who is in the Amazon rainforest with his wife Jean (Meg Foster) and their two very young children. Bill is in charge of overseeing the construction of a giant dam that will restrict the flow of water to parts of the rainforest, which will flatten the land for future industrial and commercial buildings to be constructed. Boorman clearly shows which side he is on as he delicately shows us the beauty and wonder of the trees and animals, whereas the big bad city people are using their big tractors and fire to destroy the beautiful land.Bill and Jean's young son is stolen by an indigenous tribe located in the heart of the forest known as 'The Invisible People', which causes despair for the family. We cut to ten years later where Bill and Jean are still living in Brazil where the dam is almost fully built. They are still trying to repair their broken lives without their son through work and charity. Bill walks with a journalist through the forest and comes across his now grown boy (Charley Boorman) after ten years. and is a contributing member of this new tribe and about to go through some big rituals into full fledged manhood. Bill soon realizes that what was once his son, now belongs to this primitive tribe.The film switches gears and puts this reconnection on the back burner and focuses on another tribe, which is a much more violent people with more advanced weapons than the usual spears and rocks, known as the 'Fierce People', who are about to wage war on the peaceful 'Invisible People'. Meanwhile, the damn construction is nearing completion and the entire group of tribes have to keep moving further deep into the forest to avoid being killed or taken by authorities. And now Bill must make a big decision. Does he help his lost son and his tribe stand up and fight the bad guys and stop the dam, or does he move on, keeping his life's work in tact. It's a pretty powerful story.But Boorman doesn't focus very much on the reconnection or kidnapping of Bill's son, which in my opinion was a very vital and integral part of the story. Not much time is given to the initial kidnapping and quickly fast forwards ten years into the future. And when the reconnection happens between father and son, it should have been a bigger moment, but Boorman focuses on the nature vs industry aspect right away with the construction of the dam and the rival tribes. Then, the last climactic few scenes of the film is a straight up revenge flick where Bill and his son come to respect each other's decision to move on with their separate lives.Both Boothe and Foster turn in great performances as parents who are coping with the lost of one of their kids. Their anger and depression truly shows in their faces and body language throughout. 'The Emerald Forest' is a solid entry into the 80s action adventure category that stands on its own with its originality, despite the lack of hardcore action.

Not only that, but it has been remade over and over again, with audiences still loving it. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of those audience members who loves 'Lolita', both the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and Stanley Kubrick's 1962 version of that novel. Hell, I even own one of the original French movie posters of the film, which is displayed in my house. But to make a film back in the early 60s with such a controversial taboo subject as 'Lolita' has, somebody somewhere had to make a lot of changes to get past the MPAA.Before 1962, Kubrick had already made a name for himself in film, with movies like 'The Killing', 'Paths of Glory', 'Fear and Desire', and 'Spartacus'. But 'Lolita' is usually the first film from Kubrick to appear in the never-ending box sets since the first one came out on DVD more than fifteen years ago. The main reason for this is that this is where Kubrick started to become bigger than life and able to take total creative control of his films. Something that Kubrick was a stickler about and usually turned out that his adaptation of whatever novel he was making, turned out better than the book itself. And that is something very rare.But with 1962's 'Lolita', Kubrick still had to fight and curve around studio execs, actors, and producers to get this movie made, because of the intense subject matter. Kubrick went on to say that if he had to do it over, he probably wouldn't have made the film since he had to constantly jump over obstacles and change his vision to make the censors and executives happy. The result is surprisingly still an excellent film, but is far different from Nabokov's novel from 1955. Kubrick even had to change actors, because the actors he had asked were too scared to take on the roles, because of the controversial subject, which was basically pedophilia.So Kubrick had to re-work and re-write the script, which is much more comical than the book, but left the sexual innuendos and sex scenes to the viewer's minds and thoughts, rather than show anything remotely of the sorts. Needless to say, Kubrick was very cautious with making 'Lolita'. The film starts out with the end of the movie as we see a man kill another man in cold blood. We flash back several years before this incident where we meet the killer, who is Professor Humbert Humbert (James Mason) who teaches at the local college. He is looking to take in a vacation before he heads back up to the university for the school year and comes across a woman named Charlotte Haze-Humbert (Shelley Winters), who owns a big house where she rents out rooms.This pushy woman entices Humbert to come stay at the house where he is reluctant to do so until he sees Charlotte's young daughter Dolores or 'Lolita' (Sue Lyon) for short. Humbert immediately falls for the very young Lolita and decides to stay in the house. In Kubrick's film version, we see the Humbert is simply a man in love, but it is a forbidden love since the girl is so young, but in the novel, Humbert has a wide variety of problems, which give way to his creepy and unnatural infatuation with Lolita. A couple of mishaps and accidents happen, leaving Humbert and Lolita together as they travel across country from hotel to hotel where they pose as father- daughter by day and lovers by night. Meanwhile, someone keeps popping up wherever they go, usually in different disguises.This person is Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers), who usually throws a nail into Humbert's plans for Lolita. But this all builds and shows us what led Humbert, a man of questionable morals, but respected by everyone to kill a man. Kubrick, in order to appease the execs and producers, as well as make an excellent film took away the aspect of Humbert's motives for loving a much younger woman and instead put that focus on Lolita.What is supposed to shock us, never ultimately does, and instead things play out comically with excellent performances by everyone involved. Still, it would have been interesting to see if Kubrick were to make this in the late 70s or 80s, if it would have been a much different and more disturbing picture than it was back in 1962.

By this point Universal began churning out horror flicks as programmers with shorter running times and an emphasis on making a quick buck. As a result you hear the same music over and over, view the same sets repeatedly, and witness stock footage from previous films to pad the running time. And I can never get enough of it!Having grown up on these fright films I enjoy the nostalgia every time I re-watch one. This particular film was sort of a Holy Grail because it was the least seen of the Frankenstein series so I suppose I have a particular fondness for it. It was made immediately after The Wolf Man and contains many of the cast members from that film Bela Lugosi, Ralph Bellamy, Evelyn Ankers, and of course Lon Chaney, Jr. The story is nutty and really fools with the continuity of the series. Two town officials who were murdered in the previous film, played by Lionel Belmore and Michael Mark, appear in virtually the same roles. Castle Frankenstein looks completely different and apparently the sulfur pit, which was in a separate building in the previous film, is now in the basement. I could go on but why bother; this is part of the charm these films have. As directed by Erle Kenton the film has many impressive moments. Particularly solid are the shots of the Monster emphasizing his size towering over the little girl, ducking through doorways, and casting his shadow everywhere. Also interesting are many instances of characters playing to the camera as if the movie were in 3D. Plus you get two Frankenstein torch-bearing mobs instead of the usual one.The acting is always the aspect that interests me most. The two top-billed actors, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Bellamy, are very uninteresting to say the least. Bellamy is just plain dull; Patric Knowles would have been a better choice. Hardwicke seems bored throughout. He is monotonous and just plain miserable; never cracks a smile and is completely unconvincing as a driven scientist. Luckily everyone else on hand contributes to the fun. Lionel Atwill, although given little to do, is the real mad scientist here. He underplays and doesn't go off the deep end like in Man Made Monster. As always he commands attention and gives a top performance. Miss Ankers is a joy as she is in any of these genre films. Beautiful and with an ear-piercing scream she adds a touch of class to the proceedings. Lugosi gives one of his best performances as Ygor, somehow surviving being shot in the previous film. He also seems to be missing his gnarled teeth and has a new outfit. Lugosi underplays for the most part and is a brilliant manipulator. And the scene where he blackmails Hardwicke is masterful; he completely wipes the floor with that accomplished actor and owns that sequence. Of course the performance everyone wants to analyze is Chaney as the Monster. He is a mixed bag for sure. His monster doesn't make a sound and doesn't possess any of the pathos Karloff brought to the role. Instead he is just a frighteningly large creature with minimal humanity. The scene with him bursting into Frankenstein's home, stalking, and then murdering Dr. Kettering is truly frightening. But we never feel sorry for him as a misunderstood person. However it is fun to watch Chaney the actor come to life in all the physical scenes; he clearly enjoys mixing it up with the stunt men. Unfortunately for the Frankenstein series this would be the high point in the forties; the subsequent films would go steadily downhill as the Monster gets pushed further into the background. Chaney is easily the best of the post-Karloff monsters. If anyone wishes to pass an entertaining 67 minutes then Ghost of Frankenstein is your ticket.

Then, things seem to be rosy after Barry shows his bravery and gains the trust of Potzdorf. After the war, he is sent to spy on a gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Magee) who also shares the Irish lineage, for whom he double-crosses Potzdorf and becomes his collaborator in the gamble games, eventually Chevalier brings him back to Britain where he woos the affluent Lady Lyndon (Berenson), and divided by an intermission, now starts the second half of his story - where many tragedies is awaiting for him. A thematic through-line is Barry's single-minded pursuit to be a nobleman, in the first half, his chivalry wins him admiration in the fist combat among soldiers, but in the real war there is no place for nobility, the gallant facade of infantry being used as canon fodder is ludicrous to comprehend, and a tease to the royal formality. So, as an upstart who marries a rich woman whom he barely loves, Barry is not that clever, since he is never cognizant of the simple fact that the snobbish upper class doesn't welcome parvenus, a significant ally should be his wife, if he cares to manifest his devotion and affections. But now his name is Mr. Barry Lyndon, all he needs is a title to secure the wealth for him and their young son Bryan (Morley), yet his philandering predisposition drives Lady Lyndon away and a critical chasm under the roof is between him and Lord Bullingdon (played by Savage and Vitali in different ages), Lady Lyndon's son from a previous marriage, who will bring about his undoing in the future where Barry becomes a miserable failure who eventually falls from the rank of a gentleman.One of the highly acclaimed aspects of this film is the lavish set production and inspiringly beguiling cinematography, the candle-lit scenes in the second half in particular, various tableaux vivants in stunning period costumes, imbues a transcendent beauty which intoxicates Barry and viewers alike, although underneath the finery, lies the stone-hearted defence system of a dying species. Duel is a key element in the film, from the opening one which dispatches Barry's father, to the one with John which kickstarts Barry's wandering adventures until the final one between him and Lord Bullingdon, which engagingly foregrounds Barry's flawed benevolence in sharp contrast with Bullingdon's craven and vengeful nature of an aristocrat. Also, a kind warning to those well-heeded families, don't ever let your young kids ride a horse, this and GONE WITH THE WIND (1939) are two brutal examples.BARRY LYNDON might fall short as a perfect epic because of it casts O'Neal as the lead, at the age of 33, he is mortifying in the opening when he supposes to be no more than a teenager, but thankfully, it transforms smoothly when Barry ages through the journey, but rarely his performance can galvanise the screen in the protracted duration, wanting of charisma debars audience from projecting a certain amount of sympathy to him, which is a dangerous defect for its epic scale. Even more befuddling is Berenson's Lady Lyndon, who only have a few lines altogether and is one-sidedly portrayed as a mistress who has no talent in governing her man, her children and her wealth, suffice to be Kubrick's last nail in the coffin for the doomed royalty. Numerous supporting characters come and go, barely have their scene-stealing moments, bar Leon Vitali's adult Lord Bullingdon, who is brilliant in the duelling part, Murray Melvin as Reverend Runt, whose malicious appearance is the barometer of haughtiness and Marie Kean as Barry's mother, unwittingly eggs him on to his ruin. Another chief accolade should be given to Leonard Rosenman, the music adaptor who won an Oscar for wondrously concatenating Kubrick's favourites classical pieces into the epic length, embellishes the narrative seamlessly and becomes the ballast for a great viewing experience. Winning four Oscars, BARRY LYNDON is notably being the most acknowledged features of Kubrick, but ironically, Kubrick lost all three nominations under his name (BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY). Probably not his best work, but unmistakably, it is an indomitable piece of cinematic wonder, not just for its exquisite etiquette, also an influential fable about breaking the royal orders.

I was onboard and entertained for the movie's first 45 minutes, but then the movie becomes a bit too top-heavy, mired in its anti-war message and the racial tensions. Basically, once Mark Wahlberg is captured, it just sort of slogs. It feels like it's flavored by Apocalypse Now (sure seems as long). There's an uplifting (Hollywood) ending that gives the movie back its step, but between those bookends when the gold's in our main characters' possession, it's not nearly as interesting.I get the feeling this would've been a lot more subversive had I seen it 15 years ago.

The obviously high level of trust and understanding that they share, enable them to cope when things don't go exactly as planned and to improvise well whenever the need arises. The pace and precision of what happens in these opening scenes is impressive and intriguing and sets the tone for everything that follows. Numerous plot twists, double-crosses and humorous moments then add to the fun as the plot becomes increasingly complicated and the gang have to cope with some unexpected challenges.When veteran thief and gang-leader Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) accidentally has his picture captured on a security camera during a high-value jewellery robbery, he knows that the most sensible course of action is to retire immediately and head south on his boat with his much younger wife Fran (Rebecca Pidgeon). He encounters a problem, however, when his fence and financial backer Mickey Bergman (Danny DeVito) opposes the plan because he's already invested a large sum of money in setting up the gang's next job. Bergman isn't willing to make any concessions and withholds the gang's share of the proceeds of the robbery to force them into carrying out the Swiss thing.The Swiss thing turns out to be an extremely dangerous but highly lucrative robbery of a huge shipment of gold from a Swiss cargo plane. To make matters worse, however, the distrustful Bergman stipulates that his nephew Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell) has to go along as one of the gang to ensure that they go ahead with the heist exactly as planned. Silk is young, inexperienced and impulsive and also has designs on Fran. He sees Joe as an old guy who's losing his grip and soon starts to think of how he could get away with both the gold and the girl.Joe feels compelled to go ahead with the gold heist and although he has complete faith in the loyalty and professionalism of his right-hand man Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo) and his diversionary expert Pinky (Ricky Jay), the on-going presence of Jimmy Silk continues to be a source of great concern even after the ambitious heist has been successfully carried out.David Mamet's style of direction is perfect for this material as he brings great coherence and momentum to the intricate plot and his dialogue, as usual, is sharp, witty and quite unique. Some clever quips and brilliant banter illuminate the exchanges between the main characters but the usual formality and stilted nature of Mamet's lines are less apparent in this movie, possibly due to the presence of Gene Hackman. His skillful delivery is so warm and natural that it makes even the most contrived phrases sound quite spontaneous and his interactions with Delroy Lindo are a real highlight. Both actors excel in this movie as do Ricky Jay and Danny DeVito who also make their characters very real.The high quality of the direction, the writing and the acting ensure that a higher-then-average rating is merited but what's probably even more impressive is the way in which Mamet has taken a very simple and familiar plot and developed it into an enjoyable thriller that actually gets better with each repeat viewing. In the case of Heist, once is definitely not enough.
