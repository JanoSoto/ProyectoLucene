[{"date":"26 June 2009","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Fans waited 16 years for this? For shame, George Lucas, for shame. I had embraced the original trilogy as a child and was expecting this film to create that same sense of amazement as the first films did. This movie had its high points, but Jar Jar Binks is often unbearable. Rather, it is Anakin Skywalker I found annoying. He didn't care for him as much as I thought I should for being THE Anakin Skywalker. The Gungans and Jar Jar come off as okay characters, but Jar Jar himself becomes tiring.The whole film seems ruined with this aura of cheeriness and way too much comic relief in my opinion. The plot was well done actually and we have some good actors here, including Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, and Liam Neeson . Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson were both pretty awesome ein the movie, but it was Natalie Portman who was rather stale most of the time. Perhaps the main problem with this one was the lack of any emotional strong points, as seen in the five other films. Things just kind of happen, you know? Lucas probably relied too much on a mystery-type setting to make up the film's lack of any and few emotions, probably as a way to set up the two sequels. As it stands, a bad choice but the film has its redeeming moments. The highlight of this film is definitely the three-way lightsaber duel. Incredibly intense, with John William's score playing along with it, one reason to see the film in itself. Not to mention there's quite a bit to see in this film, which is also a plus, and in the end I still like to watch my DVD of Episode I from time to time.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"26 June 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Episode II may not be entirely perfect, but still, it is a huge improvement compared to the last one. Fans will cheer over the fact that Jar Jar Bink's screen time has been chopped in two, although he does play a major part in a crucial scene concerning the power of the Chancellor. Fans will know this signals the beginning of the Clone Wars, and the end of the Republic. I appreciate the film's darker tone. Anakin is now played by Hayden Christensen, who in my opinion portrayed the more 'sinister' side of Skywalker. Much enjoyed.In this film, Lucas also introduces new characters, like bad-ass Jango Fett and Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. Their performances are extremely well done. The mystery aspect of the film is something that I find adds much to the film and sets up the relationship with the original trilogy. We are also able to see more of Naboo and Coruscant, giving the film that same sense of awe and wonder the first three did. The action, which you do have to wait a bit for, is definitely worth the wait. Once the action starts, it doesn't let up, ending with an incredible lightsaber duel. Some will undoubtedly find Yoda's fight with Dooku laughable, but I find it modestly enjoyable. Despite being less than three feet tall, he truly is the most skilled Jedi Master who has ever lived.John William's does an excellent score, as usual, even providing a romantic theme for the love angle of the story. The problems I had this one, not much, it was just a bit slow at times. While surely not surpassing the originals, Episode II is still a remarkable improvement.
