[{"date":"30 April 2015","score":"","review":" Shrek is a brilliant movie that appeals to EVERY age out there. Shrek has often been made into kids toys and given to kids as presents, while on the other hand is my 70+ year old grandfathers favorite movie ever. The story is about a mean ogre who just wants to be left alone. Shrek does not like the fact that the king has banished all mystical creatures to his swamp. So Shrek becomes friends with simple minded donkey and leaves to talk with the king. The king realizes that this strong ogre is the perfect person to find his princess and save her from the scary dragon. When Shrek does so he falls in love with the princess and needs to find a way to stop her and the kings wedding.I have given this movie a 9 out of 10 because it is hilarious, well written and full of great voice actors including Eddie Murphy. In conclusion this is a great movie and will be shown for years to come. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 April 2015","score":"","review":" Shrek is a brilliant movie that appeals to EVERY age out there.
