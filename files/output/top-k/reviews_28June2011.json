It gave me a real feeling of the Eyes Wide Shut story on how everything was staged, how everything was denoted and how people were discerned in the unfolding of the tale (of course, Kubrick's movie was years after this one).It stars Mia Farrow as Rosemary, who with her spouse Guy (played by John Cassavetes) are investing in an apartment; unbeknown-st to them, the apartment is adjoined to the most peculiar and mystifying of old people; Ruth Gordon plays Minnie Castevet, a rather benevolent and well meaning person, who is the typical all kind and all helpful and attentive neighbours, who out of their kindness, give a sort of longing for distance. Her husband is played by Sidney Blackmer as Roman Castevet. The Castevets are part of a certain group of people; the gut grinding feel to the movie give it a reminiscence of Hammer Movies, with the essence of a Hitchcock Thriller; but all in all, giving a genesis to a new entity of film. My gripe with the movie is that I felt the focal point was actually different from what I had expected; don't get me wrong I thought what my mind presented was not what it was all up to be. And my other gripe is that, like the character, you get frustrated towards the people. But as soon as the plot is ignited, it really does really blast into it. The relationships are laid out in a cliché way as I have explained; however, with that in mind, it is also very ghoulish and you can feel the vividness from it. For example, the satanic silhouette from Theresa (the girl from the beginning's body) is already a real foreshadowing to the theme of the film. That's the power of it &#x96; without the context backing it up &#x96; it feels Satanic and this is one of the horror trademarks that doesn't always execute it with subtlety and with enough suspense, into that fierce territory of being as surprised as the lead character (Mia Farrow). The motif of the pendant is powerful, surprising and enough to capture your attention. However, when you peg people in the movie, it can really put your mood into a spiral essentially transmitting the idea that everybody is in on it.My favourite scene is the dream\/reality of Farrow's intoxication as we're exploring the deep darkness of sexual violence, sexual lust, sexual passion or just all things sexual; it scared me and creeps me out much more then things like The Exorcist (1971) and even The Shining (1980).The SFX is the best thing about the movie; the ambulance, screaming and chanting sounds through the use of music is absolutely liberating in that state of uncertainty about what you're watching and what's being described.The scrolled walls, the landscapes, the god like feel to it, the idea of creating the baby and the conspiracy behind that carriage, not just two, but all or possibly even being submitted to more than just one? Wow. It puts you outside of perceptual and mental ideas, forcing you to psychologically take everything in. Like what babies are used for and whether or not that mythology is true or not....Another thing that is quite annoying though, is the typical denial dynamic used in the movie, when you clearly know that they know. Even with the Baby, as if to try and creep you out, when you know it is alive or when that book is being impugned as nothing more than a fairy tale; however predictable that was, the ideas behind it were still giving you a great sense of being detected at every moment and ceased at every act with no escape.Basically, this movie is a solid movie; it adopts some of the older conventions of movies, but what the movie does unique is that it has a grittier darkness then other movies of its contemporaries and it also diminishes all humour, subjecting you to Polanski's vision and the rituals of another force to compel you to keep watching as if what you're concentrating on is destiny which is a very scary notion.

From Y2K to the End of Days to even more obscure takes, there's just a slew of films that came out around 2000 built around the idea of humanity's time running out. Most of them stink out loud, but Lost Souls may be the worst of the bunch to come out of a major studio. This thing is overwrought, unclear, repetitious and has some of the worst pacing of any movie you'll ever see.To start with, you have to get about 30 minutes into the film before you get any solid idea of what and who it's about. I don't mean there's some mystery keeping the viewer in suspense. I mean you spend the first half hour staring blankly at the screen and wondering Who are these people? Why are they doing that? Okay, why am I looking at this guy now? Is he a reporter or some kind of lawyer? Wait, he's a writer? Now why are we back with those other people? Is he the main character? Is she the main character? What the hell am I watching?Then the middle part of Lost Souls tells you the same thing over and over and over again, getting more and more explicit each time but expecting you to be surprised every time it tells you the same thing. Imagine if Citizen Kane had constantly told the audience the secret of Rosebud, but kept going on as if it was still an unanswered question. That's what the middle of Lost Souls is like, except executed with 1\/1000th the talent and skill.That brings us to the ending and a case of narrative whiplash. The first three-quarters of this film is languidly paced, dawdling along before suddenly going from 0 to stupid in 8.67 seconds. It's as if they started out with a 350 page script and shot the first 80 pages before it occurred to anyone that they were making a 6 hour long movie, then they tried to cram everything everything into just more 30 pages. It goes from feeling like a bad episode of Masterpiece Theatre to a worse episode of Pokemon.What is Lost Souls about? Well, there's this troubled young woman (Winona Ryder) trying to stop this guy (Ben Chaplin) from becoming the wussiest Antichrist in cinema history. The tagline for the movie poster should have been The Omen&#x85;for Dummies. Some stuff happens but there's very little violence, no nudity, only a smattering of bad language and Ryder and Chaplin appear to be engaged in some sort of acting contest to see who can come up with the most different ways of looking forlorn.The only possible value this garbage could have is as more evidence that Winona Ryder is one of the most beautiful women of all time. It's gone amazingly unnoticed because she never became a Julia Roberts-type movie star or sought out constant media attention, but Ryder is truly incredible to look at. Actresses as a profession are more attractive than average, but even most actresses have a beauty peak. With some it's early, with others it's late, but there will generally be a time when an actresses' physical appearance is at its zenith and she doesn't look as good either before or after that period. Ryder's not like that. She hasn't had a beauty peak. She's been at a beauty plateau for over 20 years, starting out as a phenomenally cute young woman and maintaining that level of visual appeal all the way to the point where she's now getting to be almost old enough to play the mother of one of her earlier roles.Unfortunately, as great as Ryder looks, she's not enough on her own to make Lost Souls worth watching. You'd be better off acting out the book of Revelations with finger puppets.

This thing is overwrought, unclear, repetitious and has some of the worst pacing of any movie you'll ever see.To start with, you have to get about 30 minutes into the film before you get any solid idea of what and who it's about. I don't mean there's some mystery keeping the viewer in suspense. I mean you spend the first half hour staring blankly at the screen and wondering Who are these people? Why are they doing that? Okay, why am I looking at this guy now? Is he a reporter or some kind of lawyer? Wait, he's a writer? Now why are we back with those other people? Is he the main character? Is she the main character? What the hell am I watching?Then the middle part of Lost Souls tells you the same thing over and over and over again, getting more and more explicit each time but expecting you to be surprised every time it tells you the same thing. Imagine if Citizen Kane had constantly told the audience the secret of Rosebud, but kept going on as if it was still an unanswered question. That's what the middle of Lost Souls is like, except executed with 1\/1000th the talent and skill.That brings us to the ending and a case of narrative whiplash. The first three-quarters of this film is languidly paced, dawdling along before suddenly going from 0 to stupid in 8.67 seconds. It's as if they started out with a 350 page script and shot the first 80 pages before it occurred to anyone that they were making a 6 hour long movie, then they tried to cram everything everything into just more 30 pages. It goes from feeling like a bad episode of Masterpiece Theatre to a worse episode of Pokemon.What is Lost Souls about? Well, there's this troubled young woman (Winona Ryder) trying to stop this guy (Ben Chaplin) from becoming the wussiest Antichrist in cinema history. The tagline for the movie poster should have been The Omen&#x85;for Dummies. Some stuff happens but there's very little violence, no nudity, only a smattering of bad language and Ryder and Chaplin appear to be engaged in some sort of acting contest to see who can come up with the most different ways of looking forlorn.The only possible value this garbage could have is as more evidence that Winona Ryder is one of the most beautiful women of all time. It's gone amazingly unnoticed because she never became a Julia Roberts-type movie star or sought out constant media attention, but Ryder is truly incredible to look at. Actresses as a profession are more attractive than average, but even most actresses have a beauty peak. With some it's early, with others it's late, but there will generally be a time when an actresses' physical appearance is at its zenith and she doesn't look as good either before or after that period. Ryder's not like that. She hasn't had a beauty peak. She's been at a beauty plateau for over 20 years, starting out as a phenomenally cute young woman and maintaining that level of visual appeal all the way to the point where she's now getting to be almost old enough to play the mother of one of her earlier roles.Unfortunately, as great as Ryder looks, she's not enough on her own to make Lost Souls worth watching. You'd be better off acting out the book of Revelations with finger puppets.

Just watching Falk and Rochester made me smile and laugh. Some people say this film works, others say it doesn't. I think they're both right. It is a rare comedy that is funny every time you watch it; most only work once. I have watched this many times over the years, beginning with seeing it in the theater as a kid. Sometimes when I watch it, I chuckle over every detail of a scene, sometimes laughing out loud. Other times I am just amused. And sometimes I am slightly bored. The question is why -- why does it work sometimes, and not others? I guess you have to be in the right mood. You also need to not look too closely at the plot as a whole, but rather at the absurdity of the individual scenes, and how beautifully they are played by the great comic actors, even the tiny cameos. What It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World is ultimately about is the absurdity of the whole damn crazy human condition, and that we are all fools for taking it so seriously. The movie is saying, the whole world and everyone on it has gone mad, probably including you. This was a common theme back in the Sixties -- A Thousand Clowns, Stop the World, I Want to Get Off, etc. Now the world's a lot crazier, yet we have become more serious, and don't find the mass insanity quite so amusing now that it has become so dangerous and annoying. So, if you can't see the world is nuts, and can't laugh at it, you might have trouble enjoying this film. That's how it all ends -- they all realize they're nuts. And there may be a problem with this edited down version, cut by about a half-hour from the original. A reviewer on Amazon said this took out the context for many of the scenes, leaving mainly the slapstick, which may be why the film doesn't work for some people. Perhaps someone was afraid it would slow things down. But I think change of pace is a good thing for comedy, and more grounding in reality would have strengthened this movie. Perhaps a restored version will be released one day. I wonder how Europeans like this film, vs. Americans? I hear they love Jerry Lewis, and this is a very Jerry Lewis approach to American comedy, which is to make fun of straight-laced American mores. Say, where is Jerry Lewis, anyway? Don't blink. I suspect this is one American movie that foreigners are better able to enjoy than Americans.

She says it's when a woman wakes up in bed with a man after a one night stand and he's so ugly, but you have your arm around him because last night he seemed hot. Desperate, but not wanting to be rude, instead of pulling your arm out from under him you try to chew it off like a trapped coyote. That my friends, is Coyote Ugly.It was much to my surprise that Kevin Smith actually did a rewrite of the film's script at one point. I would imagine if Smith's version was made into the final film that it would be less about the girl's bodies and more about their problems. Instead of so many overhead shots of women dancing on one another, soaked in water, comparing wet t-shirts, I'm sure there would've been more sincere dialog between Violet and her friends. Maybe we would've gotten to know them better. It's all one big maybe. The film centers around Violet (Perabo), an aspiring songwriter trying to make it in the complicated and relentless world of music. She tries to get her demo tape heard, but is always met with reps that blow her off. Violet leaves home and goes to New York to try her look, but realizing she needs to make end's meet, she goes to work at a bar called Coyote Ugly where she will entertain customers by seductively dancing on the bar countertop while pouring drinks and showering her and her fellow employees with water. That's the extent of it.In the meantime, Violet dates a shady guy who she had mistaken for a record exec (Garcia). Let me ask Violet, do you think it's a good idea to date a guy who just tried to pass himself off as a guy who could get you a record deal and doesn't discuss any of his past? Does he seem like the dream guy mothers would want their daughters to date, and could have a good ol' day out with the father? I neglected to mention that the club is run by Lil (Bello). Lil, full name Liliana Lovell, actually runs the real-life Coyote Ugly in New York. Maria Bello was excellent in The Cooler, and does more sure-fire work in this picture. She is still as hilarious as ever, and plays a very strict, yet laidback bartender.Coyote Ugly, even in possession of a decent storyline, is ruined by its own immaturity. There are too many overhead shots of women on the bar countertop that go nowhere and aren't arousing or entertaining at all. I appreciate John Goodman's role as Violet's protective and caring dad, but the scenes with him are far to spread out and far too short to fully enjoy. I imagine if Kevin Smith was responsible for writing the entire screenplay maybe the movie would've been more about the daddy\/daughter relationship rather than the women.The story isn't gripping, but it works for a while. Until the bar comes into play. Then it's down to twelve year olds controlling the camera. Piper Perabo is gorgeous, and is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood today in terms of looks and acting skills. She still hasn't had that breakout role that has taken her career to new heights. Surprisingly, as juvenile as this picture can be, this really didn't jump-start any future projects for her.

I'm not going to elaborate on that -- I'm no film expert, and anyway, that's what professional critics are for. What I really want to talk about is something else, something more about the film's overall narrative structure than about the cinematography or directing or acting.The movie starts out looking like some kind of light satire, having a laugh or two about those womanizing executives or what-have-you. But the story soon begins to take on more dimensions -- romance appears, the satire begins get more serious, dramatic elements are introduced... These new aspects of the story absolutely make the movie what it is and give it the depth it needs to be fully satisfying. That the writers were able to bring all these pieces together while still bringing plenty of comedy to the mix is a true testament to their talent and craftsmanship.But around the middle of the movie, I began worrying about where it was all heading. Basically, my concern was that the writers were going to sacrifice the integrity of the story for the sake of the audience. Baxter is such a sympathetic, likable character that I couldn't help but wanting things to turn out all right for him, and I suspect that many viewers would feel the same way. In a lesser movie, Fran would surely fall in love with Baxter by the end of the film, maybe as soon as when she is recovering from her suicide attempt. Baxter would then be inspired to stand up to his mean old boss, and... you get the picture. Yet aesthetically, that sort of ending would just feel too tidy and predictable for a story as broad as this one. So even though emotionally I wanted Baxter to get the girl, intellectually I began praying that he wouldn't.So, as it turned out, the film ended somewhere in between. The ending to the film was well-handled, but still I found it a little too compact for my liking. If it had ended just one scene earlier, with Fran leaving Sheldrake at the New Year's Eve party, I would've been fine with it. But the last scene in Baxter's apartment felt unnecessary and forced, as though the writers just couldn't stand to end the story without some romantic payoff.

The films themselves are poor, and he is not much better. Leaving Las Vegas is for all the people that believe Nicolas Cage hasn't done a good movie. Seeing this before, but rewatching it for the first time in years I can prove that if Cage is handed the right material he can be a good actor.Cage plays Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic who recently had a crisis in his family. We see a picture of him, his son, and wife. We never exactly know why he is so upset, and the movie characters neglect to ask him any question. It could either be divorce or death. I'm going to assume death since he never hear from the wife or kid. Ben is a screenwriter, and once is alcoholism hits the breaking point, he is fired and moves to Las Vegas.His plan? Drink. Drink nonstop and ask no questions about it. Drink himself to death. He meets a hooker named Sera (Shue) who is run by her abusive pimp Yuri (Sands). If neglecting to bring home a fair amount of money Sera will be cut with a knife on her thighs. Both have their share of troubles, and Ben only seems to be calm when she's around.The film is a tragedy. This is the only role Nic Cage won an Oscar for and he's absolutely brilliant in it. Watching this in 1995, you'd probably never guess he was bound for winners like Drive Angry 3D and Ghost Rider in his future. Elisabeth Shue, who I enjoyed so much in The Trigger Effect, a hated suspense film that has a dark feel to it like this, was amazing as well and deserved the Best Actress win.The score is true Las Vegas jazz.

Seeing this before, but rewatching it for the first time in years I can prove that if Cage is handed the right material he can be a good actor.Cage plays Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic who recently had a crisis in his family. We see a picture of him, his son, and wife. We never exactly know why he is so upset, and the movie characters neglect to ask him any question. It could either be divorce or death. I'm going to assume death since he never hear from the wife or kid. Ben is a screenwriter, and once is alcoholism hits the breaking point, he is fired and moves to Las Vegas.His plan? Drink. Drink nonstop and ask no questions about it. Drink himself to death. He meets a hooker named Sera (Shue) who is run by her abusive pimp Yuri (Sands). If neglecting to bring home a fair amount of money Sera will be cut with a knife on her thighs. Both have their share of troubles, and Ben only seems to be calm when she's around.The film is a tragedy. This is the only role Nic Cage won an Oscar for and he's absolutely brilliant in it. Watching this in 1995, you'd probably never guess he was bound for winners like Drive Angry 3D and Ghost Rider in his future.

We dislike the opening of the film, we dislike the opening of Kaye's film on the basis that it is ugly and frank; we dislike the fact that we are challenged to process not only the apparent ugliness of the sexual content but the Nazi infused props littering the screen, and are forced into calculating which of those leaves the nastier taste. We dislike the fact that, next door in a room of his own, is situated a young boy seemingly forced into possessing a building with such a person complete with such activity going on in such close proximity. We side with the boy, and are somewhat forced against our wishes into sympathising with all of those whom inhabit the house when a group of blank, faceless African-Americans plot outside to sabotage the car on the driveway &#x96; and all of this before the really nasty bit happens.It is to the credit of those behind American History X that they are able to take the project from these beginnings and to do what they do; the film much more than a freak show unfolding in a cesspool of crudity and violence - the film refusing to allow its powerful opening to act as its dramatic high point, instead allowing the transitions it documents to act as its key source of drama, in what is a pleasurable and really rather involving thriller about changing attitudes and the dangers of influence. Those primarily involved in the opening are that of Edward Furlong's Danny, the boy in his room, and that of his older brother Derek, played by Edward Norton. They are siblings of the Vinyard family, the pair of them two Los Angeles based brothers. Danny is a high school student; Derek is something a little different, but they share the pain of their father's death, following the falling foul of a black individual, and maintain ties to their mother who's trying to maintain a new relationship.Danny raises eyebrows at school after doing a school paper that is a riff on Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, something which causes great concern amidst his peers. Elliott Gould's character Murray, Danny's history teacher, is worried of the possibility he may follow down a route similar to that of his brother; the verbal outlining of whom shortly follows as the severity of Norton's character is built up, a speech which documents the man's history to do with formulating a national front along with some other radical thinkers that concludes with the fact he is about to be released from prison following a three year stretch. Despite the severity of Murray's outlining, Norton's Derek later appears somewhat chilled upon release; cool at the fact his younger brother has moved up into some echelons more broadly resembling that of where Derek himself was at a similar age. It is a reaction, and whose general behaviour, goes against prior perceptions; particularly when interacting with his fascist friend of old in Seth (Suplee), whom looks up to Derek and half-expects him, along with the rest of a neo-Nazi front that has formulated, to really lead them to where they want to go.Kaye's film will dart back and forth from some relatively tough sequences motivated by hatred and racism to the current tense of reform. Shot in black and white, and holding very little back, Derek's earlier times of violence and antagonism carry with them a cutting, biting aesthetic; a prominent sense of the content always being on the move sewn into proceedings, whether induced by the man's motivational speeches encouraging hate and anti-social behaviour, shortly before the playing out of such things, or the more visually dramatic sequences such as that of a basketball match between two teams that has some high stakes. Derek's post-incarceration exchanges, shot in colour, but still looking as if drained, although successfully coming across as glorious Technicolour in comparison to the rancid black and white, appear calmer; more laid-back and are not motivated by causality as much. Kaye's compositions during these segments additionally appear to open up a little more, allowing for more room to breath and for those of foreign nationalities, or varying other ethnicities, to share the frame a little more &#x96; when, nearer the end, Danny is escorted to school by his brother, we notice those of an African American or Hmong ilk milling around in the background, as if invited to occupy the film's frame with the two leads as a collective one such is the newfound sense of acceptance.The film's starker sequences indeed carry with them great adrenaline and a sense of the perversely engaging, the aforementioned basketball sequence one of many that additionally includes the trashing of a local store now owned by some Koreans as well as a grotesquely violent act during the opening. In spite of this, the film maintains such an aggressive and pent-up attitude for the sequences in which Derek confronts his past neo-Nazi accomplices; a lesser film made in a lesser fashion might have, purposely or otherwise, done well, in a negative sense, to fetishise such sequences of hate and shoot the gradual inclination toward a newer order in a drabber fashion. Another instance might have seen the content played safe, a film distancing itself from such sequences of bigotry before constructing the demonisation process in a self-important manner threatening to mutate the piece into some kind of lecture. Kaye impressively, purposely or otherwise, blows through the material in an equal on-both-fronts-fashion; maintaining a dogged grip on dramatic proceedings as controversial content is executed and hate at those the lead previously shared times with is unfolded. Regardless, the film is tough but engaging and worth seeing.

I became interested in the work that Peter Jackson did before he embarked on the 'Lord of the Rings' epic trilogy. So, when I can, I'm slowly going through his back catalogue. This is quite an interesting film with some nice ideas and some really great effects (for its day) but it does suffer from a slightly over-complicated plot and being a little too long. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first.Frank Bannister makes a living as a Psychic Investigator. After an accident five years ago, he can see and speak to ghosts. One of his clients is Ray Lynskey, who he had had a run-in with recently. Just before he leaves, after removing some troublesome spirits, he notices a mystical number on Ray's forehead but thinks nothing of it. The next day Ray is dead. His wife, Dr. Lucy Lynskey, asks Frank to communicate with Ray and from this they form a friendship. More people die and it begins to look like Frank is the culprit, but he claims he's innocent. The FBI even get involved in the shape of, the very strange, Milton Dammers. Eventually Frank and Lucy link it back to a serial killer, Johnny Charles Bartlett, who went to the electric chair many years before. Will Frank be able to stop Bartlett before he claims Lucy as his next victim? Well, you can probably guess, but you didn't hear it from me right.As I said at the beginning, this film does suffer from a rather over-complicated plot. The first-rate special effects go some way to making up for this, but not quite. Having said that, it's still quite watchable with some decent performances; chiefly from Michael J. Fox as Frank Bannister and Trini Alvarado as Dr. Lucy Lynskey. Also worthy of note are Peter Dobson as Ray Lynskey, John Astin as The Judge, Jeffrey Combs, who was really off the wall, as Milton Dammers, Dee Wallace as Patricia Ann Bradley and Jake Busey as Johnny Charles Bartlett. Oh, and worthy a special mention, it was nice to see a small cameo from R.

Starring Harry Dean Stanton as Travis Henderson, a man who suffered a nervous breakdown and estranged himself from his family as a result, the film is both a deep character study and an effective family drama in the same time.The movie begins with some beautiful images of the desert, vast and desolate. We are then introduced to Travis (Stanton) a man wandering through the desert for reasons unknown to the viewer. As he enters a bar, he collapses due to dehydration and is taken to a doctor by the bar owner. He is later reunited with his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell), who came from California to his aid and had not seen him for 4 years. We know little about Travis' character and the fact that he initially refuses to speak to anyone only adds up to this mystery. As the story progresses, we slowly find out more about his background, we find out that he has a son named Hunter who is in the care of Walt and his wife, Ann (Aurore Clement).Harry Dean Stanton plays the main character and this is probably his best role. His best moment in the film is his conversation with Jane (Nastassja Kinski), a scene in which he showcases his whole talent. His performance is all the more impressive as he is supposed to express a full range of emotions in the beginning of the movie when his character is not speaking. I also thought that Nastassja Kinski was good in her role, despite the fact that she had quite a short amount of screen time.The film is character driven and we are interested in Travis' actions because we really care about him. Wim Wenders manages to direct the movie with precision and manages to keep the viewer connected. We want to find out why Travis wants to go to Paris, Texas, or why he was wandering through the desert in the first place. What I liked about this film is that you don't know how it's going to end, there are actually moments when you don't know what the main character is going to do next. This is probably the merit of writer Sam Shepard, who is probably better known to the public as an actor. I also found the movie's score to be great. Far from being very elaborate, it manages to bring the audience to where the action takes place. As a downside, the film might seem a little slow at times, but this is necessary for the build up.Paris, Texas is an art-house film that presents a realistic story.

It belongs in any collection that boasts films from both Firth and Branagh.I loved its slow-moving, but emotionally moving, pace. The performances are simply superb. From everyone.It tells the tale, ultimately, of two shattered survivors of World War I whose path back to the world is taken a step at a time. It is technically Firth's movie and what a performance from him, still in his 20's. It is thrilling to experience how he totally immerses himself in a part and becomes one with every aspect of his character. Seeing him here lets the viewer experience the early years of someone becoming a great actor and, subsequently, one of the best of his generation. It is still a mystery to me why Colin Firth has chosen some of the parts he played in films over the years, because such amazing potential in him was so very obvious in this part of the quiet, shy, shaken Mr. Birkin.One side note, not sure if it is a spoiler, but I was very interested in the depiction of the returning veteran with the stammer. A bit of foreshadowing to Firth's incredible performance in The King's Speech over two decades later. One thread in TKS deals with King George's speech therapist, Lionel Logue, who achieved his skill and reputation working with stammering returning veterans of WWI, exactly of the ilk the young Colin Firth played in this movie.Much is made of the sun-drenched, dreamy setting in Yorkshire and it is also very much a part of what sustains these two damaged boys and helps them along in recovery.I would say this is one film in the catalog of Colin Firth that should NOT be missed. And there is hope on my part it becomes as readily available as some of his work in forgettable films. (Though he is always, always good in every performance.)This film, to me, is unforgettable.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"28 June 2011","score":"","review":" The first Nightmare on Elm Street was released in 1984, was written and directed by Wes Craven. Craven already had 2 successful horror movies under his belt, The Last House on the Left and The Hill's Have Eyes. The idea for nightmare came from a newspaper article that Craven had read where a young boy was actually found dead from suffering a terrifying nightmare. He then wrote the script to nightmare and showed it to New Line Cinema which back then was only a small film company that wasn't doing much business.The plot of the movie involves 4 teenagers who are stalked and killed one by one in their dreams by a man named Fred Krueger or better known as Freddy Krueger played by Robert Englund. What's scary about Freddy is that he is horribly burnt from head to toe and he wears a menacing glove with razors or knives for fingers. He also wears a brown and beaten fedora hat and a dirty red and green sweater. The basic story behind Freddy's character is that when he was alive, he was a child murderer in the town of Springwood. When the parents of Springwood found out, they decided to band together and hunt him down out of justice and revenge. They found him in his boiler room and so they set fire to it and burned it down killing Freddy in the process. That's the reason why he comes back and kills their kids in their dreams out of revenge. What sets Freddy apart from other horror villains like Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers and Leatherface is that he has a personality and a very sick sense of humour. The fun in watching the Nightmare on Elm Street movies comes from the special effects and Freddy's sick sense of humour. Freddy can do pretty much anything in the dream world and that's part of what makes him and the movie scary, the fact that you're more vulnerable when you're asleep. The main character is a teenage girl named Nancy. Throughout the movie she's afraid to go to sleep after her best friend was killed by Freddy and because every time she falls asleep Freddy attempts to kill her. In the end, she decides face Freddy and defeat him by literally bringing him into the real world. What I like about her is that she actually uses her brain and defends herself against Freddy. In one scene she sets an alarm clock to wake herself up and near the end of the movie she rigs her house with traps. Johnny Depp plays Nancy's boyfriend, Glen. Like some of the other characters in the film such as, the parents, he is sceptical towards the existence of the paranormal which in my opinion is a big mistake because the characters who say that a particular thing or person doesn't exist usually die horribly and believe me; his death scene is pretty memorable. It's interesting to note that the first movie Johnny Depp starred in was the first Nightmare on Elm Street. One of the things that I like about the movie is the colour contrast between the real world and the dream world. During the day, the suburb of Springwood looks like a friendly place. The houses are white, the grass is green, but in the dream world it has a dark, misty and spooky atmosphere. Also, in the dream world is Freddy's boiler room which is dark, red and has a hellish atmosphere. Whenever Nancy walks down into the boiler room it's almost like she's descending into Hell itself.The music in a Nightmare on Elm Street is another key element that I like. The theme music is slow and sounds really spooky. Speaking of theme music, Freddy actually has his own nursery rhyme sung by these creepy kids playing jump rope. Freddy's nursery rhyme is another one of Freddy's trademarks which appears throughout the series and is usually heard before he appears.At times the movie can be a bit confusing for example; there are some moments where you're not sure whether a character is asleep or awake and the very end is the most confusing part because you're not sure whose dream it is. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because it suggests that the nightmare isn't over at all. Wes Craven had actually decided against having a teaser ending, but they ended up making three. One of my favourite scenes in the entire movie is the opening scene before the film's title appears. It's shown on a small screen and it just shows Freddy's hands actually constructing his infamous glove. Freddy's breathing can be heard in the scene and just before the title appears his hand is shown wearing the glove. It's a scene that gives me goosebumps and lets you know that you're in for a good fun scare. If you're a fan of horror be sure to check it out, because it's a lot of fun.

Honestly what's the big deal with this movie and its -far worse- sequels? They are one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is pretty typical&#x85; nothing will leave you with your mouth open or surprise you. The characters are of cardboard quality at best, with Gibson playing a cartoon who is more irritating than cool. Glover plays the conservative family man, (with a moustache of course!), and Gibson is the rebel cop who cries at night while trying to kill his self because his wife died in a traffic accident&#x85; boooohoooooo! Riiiiiight&#x85; The action sequences are boring and the way the main characters and especially Gibson behave is unrealistic and far from heroic&#x85; more like suicidal just for the fun of it. You want a good cop movie look elsewhere. Yes, I've seen worse but the point here is that this movie is one of the most successful ones!!!FINAL VERDICT A Series Of Action Movie Clichés (4.4\/10)+ Great main character chemistry.- Boring action sequences and plot. Extremely stereotypical characters.Also Check Bad Boys (1993) - Die Hard (1988) &#x96; Lethal Weapon (1989) &#x96; Rush Hour (1998)P.S. My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say I like\\don't like this movie but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...
