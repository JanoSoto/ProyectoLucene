Aside from that, anyone with a brain can easily see how this is just anti-pollution propaganda.You might want to take note on the fact that Crysta, the ever-optimistic environmentally friendly main character, is portrayed as this pretty and kind individual, whereas the polluters are portrayed as corrupt and ugly-looking. So, what will children who watch this think of the employees and owners of polluting factories? What if their parents work in polluting factories? I certainly wouldn't want my child thinking that industrialism and pollution is a bad thing, not to mention that employees and owners of factories are people like everyone else, with families of their own.Maybe I'm the wrong person to review this movie (I'm pro-pollution and enjoy polluting the environment on purpose). I'm sure my review will get many unhelpful votes, but if you're an intelligent person, don't show this to your own children! The plot follows a fairy-like creature, Crysta, and her environmentally aware friends, who try and rescue their home from the Hexxus, a polluting entity bent on destroying the rain forest forever.You might as well be showing your children a bunch of Nazi 1940's WW2 propaganda because this really isn't much different. Environmentalism is all about control, and movies like this are highly influential on kids. I saw this as a little kid and up until grade seven I believed it was a movie with values, and I believed in the environmental movement. In grade seven I learned a lot about the other side of the issue, the side often ignored. Since then I've been an intentional polluter, and I'm proud of it! My advice? Only watch FernGully for the voice talents of Tim Curry (Toxic Love song is so cool) and Robin Williams, or for nostalgic value, and keep it away from your kids. They deserve much better. And let's face it, little kids won't give a damn about the environmental message in it, they just want to see an entertaining movie and the only entertaining and cool character in it was Hexxus.

And all of them deserve so. But this one is just beyond, because,this is not a film. Yes, it is not a film. It is the meaning of life. All the characters represent all the humans ever born on this planet earth. Recently, Christopher Nolan's Interstellar came out. And no doubt, it was one of the most fabulous films, ever! But the concept of they shown in that film had already been mastered by Richard Kelly in Donnie Darko. The corruption in the fabric of space time is caused by the unknown reason whose explanation spans from our own future beings to future alien contacts to even God. I mean, do you get it?

He decides to get vengeance on each member of the surgical team in the most horrific biblical way.*Special Stars- Vincent Price, Joseph Cotton, Peter Jeffrey, Virginia North, Terry-Thomas, Hugh Griffith, Caroline Munro.*Theme- Vengeance is a strong emotion.*Trivia\/location\/goofs- There is a film sequel to this film called, Dr. Phibes Rises Again. Enjoy the 1925 Art Deco styling of the sets. In order for Joseph Cotten to know his cues, Phibes' dialog was read aloud by a crew-member. Vincent Price said Joseph Cotten was very uncomfortable doing his scenes, so he intentionally made a lot of funny faces to make him laugh. The name Vesalius is a reference to Andreas Vesalius, a Flemish scientist who cut up corpses to learn about the workings of the body. The Vampire Bats were really flying foxes, very docile fruit-loving bats. A very young Joanna Lumley appeared as a laboratory assistant, but her scenes were cut. Virgina North appeared in a play in London called Council of Love, in which she was silent throughout her performance. I played the daughter of the devil, she told the Associated Press in 1971. I'd go around and do terrible things. The people who made the movie saw me in the play and decided I was what they wanted. You might say I was ready made for the movie part. For the many scenes in which Vincent Price was required to speak without moving his mouth, he was painted with a substance called 'collodion' which literally immobilized his face. GOOFS- The film is set in 1925. The automobiles, airplane, and film projector seem to be from the 1920s, but the house interiors, including the lights around Dr. Phibes' organ, and clothing appear to be early 1970s mod style. At the end Dr. Phibes plays Somewhere Over The Rainbow which was written in 1935. You can clearly see wire attached to the flying bat. After Vulnavia dances with Phibes, he lowers the cage of bats into the cellar. Vulnavia runs up the stairs, then appears downstairs seconds later, in different clothes. It is established that Phibes is murdering the surgeons he hold responsible for the death of his wife; but at the masked party, Dr. Hargreaves introduces himself as 'a psychiatrist'.*Emotion- A visibly rich and 'campy' stylistic film with many film 'exploitation' elements added for good measure. This melodrama is enjoyable and has genuine elements of horror. Clever and memorable as one of Vincent Prices best films.

All else is a police drama that allows Jodie Foster to star with a dismaying West Virginia accent and a propped up set of credentials that places her in a position to be at the center of it all. For me, although Foster is always interesting to look at, it is Ted Levines' Buffalo Bill that encases the chilling nature of the film because we get a glimpse of the biggest reason we watch horror films. What drive the evil found in mankind. Levine gives us a chilling and fascinatingly demented killer and we see why he's doing what he's doing.

DIR Edward D. Wood Jr.*Theme- Some people feel they are mistakes and need science to correct it.*Trivia\/location\/goofs- Auto biographical documentary on transvestism and hermaphroditism. B & W. Bela Lugosi was broke and a morphine addict at the time so readily took on a role in the film for which he allegedly was paid $5000. In reality, this figure was probably closer to $1000. Shot in just four days. The film was originally intended to be loosely based on the story of sex-change pioneer Christine Jorgensen. In March 1981, Paramount placed a full-page page ad in the New York Times announcing the reissue of Glen or Glenda (1953). Warren Beatty is purported to have sponsored its 1981 reissue by Paramount, while he was working there making Reds (1981). The film includes almost 14 minutes of stock footage, including the end credits, and 73 seconds that run concurrently with new footage of Bela Lugosi. The stock scenes include Fake Lightning (used 6 times), Pedestrians (3 times), Highway Day (3 times), Highway Night (twice), Playground (twice), Superior Court (twice), Ridiculous Soft Core, Natives, Bison Stampede, Parking Lot, Steel Foundry, WWII, Ambulance, Airplane, Signalman, Milkman, and Girls with Fuzzy Hats or Sweaters. GOOFS- The headline on the newspaper at the beginning has clearly been taped on. The text accompanying the close-up of a newspaper story headlined Man Nabbed Dressed As Girl is a hodge-podge of unrelated paragraphs lifted from stories about tax reform, a prison injury, and faith healing.*Emotion- This phony documentary is a terrible mix of metaphysics(Lugosi role) and bad biology. Due to the huge press from Christine Jorgenson's sex surgery from a male to female, the film wrongfully and simplistically connects many gender issues and presents them in this faux erroneous documentary. Todays medical doctor's know more about such matters that openly contradict the message of this early film by a closeted transvestite film maker. The film features the famous Lugosi pull the string monologue featured in the Johnny Depp 'Ed Wood' biopic film. That scene is presented in a much different tone and context.*Based On- Edward D.

The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court.
