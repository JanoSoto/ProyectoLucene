He has to promise his girlfriend (Mol) he's going straight.When his best friend, the aptly named Worm, is released from prison, the ever-faithful Mike is there to greet him. Because of a school indiscretion in which Worm refused to name him and was expelled while Mike graduated, Mike has always felt that he owed Worm big-time. Worm seduces him back into the life, basically so he can be bailed out from all the gambling debts he owed before going into prison.Really excellent movie that takes one into the lives of a couple of ringers who play with amateurs most of the time. John Malcovich as a Russian card shark is excellent, but really, everyone is great. Martin Landau plays a judge who is a professor at the law school and advises Mike You can't run away from what you are. He's wonderful.Director John Dahl takes us into the seedy gambling clubs and the all-night games as Mike, who believes card-playing is not about luck, reads faces and finds mannerisms that are giveaways as to the players' hands. And finally learns, for better or worse, who he is.Highly recommended.
