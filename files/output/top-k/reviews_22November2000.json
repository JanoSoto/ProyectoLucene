But if I was Ron Howard, I would've convinced Tim Burton to do this movie and have Christopher Walken to be the Grinch.

The wonderful message, the fantastic imagery, and Boris Karloff's legendary narration made it a Christmas classic (when I sang the theme song for a high school Christmas choir concert, a couple of years ago, the audience instantly recognized and loved the song).  So, when I heard that there was a live-action remake in the works.  I though of only one word How?  That seemed to me at the time to be the most impossible story to remake in live-action.  While other people were excited, I was incredibly skeptical.  That is why I was so pleased with this new version.    Basically, there are two reasons that this is a film to be seen.  The first is obviously Jim Carrey.  I have been a big fan of his work since his breakthrough in Ace Ventura Pet Detective.  Even if the film that he is making is not very good, he manages to give 110% in that role.  This role will most likely be listed as one of his best.  To play a character that is as firmly rooted in children's minds as Mickey Mouse, Harry Potter, or The Wicked Witch Of The West is a tremendous honor for an actor, and Jim Carrey knows this.  He plays each scene, each LINE like it is his last.  He commits his face, his voice, and his body fully to this role.  It does not take too long to forget that Jim Carrey is simply playing the Grinch.  You believe that he IS the Grinch.  That is only the second time that Jim Carrey has done that to me (Man On the Moon being the first).    The other notable aspect of this film is the art direction, which is simply breathtaking.  Since the town of Whoville is enclosed in a snowflake, the crew has taken great pains to show us a place that is not of this world.  All of the noses are microscopic, the buildings are bent, and the cars are more suited for a circus than a city street.  This film belongs on a list with other films such as Star Wars, Metropolis, and almost every Tim Burton film as a movie that created a incredibly good-looking world.  This is the type of film that you could spend the entire time just looking at the corners of the screen and still be entertained.    How the Grinch Stole Christmas has a central message in it which states that Christmas is not something that is bought in a store.  Well, this film shows that a good movie is not something that is bought in a store.  Most of the Hollywood that I have seen consists of filmmakers who either (1) wonder why their artistic film did not appeal to a wide audience, or (2) why their summer blockbuster was widely made fun of.

As a very 'different' looking child the Grinch was constantly tormented and teased by unfeeling fellow classmates, culminating in a particularly cruel incident that takes place during a class Christmas party.

One fateful day during his annual return to wreck holiday havoc in Whoville, the Grinch meets Cindy, an experience that somehow convinces the youngster that there is much more to this man than he allows folks to see...that somewhere way deep down inside this hairy green body...small as it ultimately is...there exists a heart. Like a good reporter Cindy goes on a quest to learn the origin of the much maligned and feared Grinch.

I had very low expectations because the movie title sounded flat, director was Spielberg, who had not directed any grunt-level war movies so far. Also, Tom Hanks was starring it-I regarded him unsuitable to the role, despite being versatile actor. But these thoughts quickly vanished from my mind as landing crafts hit the beach and German MGs began peppering the shoreline. I began to feel almost as uncomfortable as the US troops pinned on the beach, everything was chaotic, tracer bullets whistling in the air, limbs blown off by mortar shells, men dying and screaming in agony, waves colored red with blood... Everything in these first 20 minutes or so was done in amazing detail and accuracy. It forced me to adapt totally different attitude towards the rest of the movie this was war, nothing less or more, just war like it was in Summer 1944 in bocage hell of Normandy.Captain Miller and his squad's mission is to bring back Private James Ryan, whose all brothers are killed in various theaters of war almost at the same time and he is now the only surviving son of the Ryan family. Despite this naive plot setting and some emotional and patriotic overtones (like scene of Gen. Marshall referring to Lincoln) they seem irrelevant since the movie is all about a squad of Army Rangers, their fighting, suffering and griping in Normandy battles. The chaos of war is captured very well with airborne troops and German units scattered all over Normandy cut out of command and communications. Sometimes only a wall separates Germans from Americans and solitary German machine-guns and snipers take their toll even before Captain Miller's (Hanks) squad even reaches Private Ryan's unit in a remote village. As they finally reach the ruined village, Ryan refuses to leave and Miller decides to stay also to defend an important bridge. As the troops wait for a German attack, there are some good scenes like idle soldiers killing time talking grunt talk, but also the worst scene in the movie Matt Damon starts to tell Miller about some hilarious events taking place with an ugly girl at attic of his homestead's barn. I think this scene could have been easily been cut out, now it looks only a clumsy attemp to bring depth in the Ryan character.The final battle is another longer combat sequence in this movie and it takes place in the streets of Ramelle. The fighting is again shown in a realistic manner, but I doubt that the elite German SS would advance the main street with tanks like in a parade while expecting US resistance. And at some scenes Germans just seem to run mindlessly towards intense US machine gun and sniper fire without any cover. There are some macho scenes, like sgt. Horvath (Sizemore) and a German running out of ammo and throwing helmets at each other.  But these issues might only matter to WWII history buffs (like me) and generally the combat is more realistic and intense than anything ever seen on the screen before.At the end of the bloodbath, only two men are left of original Miller's squad with Miller gasping Earn this.. with his last breath to Private Ryan. The very end is a return to the beginning of the movie, with Ryan shown as an old man making visit to Miller's grave in Normandy. The final dialogue is between Ryan and his wife, and the scene is a bit Spielbergishly over-melodramatic with Ryan asking his wife is he a good man. And he then makes a military salute to Miller's grave, which I think is a proper end to to this great war movie.Overally, this is a classic war movie, perhaps not the greatest of all time but at least best of the 90's. The acting is excellent, Tom Hanks making his best role so far as emotional, yet tough Captain Miller. Certainly would have deserved an Oscar for that. Supporting roles are also good, but perhaps kind of one dimensional and shadowed by Hank's Milller character. Effects are equally good, on the special and sound department. The washed colors work well and add to realism. The general feeling of being there is captured very well.**IMPORTANT HISTORICAL NOTE** *Some British comments here state that there were other nationalities like British and Canadians in Normandy Invasion. Of course there were, but this movie is about a squad of men, not the whole vast scope of the Invasion. If you are looking for that, watch also The Longest Day. SPR is by no means telling that the Americans made Normandy Invasion single-handedly.The scene where Miller and some airborne officer are talking about the progress of the Invasion and refer to General Montgomery as Overrated or he can't get through at Caen. They were just talking about how American GI's really thought during summer 1944. There WAS a certain amount of friction between western allies and this movie is not claiming that British were incompetent-it merely show what was thought in those days.*I give The best war movie of the 90's a score of 9.5\/10PS. The Thin Red Line, the other big '98 war movie is nothing compared to this masterpiece. Saving Private Ryan makes you think by just showing what war really is. The Thin Red Line shows what war really isn't and wants you to think like director has already thought for you.    ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2000","score":"","review":"  I was simply stunned when I saw Saving Private Ryan back in Fall 1998. I had very low expectations because the movie title sounded flat, director was Spielberg, who had not directed any grunt-level war movies so far. Also, Tom Hanks was starring it-I regarded him unsuitable to the role, despite being versatile actor. But these thoughts quickly vanished from my mind as landing crafts hit the beach and German MGs began peppering the shoreline. I began to feel almost as uncomfortable as the US troops pinned on the beach, everything was chaotic, tracer bullets whistling in the air, limbs blown off by mortar shells, men dying and screaming in agony, waves colored red with blood... Everything in these first 20 minutes or so was done in amazing detail and accuracy. It forced me to adapt totally different attitude towards the rest of the movie this was war, nothing less or more, just war like it was in Summer 1944 in bocage hell of Normandy.Captain Miller and his squad's mission is to bring back Private James Ryan, whose all brothers are killed in various theaters of war almost at the same time and he is now the only surviving son of the Ryan family.
