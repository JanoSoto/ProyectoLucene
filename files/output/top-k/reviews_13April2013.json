Fast forward 18 years, and it's &#x96; totally! &#x96; still enjoyable, but I agree with my original thought.So, I can see someone saying that it's dated nowadays, especially kids, or anyone that missed it back then. Luckily, I caught it new and still love it just as much.Normally, I hate to be around or watch either bimbos or mimbos, but I had a feeling this movie wasn't glorifying them; instead, they were severely mocking them. But, when the very talented (at least for this role) Alicia Silverstone can play someone with less than half a brain and selfish and yet, contains a full heart, I admire the movie &#x96; and her performance &#x96; even more.Totally Valley Cher (Silverstone) and her pal, Dionne, spend their time using up their rich family's money by incessantly shopping, grouping fellow high school kids into segregations and occasionally caring about the lesser and unfortunate people, which, in real life, have more going for them than 3 of both Cher and Dionne combined. But, this is a slapstick kind of comedy, so let's try not to get too deep.The first half of the movie is just one example after the next of perky Cher and her high zest in life and an actual second movie appears when the ultrathin plot is revealed Cher's outward appearance doesn't match her insides. She wants companionship and the movie tries to convey that with little success, but enough to give the movie a slight spark of a conflict. It's the second half where the film, unfortunately, loses a little steam and overstays its welcome a bit.All of that doesn't matter; Clueless is not really just that. In a lot of ways, it's brilliant, absolutely hilarious, contains fantastic secondary characters and has both some enormously quotable lines and very funny scenes. Not to mention, the incredible soundtrack that I recall buying immediately following my first viewing. While I like practically every song on the album, Kids in America, the opening title song to the motion picture, is one of my all time movie favorite songs.Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became passé, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl!Side Note Oh, and Paul (Rudd) I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better &#x96; I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers. Wait&#x85;oh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call.Side Note II As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase A Friend of Dorothy, which means, um, Not a Fan of Hustler. I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?

(Just like the Mask) Let me tell you my story.Honestly, I don't remember if I saw this in theatres. I probably did, because what I do remember in early 1996, is buying the VHS copy of this movie and I watched it a grand total of 5-6 times in under a week. I recall watching The Mask over and over and never getting sick of it. Sure, I had plenty of other movies to watch, but this one&#x85;was so much fun.And it still is today. Recently, I bought this movie on BluRay, because I remember loving it, but haven't seen it in over 10 years. I seriously had just as much fun today as I did with those multiple viewings when I first bought the VHS. This movie really holds up from the many years since its release. It really is timeless.Goody-Man Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is transformed into the daredevil Mask figure when he finds, and dons an ancient wooden mask, and his inner desires come out tenfold. He goes for the girl, inadvertently pisses off the mob and takes care of business as The Mask superhero\/cartoon character that mild-mannered Stanley couldn't.The story isn't exactly new, even for 1994, but it's take on the age-old underdog\/superhero is fresh, exciting and most of all HILARIOUS.As a matter of fact, when prepping and watching the movie to write this review, I was puzzled on which genre this movie fit in Action\/Adventure + SuperHero? Or Comedy + the rest mentioned? And as I found myself laughing and laughing, even after my 5+ original viewings, I settled on This MUST be a comedy&#x85;with a close second of Action\/adventure + SuperHero.I think this is a very underrated film. It was a very old concept that was a ton of fun, thanks to Jim Carrey at his peak and newcomer, Cameron Diaz who (almost) stole every scene she was in. She was gorgeous and talented and it was hard to believe that this was her first outing. Honestly, as much as I do like her, but not so much every movie she's been in &#x96; though I do enjoy a lot of her films, she was fantastic in this. And I understand that dog was like a prop, I still LOVED little Milo. You have to suspend your disbelief a lot during this movie, so you might as well believe all the dog accomplished.This movie is so straight forward to typical movie viewers and still, it's a lot of fun. And it contains one of my all-time favorite scenes\/songs in any movie The Cuban Pete dance segment. Priceless&#x85;as was this movie. See it! It still holds up today and despite all the smoking, especially if you're against that, it's a helluva lot of fun.

The script and plot is close to perfection. Everything from Action, comedic feuds, deceit, romance and amazing surprises. It has a little of everything and a lot of the rest.The characters' difference is brilliant. The background of them is hidden beneath the surface of someone completely different. They're just amazingly entertaining. They're personalities is even better. I can't say anything else because I'm out of words; speechless.The action scenes are incredible for a movie like this. I won't say to much about them though, but if you haven't seen it yet, do so. The first scene when you see how good Brian drives is good and when you see the spark he has, and how his driving improves throughout the movie; nice, very nice. The turning point is pretty good too, but you'll have to find it yourself because I am not going to spoil your movie-experience. The twists in the movie are good, and there is more than one as well. Everyone has secrets, and the secrets are what make this movie just as good as it is. Without the secrets the movie wouldn't be worth watching. OK, let's talk about the acting. First, Mark Vincent (or as you may know; Vin Diesel), I'm a big fan for a reason. There's never anything to say on his acting, so I won't even get into how amazingly amazing he is. So, the rest of them, I am a little iffy on their names so I am just going to call them by their character names. Brian, or the guy who played his role in the movie did a great job and so did Mia and Vince. There wasn't any bad acting in the movie, only good acting and some awesome acting.The mix of secrecy, trust and romance is pretty damn good. I'm running out of adjectives.

I really and truly recommend you to watch this movie and its following movies. They are worth watching, ask anyone who've seen them they'll tell you the same. Personally I think it's great and awesome and so does my pal here who watched it with me an hour or so ago. For my rating, based on everything I wrote and didn't write, I give it 10 out of 10 stars. Why? I couldn't find anything negative about it and since I still enjoy watching after all these times I've already seen it it's probably worthy of a perfect 10.Rating 10\/10Thanks for reading my review.

Right from the start when the camera is panning round the ship, you know that you are in for something special.It is also excellent the way in which the tension is built once they arrive at the distant planet. The cinematography was really good and really gave the impression that we are at a desperate and bleak place. I believe that a lot of this is down to Ridley Scott's direction which in Alien I thought was fantastic - some of the camera angles that were used really helped to create an air of suspense throughout the film.The special effects were also brilliant (considering this was made in 1979) and I thought that the alien itself looked menacing - although in all honesty I only thought it looked menacing when it developed to full size. I almost laughed when it came out of Kane's stomach and then shot across the room.The main crew includes Ripley (Weaver) Dallas (Skerritt) Kane (Hurt) Parker (Kotto) Lambert (Cartwright) Brett (Stanton) and Ash (Holm). Whilst all of the actors were good in their respective roles, I didn't feel that any one gave a stand out performance.Alien is technically well made and it certainly ticks all the major boxes; Atmospheric, Tense, Suspenseful, Good Acting, Special Effects & Cinematography. Unfortunately, the only thing Ridley Scott didn't do is come up with a good ending. For me this film had one of the most anti-climatic endings that I've seen. I thought after the way that the Alien was built up and having seen how easily it killed all of Ripley's crew that there might have been a major battle between Ripley and the Alien. Instead of that, we have Ripley running round the ship with the Alien seemingly not bothering to chase her. She then picks up her cat, gets in her space capsule (a few minutes prior to this she set their mining ship up to self destruct) and low and behold there the alien is seemingly wedged into the front of the capsule (for no apparent reason and seemingly with no explanation as to how it got there) then she tries to gas it and eventually fires at it and shoots him out of the capsule and that's pretty much the end. This film could have been so much better if Ridley Scott would have thought more about the ending - I think Ripley being stalked round the ship by the Alien and having a 'proper final showdown' - a physical struggle with it at the least, would have been much more of a fitting way of ending the film as that at least would have added a little tension. Despite the poor ending, I still enjoyed the film and rated it 7\/10.

Any possible change, in whatever direction, would likely make it a less hard-hitting experience. The message is urgent, the storytelling is brutally effective, and every aspect of the craftsmanship is simply superb. And the acting. Holy sh!t, the acting.This is a film that must be viewed multiple times (get the DVD!). The story is quite simple, but the characters and their relations are anything but. There's so much understated history in Festen that it probably would be a trilogy if everything were spelled out.For instance, what role did grandpa have in making Helge a child abuser? Is he really as senile as he behaves, or is that partly an act he plays to avoid responsibility? Maybe I'm over-interpreting, but I get the impression that Helge was continuing a sick family tradition. This family certainly has plenty of sick traditions.At one point, Helge seems to be hinting at an incestuous relationship between Christian and his dead sister, but then slides over to a more general accusation of being an unsupportive brother. Is Helge trying to deflect his own guilt, or is Christian in fact more than a simple victim? The ambiguity is brilliantly done (resolved in the climax).And the little details. When Helge changes from black tie to bathrobe, he's finally ready to change from monster to human. The symbolism here works on every level, from personal unmasking to larger social criticism.Much has been said about the Dogme95 agenda; some like it and some don't. In the hands of a lesser director than Vinterberg, the Dogme tricks could easily come down to a gimmick, and it certainly won't work for every movie. But in Festen it's used, with devastating effect, to enhance the merciless realism of the story.Festen is an emotional roller coaster that left me completely drained. Despite the grim subject matter, it's sprinkled with the kind of absurd, black humor that makes you laugh, and then immediately feel bad for laughing. When Helge delivers his list of nasty counter-accusations, Christian just keeps eating with this blank, detached look on his face. This is oddly funny, but it's also how clinically depressed people often behave.In the end, Festen is a powerful, optimistic story of redemption and personal growth. The old man had to be broken so the children could start healing. I like to think that even the father came out of this a better man. The younger brother ends up a little less of an a-hole. His response to Helge's apology was another perfect moment That's great dad, we all appreciate it, but forgiveness will take more work than a few pretty words.

Filled with excellent direction,powerful performances and a wonderful screenplay,Unforgiven is not only one of my favorite Western films,but one of my favorite films in general and Clint Eastwood's greatest film as a director.Set in the Western town of Big Whiskey,Wyoming in 1880,Unforgiven tells the story of William Munny(Clint Eastwood),a retired gunslinger who is now a farmer who has been asked to come out of retirement to collect a reward of 1,000$ to get two cowboys who cut and assaulted a prostitute. With the help from his old partner Ned Logan(Morgan Freeman)and a young gunslinger named The Schofield Kid(Jaimz Woolvett),William has to deal with trying to get the bounty as well as dealing with the town sheriff Little Bill(Gene Hackman).Unforgiven is a powerful masterpiece that came out during the time of the Western film revival that lasted from the mid-80s to the mid-90s. During the Western revival Westerns such as Tombstone(which is my second favorite Western during the revival),Best Picture Oscar Winner Dances With Wolves,Silverado,Pale Rider and the Young Guns films,just to name a few. The reason I think Unforgiven was the greatest Western during the revival is because Unforgiven was a film that offered something bigger and deeper. One of the reasons I love Unforgiven is because of the way Eastwood strips away the romantic view of the West and portrays the Old West as it really wasa violent,dark and dangerous world where there was dust, lawmen,outlaws in a sometimes lawless land where things like killings,blood and money were in the dust and where the West was ugly. Another thing that I love about Unforgiven is the film's dark Film Noir atmosphere and the way the film is shot. During the night and even the daytime scenes the film is surrounded by darkness and harsh light where there is rain and muddy streets on a constant basis with a sense of dread where you feel like you're in a nightmare and nothing is going to turn out all right. The film's visual style is one of the things that separates Unforgiven from other Westerns and what makes it stand out from other films of the genre. The film is also a study about violence,the way it's shown and how the characters react to the violence. The violence in the film is how violence is in real life it's horrible,ugly and unsettling and when characters are killed there no smiles,laughs or glee when a person is killed,but anger,sadness and regret. The film shows that even good and vicious human beings can be affected by violent acts. The screenplay by David Webb Peoples is excellent with Peoples giving the film great scenes and wonderful dialog that can be sometimes haunting and powerful. What's also great about Peoples screenplay is the moral ambiguity that the main characters have especially the two characters William Munny and Little Bill Daggett because while both characters are on opposite sides of the law with Munny being a gunslinger and Bill being a sheriff,but both characters are not shown in a right or wrong or black and white but a gray area. Munny was a vicious killer and can be seen as bad,but is shown to care about his family and the people he is with while Little Bill is a lawman and is supposed to be good he does vicious things yet at the same time has likable qualities. I love that both characters are not shown as all the way good or all the way bad and that with the two characters there is something deeper and underneath the surface and much more complex than one might think. Unforgiven is a film that moves at such an amazing pace and will keep you glued to the screen trying to guess what happens next and the film never slows down. Although Unforgiven is not an Action film,the Action is great and intense and but like I said before the violence is ugly and horrible. The ending of this film is one of the best endings in film history and is so suspenseful,intense,unforgettable and iconic. The ending is so powerful and haunting and is one of the things that make this film a brilliant masterpiece.The whole cast in the film is excellent. Clint Eastwood is excellent and at his best as William Munny,with Eastwood bringing an intensity,grit and toughness as he does to his other roles. Gene Hackman is brilliant as Little Bill Daggett,with Hackman bringing depth and power to the performance. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as Ned,Munny's old partner. Richard Harris is amazing as English Bob a gunslinger and old rival of Little Bill. Jaimz Woolvett is great as The Schofield kid,Munny's other partner. Saul Rubinek does a terrific job as W.W Beauchamp,English Bob's biographer. Francis Fisher is fantastic as prostitute Stawberry Alice. Anna Levine is wonderful and brings great depth to role as Delilah,a prostitute. Anthony James is memorable as Skinny a bar owner.The direction by Clint Eastwood is Excellent and Masterful,with Eastwood using simple,yet great camera movements and giving the film a haunting and dark visual style. Great direction by Eastwood.The score by Lennie Niehaus is great,melodic,haunting and intense at the same time and one of the things that adds to the greatness of the film. A powerful score by Niehaus.In final word,if you love Clint Eastwood,Western films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Unforgiven,a timeless Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and will stand the test of time.

Now you have the gold, but you wish you never see this map, the chief grunts with his dying breath. The spirits will kill you.Those being the spirits of bad Hollywood westerns, apparently, hovering over every bedraggled scene of this film. Bad process shots, corny dialogue, lame motivations, senseless horse chasing, a pathetically undercranked whitewater run, pointless ambuscades. They are all here, in a movie that makes less sense the longer it goes.Peck isn't terrible, just typically inert and mannered with his half- grin and raised eyebrow. At least his role doesn't shut off as abruptly as those of other Hollywood stars cast in this movie. A group of six name performers pop up at one point as The Gentlemen From Hadleyburg, including personal favorites like Edward G. Robinson, Lee J. Cobb, and Eli Wallach, all apparently afflicted by a combination of gold fever and lazy agents. Before we get to know much about them, they are gone in another pointless scene. Sadly, the film trudges on, picking up an anachronistic Telly Savalas as a greedy cavalryman to tarnish another decent star's legacy.To me, this movie is a prize example of how bad editing can help sink a movie. One early scene cuts from Mackenna and the dead chief to our main group of bad guys, led by Omar Sharif, in the process of killing a rancher and kidnapping his daughter somewhere presumably far away. The next thing we know, the same bad guys have surrounded Peck, still in the desert burying the dead chief. The movie moves like this all the time, abruptly and with no explanation.Other reviewers here single out Sharif for hammy overacting, but I won't. He's the only actor who stands out, working in some real menace in the part of John Colorado even if the plot depends on everyone else acting like an idiot by trusting this obviously ruthless rogue. Gold fever is a term we keep hearing as motivation for everyone's blindness, and it doesn't work.Director J. Lee Thompson shoots every scene in the same lifeless, overlong way, four or five long shots communicating the same idea. He even manages to render dull a fairly revealing nude scene by an undoubled Julie Newmar by shooting her swimming underwater over and over in the same way. She tries to make out with Peck, then kill the rancher's daughter, and all I could think was how I couldn't believe how ready I was for this scene to end.The core idea of the film is promising. Mackenna doesn't want to go looking for gold, he doesn't believe it exists, but he's forced by Colorado. Mackenna burned the map, you see, and as Mackenna is a well- known card sharp, Colorado knows he will remember what it showed.The scenery is gorgeous, like I said. There's even a denouement where a giant canyon collapses which was apparently done with a real canyon. But any impact of this impressive if ecologically disastrous effect is lost as Thompson cuts from that to bad process shots showing Mackenna and the others trying to gallop to safety. I don't even want to get into the silliness of a big slow finish which involves watching three principals bent on killing each other climb up a ridiculously steep cliff-face and then back down again.Apparently this was supposed to be a three-hour film but was cut by the studio after a first screening. I can't imagine how dull that must have been; this version is shorter apparently by an hour but feels terribly padded all the same. Unlike another flop western from 1969, Paint Your Wagon, it doesn't even work as unintentional comedy, slowness being its main flaw.Yes, they still made great westerns in 1969, like The Wild Bunch and Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. Ted Cassidy from Butch is here, too, as a stoic Apache killer, his famous Lurch voice poorly dubbed. The overall effect of Mackenna's Gold is much like that, wholly artificial and completely unconvincing. Fool's Gold would have been a more worthy title.

This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more meta level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book\/film.This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset.

Why is that even included? If you remove the few moments she talks, it would not detract from the movie at all -- she offers nothing in the way of explanation or plot. And it really makes no logical sense if you think about it why would she know what the priest dreams? But, oh well.Terry O'Quinn has a small role, but it is still great to see him. Before he got (more) famous as John Locke on Lost, the horror fans knew him as the Stepfather. So any time he makes a horror appearance, it is a welcome treat. Gary Busey is also great, being his typical crazy self. They say he became crazy after his motorcycle accident, but it really seems to have been present before that.A quick shout-out to the bear trap joke. Not sure which film did this first, but it is always nice to see.Last, but not least, we must salute Daniel Attias. This was Attias' directing debut before going on to be successful in television work. He did an amazing job and I am impressed. Apparently Don Coscarelli was going to be the director before things fell through. While Coscarelli is certainly a legend in the horror world, I am not sure if he could have made the film any better... it is in many ways now a classic.

The reviewer said that the film not only vilified guns, but also said that there was no way to stop this kind of guns on the streets. We didn't get the chance to rent it that week so I checked out a few scenes online and was so impressed by the few scenes that I saw that I went right out and bought it. Now, you may be thinking that was a foolish decision on my part. I was worried that I may have bought a movie with a few good scenes and two hours of fluff, but it was a chance I was willing to take. The decision, despite it being impulsive, was one of the best movie purchases I have ever made.Falling Down is about a typical man named Bill Foster, who is played by Michael Douglas. Now, I will admit that when I first saw that Michael Douglas was the lead, it sort of turned me away a little bit. I'd seen earlier films of his, and it seems like he always plays the same character. Some rugged tough guy struggling with issues and what-not. I thought that way until I saw Falling Down. His performance completely blew me away. I was not expecting such a subtle, yet tortured character, much less such an obviously screwed-up one.Foster just got laid off from his job at the defense department who is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the day of one of the hottest days in Los Angeles. His stress doubles so much that the simple noises of bratty children fighting or people honking their horns in frustration become magnified to an almost unbearable level. He instantly gets out of his car and walks away, abandoning it. At this point, you may be able to tell that Foster isn't exactly a person who is mentally well. But who could blame him? Foster starts walking to get to his daughter's birthday party, which is across town in Venice, and as the minor annoyances we all face become unbearable, he decides that he won't put up with it anymore and goes on a rampage through the streets of Los Angeles. It's almost as if it's a game of Grand Theft Auto. One thing leads to another, and he's walking down Hollywood with a gym bag full of guns. I suppose you can see where things are going from here. What follows is a disturbing, yet somehow strangely hilarious series of events where Foster starts a one-man war on the system that shunned him. There's also a detective that won't quit pursuing him, but this is difficult because Foster is always one step ahead of him. Sure, he may be going berserk, but it is in an understandable way. Foster isn't really hurting anybody, he's just lashing out at the society that he once loved, and the society that loved him back. Foster is a relic of another time, a time when people had respect for each other. He doesn't like what he's doing; he almost feels that he has to. He's confused and he just wants to try and make people understand what's wrong with society so things can get better. The ending is very suspenseful and one of the most beautiful and tragic endings I have ever seen.The cast was incredible. Not only do we receive a spellbinding performance from Michael Douglas, but we also get a lovable performance from Robert Duvall as a soon-to-be-retired detective. I was surprised at Duvall's performance as well. I haven't ever seen Duvall in such a role before. Duvall knows that the city is a terrible place, but he isn't trying to make it perfect. He's trying to do whatever he can to make it better. Barbara Hershey also does an excellent job as the ex-wife of Foster, who is afraid of him. What makes this even more tragic is that Foster doesn't know why she is afraid of him, and even thinks that they are still married. The only thing I would have changed with the cast is perhaps giving Foster more screen time, and dropping the subplot about Duvall's marriage.This may be the only comedy-drama besides Dog Day Afternoon that not only compels you with its intriguing and disturbing storyline, but it makes both the comedy and the realism work.An interesting scene involves a man who is Not Economically Viable protesting outside of the bank that denied him a loan. As everyone else on the street ignores him, Foster pays attention to him. Foster obviously sympathizes with this man who is also being stepped on by society. As the man is escorted away in the police car he looks directly at Foster and says don't forget me. In a gesture of empathy, he acknowledges this. When they look at each other, it is as though they are looking into a mirror and seeing the same thing a victim of society. Another scene I always thought was really sad was where Foster remarked that a plastic surgeon has a better house than him, who keeps the country safe. That really tugged at my heartstrings, because it's true. The most important and hardworking people in this country get absolutely nothing in return from the country they spend their lives serving.Overall, this is a very original and sad film. Not depressing, tragic. Even though Foster is supposed to be the villain, you identify with what he's feeling and you start to, oddly enough, sympathize with the man. Falling Down isn't a revenge movie. Nobody is supposed to cheer. It's meant to be both tragic and amusing with its shatteringly violent path of destruction that Foster is carving into the city. It really shows what this man is going through and makes you feel for him. That's quite an achievement.

For some reason, the film can't help one view Withnail and Marwood's 'bohemian' lifestyle through rose-tinted spectacles.Withnail, an unemployed and (for all intents and purposes), unemployable actor is an inspired act by Richard E. Grant and Marwood, his long suffering friend, is portrayed skillfully by Paul McGann. The two degenerates have sunk to the very depths of squalor and despair and live surrounded (and drowning) in their own filth and detritus. Withnail is the perfect stingingly aloof, uncaring 'angry young man', immersed in self-destruction and the very epitome of a self-destructive, sneering, middle class intellectual that only the British could engender. Marwood cares a mite more and eventually becomes somewhat concerned about their situation the copious amounts of drugs they ingest, the money they don't have and the terrible state of their health and surroundings. Facing the kitchen sink (and the horrors that lurk therein) appears to be the turning point when they both realise they have 'have to get away from it all'. At this point it would be very remiss of me not to bestow praise upon Ralph Brown, who plays Danny, the stereotypical monotone, ever-stoned, ever-present drug dealer, who, while appearing and sounding like he doesn't have many brain cells left, actually provides a quirky brand of mindfulness, wisdom and calm in the face of his clients' drug induced bouts of terror. When things can't get any worse for the hapless duo, Withnail remembers that his rich Uncle Monty has a 'cottage' in Wales that could be just the ticket for their escape from the filth, drugs and self induced paranoia that have become the very essence of their dissolute London life.The thing about 'Withnail & I' is that the plot really doesn't matter; it's all about the characters, the dialogue, the milieu and the emergence of a generation of 'drop outs' who just don't care about societal conventions and yet hold on to a strong sense of self-entitlement; as such, this movie effortlessly provides entertaining, hilarious, 'black' and addictive cinema. It captures so many quintessential elements of British culture from the all too obvious class system, to the rolling countryside, stone fences, and patchwork fields, to the emerging culture and the ways in which characters of Withnail and Marwood's ilk attempt to rebel against the social order. Despite their intellectual prowess, the two miscreants have no practical skills whatsoever, resulting in much hilarity (for the viewer) as they lurch about the countryside, supremely inept at 'living off the land', or even making it to the shops. Uncle Monty, played by Richard Griffiths, is perfect for the part and his lascivious pursuit of Marwood results in the ultimate bedroom farce.Withnail and I is a cult classic, from its excellent and fitting soundtrack to its perfect depiction of the privileged, over educated and willfully unemployed generation of that time.

The visual effects are stunning for it's time, 1968. Several Science Fiction movies have borrowed directly from 2001, including Star Wars; just compare the looks of the Imperial Cruisers in SW and the Odyssey in 2001.2. The details and accuracy are splendid. 3. The music &#x96; all classical tracks - add a unique touch to 2001. Basically, the more alien the scenery, the more mystical and atonal the music.4. The lack of narration adds to the mystery of 2001, leaving the audience to speculate about the meaning of everything.5. Most scenes in space are very slow, adding realism. Also, when Dave and Frank go EVA, you can only hear their breathing and the hiss of gasses flowing into the space-suit. It feels like you are in space yourself!6. All human characters are flat and bored, whereas HAL9000, the super computer, has the most vivid personality of all. I believe this reflects both Clarke's tendency to focus on the Science rather than humans, and Kubricks cynical look on humanity.All in all, a fantastic movie, still! TEN STARS!!!The sequel, 2010 The Year We Make Contact (or 2010 Odyssey Two as the title for the novel) is a worthy film in itself. However, it is completely different in style and feel, and rightly so. I guess Hyams who directed it did not make an attempt to make it similar to 2001 in any sense. A wise decision, I think...

But like it or not, if you manage to sit through this film and concentrate on it's images, it is unlikely you will forget it. Even Dwarfs Started Small is a dark, lurid, nightmare of a movie, a disturbing vision of mankind run amok, not unlike much of what is happening in most of the world today, but related obliquely and allegorically. A palm tree is pulled down and burned, blind dwarfs wearing goggles and rubber tennis shoes battle with their oversize sight sticks, and one two foot midget giggles maniacally throughout the film, unceasingly, disturbingly.Like Lynch's Eraserhead, this is a distinctive vision unlike any other, supremely confident of its vision, and supremely memorable, regardless of your own feeling about Director Herzog's tweaking of sacred cows, of coherent narrative, of good taste; it isn't just Quentin Taratino being a bad boy making bloody images, it's a totally black vision of the end of civilized society--and all done by a filmmaker who was about twenty-four years old at the time.
