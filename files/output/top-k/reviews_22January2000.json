Made in 1940, every single frame was carefully hand drawn with such skill that now sixty years later it still looks so good it could have been created yesterday.  I guarantee nobody will be talking about this new movie sixty years from now, let alone marvelling at its beauty.Not to say that it isn't impressive or that it's a bad film.  The musical selections are excellent and simply listening to the wonderful performances is worth the cost of the ticket alone.  They are also selections that would have fit well into the original and are very well suited for animation. There are breathtaking visuals that will leave you amazed and the same clever short stories set to music that worked so well in the original.The main problems I had were the technical aspects of combining computer and hand-drawn animation, which are the same as most every film they make the attempt on.  I was enjoying myself enough during The Pines of Rome that I didn't stop to consider how ridiculous the flying whales really were, so that didn't bother me, but there were moments that the computer animation was lacking.  Likewise, during the final piece, the elk (or whatever it was) seemed to be having troubles walking, since the motion of the animal was disconnected from the ground it was supposed to be walking on.  Those types of things I find incredibly distracting and rudely remind me that I'm watching animation.Another complaint I had was the lack of charm from the original.  When watching Fantasia, you got the sense that the animators were winking at you, inviting you to smile at the clever jokes they were making using only music, ink, and celluloid.  They also gave the sense that they *loved* to animate. They loved to create motion out of still pictures, they loved to tell a story without words using their own drawings, they loved the music they included and wanted to share the beauty of the pieces with their audience. And their love for the art showed in their creation and the care in which they created every frame.  That sense just wasn't there in Fantasia 2000. Instead, you got the sense that they were paying tribute to the great animators who had gone before them, and trying more to mimic their successes rather than setting a new standard for animation the way the original did. The Carnival of the Animals piece was the closest to capturing that sense of humor and love for animation that the original had, but that segment couldn't have been any longer than ninety seconds, could it?!  I was loving every second of that section when they cut it off.  Why so short?The other problem I had was with the editing of the music.  I guess they're assuming that their audience will not be familiar with the music they used, but that's simply not the case.  Chopping up the Firebird Suite like that was jarring for those of us who knew what it was supposed to sound like. Likewise, Pomp and Circumstance, Fifth Symphony, and Rhapsody in Blue all had noticeable breaks where they cut out parts of the music we all know should be in there.Finally, it was *way* too short!  The advertised one hour, twenty minutes includes *everything* from the intro on how great IMAX is to the previews for the upcoming IMAX movies to the instructions not to smoke in the theater to the credits.  We started right at 900 and we stayed for the credits and still walked out at 1022.  Cut out those silly intros to each song and there wasn't even an hour of animation.  It was good enough that it was disappointing to not have more to enjoy.In spite of a few of the negatives that diminished my viewing enjoyment, it was quite a film.  The IMAX was a neat format to watch it in and was well worth the extra couple bucks for the ticket.  The bubbles in the Pines of Rome segment was a nice nod to the original, and it was my favorite of the selections.

Since I grew up to read Andersen's Fairy Tales (in Chinese version), plus my personal experiences, I can't stop loving The Steadfast Tin Soldier.  I actually burst into tears when I saw the tin soldier and the ballet-dancer girl came to life on the IMAX screen.  They looked exactly the way I imagined ever since I was a little boy.  Until I saw the very happy Disney style ending, I felt I just been cheated by Disney one more time!After the movie, I went to talk to a Disney salesgirl and asked if she likes the movie and noticed there were a few flaws in the movie.  She said she likes the Firebird Suite the best. I told her that I liked the Tin Soldier the most and also hate it the most because they changed the ending.  She was confused what I said so I went on explain  Have you ever read the original Andersen's stories?  The Tin Soldier was supposed a very sad story. In the end, he was melt away in the fireplace - in another words, he was dead!  The Disney salesgirl was surprised with my knowledge and asked Are you a serious collector of toys and story books? She handed over me a $180.00 Fantasia 2000 Collector's Album.  I told her I would love to purchase everything behind the counter once I get my degree.In the original story, Tin Soldier's fate was altered by his owner - a human boy.  There is no way he (as a toy) could possibly against the ultimate evil - a human boy. The same reason we human can't against the will of God.  But in this film, the ultimate evil was a silly looking Jack-in-a-box.  The Tin Soldier could easily overcome this one, since Jack is just another toy without both legs.  That along hindered the story a lot!Just like in the Little Mermaid, Disney did it again to alter the original by switch one of the saddest ending with a very happy (and a little silly) ending.  The classical music used for Tin Soldier was from Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2 (which I heard for the first time), was also a fast paced and very happy music.  Although in the intro the guy said the story and music are perfect match, but I just can't get it!  I am beginning to worry what would happen if Disney put The Little Match Girl into a movie or short film?  Can we have a more serious ending this time?Since it is impossible for them to remake The Tin Soldier film.  I just hope that Disney can soon release those Tin Soldiers in a box set and the lovely ballet-dancer girl in a collectible toy format.  So that I can recreate this classical romance many times in my own bedroom.  How about the evil Jack-in-a-box?  No thanks, he was not in the original story!

It however may be the most accessible picture of 1999, in that it tries to be cutting-edge and yet mainstream, cynical yet heartfelt, Todd Solondz and Frank Capra at once.  Real-life suburban America is as pathetic as it is gorgeous, as shown by Ricky Fitts, a video-maker\/drug dealer who spends his free time showing the beauty in what many do not consider worth a glance.  I know I was getting teary while I was in the theater, yet something changed once I left American Beauty is very compelling, excellently shot (who is the cinematographer?), edited, directed, and acted.  However, it's also rather false\/crude it condenses way too much and ends up giving caricatures and surface in the disguise of poetic monologue instead of real depth.  The film settles for titillation with its overstepping of social boundaries when it could actually try to be provocative.      You've probably read enough reviews to know the plot and the characters.  All of them are pretty over-the-top, with the exception of Alison Janney as Ricky's mother, wonderfully absent in the film.  She perhaps says more about the life of a housewife with her line Sorry for the way the house looks than Annette Bening can in her incessant rage.  Spacey is as always incredible, but there's something missing, or forced about Lester Burnham.  That last Kodak-like monologue reflecting on his childhood, the moments when he speaks nostalgically about college life and meeting Carolyn, even the way he says I'm great at the end, all seem very scripted, like a great actor striving to reach a character from a mediocre script.  OK- He's in a suburban daze!  Right, and he wakes up and remembers how good it was to be young cause he meets this hot chick!  And then he dies right when he's happiest!  Finally, he gets this great monologue about how great it was to be alive!  Raymond Carver, this ain't.  It's way too forced.       It's worthwhile and certainly compelling, but the film shouts things in its dialogue that need not be SAID.  It contains crudely drawn characters reaching for a 3d dimension.  For me, the actor most transcending his lines is Chris Cooper, playing a truly repulsive human being who somehow ends up stirring you and making a lot of sense.    Again, the film is worthwhile, but not the best of 1999, especially if you consider the int'l market.  See All About My Mother for a film about the interactions of extreme\/pathetic characters well-drawn out and excellently acted, Fight Club for a film that really deals with breaking out of the 90s shell, and The Dreamlife of Angels for the real beauty in the simple things.  American Beauty is like a Reader's Digest edition of the three worthwhile but only a rough draft.

Real-life suburban America is as pathetic as it is gorgeous, as shown by Ricky Fitts, a video-maker\/drug dealer who spends his free time showing the beauty in what many do not consider worth a glance.  I know I was getting teary while I was in the theater, yet something changed once I left American Beauty is very compelling, excellently shot (who is the cinematographer?), edited, directed, and acted.  However, it's also rather false\/crude it condenses way too much and ends up giving caricatures and surface in the disguise of poetic monologue instead of real depth.  The film settles for titillation with its overstepping of social boundaries when it could actually try to be provocative.      You've probably read enough reviews to know the plot and the characters.  All of them are pretty over-the-top, with the exception of Alison Janney as Ricky's mother, wonderfully absent in the film.  She perhaps says more about the life of a housewife with her line Sorry for the way the house looks than Annette Bening can in her incessant rage.  Spacey is as always incredible, but there's something missing, or forced about Lester Burnham.  That last Kodak-like monologue reflecting on his childhood, the moments when he speaks nostalgically about college life and meeting Carolyn, even the way he says I'm great at the end, all seem very scripted, like a great actor striving to reach a character from a mediocre script.  OK- He's in a suburban daze!  Right, and he wakes up and remembers how good it was to be young cause he meets this hot chick!  And then he dies right when he's happiest!  Finally, he gets this great monologue about how great it was to be alive!  Raymond Carver, this ain't.  It's way too forced.       It's worthwhile and certainly compelling, but the film shouts things in its dialogue that need not be SAID.  It contains crudely drawn characters reaching for a 3d dimension.  For me, the actor most transcending his lines is Chris Cooper, playing a truly repulsive human being who somehow ends up stirring you and making a lot of sense.    Again, the film is worthwhile, but not the best of 1999, especially if you consider the int'l market.  See All About My Mother for a film about the interactions of extreme\/pathetic characters well-drawn out and excellently acted, Fight Club for a film that really deals with breaking out of the 90s shell, and The Dreamlife of Angels for the real beauty in the simple things.  American Beauty is like a Reader's Digest edition of the three worthwhile but only a rough draft.

The story of Carter, a champion middleweight boxer who was sentenced to life in prison on a bogus murder rap and who was set free after 19 years through the efforts of his lawyers and a group of courageous Canadian do-gooders, is a tale of triumph over a corrupt system, and the power of hope.  Still, it requires the hero to be a relatively passive figure in the deciding of his fate, trapped as he is behind bars.  The Hurricane, Norman Jewison's dramatization of Carter's story, encounters both this story's virtues and its flaws, and ends up with a story that's quite a mixed dramatic bag.Denzel Washington plays Carter with his customary intensity and control, and undergoes an impressive transformation from hard-souled fighting machine to soft-spoken, eloquent defender of justice.  It's really an impressive performance, and Washington benefits from being at the center of many of the film's best-written scenes, including a terrific sequence where Carter hallucinates conversations with himself while trapped in solitary, and a great moment where he gets an unexpected present from his Canadian benefactors.These Canadians cause other problems, however.  Though there was a real group like this involved in the freeing of the Hurricane, the film puts almost the whole operation into their hands, thus making Carter feel like he is passively handing his fate over to them.  Also, these three white Canadians sometimes play like satires of do-gooding white liberals.  They have taken in an underprivileged black youth who they see potential in (and who I guess they assume would not be able to realize that potential without their help), and after he brings Carter's case to their attention, they shoulder the burden of securing his freedom.  It's another film, like the inferior Ghosts of Mississippi and the superior Amistad, in which the black man is only able to achieve his deliverance through the action of white hands.The American system is a corrupt one, yes, and has perhaps more often worked against blacks than for them.  However, the necessities of dramatic condensation has caused The Hurricane to channel its criticisms of the system into one man, the fictional cop Della Pesca, played as a one-dimensional bigoted thug by Dan Hedaya.  Those unfamiliar with the facts of this story will come away believing that the case of Hurricane Carter was not a story of a miscarriage of justice, but of what one white man's hatred did to an innocent black man's life.  Still, even with these criticisms, there is much to admire in this film.  The acting is fairly consistent and strong throughout the film (though Washington pretty much acts everyone else off the screen), and Jewison's direction is classy and well-modulated.  The film's soundtrack is also nicely handled, with Christopher Young's moodily effective score intercut with classic tunes, including Bob Dylan's exhilarating ode to Carter.  Besides, it IS a pretty fascinating story, and thanks to Washington and Jewison, enough of that comes across to make The Hurricane an interesting and uplifting experience.  You do leave the film with the satisfaction that justice has at long last been done.  Hopefully, you'll also leave with a desire to go out and get the real facts of the story.

DO NOT READ IT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!I finally watched The Matrix on DVD  -- I give it a solid 8 out of 10.This movie is a heck of a lot a fun!   Let's face it, the most appealing things about this film were the awesome fight scenes, the shameless glorification of automatic weapons, the black leather, and Carrie-Ann Moss.So far I haven't seen many films in 1999 with a particularly outstanding performance by an actor, save Richard Farnsworth in The Straight Story.   But Mr. Fishburne would certainly get my vote for best performance!   I can't possible imagine anyone else better in that role.   He played it to perfection.   And Hugo Weaving's performance as `Agent Smith' was absolutely brilliant.However, I did find some faults with this film; the main one being the recycling of the most cliché' of science fiction plot lines, the messiah-deliver who was prophesied to free us all...blah, blah, blah....     Now that it's been done 14,000 times over, I think it's clearly time to finally lay that plot line to rest.... Also, the film was way too upbeat concerning the superiority of humans vs. machines.    Everyone knows machines are better.  (Speaking of clichés', how many times has the conflict of man vs. machine been explored in film-literally history?   About 50 million times???  Puh-lease....)Warner Brothers should have forced the Wachowski Brothers to include an apology to the makers of `Dark City' and `Terminator 2' in the opening credits.   (Not to mention `Dune,' `Metropolis,' H.G. Wells, and Stanley Kubrick&#133;.)And to be perfectly honest, that guy who made a deal with the agents to be put back into the matrix was the only intelligent one of the bunch.  (Say, isn't that `Guido, the Killer Pimp?')  He knew a good thing when he saw it.   Too bad he was such a jerk.   (Philosophical note If the dude asks to have his memories completely erased before taking on his new identity, then how does that differ from him just putting a bullet to his head and ending it right then and there????  Isn't the exact same thing accomplished?   OK class, who'd like to answer that one?)Besides all those negatives, this was the best martial arts film I've ever seen.  Jackie Chan finally has some competition.And yes, the agent's line about the failed Utopia matrix was very interesting; but if you think about it, it makes absolutely no sense.    The best way to keep a human being enslaved is to play off their appetites for food and sex.   Just keep giving them enough to want more, but never enough to reach complete satisfaction.   Those in the drug, porno, and entertainment industries know all about human enslavement.  It's not that a Utopian society would have failed because everyone would have considered it to be a fake, they'd be too busy satisfying the cravings of their flesh to notice.... but a Utopian Matrix would fail because of the evil, sinful nature of human beings.   Man is just too selfish to be able to create a successful Utopia here on earth, or even in a computer simulation.That's why Forbidden Planet is such a classic movie.   It shows that even when a society has everything it could possible want, there's no way to eliminate the wildcard of the id or sinful nature of man.   (Or, in the case of Forbidden Planet, the sinful nature of Krell....)   It was the Krell's inability to check their dark side that caused the destruction of their society.  So the A.I. machines built a world where humans could indulge their evil nature, a world identical to the one we currently live in. I liked the whole concept of the realization that the world around us is not all there is to reality.   On that point, the film scores some major bonus points in my book.Truth is the world that we see, feel, touch and smell everyday of our lives is a matrix of sorts.   Yet you won't find a bunch of amoral A.I. robots behind the curtain running the whole show, no matter how hard you look.   Rather, our world is run by a rather benevolent spirit whom most like to refer to as God.   He has sent many prophets, and even his own son to let us in on the secret, much like Morpheus acts as a prophet in this film, letting Neo and others in on the secret that is the Matrix.And much like Neo, God offers us the choice of the red and blue pills.   Either we can throw our lot in with him, or continue on in our quaint little deception that what we taste, see, feel & hear are the only things that are out there, nothing more.Throughout the course of human history, we have various examples of individuals who decided that the blue pill was for them Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Mussolini, Fruede, Nietzsche, T.H. Huxley; to name a few.   All of them devout atheists.   All of them believing all there is to this world is what their senses dictated to them, nothing more.   Then there are those who took the blue pill, like Mother Teresa, the Pope, Billy Graham, Albert Shcwietzer, C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and J.S. Bach.   All of them believers in a spiritual world more real than the world around us.   All of them committed, in their own way, of proclaiming this great truth to any that would listen.   As for me, I took the blue pill and threw my lot in with the benevolent higher power.   I don't regret it for a minute.

Now that it's been done 14,000 times over, I think it's clearly time to finally lay that plot line to rest.... Also, the film was way too upbeat concerning the superiority of humans vs. machines.

It's not that a Utopian society would have failed because everyone would have considered it to be a fake, they'd be too busy satisfying the cravings of their flesh to notice.... but a Utopian Matrix would fail because of the evil, sinful nature of human beings.   Man is just too selfish to be able to create a successful Utopia here on earth, or even in a computer simulation.That's why Forbidden Planet is such a classic movie.

This remake of Psycho could have been better with a more relaxed attitude about following the exact blocking of the scenes. This just makes you feel tense to see where they do and do not depart from the original. And if the Anne Heche and Julianne Moore roles had been reversed it would have been superior. No one cares if Anne Heche's Marion is killed; she has failed to make her character likeable as Janet Leigh did, whereas if Julianne Moore were killed off in the beginning it would be more upsetting.Last but not least, I have to say that Tony Perkins made the original Psycho what it was. Even though others have pointed it out, I must reiterate that this is the major, major problem with any remake. He was so effective in it that it typecast him as a psycho for the rest of his life. New audiences would not realize that Tony Perkins was previously cast in normal, romantic movies. When his flair for the nervous twitch was discovered it was all over for any other kind of role.Whereas this bland actor who tried to portray a psychopathic killer can go on tomorrow and play any kind of role under the sun.This was not the way to pay tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, but everyone knows this by now.Hopefully people will lay off this remake idea nowIn closing I want to point out that Hitchcock remade his own Man Who Knew Too Much and IMPROVED it.

No one cares if Anne Heche's Marion is killed; she has failed to make her character likeable as Janet Leigh did, whereas if Julianne Moore were killed off in the beginning it would be more upsetting.Last but not least, I have to say that Tony Perkins made the original Psycho what it was. Even though others have pointed it out, I must reiterate that this is the major, major problem with any remake. He was so effective in it that it typecast him as a psycho for the rest of his life. New audiences would not realize that Tony Perkins was previously cast in normal, romantic movies. When his flair for the nervous twitch was discovered it was all over for any other kind of role.Whereas this bland actor who tried to portray a psychopathic killer can go on tomorrow and play any kind of role under the sun.This was not the way to pay tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, but everyone knows this by now.Hopefully people will lay off this remake idea nowIn closing I want to point out that Hitchcock remade his own Man Who Knew Too Much and IMPROVED it. Now, if this Psycho was truly Hitchcockian it would have been greater than the original. That did not happen!

It wasn't the best gay themed movie i've seen, for it wasn't terribly dark, moving, or funny.  But, at moments, the film manages to have very moving scenes while at other moments, you're cracking up with laughter.  It treats its subject matter very normally, which is a good thing.  I think this film can be entertaining for anyone--gay or straight and everything in between, for it doesn't strictly concentrate on what it's like being young and gay.  It shares a glimpse of two boys who discover their sexuality in the midst of other subplots---such as dealing with an abusive family situation and having a very eccentric mother....and having to share an apartment complex with some pretty goofy neighbors. Yet, if you are looking for a movie which makes a comment on homosexuality, this film indeed accomplishes that.  I think the moral of the story is simple  these two boys find each other, fall for each other, and deal with the everyday problems of a relationship. Their only problem is having to deal the people who view their lifestyle as sick or twisted.  But the movie never gets too dark and is actually very hopeful, especially at the somewhat moving close.

Do not let the fact that it is a Rambo movie put you off that its just a dumb action. It has such great film art in it. It was great in all ways. The script, the music score and the characters and acting. All was just great. It was not until the next film that the legendary tough guy dumb adventure film became famous.A vietnam veteran returning from the war goes to meet his last friend but discovers that he has died too along with all his other friends in the army. Now, with no where to go, not much faith in what to do, walks to a town just to get some food, where he easily becomes an enemy with the towns sherrif. His appearence quickly annoys the cop and after a bit of ruffle, Rambo is arrested but shortly after, escapes from the local police station and goes on the hide in a forest on a mountain where a manhunt groups.The story becomes very captivating and suspenseful with some great stunts. The deprest, loner John Rambo gives a great little comment on the events that took place in Vietnam. The disrespect from the government and people of the United States of America towards the men who were forced to go out and protect their country. A movie describing unloyal people.In this movie, Rambo actually doesn't kill a single person while the legend of the story is that he takes on a hundred guys and kills them all at once is so untrue. It is a good movie. Great fun but serious all the same.This is one you have to watch. A fantastic film which is many times over and over again better than Star Wars as it is set un reality and involves a captivating script. Just wonderful.

Does it sound like I'm yelling at you?? Well if it does, then you have a basic idea of what this movie is about. It's loud, brash and not all that subtle.Any Given Sunday is a football movie...American football in case any of you were wondering. It's about a team that has an aging star quarterback, Jack Rooney (Dennis Quad) and an aging coach, Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino). The two have been together for years and the relationship is more of a father-son relationship than it is a player-coach relationship. The season hasn't been going very well and to make matters worse, Rooney gets injured early in the season and will be out indefinitely. He's in the hospital and the team turns to their backup quarterback; a not too bright guy. The team goes on a losing streak and eventually the backup gets hurt too. In goes the third string guy, Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx). After a rough start, things begin to turn around as Beaman begins to change the plays and do the things that he wants. The problem is that the team is winning and Beaman has gone from a third string quarterback to a star player in the league. The team makes it to the playoffs and Rooney recovers from his injury. Now the coach has to make a decision of who to play. Does he stay loyal to Rooney or does he go with the brash, out of control but talented Beaman? The coach has very little control and management, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) is demanding results yet has an agenda of her own.If the story sounds a little convoluted to you then you're not alone. I found it hard at times to follow and very loud. There was music running almost constantly and the camera shots of the football games were very quick and in your face. Be warned, if you have epilepsy, you may suffer a seizure. I know I almost did with they way they cut scenes and how loud it was. This movie was unbelievably long too. It's almost three hours long and when you think it's about to end, it drags out another 20 minutes. I do have to say though, the ending was interesting. I'm not sure if it depicts how football life really is though. I've never played so I can't comment on it.Despite those negatives, I have to say that Al Pacino was very good. But more surprisingly, I liked Cameron Diaz's performance. I saw her in Something About Mary and thought she was ok at best but in this movie she was extremely good. This is the first time that I have seen Jamie Foxx and I actually liked him quite a bit. Look to him for more good things in the future. Overall, I'm luke warm to this movie.

People have always been selling their possessions in exchange for wealth. It's been a long time since they started selling out even very private things (like their own body). EDTV is about giving away our ultimate belonging... our life. And the movie is very effective in showing how it's in our nature to complain about the loss of something only after such thing is gone. One might argue that the movie is quite lengthy, that it takes way too much time for the director to prove his point. But maybe Ron Howard wanted to test how morbid the spectators could really be... and I am not talking about those in the movie, I am talking about us. After all the only real bad guy of EDTV is the public itself, the only one who can never get enough of Ed's life and misfortunes. But where does this place us?

Neither is particularly scary, but Deep Rising is at least amusing (in a good tongue-in-cheek kind of way).

He takes on a whole lot more than just Welles, however, and Cradle Will Rock emerges as a timely and captivating story of the dangerous web woven when art, commerce and politics mix.The Cradle Will Rock was originally slated to be a production mounted by the Federal Theater Project, a government-funded arts coalition which gave unemployed theatricals jobs during the Depression.  However, like many other people's groups during this period, the FTP eventually fell under suspicion of Communist leanings, and the feds locked the theater prior to Cradle's opening show.  That didn't stop its director, Welles, and its producer, John Houseman, from marching the whole cast and crew twenty-one blocks to another theater, where the composer, Marc Blitzstein, played the score from the stage while the actors performed from the seats (thereby saving their union status and keeping their jobs).This story is intercut with the conflict between fatcat-in-training Nelson Rockefeller and left-leaning artist Diego Rivera, who is hired to paint a mural for the lobby of Rockefeller Center under the false pretenses that he will be permitted to express himself.  It was a scary time in America in many ways.  Artists were being shut down and blackballed for expressing the threatening philosophy that the working man should be entitled to his fair share.  The government found Communists in every backyard, and ruined many decent people's lives, while the rich businessmen who kept the politicos in office were free to hobnob with Hitler and Mussolini for the sake of their business interests.  It was the only time in American history when arts projects were fully supported by the government, and the results show that artists should probably never put their fate into federal hands again.   It's a lot for one story to tackle, and great credit goes to Robbins for keeping it all clear, interesting, and immensely entertaining.  He shows a style and verve here that his previous two films, for all their skill, lacked.  He's like Robert Altman crossed with Woody Allen here, and his elegant, confident work should not be ignored at Oscar time.  The film breathes with authenticity, and the cinematography of Jean Yves Escoffier glimmers.Still, the true hats are off to the superb ensemble cast, who take what could have been an intriguing but staid history lesson and truly engage us in the roiling emotions of the people involved.  All are superb, but special mention goes to Bill Murray, whose work as a Red-hating ventriloquist who falls hard for a like-minded government worker surpasses his turn in Rushmore, Angus Macfadyen, who has a ball playing Welles as a loud but exuberant perpetual showman, John Turturro, who dazzles as a proud FTP actor, and especially Vanessa Redgrave, who turns in a zesty comic performance as a countess whose marriage to a gladhanding steel tycoon hasn't dulled her revolutionary zeal.Rudolph Giuliani, Jesse Helms, and the entire federal government should be sent on a field trip to see Cradle Will Rock.  Not only will they be supremely entertained, but they might take something away with them that will help us all in the long run.

Well, we've all seen it (more than once too) and most of us loved it so what's left to say? Well, I want to praise you like I should, as the song goes. This is a film I shouldn't have liked as it's yet another cartoon from America and I tried hard not to. Glip? Trite ? Meritricious?....but to no avail, I'm doomed to love this genuinely gobsmacking picture. The one fault it has is it's ten minutes too long. You think Guys, I love you, but you're exhausting me so let's rap it up, which they do with such a spine tingling, poignant and phenomenal ending that you forgive it even that flaw. The song over the end titles was so hot I stayed right to the end. It's rare you leave an American film thinking it's the best film ever made and the most fun you've ever had in a theatre. Many couldn't accept the plot twist and I think this is because they loved the character in question so much. The radical and brave departure was right though. It made for a funnier and more truthful film as most men aren't supercool like that. Others have complained that the film doesn't take a clear stand and leaves you to have to make up your own mind. Surely this is it's virtue and what makes it so unusual? Is it profound or just a comedy about a man who goes mad? Is the ending optimistic or does it say that trying to change your life or society is futile or unattainable due to man's inherent flaws and vanities? Script, direction and performances are masterly and will set the bench mark for others to beat for years to come, not that film making is a race. There are so many great lines and observations that it's almost four films in one. The scene where Durden speculates that god may, in fact, hate you is a whole theme for a film in itself. There are some nice in-jokes. I presume the narrator wanted to fight William Shatner because of that Star Trek episode 'Shore Leave' where Kirk has an outrageously long and violent punch up with a man called Finnegan who is not real. It all ties in. The film's ending may go along more conventional lines with a ticking bomb but I suspect this is just to send up guy movies whereby someone has to always decide which wire to pull. And this is the ultimate guy pic. Another reviewer below made the astute observation that the film is really quite humane and the humour is never sarcastic but has a more Zen like reflectiveness. That's on the money. Whether you like the film will depend on your sense of humour which varies from person to person. It pokes fun at men and our need to follow others as well as other foibles. It is also ambivalent and unjudgemental about our need for aggression and excitement. I remember about three years I thought about asking my sister's commanlaw husband to have a punch up with me just for fun. I don't know why, but it proves the film is on to something. At the end of the day this film may just be rock and roll, a fun picture not to be taken too seriously. I think it was Tarkovsky who said that lots of editing and trying to entertain an audience visually was inimicable to great art. This film pulls off the trick of both leading you on and also being very wide open. It may fall into the trap of trying to make the lead character more sympathetic to the audience by making him appear ignorant of his own mayhem, and empathy is good box office, but as I said before you really have to clutch at straws to criticise this stunning and outrageous picture. The studio who financed it took a risk in making a film with content you'd expect to see in an indi feature, so reward their faith by going to see this picture or there won't be another for a long time.
