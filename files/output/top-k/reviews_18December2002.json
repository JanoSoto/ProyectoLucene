There are a number that emerge as B-movie classics such as The Beastmaster, but most are just plain rubbish with cheesy acting and cheesier effects, like Dungeons and Dragons. Conan the Barbarian is one of the few fantasy movies to combine a good story, with excellent production values and believable acting, all tied up with a score that it is just perfect for the film.Likewise, there are some roles where you can't help but feel that no one else but the original actor can play that part...ever! Arnold Schwarzenegger is Conan. No if's, but's or maybe's about it. I can't think of anyone who could do the role justice and I don't mean just physically. Let's be honest, Arnie isn't a fantastic actor, but he knows what he can and can't get away with. And the strong, silent hero (or villain, a la Terminator) is his forte.Add to his performance the likes of James Earl Jones as the bad guy, Mako as the wizard and a great performance by Gerry Lopez (who was a surfer, I believe) as Conan's side-kick and you can't really go too wrong.Basil Poledouris' score is first class and really captures the mood and theme of the whole film. His Anvil of Crom theme will always be one of my favourites.The plot is interesting in that its a classic tale of revenge, with Conan seeking the warlord that murdered his people whilst he was only a child. The fact that the warlord has become the leader of an evil cult and that kings and rulers would also like him dead means nothing to Conan. Revenge is all he is interested in. Nothing more, nothing less.This is a great movie and well worth watching. Even taking into consideration such recent films as LOTR it still holds up well on its own merits and will do for years to come.

That quality of a movie made me long for this kind of Star Trek movie.  This is a movie that defines Star Trek, boldly going, seeking out new life and civilizations, protecting mankind, and doing all of this with the best of intentions.  There is nothing dark about movies like this whereas the most recent entries in the Star Trek franchises have been very dark.In this Star Trek we find the crew of the Enterprise not at all on the Enterprise.  Instead they are on a hijacked Klingon vessel they hijacked from the third one.  They decide to journey home, where they are in hot water for stealing a Klingon vessel and the Klingons are not happy about it.  Also back home are Spock's worried father, Sarek, and Admiral Cartwright, played nicely by Brock Peters.  On their way home the crew encounters a probe of unknown origin.  This unknown probe is destroying everything in site and it is heading for Earth.  SPOILER  Mr. Spock identifies the signals this probe is giving as whale signals.  The crew deciphers that they are trying to send signals to earth.  Here is the problem  The probe appears to be trying to contact a form of whale that was extinct long ago.So what do they do?  OF COURSE!!!  Why didn't I think of that?  They go back in time to take a whale from the twentieth century and bring it to the future to save mankind yet again.  This is perhaps the most successful installment of Star Trek.  This installment is relatively lighthearted compared to other installments in the series.  There are no great battles in this movie or real intense moments.  But this is just a decent little film. One thing I like about this movie is the socially conscious element.  This movie really talks about an important issue in this time frame and that is environment preservation and species protection.  Few people look at it and I am glad this movie did.  The movie has its very funny moments as well, including the crew trying to blend in during modern times, as well as Spock cussing, that's great!!There was a scene where the Star Trek people were in front of a group of TV screens and originally the screens were suppose to have old episodes of Star Trek.  Why didn't they?  It would have been great.  But this Star Trek gives way to intensity and Science Fiction and makes for great light-hearted entertainment.  To me this is the second best Star Trek the first is the Undiscovered Country, in the original.  I have to say First Contact is the second best movie overall.This was the last ever Star Trek before the Next Generation.  For 21 years this was the only Star Trek, still the best Star Trek and still very entertaining.

In the end I had to award both of them for bringing it on.2) Girls who watch this get really...inspired  by this movie.

Probably a lot of people disagree with me, but I feel that this is the best film of all time. Even though, after seeing Hardball many times it may have lost some touch, I have not forgotten the effect it had on me the first time I saw it.In Hardball Keanu Reeves plays a gambler who is offered to get paid under the table by a friend, if he coaches a Little League baseball team for children in the Cabrini Green Housing Projects. Really, I feel that this film is no more about gambling than it is about baseball, even though there's a lot of baseball. I feel that this film is really about one man's conversion brought on by the children he coaches. He touches their lives and they touch his. Keanu Reeves is also touched with a light, chaste romance with Diane Lane as a school teacher of some of the team's boys.Some people may have felt that this film is predictable or formulaic, but I felt everything flowed so beautifully that it seemed real and felt great. As a matter of fact, I feel that Hardball doesn't fall prey to certain cliches.The acting is great, the music is electrifying, the cinematography very good, humor is there, and Hardball is ultimately uplifting and moving.

I think most people are upset, because they wanted to see Rocky get in the ring with Tommy Gunn, but this movie returned Rocky to his roots. While I loved Rocky III and Rocky IV, they were over the top. Rocky once again questioning his importance and doubting himself makes for a great movie. I feel this movie is the best acting that was done in the series next to the origanl Rocky. And people find stupid things to complain about for this movie like Rocky Jr's age. Rocky's son, who was a minor and less important character than Duke (Apollo's trainer) in the previous movies, is finally given a meaningful role and it really matters that he inexplainly ages. Who cares?

Okay, well let me start out from the beginning. I loved happy, romantic comedies for a long time. A Family member and I were on vacation and happen to go see A.I.-(Great Movie As Well)- I had already seen it, but what I hadn't seen the first time was the trailer of Serendipity. When with my relative, the second time, I did! I told myself I had to see it.2 Months or so went by and I am setting on my bed, eating dinner, and I almost, literally, drop my plate. There it was, on TV, Serendipity Sneak Preview- Saturday Night. So, a friend and I went to see the preview, and I loved it-(even though I missed a really good part, when I went to the bathroom- laugh) So, I sat there, watching an awesome cast tell this amazing story, of love, fate, & destiny. The first thing that popped in my head was Christmas In Manhattan. First of all, I love Christmas movies, and this one hit the spot. Now, you're probably wondering what I'm talking about when saying Christmas In Manhattan. Well, there is this CD, produced by David Huntsinger, called the exact same name. I got it back in 1997, for like $4 at Wal-Mart, the Christmas music on it was so excellent, and peaceful, that you felt you were actually in New York! So, since Serendipity is about Christmas In Manhattan I was thrilled, and it was a wonderful, elegent film. So good, that I still actually have my ticket from the sneak preview. It was Saturday, September 29, 2001, it was a night to remember.I saw it once more on the big screen, then it finally came to video April 9, 2002. Sadly, I decided to save my money for other DVD's. Boy, did I make the wrong decision. So, 3 months ago I used a Wal-Mart gift card someone had gotton me, and bought My Big Fat Greek Wedding Soundtrack, and Serendipity DVD! Since then I have watched it over 22 times, not to mention all the times I already watched it, because right after it came out I kept on renting it! Now, I also own the soundtrack, which I can't stop listening too.Wow, what a movie! A great cast, plot, and soundtrack. I can honestly say that Serendipity has got me through rouge times, and through life since it entered my life back in 2001! I always turn to it, and it always entertains me. The lovely music from such artists as Shawn Colvin, Louis Armstrong, Wood, and so many more make you cry tears of joy, and John Cusake & Kate Beckinsale along with the whole cast make you cheer for more! And little things like Christmas In Manhattan for me make it even better. Do not think for one minute doubting Serendipity.I Have entered it into my family as well. I've also got my 2 stepsisters, who are 4 & 8 years-old hooked on it as well. So as you can see it's a great movie for all ages! Serendipity will lead you to a poweful faith in what the ancients used to call fatum- what we currently refer to as destiny!
