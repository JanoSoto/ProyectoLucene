Fame, for Allen, is an unpleasant by-product of success, like cavities are a national by-product of too much sugar, both to be accepted, but certainly not enjoyed.While only a minor film with limited tricks, this is almost a horror movie set not in darkness among people that want to hurt or rob, but in bright sunshine among people that  want to praise, support and coattail.Easy to see why people don't enjoy it though and watching it twice would be a folly.

Its most notable feature is the director, King Vidor, master of silent film making. As you might expect, many of the important scenes have little or no dialog. In one scene between Lionel Barrymore and Lillian Gish, he rambles on about their life together, while she strains to get out of her sickbed and crosses slowly to him, the entire distance transfigured by the depth of her love for him. Gish was a great star of silent film, with a wonderful, expressive face, full of compassion and grace. In another scene that happens under quite different circumstances, Jennifer Jones crawls to Gregory Peck, the man she loves, also without words, evincing great sorrow and quiet dignity. In both cases, the women prove they are far more noble than the men who love them so badly. Jones also has a mobile face, together with a beautiful, resonant voice. No film that has these two ladies at its center should be missed. In addition, the film has two marvelous scenes that, at the time of its making, would have been just as impressive as some of today's special effects wonders In the first, about 20 armed horsemen face a crowd of railway workers, including some chinese, clothed in authentic period dress, with a steam engine in the background. As the tensions mount, a troop of mounted cavalry, about 100 strong, ride onto the set, filmed on location (judging by the saguarros and ocatillos) in Arizona. This was a tour de force of filmmaking at a time when shooting on location was rare. In the second scene, a train under a full head of steam jumps the tracks and plows down an embankment. Filmed in early technicolor, this movie has lush exteriors and panoramas of rich desert color. Two more character actors should be mentioned, both of whom steal every scene they enter Butterfly McQueen, the maid whose comments are both simple and profound, and Walter Huston, as the crusty sheriff who doubles as a preacher during a funeral.

Either way, it was certainly not the worst movie of all time, but a definite turkey. I'm not even that good at guessing what's going to happen in movies because I usually just watch and let things happen, but I think my 6 month old daughter could have seen the twists coming and figured just about all of them out. I knew right away this was the same director as House of Games because of that horrible delivery where you feel like you're watching a bad play. Could Mrs. Mamet actually not be a terrible actress, but rather given bad direction? Were the weird sayings people would throw out there meant to not be funny? Was there actually supposed to be any guesswork or suspense here? These are the questions I'm left with.

I gave it 2 pts above the lowest rating for a) Steve Martin trying something different and doing pretty well considering and b) I made it through the whole movie without really wanting to turn it off that badly.

This one was actually worse than House of Games, which up until this point was the most amateurish I had ever seen in a non-home movie. The Spanish Prisoner had a bit higher budget and as a result H.O.G. may still be the leader in crudeness, but at least House had some suspense. I don't even know where to begin with this movie- the bad acting? The ridiculous things the main character did? Perhaps the delivery of the lines which one source so rightly called staccato. Either way, it was certainly not the worst movie of all time, but a definite turkey. I'm not even that good at guessing what's going to happen in movies because I usually just watch and let things happen, but I think my 6 month old daughter could have seen the twists coming and figured just about all of them out. I knew right away this was the same director as House of Games because of that horrible delivery where you feel like you're watching a bad play. Could Mrs. Mamet actually not be a terrible actress, but rather given bad direction? Were the weird sayings people would throw out there meant to not be funny?

He's a B-movie screenwriter, but is trying to graduate to real films. His latest film, however, is considered Communistic, and he's blacklisted. As he's driving on a very fake-looking bridge, he crashes and loses his memory. He winds up on a beach and is taken to a small, idyllic town, which lost many people to the war. It turns out that people think that he's Luke Trimble, a war hero, and Harry Trimble's (Martin Landau) son.I didn't believe for a minute that Peter was actually Luke and Harry's son. I think that there was supposed to be some sort of mystery of whether Peter was actually Luke or anyone, but you could probably guess. When Peter didn't know, I thought that he didn't really have chemistry with Harry. Most of the small-town sets were just façades, just like in westerns. When I took a studio tour of Universal Studios last summer, I noticed how similar everything was. I think we shouldn't have known whether Peter was Luke or if Luke was Peter, etc.Another thing that seemed fake was Adele's (Laurie Holden) hiccups that she got whenever she was nervous. They didn't really need to be there, because it's 150-minute runtime is hard enough to sit through, and they didn't really add any humor.The Majestic is the name of the movie theater in the town where Harry lives, and now that they think that Luke is back, they decide to open it. That's about the worse reason for naming a movie (besides Swimfan, of course). In fact, if that entire worthless subplot was taken out, the runtime could have been chopped by 45 minutes or so.Carrey proves that he's better at drama than at slapstick comedy yet again. After his terrific acting role in The Truman Show, he's one of the better points of The Majestic. Why he continues to do idiotic comedy, I don't know, when he could be doing much better in drama. Landau was also quite good, although I would have liked his role to be bigger. Another person's role that was small that I wanted larger was Amanda Detmer's role as Sandra, Peter's girlfriend. She's a good actress, and she should be better known. There was something about Laurie Holden. She just didn't do anything for me.As I look on my notes, I see I wrote `authentic if fakey music', which contradicts itself. I think I meant that the music seemed real for the time-period, but it seemed made just for that period and this movie. Understand what I mean? Well, neither do I. And, like all time-piece dramas, there has to be a climactic courtroom scene which concludes with the main character giving a monologue on where America went wrong, etc.It had some good drama, but it just wasn't enough for me. They could have reworked it and released it later to make it better, which they could do a lot of.My rating 6\/10Rated PG for language and mild thematic elements.

I think we've all had times with one thing or another where we had one day to put together something we knew nothing about. Well, that's how Bill and Ted feel in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, when they find out they have one day to present a history speech at school, or they will flunk.Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are two high-school clowns from San Dimas, California, without a clue. Literally. They don't know a single thing about history and are as dense as dense can be. Bill believes Napolean to be a short, dead dude, and Ted thinks Joan of Ark was Noah's wife. But they try to clean their act up after their history teacher threatens to flunk them both unless they come up with a good history presentation that same day. Things turn even more heinous when Ted finds out his father is going to ship him off to military school in Alaska if he doesn't pass. Whoa.The two dudes are in most righteous trouble. If Ted is shipped off to military school in Alaska, Bill and Ted will never complete forming their rock band, the Wyld Stallyns. But they have no idea of just how important they are in the future until Rufus (George Carlin) comes back in time from the future with a time-travelling phone booth. He tells the two dudes that in the future they solve world hunger, bring peace to the world, and stop war, all through their music. Sounds like The Beatles. Anyway, the two teens are surprised and take Rufus' phone booth through time, trying to learn history first-hand. But along the way they learn that instead of taking history from their surroundings mentally, why not take history from their surroundings PHYSICALLY?  Bill and Ted start to pinch historical figures and bring them back to the eighties. These figures include Napolean (who takes a trip to San Dimas' Waterloo fun park), Socrates, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, Gengis Khan, Billy the Kid and Abraham Lincoln. But the two pals still have a lot of obstacles in their path if they wish to successfully pass history class. Dude!Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of those movies that is hilarious in the beginning, funny in the middle, and outrageously, screamingly hysterical towards the end. I'll admit the first time I saw this film I didn't enjoy it much, but I saw it at a local video store for a few bucks on DVD and couldn't pass up the deal. I bought it along with Spaceballs and left Bill and Ted for last viewing. I finally watched it again today, and it was more than surprising. It was great! It cleverly combines eighties-type-humor with an original, if somewhat borrowed plot.It's predictable, yes, but on a scale of enjoyability it scores a solid 4 out of 5. A lot of times we can forsee many events, and unlike the Back to the Future films, the idea of time travel itself isn't played upon as much as it is there just as a reason to get historical figures into the eighties. The phonebooth had a lot more potential; and when they did start phone booth paradoxes, most of the time they were never fully resolved, and didn't make sense. But that is not really what the film is here for. It isn't Back to the Future. The story isn't centered around the time machine and\/or what it can do, but rather what you could bring back with you. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is nowhere near as good as Back to the Future Part 1 or 2, but I didn't expect it to be.The best parts of the film are when they play on what historical figures would do given the chance to be thrusted into a new year. Bill and Ted bring the different characters into the San Dimas mall, where Genghis Khan proceeds to wreck a sportshop, Joan of Ark tries her hand at becoming a fitness instructer, Beethoven plays the electronic piano in the mall, Socrates goes ice-skating, Sigmund Freud hits on women and asks cops about their mothers in an interrogation with another psychiatrist, etc., etc., etc...I won't ruin anymore for you, nor give away the specifics and outcomes of this mall exploration, but I will tell you that there is nothing more enjoyable for a Friday night then watching important, key-historical figures from different time eras exploring the 1980s. I know someone who gets mad at the Abe Lincoln speech and really hates this movie, but I think it's all good fun.Much like Back to the Future played on time-travel and its impact, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure plays on the epic question, Just what would historical figures think of modern-day life?, and while the outcome isn't as evenly funny or amusing as Back to the Future, it's still a wildly funny film that will entertain you, if nothing else.4\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"27 April 2003","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  *Some Minor Spoilers*Do you remember in high school, when you had a day to come up with something good or you were afraid of flunking?

I know someone who gets mad at the Abe Lincoln speech and really hates this movie, but I think it's all good fun.Much like Back to the Future played on time-travel and its impact, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure plays on the epic question, Just what would historical figures think of modern-day life?, and while the outcome isn't as evenly funny or amusing as Back to the Future, it's still a wildly funny film that will entertain you, if nothing else.4\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Music"},{"date":"27 April 2003","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Frankly speaking, when I hired the movie I was expecting something much worse.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"27 April 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  There are several themes that run through many of Alfred Hitchcock's films. Theme is described by the Oxford English Dictionary as, `the subject of discourse, discussion, conversation, meditation or composition; a topic.' With this definition the themes of Hitchcock's movie are the underlying message he is trying to impart to the viewer. In Rear Window one of the main themes Hitchcock is exploring is the idea of voyeurism, the pleasure people derive from watching others. The idea of voyeurism is the overarching point of the film; you cannot watch Rear Window and not be drawn into Jeff's (played by James Stewart) voyeuristic ways. Almost the entire film is shot from Jeff's point of view, so the audience sees exactly what Jeff is seeing. Another important aspect of this voyeurism that cannot be overlooked is the commentary Hitchcock is giving on cinema as a whole. When a patron buys a movie ticket they are paying for the privilege of watching other people's lives for around two hours. In real life they would be arrested as `Peeping Toms', as Jeff's nurse warns him about. This idea of the moviegoers participating in voyeurism can also be seen in Hitchcock's film Sabotage. In it the main characters own a movie theater.  The patrons are then paralleled with the New Scotland Yard detective who is watching the owners. While the entire film is a commentary on voyeurism we will examine two scenes closely to better understand how Hitchcock was able to make such a fascinating film about how much people enjoy watching other people. The first scene we will examine is the opening scene in which the viewer is introduce to the occupants of the building outside Jeff's `rear window'. The viewer is treated to unobstructed views into the personal lives of the inhabitants whether they be sleeping, shaving, or dancing. Within each window Jeff, and therefore the viewer is treated to a different genre of film. The woman Jeff describes as `Miss Lonelyhearts' is a melodrama, the love story of the newlyweds, and the murder - mystery of the Thornwalds.One technique Hitchcock uses to get his point across about the movie viewer being a voyeur is through the constant use of Point of View shots. Therefore, the viewer sees only what Jeff sees. They are not treated to shots from inside the other apartments. This leads to a desire within the viewer to know more about what is occurring in the other building, just as Jeff grows ever more curious. Similarly, when Mr. Thornwald looks up and catches Jeff peeping the angle stays with Jeff's point of view so that Thronwald is looking directly at the viewer; almost accusing them of being an accomplice. Another scene where the viewer is drawn farther into Jeff's world of spying is the scene where Mr. and Mrs. Thornwald get into an argument. The viewer watches, as Jeff does, the couple fighting. However, the viewer gets no more information from the couple than Jeff does. Hitchcock does not cut to a shot from within their apartment. Instead, the viewer is left wondering what is being argued about, just like Jeff. One of the techniques Hitchcock uses to reinforce this distance from the action and voyeuristic tendencies of the audience is the dialogue left out in this scene and the noise that is placed in the scene. Perhaps the voices of the Thronwalds would have traveled across the courtyard if everything were perfectly quiet. However, the movie takes place in New York City where there is a constant buzz of noise that obstructs the viewers' and Jeff's ability to hear. Again, Hitchcock is forcing the viewer to deal with only having the information Jeff has. Most moviegoers feel uncomfortable with this since they are used to being all-knowing. Similarly, this drone of city noise is overcome when the poodle owner finds her dead dog. It leads to an aggravating and unsettling feeling for the audience and Jeff. While some things can be heard in the courtyard, most things cannot be heard from the apartments. Therefore, when Thronwald is getting ready to attack Jeff we are left wondering if anyone will be able to hear his cries for help and come to his aid. It is a masterful device set up by Hitchcock. As a whole Rear Window is a fascinating examination with culture, both the cinema and the outside world. People will forever be mesmerized by the lives of others. Even if it brings danger to themselves or the ones they love. It is innate in the human psyche and Hitchcock does a wonderful job of showing through this film.

While the entire film is a commentary on voyeurism we will examine two scenes closely to better understand how Hitchcock was able to make such a fascinating film about how much people enjoy watching other people. The first scene we will examine is the opening scene in which the viewer is introduce to the occupants of the building outside Jeff's `rear window'. The viewer is treated to unobstructed views into the personal lives of the inhabitants whether they be sleeping, shaving, or dancing. Within each window Jeff, and therefore the viewer is treated to a different genre of film. The woman Jeff describes as `Miss Lonelyhearts' is a melodrama, the love story of the newlyweds, and the murder - mystery of the Thornwalds.One technique Hitchcock uses to get his point across about the movie viewer being a voyeur is through the constant use of Point of View shots. Therefore, the viewer sees only what Jeff sees. They are not treated to shots from inside the other apartments. This leads to a desire within the viewer to know more about what is occurring in the other building, just as Jeff grows ever more curious. Similarly, when Mr. Thornwald looks up and catches Jeff peeping the angle stays with Jeff's point of view so that Thronwald is looking directly at the viewer; almost accusing them of being an accomplice. Another scene where the viewer is drawn farther into Jeff's world of spying is the scene where Mr. and Mrs. Thornwald get into an argument. The viewer watches, as Jeff does, the couple fighting. However, the viewer gets no more information from the couple than Jeff does. Hitchcock does not cut to a shot from within their apartment. Instead, the viewer is left wondering what is being argued about, just like Jeff. One of the techniques Hitchcock uses to reinforce this distance from the action and voyeuristic tendencies of the audience is the dialogue left out in this scene and the noise that is placed in the scene. Perhaps the voices of the Thronwalds would have traveled across the courtyard if everything were perfectly quiet. However, the movie takes place in New York City where there is a constant buzz of noise that obstructs the viewers' and Jeff's ability to hear. Again, Hitchcock is forcing the viewer to deal with only having the information Jeff has. Most moviegoers feel uncomfortable with this since they are used to being all-knowing. Similarly, this drone of city noise is overcome when the poodle owner finds her dead dog. It leads to an aggravating and unsettling feeling for the audience and Jeff. While some things can be heard in the courtyard, most things cannot be heard from the apartments. Therefore, when Thronwald is getting ready to attack Jeff we are left wondering if anyone will be able to hear his cries for help and come to his aid. It is a masterful device set up by Hitchcock. As a whole Rear Window is a fascinating examination with culture, both the cinema and the outside world. People will forever be mesmerized by the lives of others. Even if it brings danger to themselves or the ones they love. It is innate in the human psyche and Hitchcock does a wonderful job of showing through this film.  ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"27 April 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  There are several themes that run through many of Alfred Hitchcock's films. Theme is described by the Oxford English Dictionary as, `the subject of discourse, discussion, conversation, meditation or composition; a topic.' With this definition the themes of Hitchcock's movie are the underlying message he is trying to impart to the viewer. In Rear Window one of the main themes Hitchcock is exploring is the idea of voyeurism, the pleasure people derive from watching others. The idea of voyeurism is the overarching point of the film; you cannot watch Rear Window and not be drawn into Jeff's (played by James Stewart) voyeuristic ways. Almost the entire film is shot from Jeff's point of view, so the audience sees exactly what Jeff is seeing. Another important aspect of this voyeurism that cannot be overlooked is the commentary Hitchcock is giving on cinema as a whole. When a patron buys a movie ticket they are paying for the privilege of watching other people's lives for around two hours. In real life they would be arrested as `Peeping Toms', as Jeff's nurse warns him about. This idea of the moviegoers participating in voyeurism can also be seen in Hitchcock's film Sabotage. In it the main characters own a movie theater.  The patrons are then paralleled with the New Scotland Yard detective who is watching the owners. While the entire film is a commentary on voyeurism we will examine two scenes closely to better understand how Hitchcock was able to make such a fascinating film about how much people enjoy watching other people.
