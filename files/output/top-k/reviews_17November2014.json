[{"date":"17 November 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Adapted from the Patricia Highsmith novel, this film details the adventures of twenty-something Tom Ripley, a New York City nobody who gets a chance to travel to Italy to persuade a playboy to return to his American roots. And when opportunity knocks, Ripley opens the door. This film is an expensive, splashy Hollywood production with big name stars, and shot in multiple locations in Italy. Naturally, the scenery is enthralling.The story is very good, but the plot here is mediocre. The rationale for multiple plot points is lost on me. Why did Ripley feel the need to learn jazz before leaving New York? What was the point of the lady who drowned in the water? Why was the Meredith character included, apart from giving Ripley more headaches with his identity crisis? The film was about thirty minutes too long. And some of these vague plot points could have been zapped.Casting and acting are okay, except for Matt Damon who plays the lead character. I never did see Tom Ripley; all I saw was Matt Damon. See Matt smile; see Matt move his lips; see Matt smile and move his lips again. Was Damon not interested in his role? Probably the best performances were Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchett, both in support roles.I had already seen Purple Noon (1960), the first version of the Ripley story. Maybe because I have such a fond memory of Purple Noon, I'm a bit biased against this 1999 version. But Purple Noon had better casting and plot. The visuals in both films are equally good.Despite the casting of Matt Damon and the mediocre plot, The Talented Mr. Ripley is still worth watching, owing mostly to the original concept and story from the source material.
