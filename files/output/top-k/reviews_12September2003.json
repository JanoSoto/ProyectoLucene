Quality of the animation is just great, pictures are both scary and beautiful. I ensure you that you could watch this movie just for the visual side of it. Music is even better, i wonder why you people don't mention music when commenting on this film. Sincerely, it must be one of the best film musics i've ever heard, it makes 'climate' all the time. Action goes really fast, some ideas are really cool (talking hand for ex.) and there are NOT such dialogues like Oh my God, how did he gain such a power?! or You are nothing to me, i have much greater power than you! in addition to constant overkill and mass-destruction, which is so anime-typical and really annoys me. Wchich doesn't mean they don't fight there, but it's just made a little different. The only things i didn't like about this film are general look of Marcus' brothers' team - they seem to have escaped from Mad Max, and maybe some of 'romantic' dialogues a la -My dear! -My love! -My dear!, but they really don't make this movie any worse.

The fact that they resonate with such power to someone who has no personal or professional ties with the country speaks volumes. My first viewing of this film was anticipated with equal amounts excitement and trepidation. How could a film of such enormous stature possibly live up to anyone's expectations, let alone mine? Over two and a half hours later I realised I would probably never see a finer film in my life. And about six or seven years on from that revelatory experience, that view grows ever stronger. With the exception of The Godfather Part Two that is. But that's a film for another day. The Godfather is now so much a part of our culture that it becomes difficult to talk about it as a film by itself. Entire books have been written on how it has not only affected change in the way films are conceived by individuals and whole studios, but also the very nature of the film industry itself. At the time nobody could have predicted that a lengthy (and costly) film set in the 1940's with a relatively little know cast and a serious and weighty subject matter could have made such a huge profit at the box office. Much like in the film itself, ambition and bravado is rewarded with great success and power, and this was true for many of the cast and crew with their subsequent careers. There may be spoilers ahead but the plot and events in this film are now so well documented I doubt anyone will be surprised.The film opens with a wedding taking place between Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie and Carlo, a wannabe member of the Family. While the celebrations take place outside in glorious sunshine, in the darkened rooms of the main house Don Vito pays court to various people requesting help with whatever problems they need assistance with. This is where Bonasera, a local baker, opens the film with the aforementioned line and seeks revenge on two men who savagely beat his daughter after she refused their advances. The subsequent conversation sets the tone for the rest of the film. Respect is always demanded from those in power and who are willing to use that power to benefit you. But there may always be a favour required by The Don in return. Later in the film, this favour is repaid to The Don in a way that is both shocking and relieving to Bonasera. Every element in this first scene demands attention from the audience and rewards them by setting a very high standard thereon. The way the camera slowly pulls back from Bonasera to reveal The Don listening to the story as we are, the use of lighting to almost hide The Don's eyes in the darkness, and the expressions, the voice and even the movement of Marlon Brando as The Don immediately put us in the company of one of THE great acting performances. Also attendant at the wedding are The Don's sons, Sonny the firey tempered James Cann, the weak willed Fredo played by John Cazale and Michael, the youngest and most cool headed of the brothers, played as such by Al Pacino. As with Brando, you are assured career defining performances by all three men, and I don't think any of them reached these acting heights again. Equally impressive but not strictly a family member is Robert Duvall as The Don's Consilgerie, Tom Hagen. In a nutshell (if such a thing were possible) the film follows the reluctant but necessary rise of Michael to the head of The Family and his dealings with his immediate family, his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), the ranked members that protect their Family (Tessio, Clemenza, etc), other Mafia Families and corrupt  state officials. Throughout the film Michael's views on his involvement with his Family change from the events that happen to his father after The Don refuses to involve his Families resources in distributing drugs into the city. When The Don is gunned down and left for dead in the street, and Michael has his jaw broken by corrupt Police Captain McCluskey, whilst trying to protect his unguarded father in the hospital, he sets in motion the revenge killing of both McCluskey and Sollozzo, the man partly responsible for the attempt on Don Vito. The result of the ensuing incredible set piece makes it necessary for Michael to leave the country to Sicily until it is safe to return. There he experiences both happiness and tragedy, as he takes a new bride, Apollonia, and receives news that Sonny was killed for a hit he had ordered on a rival Families son in previous retribution for the hit on The Don. Sonny's death scene is itself one of the most memorable set pieces in all of cinema. When a failed attempt on Michael leaves Apollonia dead, he returns to America, cold and hardened by these terrible events. There he begins to pick up where he left his life with Kay and moves to become his fathers heir. The phrase that there is honour among thieves is nowhere more relevant than in The Godfather. Michael, Sonny, Fredo and Tom are bound together by the respect and loyalty they hold for their father (in Tom's case, unofficially adopted) and the Corleone name. Their Family will always come before anything else, as shown when Michael leaves for Sicily without much of a thought towards Kay (being both Jewish and a woman excludes her from the Family), or when Sonny rushes to his sister Connie's aid (and ultimately his demise) after she receives another vicious beating by Carlo.Some of the most fondly remembered and famous scenes in cinema occur throughout The Godfather. The sequence with Khartum's severed head is an undisputed classic for both the shock value and for showing us early on how far and what type of methods the Family will employ. Sonny's murder is brutal and affecting, the attempted hit on The Don is wonderfully staged with the camera looking down on the event from above, the cumulative killings of the heads of the five Families at the end is a masterpiece of editing (note to George Lucas circa Phantom Menace. This is how you direct separate climactic events that reach toward the same goal!) , and these are only some of the major events that take place. There are so many great lines that it would be fruitless to list even some of them here, as many of them are now as much a  part of the English language as any piece of classic text. What I will mention however, are the delivery on some of the lesser known phrases. When Tom has to tell The Don that `They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead', it's a heartbreaking moment both for himself, The Don and the audience and we can completely emphasise with their pain. The fact that we can emphasise at all with these criminals and killers is not only due to the acting, writing and directing of these characters, but that the Corleone Family is just that shade more moral and honourable than the other Families depicted in the film. When The Don calls a meeting with the heads of the five Families to clear the bad blood between them and prepare for Michael's return to America, his delivery of the line `..but I'm a superstitious man..' and subsequent warning is so powerful and commanding that nobody but Brando could have pulled it off with such weight and grandeur. When Michael asks the powerful Vegas hotel owner Moe Green that `You straightened out my brother?' the &#145;threat' is so tangible that Moe is immediately sorry and Fredo tries to make light of the situation by assuring Mike that he and Moe are best of friends. Thus begins the tragic downfall of Fredo&#133; At the beginning of the film when Michael is telling Kay about his family he assures her that `That's my family Kay, it's not me'. At the end of the film he tells her `Don't ask me about my business Kay'. Both times he is completely sincere and believable. All throughout the film there are little moments where there may not be any dialogue or anything particularly important that happens to the plot, but they made such an impression on me that I have to mention some of them. The moment when Sonny bites down on his fist so (I assume) he wouldn't swear in front of Connie when he sees the bruise marks left on her face by Carlo, gave me goosebumps. The shot of the Statue of Liberty in the backdrop after Clemenza takes Paulie out to pick up some Cannelloni and has Rocco kill him and leave him bleeding in the car. The simple shrug of The Don's eyebrows when Tom returns from meeting Jack Woltz, and the previous shot was hearing Woltz's continued screams after finding the head of his beloved horse Khartum, in his bed when he awoke. The impeccable way Michael looks, dresses and carries himself when we first see him after returning from America as he steps out of a car toward Kay, and the way Brando's face literally crumbles as he is told of Sonny's death. Every technical element in this film is of the highest level. The cinematography is beautifully composed and framed, the period designs of New York are utterly believable and we never assume we're in any other time. The music is simply stunning and perfectly highlights the mood of the characters throughout, with the main theme one of the most recognisable pieces of music in cinema. When watching this, the film simply FEELS rich. I take a great  sense of importance and history from it, as though it's not merely a film but something much bigger. And there are plenty of arguments to support this, given the massive impact it has left not only on the film industry, but also on American businesses, commerce and crime. There are many stories of real life Mafiosi who base their lifestyle and way of conducting business on the Corleone way. I think the best compliment I can pay to The Godfather is that once the door is closed on Kay's face and we've both been shut out, I feel like I've witnessed an event, rather than just watch a film.

This is how you direct separate climactic events that reach toward the same goal!) , and these are only some of the major events that take place. There are so many great lines that it would be fruitless to list even some of them here, as many of them are now as much a  part of the English language as any piece of classic text. What I will mention however, are the delivery on some of the lesser known phrases. When Tom has to tell The Don that `They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead', it's a heartbreaking moment both for himself, The Don and the audience and we can completely emphasise with their pain. The fact that we can emphasise at all with these criminals and killers is not only due to the acting, writing and directing of these characters, but that the Corleone Family is just that shade more moral and honourable than the other Families depicted in the film. When The Don calls a meeting with the heads of the five Families to clear the bad blood between them and prepare for Michael's return to America, his delivery of the line `..but I'm a superstitious man..' and subsequent warning is so powerful and commanding that nobody but Brando could have pulled it off with such weight and grandeur. When Michael asks the powerful Vegas hotel owner Moe Green that `You straightened out my brother?' the &#145;threat' is so tangible that Moe is immediately sorry and Fredo tries to make light of the situation by assuring Mike that he and Moe are best of friends. Thus begins the tragic downfall of Fredo&#133; At the beginning of the film when Michael is telling Kay about his family he assures her that `That's my family Kay, it's not me'. At the end of the film he tells her `Don't ask me about my business Kay'. Both times he is completely sincere and believable. All throughout the film there are little moments where there may not be any dialogue or anything particularly important that happens to the plot, but they made such an impression on me that I have to mention some of them. The moment when Sonny bites down on his fist so (I assume) he wouldn't swear in front of Connie when he sees the bruise marks left on her face by Carlo, gave me goosebumps. The shot of the Statue of Liberty in the backdrop after Clemenza takes Paulie out to pick up some Cannelloni and has Rocco kill him and leave him bleeding in the car. The simple shrug of The Don's eyebrows when Tom returns from meeting Jack Woltz, and the previous shot was hearing Woltz's continued screams after finding the head of his beloved horse Khartum, in his bed when he awoke. The impeccable way Michael looks, dresses and carries himself when we first see him after returning from America as he steps out of a car toward Kay, and the way Brando's face literally crumbles as he is told of Sonny's death. Every technical element in this film is of the highest level. The cinematography is beautifully composed and framed, the period designs of New York are utterly believable and we never assume we're in any other time. The music is simply stunning and perfectly highlights the mood of the characters throughout, with the main theme one of the most recognisable pieces of music in cinema. When watching this, the film simply FEELS rich. I take a great  sense of importance and history from it, as though it's not merely a film but something much bigger. And there are plenty of arguments to support this, given the massive impact it has left not only on the film industry, but also on American businesses, commerce and crime. There are many stories of real life Mafiosi who base their lifestyle and way of conducting business on the Corleone way. I think the best compliment I can pay to The Godfather is that once the door is closed on Kay's face and we've both been shut out, I feel like I've witnessed an event, rather than just watch a film.

This is a great film, there is little else to say about it's quality.  A group of younger blue collar workers living in southeastern Pennsylvania in the late 1960s are sent to Vietnam.  This movie examines their life before Vietnam, their life during Vietnam and the life after Vietnam.   This is a three hour movie and I did not see one thing wrong with the movie.  The movie is not overtly critical of Vietnam, but it tends to show the subtle differences of life after Vietnam and how it affected society as a whole.  Robert De Niro did a great job in this movie, as did Christopher Walken.   The movie shows a side of society that is rarely seen in American film, that of your average guy.  In many movies the lead characters are people that are fairly well to do and are not exactly average.  Here there is nothing remarkable about the characters, and that is what makes this movie so good, they are just normal people.I lived around the area where the place was set, and most of these people would be out of a job now, as the steel industry in Pennsylvania has been really hard hit. The scenes in the steel mills are excellent.  In American films' obsession with perfect characters and perfect situations watching a movie about something so real and so un-Hollywood is great. The subtleness of the movie is incredible.  There are no great defining moments, it is just one of those movies where you watch it and eventually you begin to pick up something is going on.  The most powerful moments to me (SPOILER)  are watching Robert De Niro not kill that deer (hence the title) in the last half of the movie, and watching Robert De Niro go from the one involved in the Russian Roulette game to watching Walken become the one that does it.

Each part is great and this three hour movie is worth every minute of watching it.This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  So much has been crammed into three hours, so many different statements, so many different locations, just so much and it is very good.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"12 September 2003","score":"","review":"  The art of subtle poignant filmmaking is epitomizes in this methodical articulate brilliant film starring Robert De Niro.  This is a great film, there is little else to say about it's quality.  A group of younger blue collar workers living in southeastern Pennsylvania in the late 1960s are sent to Vietnam.  This movie examines their life before Vietnam, their life during Vietnam and the life after Vietnam.   This is a three hour movie and I did not see one thing wrong with the movie.  The movie is not overtly critical of Vietnam, but it tends to show the subtle differences of life after Vietnam and how it affected society as a whole.  Robert De Niro did a great job in this movie, as did Christopher Walken.   The movie shows a side of society that is rarely seen in American film, that of your average guy.  In many movies the lead characters are people that are fairly well to do and are not exactly average.  Here there is nothing remarkable about the characters, and that is what makes this movie so good, they are just normal people.I lived around the area where the place was set, and most of these people would be out of a job now, as the steel industry in Pennsylvania has been really hard hit. The scenes in the steel mills are excellent.  In American films' obsession with perfect characters and perfect situations watching a movie about something so real and so un-Hollywood is great. The subtleness of the movie is incredible.  There are no great defining moments, it is just one of those movies where you watch it and eventually you begin to pick up something is going on.  The most powerful moments to me (SPOILER)  are watching Robert De Niro not kill that deer (hence the title) in the last half of the movie, and watching Robert De Niro go from the one involved in the Russian Roulette game to watching Walken become the one that does it.  The movie shows subtle change, making this movie one that make you think about what the message is. The movie very much does reflect the changing society of the time and the overall turmoil of the period as well. SPOILER  I thought the end where they all sing a patriotic song is great in a way, it is almost as if life went on despite all of the problems they had over the last ten years. The sequences in Vietnam are incredible, as it truly shows the horrors of war and the horrors that many in Vietnam faced.  I think the movie as a whole is incredible.  There are four distinct parts to this movie  (SPOILER)  There is the first part where everything is relatively decent, and life is pretty normal before everyone goes to war, then there is the part in Vietnam, when they are fighting, then there is the part where they come back home, and then there is the part where De Niro goes back to Vietnam.  Each part is great and this three hour movie is worth every minute of watching it.This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.

There isn't really anything that makes it worth watching, other than the funny comic cast that lends it a certain familiarity. It's not an underrated great comedy like Planes, Trains and Automobiles, but rather an underrated mediocre comedy, one that you can watch over and over, almost as a tradition, and never get tired of, but furthermore, never fully understand its charm.The film stars John Candy as Chet, a down-to-earth kinda guy who wants to give his family (a wife and two sons) a great vacation in the great outdoors, away from civilization and modern conveniences. Chet's family does not necessarily appreciate what he is doing for them but rather the thought, and so they go along with the oblivious Chet out into the middle of nowhere, staying in a log cabin infested by who-knows-what.Chet is happy all the way up until they arrive at their cabin, because upon arrival they are greeted by Chet's glob of a brother, Roman (Dan Aykroyd), who shows up unannounced with his snobby wife (Annette Bening) and strange little twin girls (who serve to be a damper on the film, as they are almost so creepy it hurts the movie.)Chet bites his tongue and watches Roman squirm his way into the cabin. As in most films like these, Chet seems to be the only one who notices how annoying Roman is. Remember What About Bob, when Dr. Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) seemed to be the only one who resented an oddball patient named Bob (Bill Murray)? It's a bit like this with Chet and Roman. Chet's family doesn't seem to mind Roman, but Chet does. And in resenting Roman, Chet realizes he is being selfish, so he subconsciously, unknowingly pretends his family is bothered by Roman, which justifies him hating Roman and wanting him to leave. I bet you never thought I'd start reviewing this on a psychological level, eh? I guess you got more than you bargained for.The script was written by John Hughes, who directed my favorite comedy of all time, Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987), which also starred Candy. Hughes and Candy had a long-time collaboration - Hughes was even writing another script for Candy when John passed away in 1994. But what can be said about Hughes is that he tends to create real characters in realistic situations, with a clear sense of focus on what he wants to get across. It is only in recent years his scripts have been becoming more and more muddled (Home Alone 3, 101 Dalmations), and this may very well be because the times have passed on, yet John Hughes is still, in a way, living in the 80s, the decade that made him one of the most successful filmmakers within a short period of time. (His films such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Breakfast Club are icons of the eighties, and still have adamant fans to this day.)A film like The Great Outdoors is mediocre at best, and I don't think anyone will say otherwise. Sure, there are a few funny scenes like when Chet goes on an accidental waterskiing trip, or when Chet and Roman try to rid their house of a bat, only to enter into the cabin wearing a crazy assortment of items. These are the type of cheap comical gags that would sink a normal film, but watching John Candy and Dan Aykroyd go through the motions is something more. Especially Candy, God rest his soul, who could and continues to always make me laugh. I think that there's a certain charm about The Great Outdoors, one that invites the viewer, lets the viewer know what they're in for, but entertains the viewer during the course of the film. The first time I saw The Great Outdoors I shrugged it off as another typical 80s film - which it is, in a way - but I found myself watching it every time it appeared on television since. I even tape recorded it last year and have since watched many of the funny parts over and over.

Now, first of all, I would like to say that I was born in the early 1980s. I really never knew, up-close and personal, what true punk rock was. Watching this film was like a history lesson of sorts. The music was great, good vintage rock n' roll from bands like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, X, etc. It seemed to me that with this film, Penelope Spheeris was trying to show people that these weren't all just stupid kids who were out to do drugs and kill people. Some of these punks really had some philosophies that they were working at behind their music. This seems most evident in the interview with Black Flag. I understand myself how a lot of people might view these bands' philosophies as under-developed and simple, but one must take into account that these were some pretty young people. Nowadays, as young as I still am, I find it refreshing to run into someone my age who understands in any way philosophical thinking. In this movie, the young people may seem a little half-baked in their philosophies, but you might keep in mind that most kids don't even get that far. I've met many full-grown adults who have not progressed as far with deep thought contexts as some of the punk musicians in Decline. Another thing I loved about this movie was how funny it got at times. Some of these kids were total idiots, while the story about the dead painter was devilishly humorous. Fear's performance at the end topped it all. Even if punk is dead, it was once very alive.

With On the Waterfront, in particular, his directing style seems awfully stagnant; there's really nothing to it. And really, the wonderful storyline must be extracted by the audience, we're not really treated to it, like in the works of other greats of the time.Obviously this film is best remembered for Marlon Brando's staggering performance (I coulda bin a contender), and this really is him at his very best. His performance is raw, human emotion, and it is undeniably one of the greatest acting jobs ever done. Eva Marie Saint never looked better than in this film and the supporting cast, including the great Rod Steiger and Karl Malden, does a fine job. And yet the movie never comes alive.I felt through both this film and East of Eden that Kazan has at his disposal some of the greatest stories ever told (the least being a Steinbeck) and some of the greatest acting talent of all time, and does nothing with it. On the Waterfront's story is slow and unemotional at times, and you never really get the impression of how the plot is moving along, where are the major developments or is this all just one stream of consciousness. While the overall effect of the film is almost breathtaking, it's entirely carried by the script and the actors.While it really is excellent and a definite classic, I still can only wonder at how much better it could have been.
