The reviewer seemed to think the movie was  nothing more than a fast-paced escapist action film.  What seemed to be ignored, however, is the film's greatest quality it makes you think.  Of course, with the lack of such films being produced by the major American studios, I guess it should be no surprise that some may no longer use that as a criterion when judging a movie.  What makes Lola Rennt a true diamond in an industry overflowing with cubic zirconia is that it makes you think about just how much every little thing you do affects everything not only in your life but also in the lives of others to proportions you could never imagine.  This movie rises above the escapist trend that has beset the movie industry in a way few do, perhaps in part due to its not coming from Hollywood.  If you dislike thinking, this might not be the movie for you. Otherwise, I'd rate it as a must see.  5 out of 5 stars, two thumbs up, and so on.

Then I thought about it.  I decided to view this film not because I expected it to be a quality film with all that goes with such distinction, rather, to just have some mindless entertainment.  Once I realized my own intentions, I was able to look at this film for what it really is--mindless entertainment.  There is no genius here.  There is no great script or acting ability involved.  However, keep in mind the film is a comedy and often we expect such films to be comparable to dramas and the like that often are distinguished as quality films.Now, as a comedy, a different set of rules apply.  We can't expect everything to make sense and we have to suspend our own judgments and values when watching such a film (the same way as when one watches The Naked Gun films).  In doing so, one can appreciate Molly Shannon's work here.  She is a nut!  She is crazy!  She is pure joy to watch as the title character, Mary Catherine Gallagher.  Hers is not an Academy Award caliber performance, but it is more enjoyable to watch then say Jessica Lange from Blue Sky (a torturous performance in an unbearably watchable film).Her performance sets the tone for the rest of the film.  Most of the characters have nothing to offer, but Molly Shannon goes from charming and sweet, to vicious and vindictive.  With relative ease, she quotes monologues from made-for-tv movies that are outright hilarious while trying to play off the insecurities that her own character possesses.  In doing this, she somewhat pulls off an acting coup by making her character as eccentric and difficult to really understand as one of the monologues she exhibits (Sally Field's performance in Sybil).Don't get me wrong...no one will mistake this film as comparable with some of the great comedies of all-time (Some Like it Hot and others), but we must look at what the film is trying to accomplish.  I can't imagine that the creators figured that this film would do anything more than provide a few gags.  In that mindset, it becomes amazing to me to realize that this is really a powerful vehicle to showcase Molly Shannon's performance.With the right material, better script and dialogue, hers could be a true comic performance.

You know, the people who walk into rooms covered with sinister-looking messages in indecipherable languages and just frown a little and say Hmm, I wonder what it means?  People who walk blithely with only a candle into places no sane person would set foot in without extensive prepping by artillery fire?Wherever they get them, there must be quite a supply, 'cause, boy, they sure don't last long.  (It may be the same place where they get the cops in B-action pictures).Now, I'm not saying that such people (I understand the technical term of art is idiot in the attic) cannot be a source of genuine entertainment and suspense.  But they need to have a good movie around them.  Thirteen Ghosts, or more technically Thir13en Ghosts (which, if you think about it, is almost twice Se7en, only without the atmosphere of impending existential doom) is not that movie.  It might have been, if only the writer had worked half as hard as the production designer.The plot concerns Arthur, a math teacher trying to recover emotionally and financially from a tragic event, who is visited by the creepiest lawyer Central Casting could come up with.  Creepy, esq. informs Arthur that his eccentric uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham, trying valiantly to erase any memory of him as a good actor) has left him a house and a pile of money.  No one in the audience would trust this guy to pour them a glass of water, but Arthur and his family follow the lawyer to the house, since they are natives of the Land of Suicidally Stupid Horror-Movie Characters (motto Let's split up.).  This despite the fact that the house (and Uncle Cyrus' unsettling video will) has glass walls, tons of cryptic writing and eerie symbols, and images of rotting, gape-jawed skulls.  I guess that's what the real-estate market will do to you.  The house is full of ghosts that Uncle Cyrus captured with his band of ghost-hunters (think of the Ghostbusters, only with Reynolds-and-Saran-wrap jackets and no sense of humor) have imprisoned.  They need the ghosts to harness their energy to power an ancient device that - oh, never mind.There is a great deal of running away from various mutilated and disgruntled ghosts (who can only be seen with special glasses), which at least gives the cast a break from speaking their flat and uninteresting lines.  Tony Shalhoub lends Arthur some tortured dignity, and of the characters who get the most screen time, his is easily the most credible performance.  Also trapped in the house are his two children, played by Shannon Elizabeth and Alec Roberts.  Partisans of the winsome Ms. Elizabeth should note that, despite her prominence in the movie's marketing, she disappears from the action for a very long stretch.  Embeth Davidtz shows up as a kind of undead-rights activist with a spell book and a bag of TNT blocks (when trapped in a haunted house, it's always advisable to bring at least one cast member from Army of Darkness).  Matthew Lillard, who places an undue dramatic value on annoyance, plays an angry psychic (aren't they all?) who was helping Cyrus get the ghosts.The ghosts are really the most interesting part of the movie, as you might expect.  They are a diverse group, and their disparate energies are required to - oh, forget it.  But I was hoping for more back story on them, like who they were, how exactly they met their sundry bad ends, or why it was their bad luck to end up as the ethereal equivalent of the Energizer Bunny.  But little development of the ghosts is forthcoming, except for a few vague hints here and there, enough to pique your curiosity, but not enough to satisfy it much.In the end, Thirteen Ghosts adds up to less.  The house is cool (I can't imagine what the glazier's bill looked like), and some of the ghosts are intriguing (though quite over the top).  Mostly, it's Ghostbusters without the wit, and The Sixth Sense without the depth. But never fear; we aren't likely to run out of idiots in the attic anytime soon.
