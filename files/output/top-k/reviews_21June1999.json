The initiations, the hierarchies, the humiliations- it's all here.And, after probably 30-odd times, I can say that it's even better on repeat viewings; the script, performances, editing and source music are in absolute syncronization.  When its elements  work together this perfectly, a movie seems effortless- but don't be fooled, there's a wizard behind the curtain. Exhibitionism is so often mistaken for style, but Richard Linklater prefers to remain in the woodwork and the movie is better for it.The humor in Dazed and Confused is based on familiarity, not shock or surprise, and so it doesn't expire like what passes for so many of today's so-called comedies.  Details like Mitch's tics, and the ever-present use of the word man, ground the elliptical narrative in character, not gimmickry- and make the movie that much funnier.There's actually much more here than yuks, though you have to listen for it. A definite perspective is threaded in the sentiments as expressed by the characters throughout the movie. The brilliance lies in the way Richard Linklater puts this point across, much more eloquently and powerful than can be stated in a synopsis or a review...  D&C is just about the most palatable message movie in existence.Side note  while I'm sure that its depiction of the era owes as much to the looking-glass of the 1990s, D&C isn't, unlike some of the films to which it is compared (American Graffiti, namely), mired in nostalgia or fetishes.

Say what you will about Disney and its animated features, but this one is really one to watch.Cross the best elements of Lion King, Hunchback, with hints and sniffs of Pocahontas, Beauty and the Beast and Hercules, and you get this amazing film.  Sure, you might feel like you watched a part of the movie from elsewhere, but the movie as a whole works so well that you quickly forgets about it and are completely emersed into the story.In fact, Tarzan is worth the ticket just for the animation along. Seeing Tarzan swing and surfing around in the jungle is very, very satisfying and surprisingly exciting, not to mention the fact that it's just so damn cool. Most of the jungle is modeled in full 3D with the Deep Canvas technology, and the result is an exhilarating ride. In fact, I went ahead and saw Episode 1 in the same day, and came out totally unimpressed by its visuals. The pod race, for example, does not have the same sense of tense excitement and speed as the battle with Jaguar or the monkeys scene in Tarzan. With the best animation I've seen ever, Disney proves once and for all that Tarzan is a story best told in animation, because it is simply impossible to achieve the same effect in the real world.Fortunately, it is much more than pretty visuals. Its opening scene is one of the most powerful and ingenious that I've seen in ages. And it's also a lot more exciting that most other action films out there, real actors or otherwise. The tense and exciting scenes must be seen to be believed, the jaguar (maybe it wasn't a jaguar... I forget what it's called) fight and the mad chase scenes in particular.I know I'm using way too many exciting here, but that's really what it is, a wild ride from the beginning to the end. And the best part is, this movie seems to have two plotlines -- one for the kids, one for the adults. And, as a teenager, I can laugh with the kids and also plunge into deep thoughts with the adults about one's true identity.Overall, this is the best animated feature I've seen in years. If you don't like animated films, you should still at least watch this one. Amazing, amazing film.  ","genre":null},{"date":"21 June 1999","score":"","review":"  Oh, shut up.

There are also a few cheesier moments in some of the action sequences which I think would have been better left out as at some points you are uncertain as to whether or not you should be laughing at them. Apart from these admittedly minor grievances, I think the film is extremely well directed. The camerawork is excellent and the chases and gunfights are the best I have seen for a long time. The acting from Keanu Reeves is competent, but not outstanding. What makes this film so good is that the filler scenes are also extremely good - Hugo Weaving is brilliant as the intimidating agent, and Laurence Fishburne puts in a good effort as Morpheus. The script is good although a little cliched at times, but then that's par for the Hollywood course. The film is in a similar vein to Twelve Monkeys, only with a more Blade Runnery feel, and although I think that both of these films are ahead of The Matrix, anyone thinking of seeing an action or scifi film should definitely watch it - there hasn't been anything this good on in ages.
