[{"date":"15 August 1998","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  LOLA RENNT is simply one of the best german films ever made. It's innovative , funny and clever. Like in his last movie WINTERSCHLÄFER director Tom Tykwer reinvents the german cinema with superb and intelligent dialogues. The whole movie is like a videoclip. Fast, colourful and very entertaining. Lola's friend Manni is a thief and a money-courier for a car pusher. But this time everthing goes wrong. Manni leaves the money in a subway and now Lola has twenty minutes to bring him 100.000 DM. This movies has everything a movie should have A brilliant camera with astonishing ideas. The story has lots of turns and twists and even the humour is fabulous. The soundtrack (mostly TECHNO with the actors singing) fits perfectly! I loved this movie and I think that everyone should watch it! A 10 is not too much for this little jewel. This film expresses the feeling of this generation and I think nobody can demand more from a movie...
