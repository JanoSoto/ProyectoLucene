Maybe the psych patients are there only because they've got too much color to share or maybe even more than they can help themselves with and must be deported into a bland and controlled environment full of routine and schedules.

In there he plays with cards that have pictures of women on them, shanghais a bus full of patients, coaches basketball and shows the rest of the ward what a good time with R.P. McMurphy is like. And the color splashes into places you would never expect. However, in this ward lies a nurse.This nurse has my favorite performance in the movie. I don't think any part of her face moves for the entire movie except her lips, but it got me wondering so much What could possibly have gotten behind those eyes that hardened her soul?

The first film fed off that excitement, being so successful that it was, for a time, the highest grossing independent film ever. A sequel had to happen. And fast. Nearly a year after the original, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret of the Ooze ninja-chopped into theaters.The film is a direct sequel, picking up days after the first. The Ninja Teens are still high on their victory over Shredder, despite Splinter's insistence that they focus on their studies. Shredder isn't dead though, somehow surviving a seven-story drop into a garbage truck. With a more messed-up face, Shredder pulls together the Foot in order to exact revenge on the Turtles. That revenge takes the form of the ooze that birthed the Turtles. The bad guys steal the last of the ooze in order to create two mutants, the brutish but child-like Tokka and Rahzar. The same ooze leads the TMNT to understand their past.Something I admire about the original film is how deftly it balanced the goofiness of the popular cartoon with the grittiness of the comics. Secret of the Ooze has no interest in balance. In the first film, the Turtles smash a light before attacking, avoiding detection. In the opening of this film, the team step in full view of a human, dispatching their enemies with slapstick comedy. So much for the Art of Invisibility. In that first scene, Mikey fights with a yoyo and sausage links. Donnie pretends to be an inflatable clown, whacking a guy with a foam bat. That silliness infects the entire production. While attempting to grab the mutagen away from the Foot Clan, the Turtles enact a game of football, surfing on office chairs. Previously, the Foot was a serious threat. This time, they're a joke, not a one putting up a fight. Tokka and Rahzar aren't much of a threat either. Their childish minds make them easy to outsmart. The worst thing they do is knock down telephone poles and flip a car. Even that scene is undermined by wise-cracking old people.Secret of the Ooze was rushed into production. That shows in its ramshackle plot. There are elements that work. The mutagen's origin, an accidental mixture of chemicals, is satisfying. David Warner's Professor Perry is a decent addition. He advances the plot while having a personality. However, the plot mostly seems thrown together. The Turtles searching for a new home is decent but stumbling upon the abandoned train station is awfully convenient. The movie introduces a new character, karate pizza boy Keno. Keno, played by an overly earnest Ernie Reyes Jr., is annoying. He disappears for long stretches. He exists to help Raph infiltrate the Foot, which promptly gets the Turtle captured. The heroes escape that trap easily before willingly walking back into Shredder's lair. Combat between the Ninja Teens and Tokka and Rahzar is never delivered. Every time it looks like the fight is about to click, the movie is sidelined by goofy comedy.The biggest indignity faces the Turtles in the last act. The Foot's junkyard base is apparently located next to a dance club. The fight tumbles into the club where Vanilla Ice, signifier of nineties schlock, is performing. The patrons don't flee from the fighting terrapins. Instead, the funky white boy improvises a rap, the club playing along. Tokka and Rahzar are easily defeated, the Professor pulling a plot resolution out of nowhere. Despite the movie around him being a goofball comedy, Shredder remained a serious villain. He grabs a dancer and threatens to slash her throat. The Turtles' response? Michelangelo performs a sweet keytar solo, causing a speaker to explode, launching the villain into the equally improbable dock outside. The film wraps up on the potentially cool idea of Shredder drinking the last of the ooze, transforming into Super-Shredder. (Even if his armor mutating makes zero sense.) However, the neatness of that idea is undermined by the Turtles refusing to fight and the villain ending his own life by needlessly collapsing the dock.The film is a mess of campiness and squandered potential. Yet the movie still gets a few things right. The characterizations of the Turtles remain strong. A concept that reoccurs throughout every version of the franchise is Leo and Raph butting heads. Here, the head-strong Raphael wants to pursue the Foot Clan while Leonardo is more preoccupied with finding a new home. That rashness gets him in trouble, again, and after rescuing him, the brothers are reunited. Donatello was mostly Mikey's comedic foil in the first film. Here, he gets a juicy character arc of not accepting the casualness of their origin. He is also more fully established as the one who does machine, as his techno know-how comes in handy a few times. I even prefer Adam Carl's thoughtful vocal performance over Corey Feldman's. I also like Paige Turco as April more then Judith Hoag. Turco seems more comfortable in the part. The creature effects are even better then last time too. The Turtles' faces reach a new level of expressiveness. Tokka and Rahzar are memorably cartoonish in their designs as well.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret of the Ooze is a lesser film than the first. The sloppy screenplay and an abundance of kid-friendly silliness sinks it. However, I can't hate the movie. Any film that gifts the world of pop culture with a bit of ridiculous cheese like the Ninja Rap can't be all bad. However, I have a lot less nostalgic affection for this one. Instead of playing off the original's good example, it's more-or-less the silly kid's flick we expected the first one to be.

That revenge takes the form of the ooze that birthed the Turtles. The bad guys steal the last of the ooze in order to create two mutants, the brutish but child-like Tokka and Rahzar. The same ooze leads the TMNT to understand their past.Something I admire about the original film is how deftly it balanced the goofiness of the popular cartoon with the grittiness of the comics. Secret of the Ooze has no interest in balance. In the first film, the Turtles smash a light before attacking, avoiding detection. In the opening of this film, the team step in full view of a human, dispatching their enemies with slapstick comedy. So much for the Art of Invisibility. In that first scene, Mikey fights with a yoyo and sausage links. Donnie pretends to be an inflatable clown, whacking a guy with a foam bat. That silliness infects the entire production. While attempting to grab the mutagen away from the Foot Clan, the Turtles enact a game of football, surfing on office chairs. Previously, the Foot was a serious threat. This time, they're a joke, not a one putting up a fight. Tokka and Rahzar aren't much of a threat either. Their childish minds make them easy to outsmart. The worst thing they do is knock down telephone poles and flip a car. Even that scene is undermined by wise-cracking old people.Secret of the Ooze was rushed into production. That shows in its ramshackle plot. There are elements that work. The mutagen's origin, an accidental mixture of chemicals, is satisfying. David Warner's Professor Perry is a decent addition. He advances the plot while having a personality. However, the plot mostly seems thrown together. The Turtles searching for a new home is decent but stumbling upon the abandoned train station is awfully convenient. The movie introduces a new character, karate pizza boy Keno. Keno, played by an overly earnest Ernie Reyes Jr., is annoying. He disappears for long stretches. He exists to help Raph infiltrate the Foot, which promptly gets the Turtle captured. The heroes escape that trap easily before willingly walking back into Shredder's lair. Combat between the Ninja Teens and Tokka and Rahzar is never delivered. Every time it looks like the fight is about to click, the movie is sidelined by goofy comedy.The biggest indignity faces the Turtles in the last act. The Foot's junkyard base is apparently located next to a dance club. The fight tumbles into the club where Vanilla Ice, signifier of nineties schlock, is performing. The patrons don't flee from the fighting terrapins. Instead, the funky white boy improvises a rap, the club playing along. Tokka and Rahzar are easily defeated, the Professor pulling a plot resolution out of nowhere. Despite the movie around him being a goofball comedy, Shredder remained a serious villain. He grabs a dancer and threatens to slash her throat. The Turtles' response? Michelangelo performs a sweet keytar solo, causing a speaker to explode, launching the villain into the equally improbable dock outside. The film wraps up on the potentially cool idea of Shredder drinking the last of the ooze, transforming into Super-Shredder. (Even if his armor mutating makes zero sense.) However, the neatness of that idea is undermined by the Turtles refusing to fight and the villain ending his own life by needlessly collapsing the dock.The film is a mess of campiness and squandered potential. Yet the movie still gets a few things right. The characterizations of the Turtles remain strong. A concept that reoccurs throughout every version of the franchise is Leo and Raph butting heads. Here, the head-strong Raphael wants to pursue the Foot Clan while Leonardo is more preoccupied with finding a new home. That rashness gets him in trouble, again, and after rescuing him, the brothers are reunited. Donatello was mostly Mikey's comedic foil in the first film. Here, he gets a juicy character arc of not accepting the casualness of their origin. He is also more fully established as the one who does machine, as his techno know-how comes in handy a few times. I even prefer Adam Carl's thoughtful vocal performance over Corey Feldman's. I also like Paige Turco as April more then Judith Hoag. Turco seems more comfortable in the part. The creature effects are even better then last time too. The Turtles' faces reach a new level of expressiveness. Tokka and Rahzar are memorably cartoonish in their designs as well.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret of the Ooze is a lesser film than the first. The sloppy screenplay and an abundance of kid-friendly silliness sinks it. However, I can't hate the movie. Any film that gifts the world of pop culture with a bit of ridiculous cheese like the Ninja Rap can't be all bad. However, I have a lot less nostalgic affection for this one. Instead of playing off the original's good example, it's more-or-less the silly kid's flick we expected the first one to be.

The first film fed off that excitement, being so successful that it was, for a time, the highest grossing independent film ever. A sequel had to happen. And fast.

Things aren't going so well, because they had to lug their handicapped brother, Franklin along with them. To make matters worse, they are shaken up by a sadistic hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) . The real nightmare begins when they go to their old family house and they encounter a chainsaw wielding maniac. This is NOT one of my favorite horror movies! I think it's overpraised and dated, but it is a pretty good horror movie. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. Leatherface has never been one of my favorites for some reason. I find him dull compared to some of the other horror icons. It isn't a fun film by any means! It has an amateurish quality that works in its favor, but also hampers it in ways as well. This is just raw and gritty filmmaking, and I certainly have to give it credit for that. This felt like real terror. It also has a subtle, yet creepy score that chills you to the bone. They didn't have a huge budget to work with and they managed a solid horror movie. My main problem with this movie, is that it's somewhat dull at times. It's never boring , just a few too many scenes with characters wandering around with boring conversation. Some will call that effective, I call it meandering. This was a product of its time, and rather daring back then. By today's standards, it comes across as somewhat tame. It's disturbing, don't get me wrong. I just think the sequels and subsequent remakes have tarnished its reputation. They really lucked out because of the excellent use of location. That big house is very eerie! I don't know if I'd call it a fluke, but Tobe Hooper hasn't done anything as successful as this. He was certainly feeling it during this movie! The shots during Sally's torture scenes are very hard to endure I don't know what happened, but Tobe seemed to lose his touch after this. There isn't much gore in this movie, but there is disturbing things. Marilyn Burns legitimately cut herself on the branches, while filming. People are bludgeoned to death, and more. It's not very gory, but it doesn't really need that much of it. There are some throwaway characters, but there is a few performances that truly standout. Marilyn Burns is overshadowed in some ways, but she deserves all the praise in the world. It must have been emotionally and physically exhausting to play that part. She came through big time and screamed like a champ. She's pretty easy on the eyes as well. Gunnar Hansen is the original Leatherface! He deserves critical acclaim for that alone. The weird pig noises were creepy and he was very intimidating! Paul A. Partain is both sympathetic and annoying. That being said, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. He's in a wheel-chair, so that makes it hard for anyone to hate him. It was a dynamic performance in my opinion. Edwin Neal is a scary SOB! I will never pick up a hitchhiker, solely because of this performance. You won't forget him anytime soon. Jim Siedow yells too much as the Cook, but he played his part well. The last 10 minutes are legendary! Especially the last 5 minutes. The last scene of Marilyn Burns on the getaway truck, maniacally laughing, is classic! Despite that it isn't one of my favorites, I did give it a lot of praise. It is somewhat overrated, but it does a lot right as well. There is a reason why it became so popular among horror fans!

Richard Gere stars as newspaper columnist John Klein who early in the film gets into a car accident while his wife is driving. Mary (Debra Messing) swerves to avoid a creature and ends up dying shortly after of a brain tumor. Was it the strange black-winged, red-eyed creature that caused this? Two years later, Klein inexplicably finds himself in the small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia when his car breaks down. In the town he finds dozens of reports of people who have seen this mothman and he decides to investigate. He teams up with local police officer Connie Mills (Laura Linney) as they document sightings, injuries, hallucinations and finally, strange prophecies foretelling deaths. Klein gets increasingly involved in the cases.This movie has a really solid first half. There's just enough sort-of explainable weirdness going on that you believe this is based on a true story and that Klein would stick around to see what is going on. As he uncovers some clues that may explain what happened to his wife, you start getting a bad feeling about the whole thing. Then we've got the creepy reports from people who have seen the creature, a strong message from an expert that warns him to stay away that further peak your curiosity and that increasing dread as you realize this guy is in way over your head. As I said before, it gets downright creepy and frightening when you finally start to learn about this strange Indrid Cold character. The unexplainable but kind of mundane stuff just keeps pilling up until you know something really bad is going to happen. Then the second half, the movie really switches gears and doesn't work nearly as well. It's like the director couldn't make up his mind as to whether he wanted to make a thriller that built itself up slowly, setting itself up for some big, but sparse scares, or a nutty supernatural monster movie about a possibly benevolent, possibly maleficent force that we as humans have no way of understanding. It ends up just being a bit of both and not paying off for either camp.Some of the problems in this movie are truly hard to describe because they have to do with the jarring switch in tone and atmosphere of the story. There's a scene where we see a face in a mirror within Klein's apartment. It should be a big jump scare but because of the tone of the scene and the way it was shot, it's more of a weird surprise that only creeps you out if you're fast-forwarding through the film (which is how it got me all creeped out). The movie begins so smart and towards the end, we get yet another movie where the characters in the film have never seen or ready any story where ghosts, monsters or aliens are involved. Klein hears about a prophecy concerning a great tragedy on the Ohio River and like a fool basically runs around screaming, blabbering about doomsday and not even coming up with a clever story to explain why he is acting so weird.Despite the missteps along the way, it could have all been wrapped up neatly with a tight ending. One that doesn't explain too much, leaves enough to the imagination to play with your head and make you wonder if the mothman is still out there kind of thing. In a way, the film actually does have an ending like this that works really well and leaves itself ambiguous without feeling like it's a cop-out non-ending. It's a very creepy moment where Klein is waiting for a phone call. I couldn't make up my mind about what I wanted to see. Did I want him to do the smart thing and tear the phone from its wall, throw it in the trash can and run away with his fingers plugging his ears? Did I want him to answer the phone, regardless of the consequences? Unfortunately, that scene, the film keeps on going. We get a scene with a lot of cool special effects that goes on for way too long, doesn't belong at all in this movie and unfortunately features horrendous sound editing. You know those three stock screams you hear a lot in movies? We're talking about the Wilhelm scream, the Howie scream and that third overused one that only belongs in a movie if it's a joke. Yes, they are all present in the climax and it really hurts the film.Overall, The Mothman Prophecies isn't really that bad, it's just underwhelming. In the end it becomes another one of those spooky, supernatural movies that stayed pretty faithful to the truth except for a few glaring parts that were totally blown out of proportion to make a standard Hollywood story. It's a nice way to spend two hours though so as a rental or if it's playing on TV I recommend it, partially because what it does right it really does well and also because there's enough believable stuff going on here that if you watch it with someone else it will be a lot of fun to discuss.

Klein hears about a prophecy concerning a great tragedy on the Ohio River and like a fool basically runs around screaming, blabbering about doomsday and not even coming up with a clever story to explain why he is acting so weird.Despite the missteps along the way, it could have all been wrapped up neatly with a tight ending. One that doesn't explain too much, leaves enough to the imagination to play with your head and make you wonder if the mothman is still out there kind of thing. In a way, the film actually does have an ending like this that works really well and leaves itself ambiguous without feeling like it's a cop-out non-ending. It's a very creepy moment where Klein is waiting for a phone call. I couldn't make up my mind about what I wanted to see. Did I want him to do the smart thing and tear the phone from its wall, throw it in the trash can and run away with his fingers plugging his ears? Did I want him to answer the phone, regardless of the consequences? Unfortunately, that scene, the film keeps on going. We get a scene with a lot of cool special effects that goes on for way too long, doesn't belong at all in this movie and unfortunately features horrendous sound editing. You know those three stock screams you hear a lot in movies? We're talking about the Wilhelm scream, the Howie scream and that third overused one that only belongs in a movie if it's a joke. Yes, they are all present in the climax and it really hurts the film.Overall, The Mothman Prophecies isn't really that bad, it's just underwhelming. In the end it becomes another one of those spooky, supernatural movies that stayed pretty faithful to the truth except for a few glaring parts that were totally blown out of proportion to make a standard Hollywood story. It's a nice way to spend two hours though so as a rental or if it's playing on TV I recommend it, partially because what it does right it really does well and also because there's enough believable stuff going on here that if you watch it with someone else it will be a lot of fun to discuss.

From time to time I tend to binge on it and plough through his whole American filmography (even including Showgirls, when I have the courage) in a day or so, because this man is the absolute master of mixing artistic value, satire and pure unadulterated camp value. Total Recall is an awesome roller-coaster ride of increasingly ridiculous action set pieces. The extreme violence is not quite as raw as in RoboCop, but it's cartoonish (yet still gory) style always gets a chuckle out of me. The best part about this though is the casting of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead, who delivers his cheesy one-liners with gusto and makes good use of the somewhat clueless glint in his eyes. He really brings home the point that his character has no idea what's going on, comparable to his performance in the much inferior The 6th Day. He's also made a fantastic commentary track of this movie that I highly recommend, where he just basically describes what's happening on the screen with a childish enthusiasm, adding absolutely no behind the scenes information whatsoever. It's just an absolute treat, you won't learn a single thing about how the movie was made but it's still one of the best commentaries I've ever heard. Even without the track though this is a true classic, albeit a pretty sleazy one. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 November 2014","score":"","review":" Ah, the magnificent work of Paul Verhoeven.

William Shatner is nowhere near the director that Leonard Nimoy is. Much like Planet of the Apes (2001) in which David Warner also appeared, it feels like a first draft rather than the finished product. Considering that there was a writers' strike in 1988, I may not be far off. The ideas behind the script, which were admittedly recycled from TOS, weren't bad. They at least had potential, which was never realised. On the bright side, Laurence Luckinbill - whose mother-in-law Lucille Ball approved TOS' production by her company Desilu - is very good in the fairly thankless role of Sybok.Speaking of David Warner, one of my favourite actors, he has an excellent first scene in which we are introduced to St. John Talbot, a drunken, broken man assigned to a backwater planet where his superiors presumably hoped he would cause no damage. The character has also had a great deal of potential but Warner has exactly four lines after his first scene. His part was originally bigger but it ended up on the cutting room floor. It's a waste of an excellent actor. He spends most of his screen time standing around the bridge. I liked that he developed a relationship with the Romulan ambassador Caithlin Dar but it's literally in the background of scenes that this happens! He has less screen time as Chancellor Gorkon in Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country but better material and a more important part.The scenes featuring Kirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy camping in Yosemite National Park may not be the cleverest, deepest or best written scenes in Star Trek history with talk of marshmelons and Row, Row, Row Your Boat and whatnot but they were my favourites because of the sense of warmth and easy camaraderie between the Big Three.

Like Timothy Dalton's second and final Bond film Licence to Kill, it had the misfortune to be released during the Summer of Sequels, which has since become an almost annual tradition, and it performed badly against films such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ghostbusters II, Lethal Weapon 2 and Batman (which was the major exception). Surprisingly enough, it actually did better than Licence to Kill in the US, earning $49.5 million to the Bond film's $34.6 million. Worldwide, however, Licence to Kill earned $156 million to this film's far less impressive $65 million.It has a few great lines such as Bones saying that he liked Spock better before he died, Kirk saying that he misses his old chair from TOS and, of course, the unforgettable What does God need with a starship? which by itself makes the film worthwhile.

It is important that we like Treasury Department investigator Elliott Ness, the man who brings down Al Capone, because this is his story. But as the stiff, humorless enforcer of two deeply unpopular laws, Prohibition and the U.S. tax code, sympathy for him is hardly automatic. De Palma creates that sympathy in short order through a series of carefully crafted moments. First, he makes Ness's foe a larger-than-life villain. Robert de Niro's Capone is a grotesque monster, cocky and immature as a school bully, but incalculably more frightening. His first on-screen victim is a 10-year-old girl, and just like that the audience is out of his corner. The camera is always markedly above or below de Niro so that his face and body, swollen by decadence, bulge out in unnatural and off- putting ways. By contrast, Kevin Costner's Ness is quiet, steady, unassuming, and life-size. The camera looks straight at him as he keeps his composure in the face of a news crew's cynical heckling. Their faceless taunting, and his defenselessness, puts the audience on Ness's side even though Costner has far less natural charismatic than de Niro. But de Palma is not through crafting his protagonist instead of being truly untouchable, a flawless Superman, the first major set piece sees Ness engage in farcical vainglory. He shouts Let's do some good! as he drives a truck through a warehouse wall, only to find that his first big bust is a big bust. Seeing Ness humbled is the final piece of de Palma's masterful opening arc. By humanizing him, by refusing to make him simply pure in counterpoise to Capone's simple evil, de Palma makes a killjoy Fed into a hero worth rooting for.Unfortunately, de Palma's deftness at audience manipulation and his penchant for highly-manufactured staging have their downsides. The plot unfolds in a series of violent vignettes, and while these are exciting and memorable entries in the long tradition of shoot-em-up cinema, de Palma does not always know how much is too much and where to draw the line. The first big showdown takes place on a bridge, and the visuals are great. We see the plan unfold clearly. But the music is all wrong for the moment. It sounds almost comical, and is the kind of music that can only be played after the fact because its tension-killing jauntiness indicates that none of the principles are going to die. The film is scored by universally-acknowledged genius Ennio Morricone, so the fault must lie with de Palma for putting the music in the wrong place. In the next major bloodbath, which involves Sean Connery's quotable Irish cop Malone and a pair of assassins, de Palma switches to first-person view for an extended shot that moves seamlessly through a window and up and down a hallway. This technique is often used in schlock horror, but it works just as well to build tension in a period piece drama. As a bonus, it showcases the movie's excellent set dressing; the 1930-ish furniture and fixtures are museum-display perfect, yet feel authentic and lived-in. The end of this sequence has enough bullets that it really must result in an immediate death, but for the sake of melodrama de Palma stretches out the victim's life in a way that is unforgivably unbelievable. The loss of believability is only compounded in the movie's final act, in which de Palma detaches the film from the realm of physical probability in order to indulge in a slow-motion massacre on a staircase. It is an obvious homage to the famous Odessa Staircase scene in Sergei Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin (1925), which popularized the telescoping of time as a way to tell several small stories that occur in the same place at the same moment. It looks great, and it's gripping, but when it ends we can feel that we've been played.The conclusion of the film is too easy, even corny, completing de Palma's drift away from stylized reality and into pure fantasy.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"30 November 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I decided to do something new with this movie review. This time I be reviewing all three films like one full fledged review. I decided not to review each one separately because I'd be saying the same thing over again. I also will not be giving a plot summary with this review, because to be honest, I always have a difficult time giving plot summaries with my other reviews without ripping other reviewers off and most of you probably know what the basic plot of this trilogy is. If you don't, then you can look up the plot on Wikipedia or look for IMDb for plot summaries for all three movies. Also, I felt like not giving the info that I give nowadays in my reviews because I felt that it would be unnecessary for this type of review. Now let's get my thoughts on this trilogy started.I don't think that I'm breaking new ground when I'm saying that this is one of the greatest film trilogies of all time, but it pretty much is. Even though the first 2 movie are nearly 3 hours long each and the third movie, The Return of the King is actually 3 hours and 20 minutes long, you are never bored, because right from when the first movie, The Fellowship of the Ring begins, you not only become very invested onto the world as well as the characters' journey to destroy the ring of power, but you also become invested in the characters as well. Right from Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey\/Gandalf the White, who is such a bad-ass, each and every character is so investing. However, the best character not just in the trilogy, but n this entire Middle Earth franchise is Gollum, voice acted by Andy Srekis. Whilst he was introduced in The Fellowship of the Ring, that was only a cameo, and it was the second movie, The Two Towers, that made him a fully fleshed-out character and there is even more back story about him in the beginning of The Return of the King. When he first meets Froodo and Sam in The Two Towers, he wants to help them, but he is in conflict with his lust for the ring. The scene where he is talking to himself about whether he should kill Froodo and Sam or not is very well done and powerfully voice- acted by Andy Serkis himself.These movie also have some fantastic action sequences to boot. Every battle in the films of this trilogy is so epic and exciting. One fantastic example is the Battle at Helms Deep in The Two Towers. The CGI is so well done that you forget that the creatures are just visual effects. Not to mention that the cinematography is fantastic and the direction from Peter Jackson is so confident and so well done.Overall, this trilogy of films are fantastic epic fantasies that to me, get better with every movie released. Yes, even though The Fellowship of the Ring is an amazing franchise starter, The Two Towers improves on it with ore character development and that battle on Helms Deep, which is just... damn great. My favorite film in this trilogy however, has to be The Return of the King. It has the best character development, the best acting, the best action and in my opinion, the bet ending of this entire trilogy of films (I know some people found the ending to be too long, but I disagree).

This time I be reviewing all three films like one full fledged review. I decided not to review each one separately because I'd be saying the same thing over again. I also will not be giving a plot summary with this review, because to be honest, I always have a difficult time giving plot summaries with my other reviews without ripping other reviewers off and most of you probably know what the basic plot of this trilogy is. If you don't, then you can look up the plot on Wikipedia or look for IMDb for plot summaries for all three movies. Also, I felt like not giving the info that I give nowadays in my reviews because I felt that it would be unnecessary for this type of review. Now let's get my thoughts on this trilogy started.I don't think that I'm breaking new ground when I'm saying that this is one of the greatest film trilogies of all time, but it pretty much is. Even though the first 2 movie are nearly 3 hours long each and the third movie, The Return of the King is actually 3 hours and 20 minutes long, you are never bored, because right from when the first movie, The Fellowship of the Ring begins, you not only become very invested onto the world as well as the characters' journey to destroy the ring of power, but you also become invested in the characters as well. Right from Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey\/Gandalf the White, who is such a bad-ass, each and every character is so investing. However, the best character not just in the trilogy, but n this entire Middle Earth franchise is Gollum, voice acted by Andy Srekis. Whilst he was introduced in The Fellowship of the Ring, that was only a cameo, and it was the second movie, The Two Towers, that made him a fully fleshed-out character and there is even more back story about him in the beginning of The Return of the King. When he first meets Froodo and Sam in The Two Towers, he wants to help them, but he is in conflict with his lust for the ring. The scene where he is talking to himself about whether he should kill Froodo and Sam or not is very well done and powerfully voice- acted by Andy Serkis himself.These movie also have some fantastic action sequences to boot.

However, its grasp on the kiddy zeitgeist was starting to slip. Critically acclaimed adaptations of superheroes, like Batman The Animated Series, had inched in on the Turtles' territory. The Turtles were no longer as hip among the playground crowd. These things I can attest to, as I was there. A few months after Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III was released, the Power Rangers would premiere, stealing the TMNT's thunder, quickly eclipsing the older series in popularity. But before that happened, the Green Machine went back in time.The film begins with the Heroes Four at ease, practicing via synchronized dance moves. April climbs down the ladder, barring gifts from Japan. Among those gifts is a golden scepter. When holding it, April is thrown back in time to 1700's Japan. A prince is teleported to the modern day in her place. Determined to rescue their friend, the Turtles quickly decipher the mechanics of the device, heading into the past after her. Once in Edo era Nippon, the turtles are embroiled in a plot involving an English trader selling guns to the samurai lord, eager to use the weapons in war, something his son is strictly against.Ninja Turtles III is not well regarded. Most consider the film the long-running series' nadir. As a kid, I remember being disappointed because the villain wasn't Krang. Now that Shredder's dead, that's the second most important villain, right? Or how about Baxter Stockman or Slash? I wasn't alone in that disappointment. The film, instead, breaks wildly from Turtles canon, featuring an original story populated with new characters. It takes the characters out their urban setting, putting them in a different time. It's a Ninja Turtles movie where ninjitsu plays a small role. The Teens spent most of the film dressed as Samurai. Yet it's not fair to judge III for what it isn't.So why do people hate this movie so much? The number one reason is doubtlessly the steep drop in quality concerning the special effects. The Jim Henson Creature Shop, who provided the fantastic suits for the last two films, passed on this one, leaving the effects duties to less disciplined hands. The animatronic heads are less expressive, with blockier faces and more exaggerated features. Whenever they have to talk or express emotion, the fakeness of the suit become apparent. The Turtles' look more rubbery and their skin is dotted with odd liver spots. Splinter, meanwhile, is obviously a hand-puppet, as you never see his legs. While the last two films convinced you that these puppets were real characters, here they look like the unconvincing special effects they are.There are other reasons Ninja Turtles III is considered the crappy one. The film has an obnoxious sense of humor. Throughout the entire film, the Turtles repeatedly drop random pop culture references, many of which have little relevance to the actual plot. There's no reason for the characters to mention the Addams Family, Elvis, or Clint Eastwood and even fewer reasons for the film to find such references so inherently hilarious. While the Turtles are in the past, Casey Jones has to take care of four ancient samurais in modern day New York. He does this by teaching them hockey and taking them out to a dance club, which leads to broad, embarrassing comedy. In the past, the Turtles obsess with Wet Willies and mock a fat dungeon master. It's not sophisticated, is what I'm saying.Moreover, the movie's plot isn't very interesting. Some consider the time travel device too far fetched but I don't think that washes, considering the silly things Turtle fans do accept. Walker is a fairly generic bad guy, motivated by simple greed. The exact reasons he and the samurai lord are working together aren't elaborated on much. His death scene is also super stupid. The looming threat of war is mostly kept off-screen. The film is also poorly paced. After arriving in the past, there are some action scenes with the Turtles attempting to rescue Mikey. After that, the story relaxes into a long, leisurely sequence of the Turtles hanging out in the village. Donnie is preoccupied with going home. Raph befriends a young child who he thinks is too serious. Mikey, meanwhile, starts to fall for Mitsu, the human samurai chick that is actually the time-displaced Kenshin's love interest. Not until the very end, when the Turtles make their way back to the castle, does the plot begin to move again. And that plot is a fairly uninspired MacGuffin chase, the Turtles chasing after the scepter that can take them back home.But I don't hate TMNT III and am coming awfully close to calling it underrated. The film tries something different with the characters. The relationship Raphael forms with young Yoshi comes close to being touching, as it finds the turtle confronting his own angry personality. Michelangelo developing feelings for a human female might strike you as odd but it forms into an interesting storyline, especially when the turtle debates staying behind in the Feudal Japan. The story may be poorly paced but I appreciate the filmmakers attempting to tell a lower-key tale. Elias Koteas and Paige Turco are back and both give decent performances. Lame as the character may be, Stuart Wilson at least has some hammy fun as Walker. The action scenes are surprisingly well choreographed and features the Turtles using their weapons more then part 2 did.The film still opened number 1 at the box office but didn't have the staying power of the previous flicks. Despite plans for a fourth film, the series took an extended break from theaters. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III is ultimately a failure but it's an interesting failure that attempted to take the franchise in a different direction. It didn't do it well but at least it tried.

The earth splits open nearby and a rude lump of glowing stuff comes pouring out, lethal, crackling like bacon in a frying pan, and conveniently built of the kinds of radioactive stuff that Jagger is working on.The blob -- for the most part unseen -- manages to kill several locals by radioactive poisoning before Jagger and the authorities are able to deploy a full-scale replica of their laboratory model. It may not work because the fans are out of synch. Or it may explode, like the tiny lab model does.Will it work? Is Jagger's fantastic theory of blobby organisms having been forced underground as the earth's crust thickened correct? Is the short, squat dilatory figure who runs the lab correct when he calls the whole thing balderdash? Will the whole mess blow up? Why does hail always have to be the size of something else? Did the Masons really design the first dollar bills? It starts off slowly and mysteriously. That's the best part. Then it gets fast, complicated, scientifically inaccurate, and very loud. Sometimes the suspenseful musical score, on top of all that crackling, as of cellophane being wrinkled, literally drowns out the speech so you can't hear what the characters are saying.It's not terrible. It's just a routine example of those 50s Briish SF movies that used an imported Yank as the main figure -- here Dean Jagger, there an improbable Gene Evans -- and sometimes they worked quite well -- Brian Donlevy as Quatermass.

Eastwood is famous for speed, quick decision making and keeps the film rolling. Costner by all accounts is quite the opposite and likes to (or did like to, at the time of Dances with Wolves) take his time, and direct films in a more painstaking fashion. So very much two opposites meeting and two men that have not worked together since I believe. Mind you, one went and hit further heights and the others career slowed down a bit from the heights he was at around the time of this film.Lacks excitement and could have had more life to it really, and I am a big Eastwood fan.

This was not meant to be a slasher movie by any means, if anyone wants to see dozens of killings this is not really a movie to see then, this movie is more about understanding the story of a crazy psychopath, who has it all, but still is envious of every little thing, somebody else has,which leads to him killing everybody in his mind for his own amusement.
