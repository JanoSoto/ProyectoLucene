Lantana is the kind of movie that by all individual measures is a little gem. But the whole of the movie is less that the sum of its parts. Lantana is made to be looked at, not analyzed. It involves a process, not a plot.The movie's premise seems to be that if you are neurotic enough, everything can happen to you. The director's need to throw a small world of disparate characters into each other's lives becomes ridiculous. In one situation, a cop, LaPaglia, is joined by a stranger in a bar who had just bumped into a woman on the street who railed at him for being agressive toward her. The two men talk, reflect, and bond. Later, the same cop is investigating a murder, of the railing woman, and must question his mistress. He arrives her house, knocks on the door, and when it opens, there stands his fellow bondee, who happens to be his mistress's estranged husband. Funny, right? Not here. Instead of playing the situation for comic effect, this becomes one more mystery of fate. The movie is so full of this intertwining of lives that the whole becomes a puzzle rather than a plot. And, it takes itself way too seriously. But no one in the film can laugh much because each is too neurotic to see humor in anything. Lines are delivered with the weight of suffering and conviction. Nothing in Lantana is light.Another movie which relies heavily on outrageous coincidence for it's story development is After Hours about a Manhattan businessman's twilight zone trek through a night of amazingly horrible bad luck. That movie has the plot advantage of a single character's struggle against the odds of his ever seeing dawn again. The night is absurd, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, but never quite ridiculous. The night in Lantana, and make no mistake, it is always night even during the day, is unrelenting. The noir metaphor is evident in the characters' pessimism toward redemption and in the several close-up shots of the film's namesake, a flowering, poisonous shrub.Maybe the director does realize he has been a little heavy-handed because the end of the movie is a series of this-is-what-happened-to-this-person shots. Now this can be seen as a confession that the director and writers could not resolve the story satisfactorily. Or, it might be that, after sitting through two hours of co-neurosis, director Lawrence wanted us to leave the theater with a feel-good notion about dark places. I go with the first idea.

So, that surmise is incorrect.  Thus, it is just a bad movie.The direction is stylistic without reason.  Filtered lighting is used continuously, probably to try to add a sense of atmosphere.  However, the only atmosphere it adds is that of the audience being unable to see the actors clearly.  Some shots are just set up badly; you can see the blocking as blocking, and the actors just trying to hit their mark.Justin Chambers as D'Artagnan was a Chris O'Donnell look alike, and not much else.  He took no risks and his stakes were not high enough.  In short, he was boring.  The character of Planchet was introduced and then left, to do nothing.  There was not much character development.  In any way.  These were all stock characters.The one exception was Tim Roth as Febre.  For, whatever he had to work with, he made his character come alive.  He was dedicated, knew what he wanted, and had an inner life.I could not finish without discussing the fight choreography, created by Xin-Xin Xiong.  Technically, the fighting was amazing.  There is a Ladder fight, which should be in everyone's Top 10 Fight Scenes.  However, most of the fighting was not validated.  It was just fighting for a very small reason.

I really have a hard time believing that this is based on a true story, in fact it seems like it's based on children's book.  It is filled with scenes which are supposed to be tear-triggering drama, but to me they seemed like propaganda-like clichés.  These clichés appalled me entirely, I always thought that the directors, the critics, and the audiences were way too mature for such trash but I was wrong.  Wallace rubbed every major stale cliché ever seen in any dramatic movie in the past 70 years in our faces and got good reviews for that!  Amazing!  I was offended by such immaturity and lack of taste!  But I guess I'm one of the needles in a giant haystack.  Also I noticed that this movie is a complete opposite to the other popular movies with Vietnam War references, such as Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, and Dead Presidents.  The most obvious difference is the childish political correctness which litters the whole film.  There seem to be no racial conflicts in the platoon, in fact they seem to be the most well-mannered, well-educated, and well-organized troops in the world!  There are no dirty jokes and no `gook' references, no cynicism, and profanity is very scarce.  Everyone and everything seem to be perfect.  In fact all the battle scenes seem to be perfect too, with very little blood and mutilation for a war movie.  The slow motion and close-ups of faces kind of gives an impression that dying in a war is a very glorious and beautiful experience.  I found that direction in the film very stupid.  Great war movies such as Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket, and some real war footage all show you that war is a bloody pointless massacre.  But unfortunately we Americans don't like to see that stuff (ohh!).  Just like professional wrestling, this movie shows only what the audience cheers for.  I guess the filmmakers were aiming for a PG-13 rating and a giant profit.

If you want to understand this very complicated movie, it might also help to notice which woman (or women?) appears floating in the sky during parts of the Times Square sequence-also in the opening minutes.It is very difficult to know what to make of all this complexity--doubly so because one cannot go back and review critical passages without shelling out another $8.50.  My suspicion is that the complexity is ultimately incoherent, but maybe I still have to do some heavy lifting.  Consider a couple of additional complexities.  Is it possible that David and Brian are actually killed in the near-brush with the Mack truck in their first scene together?  After surviving, do they get out of the car?  The next cut to David entering his offices is strangely jarring.  He has changed clothes, is wearing a different watch, and has on a funny hat.  Also, David's pre-accident face-so important to the story line-is frozen into a smugly affable look throughout much of the film.

","genre":null},{"date":"19 November 2002","score":"","review":"  It is not a spoiler to alert the viewer that we hear Sophia's voice speaking the opening lines of the movie--even though Julie is David's supposed bed partner as he awakens.  Weirdly, we hear Julie's voice repeating the same line as the last words in the movie--even though David has just launched himself back toward Sophia.  If you want to understand this very complicated movie, it might also help to notice which woman (or women?) appears floating in the sky during parts of the Times Square sequence-also in the opening minutes.It is very difficult to know what to make of all this complexity--doubly so because one cannot go back and review critical passages without shelling out another $8.50.  My suspicion is that the complexity is ultimately incoherent, but maybe I still have to do some heavy lifting.  Consider a couple of additional complexities.  Is it possible that David and Brian are actually killed in the near-brush with the Mack truck in their first scene together?  After surviving, do they get out of the car?  The next cut to David entering his offices is strangely jarring.  He has changed clothes, is wearing a different watch, and has on a funny hat.  Also, David's pre-accident face-so important to the story line-is frozen into a smugly affable look throughout much of the film.  I was thinking it was poor acting on Cruise's part, but maybe it was intended.

A few weeks ago I decided that I wanted to watch all of the Batman films in order.  So, I just finished watching Batman & Robin.  I have to say that this truly is a terrible film.  Well, maybe not terrible, just not what the fans were expecting and definitely not what the fans wanted to see.  If you are an 8 year old, this is actually a pretty good movie, but if not, this might be painful.I'm sure there are a number of people to blame here, but I'm going to put the blame on Joel Schumacher.  What happened???  Joel is a very good director, he's had some amazing films, even his previous Batman film was pretty good.  I think Joel just didn't want to take the film seriously, as I'm sure is a problem with a lot of people, but why on earth did he agree to direct another Batman film is he wasn't going to take it seriously?  Granted, it's a comic book film, so it's a little hard to take it seriously, but what I mean is that he shouldn't have made it so campy.It's sad that you have a film full of so many big names and it still doesn't work.  I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of George Clooney, he's ok, but nothing great.  He did ok with the role, but in all honesty, I don't think he should have been cast as Bruce Wayne\/Batman.  Chris O'Donnell did a fine job, not perfect, but good.  Alicia Silverstone did a find job as well (and looked perfect), but I really don't think her character should have been added to the picture...a little too much.  A great deal of people are continually bashing Arnold Schwarzenegger for his portrayal of Mr. Freeze.  Ok, well he wouldn't have been my first choice as Mr. Freeze either, but I thought he did a great job with the role.  And the make up effects on him were excellent, as was his suit that he wore.  I thought Arnold was a pleasant surprise in the film.  Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy on the other hand, was a MAJOR disappointment.  Uma did a decent job, but the dialogue and the character was just HORRIBLE!!!  They should have just eliminated her character from the film.  Her character was SO uninteresting and just plain boring!  What were they thinking with Bane?  Bane was so useless in the film!  He was no more than a useless henchman throughout the film.  Michael Gough did a great job with his role though, as expected.  Pat Hingle was just fine as Commissioner Gordon.  And finally, I have to mention Elle Macpherson.  What the heck was her character doing in the story?  STUPID!!!  I like Elle as much as the next guy, but her character was beyond useless.Contrary to some people, I thought the special effects were pretty cool and quite well done throughout the film.  Ok, there were a few cases where Mr. Freeze's Ice looked rather fake and plastic, but overall, I thought it was pretty well done.As for the super hero\/villain outfits, I thought they were ok.  Batman sometimes looked cool, and sometimes looked god-awful (what happened to solid black suit in the original?).  Robin had a cool look throughout the film (loose the nipples on the suit though).  Mr. Freeze looked really cool in the film, a very nice touch.  Poison Ivy looked good, the outfit was nothing to complain about.  Batgirl looked pretty good (except when she had on the cap with bat ears and all).  Bane looked ok, not too much to complain about there.The last thing I have to mention is the Batmobile.  GOOD GOD!!!  This is the stupidest vehicle designed in any of the films, NO CONTEST!!!  What the heck is with that enormous hood?  Don't you think Batman would want some sort of top to his car, he doesn't want the baddies shooting at his exposed head!  Need I mention the flashing light thing in the front of the car?  It saddens me that someone, or some people spent a great deal of time and effort on those props and they looked that bad.  I'm sure they worked hard, but I'm sorry, that batmobile was just horrible!  Thank god it didn't last long in the film.Anyhow, this is definitely my least favorite film in the series as most people will agree, but there are some cool things to be seen in the film.  So, if you are a fan of Batman, then check out the other three films and then this one, but keep your hopes low.  I hope you enjoy the film.

First of all who in their right mind would hire Michael Bay to direct a war film? I'll tell you who, Jerry Bruckheimer. The two together make a great team when making blow up action films, but dramatic movies are definitely not their forte. Michael Bay is no more capable of directing a war movie than David Lynch is capable of directing a movie that makes sense.However I can't completely blame Michael Bay for this awful movie, or Jerry Bruckheimer for that matter. Clearly one of the biggest problems with this movie was casting the whiny Ben Affleck in the lead role. He is the worst cast war hero in the history of war films. I would have been ok with it if the character was supposed to be a whiny wimp, in fact I can't think of anyone better to play that kind of character than Affleck, but they tried to make his character this heroic, cool, pilot. His performance was nothing short of pathetic. There were parts of the movie I enjoyed, but coincidentally all those parts were when Affleck was supposedly dead (to bad he wasn't). Every moment Affleck was on the screen I wanted to throw the remote control at the t.v. You might as well have cast his dorky brother Casey for this part, that would have been a heck of a lot better.The script definitely didn't help this movie much, but as a huge Randall Wallace fan I can't hold him responsible. He wrote the script that Bay and Bruckheimer wanted. Randall Wallace is a very corny dialogue writer and it usually works, in fact it's downright brilliant in movies like Braveheart and We Were Soldiers, but for some reason in this movie it just didn't work. Why is this? The answer is that he was just writing what they wanted, and who wouldn't write some sappy cornball movie when you're getting paid a truckload of cash.The acting overall was wretched. Even Tom Sizemore disappointed in this one, mostly because he was playing the same character he always does. But I can't write this review without giving credit to Josh Hartnett and William Lee Scott. They turned in great performances considering what they had to work with.All in all this movie was a sad excuse for a war film and an insult to the Pearl Harbor tragedy.

I would have been ok with it if the character was supposed to be a whiny wimp, in fact I can't think of anyone better to play that kind of character than Affleck, but they tried to make his character this heroic, cool, pilot. His performance was nothing short of pathetic. There were parts of the movie I enjoyed, but coincidentally all those parts were when Affleck was supposedly dead (to bad he wasn't). Every moment Affleck was on the screen I wanted to throw the remote control at the t.v. You might as well have cast his dorky brother Casey for this part, that would have been a heck of a lot better.The script definitely didn't help this movie much, but as a huge Randall Wallace fan I can't hold him responsible. He wrote the script that Bay and Bruckheimer wanted. Randall Wallace is a very corny dialogue writer and it usually works, in fact it's downright brilliant in movies like Braveheart and We Were Soldiers, but for some reason in this movie it just didn't work. Why is this? The answer is that he was just writing what they wanted, and who wouldn't write some sappy cornball movie when you're getting paid a truckload of cash.The acting overall was wretched. Even Tom Sizemore disappointed in this one, mostly because he was playing the same character he always does. But I can't write this review without giving credit to Josh Hartnett and William Lee Scott. They turned in great performances considering what they had to work with.All in all this movie was a sad excuse for a war film and an insult to the Pearl Harbor tragedy. Most of the time this movie looked like a pepsi commercial masquerading as a legitimate WWII movie. This movie was an insult to me as a fan of war movies and for that reason I can't recommend it. However if you like to torture yourself by watching garbage then by all means give it a whirl.1 out of 10 (would be lower but the scale doesn't go down to minus 347) ","genre":"Action, Drama, History"},{"date":"19 November 2002","score":"9 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":"  This, THIS utter piece of junk, slapped together and lacking anything close to coherence, this was supposed to blow the lid off of some conspiracy about Cobain's death?

The musical choices are bland, drab, and perfectly fit the endless blank-wall pallor of the film (except the live bands add a little flavor).

The scenes of the Rising and the Civil War are quite accurate (barring such things as carbombs, which someone else has already mentioned) though grossly oversimplified.  Kitty Kiernan does not deserve the major part she has been given in this film - Michael Collins was never that interested in women. I have to stress, as someone else has, that there were the Auxiliaries as well as the Black and Tans (so called incidentally, because there were not enough field uniforms to go round, so they were a hodge-podge of different uniforms), and the Auxiliaries, the officiers, were discernably worse than the rank and file.  Also, the fighting did nto affect most of the country. A note on the casting - the character of Kitty Kiernan was nto that big, though I think she was given more screen time as she was played by Julia Roberts.  Someone tell this woman that she CANNOT do accents.  Alan Rickman was more Sheriff of Nottingham than de Valera.  Aiden Quinn as Harry Boland wasn't bad, though I would have to quibble about the character, but I feel that is more the fault of the writers than him.  And lastly, sorry though I am to say it, Liam Neeson doesn't even compare to Brendan Gleeson's performance as Collins in 1992's The Treaty, even his accent wasn't quite right. For those who would like to know what really happened, I would recomment 'The Treaty', Tim Pat Coogan's biography (though he is a tad biased) and T. Ryle Dwyer's 'Big Fellow, Long Fellow', which is a joint biography of de Valera and Collins. This film is a real disappointment.  I would have to repeat Bono's statement - 'I'm sick of Irish Americans come up to me, and tell me about the Revolution back home ... that the majority of people in my country don't want', which, unfortunately are the kind of sentiments that this film has engendered.

Abraham LincolnThe 1993 black and white Schindler's List was directed by Steven Spielberg.  The Holocaust based movie lasts about three hours and fifteen minutes.   The movie is based on a true story about a man named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Nazi businessman. In 1939 Oskar Schindler tried to convince Jewish people to give him money to open a factory.   Coming in contact with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingdley), a Jewish accountant, he arranged a financial agreement with him.  Osker's idea did not really take hold until 1941 when the Jewish dollar was basically worthless. In 1941 there were several elderly people who decided to invest their money in Schindler's idea, during this time the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik was built.  Hired as cheap labor to work in the factory, the Jews soul purpose was to make pots that would be sold to the army.When compiling his list of Jews he wanted for workers, Oscar had one blank space left at the bottom of the page.  Going to Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) with his list, Amon noticed that there was a blank space at the end of the last page.  Schindler wanted to add Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), Amon's maid, whom Amon had fallen in love with and not even realized it. At the end of the movie, we learn that Schindler managed to save 1,100 Jews from a cruel death.  From those 1,100 survivors, we now have 6,000 Jewish descendants. I find it interesting to watch and to learn about one of the most horrific times in history. One of the most memorable remarks for me was one made by Oskar Schindler `This car. Why did I keep the car? Amon would've bought this car. 10 people right there. This pin, 2 people, This is gold! 2 people he could've given me 2 people at least one. One person. One person who is dead. One person I could've gotten out and I didn't!!' It seemed like the Jews were just workers.  It did not seem like he cared what happened to them. Oscar did not make any kind of emotional connection to the workers; they were just people whom he could purchase for little money.  When he made this statement and almost had a nervous breakdown, it seemed like he cared for the people and did not want to see them killed. If I had to rate this movie I would give it 4 out of 5.  One of the things that I did not like was when they would talk in German.  Unless we know how to speak German, we do not know what they are saying.
