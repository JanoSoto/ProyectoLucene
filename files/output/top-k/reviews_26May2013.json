The money skimmed is located, and the US government seizes it which angers the drug baron who was being scammed, Ernesto Escobedo. Escobedo's intel man, former Cuban DGI colonel Felix Cortez, sees an opportunity to seize power by having the US Ambassador, and the visiting FBI Director assassinated. Meanwhile, the CIA, without Ryan's knowledge, is running an illegal covert operation against the drug cartels, with covert troops deep in Colombia staging hit and run raids on drug factories, and secret airports used for aircraft smuggling drugs. The assassinations provoke the President into ordering things to be taken to a new lever. An aerial strike is ordered against a drug baron's mansion while he is meeting with several others, and attempts are made to pass it off as a car bombing by angry cartel members.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"26 May 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the best and most original films to come out of Hollywood in the last 20 years. Director Barry Sonnenfeld takes his unashamedly different approaches to film and comedy into the area of the comic book movie franchise genre. The wonderful cast is headed up by the always dependable Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as Agents K and J, respectively. It is an absolutely delightful film, in every sense of the word. The movie combines drama with humor and action, and does it very well. It is the best film I've seen in the area of achieving these moments of fierce action and real-world occurrences, directly followed up by moments of off-the-wall sci-fi adventure and outrageous dialog\/characterizations\/body language. 'Men in Black' is more or less three parallel stories running simultaneously, all expertly navigated by Sonnenfeld. We have the background story of the Men in Black agency, being told to us by Agent K and Director Zed (Rip Torn). In a nutshell, the agency has been around for a long time now. It is tasked with monitoring alien activity and protecting Earth's citizens from any harm the aliens might have planned. Smith first shows up as NYPD cop James Edwards, who through a very strange (yet hilarious) set of occurrences, is gradually inducted into the agency and learns the ropes, therefore becoming the newest recruit. And we have the not-so-unfortunate story of a douche bag farmer named Edgar, who is killed but his skin is used as a disguise 'Edgar suit' for an evil alien bug. This bug plans to find an item of great importance to him and to other alien races, so that a certain war between two of these races can continue, and his own race can continue to feed off the casualties - literally. Now, while this may seem like a lot of unnecessary explanation leading to a lot of unnecessary exposition in the film, this is simply not so. The story is explained, very quickly, in just a few scenes. Sometimes, we figure out things as the characters do, other times, we are let in on stuff long before the characters ever are. But the film does not ever lose pace because of these elements, nor does it stop so the audience can catch up with all these goings-on. The film purposefully barrels along at a breakneck speed, and the audience is just expected to dive right in and hold on for dear life. Once this is accomplished, the story is really not that hard to understand. However, if one feels that the story disappoints or just doesn't understand it, then the film is always entertaining just as a great popcorn flick. This would also probably be the case for why small children enjoy these films so much - they may not understand the story particulars, but they like the special effects and the comedic moments. This is all assisted by not only the main cast, but also by several great character actors and actresses, such as Tony Shalhoub and Siobhan Fallon. Whichever way you look at it, 'Men in Black' is a ridiculously entertaining ride of action and all kinds of comedy, and I highly recommend it. Which is not something I can say for 'Men in Black II', unfortunately. Since I haven't seen 'Men in Black III' as of yet, I cannot comment on it in the slightest. I'm hoping it's just as good, or better even, than this first installment.

Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones.Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'.Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes.The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk.While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable.Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

A very simple story, straight to the point, no pun intended. A very deep story of humanity that we all can relate to. Very well acted all around, but extremely well acted by Richard Farnsworth as he received a well deserved Oscar Nomination for the lead in this film. I love the fact that David Lynch directed this film. Out of thousands of directors who love to make movies out of the bizarre and crazy, David Lynch is probably the only one who has had a successful and lucrative A- List Career at doing so. Lynch always has a specific style and story that he does which is usually a very odd and bizarre one which makes for a very odd and bizarre film. But The Straight Story is something completely different then anything Lynch has ever done. For one thing it's rated G, and it's a Disney Film. I don't think any of us Film Buffs would ever fathom we would be using Rated G, Disney Film and David Lynch in the same sentence in our lifetime. But The Straight Story truly shows what a gifted and talented director David Lynch is. It's just a shame Lynch doesn't go outside of his box more often. What I love about Steven Spielberg is about half the time you can tell it's a Spielberg film by the style of how it is made, but the other half of the time you can't tell Spielberg made the film. And I think sometimes a great director needs to switch it up from time to time and step outside their box and try new styles and stories, just try something different. So David Lynch tried a new style and something different with The Straight Story and it is absolutely a beautiful film. The cinematography is amazing, the pace is perfect for the story at hand, and that's all in thanks to the great directing job of Lynch. Very well edited as well, in thanks to Lynch as well as the other film editor\/editors. A movie that one can watch over and over again. Also a film that can make one feel good about life and living again. Farnsworth delivers his lines with such simplicity, such humanity that they go deep in the viewers soul and the viewer will not soon forget certain lines that Farnsworth says in the film(as his character Alvin).

The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, Jim. It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, the Sambo. The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other white characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, When I See a Elephant Fly is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was Baby Mine, I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

Unfortunately, none of these films did fantastic at the box office because of the lack of support. But that doesn't mean what was produced, was poor material. This film is probably the one that lit the fuse to construct the other three later to come.There is a subtle difference between this particular film and the other three - the sense of realism. The setting is the same, which takes place in the 1930's but the world that detective Dick Tracy lives in, is a little bit unrealistic. But this is what makes it so avant-garde. For example, Each characters name depicts what they are like. If a mob member's name is called Flattop, they will literally have a flat top. Or another named Little Face, truly has a small face. Each character is a characacher of their own name. This is actually rather clever and funny at the same time. I liked that a lot, even if no person would ever have such a misshapen body structure.Starring is Warren Beatty, an acclaimed actor, best known for his role in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), directs his third film with this comic strip icon - Detective Dick Tracy. Along with him, co-stars Al Pacino, a very young Madonna, Paul Sorvino, Glenne Headly even Dick Van Dyke and several others. And even with a big cast, sometimes films don't do well, but here, it works out well because of how likable these characters are. Beatty plays Tracy like it's been his job for more than his acting career. Madonna is attractive and highly seductive like she was supposed to be, so that works. Even Al Pacino as the villain gives some comedic relief. It's funny because how his make-up was applied makes him look like a Muppet.What also stood out was just how colorful the entire film was, in its most basic form that is. Movies now a days and even back then contained a multiple array of colors but in Beatty's film, it sticks to your regular Kindergarten colors - green, yellow, red, blue, black, orange... and so on. There are no shades to these primary and secondary colors. They are just your basic crayons and it really stands out. Dick Tracy wouldn't be as memorable to me if he didn't wear his banana colored fedora and trench coat. It just wouldn't be the same and it's because of these colors that help accentuate the exaggerations of the characters.Lastly, comes the music score provided by none other than Danny Elfman. What's great about Elfman's score in this particular work is that he gives the comic strip hero and his love interest each their own memorable theme. Along with that are Elfman's other tracks that contain a lot of jazzy tunes consisting of trumpets and other instruments from that specific time. I did find it cliché though to how the famous detective gets himself into trouble for a lot of silly things because he's either not paying attention or because he lets his selfishness get to him. But that's about it.The movie adaptation of the 1930's comic strip detective is colorful, clever, has great performances and memorable music.

There's a lot of pointless scenes in the movie that should have been cut out, like a previous critic reviewer said a 2 hour movie stretched into 3.If you look at Micheal Bay's movies, they are all typically long movies... Titanic, Avatar, etc. Plus, Micheal Bay movies are also typically based around LOVE STORIES. If you looked at the cover of the movie where it says Pearl Harbor then directed by Micheal Bay you can't complain about the romance in the movie, because that's practically a given on almost any Micheal Bay movie.Just like Titanic, it's a romance twisted around a real life event. The romance drama is actually very good and it keeps you locked into the movie. I really liked the situation of the love triangle and the fact that Rafe came back to find that his one and only love had fallen in love with his closest & best friend Danny. HONESTLY, THE WHOLE STORY REVOLVING THE ROMANCE WAS GREAT.Where the movie lacks MAJORLY is the accuracy of the real life event of Pearl Harbor. Now the reason why this movie has a big fat ol' F of a rating on IMDb 5.8 is because when you call a movie Pearl Harbor IT SHOULD BE ABOUT PEARL HARBOR. There was a lot of foreshadowing throughout the movie that Pearl Harbor was the target for the Japanese. Why? I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE Micheal BAY DIDN'T TELL US. People who have no historical knowledge of Pearl Harbor will feel lost watching this movie. BESIDES THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DIED AND THE Japanese BOMBED PEARL HARBOR, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON.Also, the film featured Doris Miller and his story of the black cook hero of Pearl Harbor. You don't know who Doris is? Well that sucks. Micheal Bay apparently didn't want to do a very good job at explaining who he was. He comes in a scene here, then a scene there, and all of a sudden he's shooting down an aircraft. Why this has any sort of importance, WE DON'T KNOW. Then he gets a medal, why? WE DON'T KNOW.Overall, one half of the movie I'm like YES I LOVE IT the other half I'm like THIS IS TERRIBLESo I'm giving this movie a 6.5 (I put 7 though)Not one of Micheal Bay's best movies....

Both in reality and on screen, Rhee's techniques look great and the man clearly has an excellent command of martial arts, so why is it that in a movie starring this guy, in a series about martial arts, do we not even seen him fight anyone until about 40 minutes into this one? Now, I'm not saying that an action movie can't have build up and suspense, or it should be all fighting and no plot, but Best of the Best 3 starts the movie off with the heavy subject of violent racism and doesn't dial back from there. With virtually no relation and continuity to the other 2 movies in the series, Best of the Best 3 has only one constant, the character of Rhee's Tommy Lee, who is down South visiting his sister that he's never mentioned (although he does apparently have Indian grandparents and a brother from the second) and has to intervene in the grand plot of a White Supremacist group.Compared to the other 2 Best of the Best movies, which were about fighting tournaments and the comradery between the martial artists on the team, this one is totally Tommy Lee's show, and deals with an intense, sensitive, and serious issue. But it deals with it via motorcycle chases, explosions, and kicking. Even though the film has a good message, the corny acting and dialouge and overall 90's action movie goofiness just doesn't work for the hard hitting subject matter, which is something that deserves serious examination and treatment.It's not to say that the movie doesn't have it's entertaining moments, but whenever you get into some of the action, it draws you right back to the ugly topic it's all based around, but the poor execution makes it hard to enjoy. Overall, Phillip Rhee would've been better off including Eric Roberts, a major character in the other 2 movies in some way, and continuing the story and through line he had established with 1 and 2, which were also cheezy martial arts movies, but stayed within their depth and didn't try to tackle something this hard hitting and real.

While the film was a financial success, it proved to be far less successful than the previous films, and it's telling that 11 years later, they're attempting another reboot of the series.Affleck is likable, but he doesn't have anything close to the presence Alec and Harrison had. He is far outclassed by costars such as Morgan Freeman, Alan Bates, James Cromwell, and taking over from Willem Dafoe, Liev Schreiber as John Clark. It's interesting to note how Clark is introduced, a lone mysterious figure standing in the rain - it's fair to assume Clark, a regular and very popular character in the Ryan books, was to appear in further movies.To accommodate Ben as Jack, the book has undergone an extensive change, with Jack now a young rookie analyst, yet to be married to Cathy. While the simple premise remains the same - terrorists build nuclear device from Israeli weapon left over from Yom Kippur War and use it to provoke nuclear war between US and Russia, Jack is forced to end the crisis himself by going directly to the Hot Line - one can't help feeling extremely cynical about the change of villains. In the book, the main villains are Palestinians, helped by a former left-wing German terrorist, and an American Indian extremist. In the film we get....neo-Nazis. As good as Alan Bates is as the megalomaniacal fascist Austrian politician, it is difficult to take seriously the scenario.In fact, the film's biggest problem is this - they are trying to present it as a more-realistic-than-usual thriller, yet at the same time, the film has cartoonish villains, and there are a great number of moments that take us out of realism and into pure fantasy.As problem-riddled as the film is, one area it does not fail at is entertaining the viewer. If one distances themselves from the previous films, the books, it is still a pretty good thriller that always keeps your attention glued to the screen. It's pace goes along at a fair clip, and there are some standout sequences. The best sequence is obviously when the nuke goes off.

Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.What I love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. We don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about Tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' To see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.With a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone. From the films I've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. Even with a film as dark as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'Once Upon a Time in America,' Leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is pure beauty on film.

To see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.With a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone. From the films I've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. Even with a film as dark as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'Once Upon a Time in America,' Leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is pure beauty on film.

Somehow I didn't got to see Caddyshack until last year. This movie has been called on of the greatest comedy movies of 80's and beyond. To be honest I think the movie is a little bit overrated ( probably because of the cult status it has). I didn't enjoyed it as much as I expected . I would rather watch one more time one of the movies I've mentioned above.It doesn't mean I don't like the movie at all. The problem for me is that a lot of the jokes fall flat. There is plenty of low humor , over-the-top humor and at times also quite vulgar humor. I think I like a little bit more sophisticated humor. On the other hand I like the fact that this movie is not politically correct . I laughed hard at some of the jokes that will be probably offensive to other people ( For example &#x96; Rodney Dangerfield tells his Asian friend  This is a rather exclusive club , so don't tell anyone that you're a Jew ) . The parody of Jaws  is priceless. Gunga Allunga. Overall , I had good time , but it's not necessarily my type of comedy.There is also a little problem with the screenplay. Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is supposed to be the main hero of the movie , yet he ends as a supporting character. He isn't even on the movie poster ! There is a love story between him and Maggie (Sarah Holcomb) that I've found rather boring and unnecessary . One could wonder wouldn't it be better for the movie to get rid of his character . Most of the jokes are otherwise provided by the so-called supporting characters that obviously and easily steal the whole show. I like the fact that the movie feels improvised , but the writers should make the story a little bit more focused.Acting is definitively a strong side of Caddyshack . Chevy Chase , Bill Murray , Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight &#x96; each one of these actors fits his role PERFECTLY. All those characters are very charismatic and memorable. Chase plays Ty Webb - a rich and lazy guy with a Zen philosophy of life. Dangerfield plays Al Czervik &#x96; obnoxious , rich businessman from Czech Republic who's got no taste whatsoever. Murray plays Carl Spackler &#x96; retarded gardener who's trying to kill pesky ( but cute) gopher . Oh , by the way the obviously mechanic gopher was created by George Lucas. Last but not least Knight plays Judge Smails &#x96; hysterical and arrogant owner of the golf club. Other actors also give fine performances. It was also good to see Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall) naked.The soundtrack is great . Kenny Loggins songs are catchy , especially the main song &#x96;  I'm alright  . Other artists are  Eddie Cochran Summertime blues ,Earth Wind and Fire Boogie Wonderland , Hilly Michaels Something on your mind , Journey Any way you want it , The Paul Collins Beat There she goes , Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky Waltz of the Flowers - Nutcracker Ballet and Bill Murray (!)Ballad of the Green Berets. All those songs are great as well. The original music made by Johnny Mandel is very jazzy and nice. The musical scenes are beautifully choreographed and the music is excellent.This movie is better than any movie mad by Adam Sandler or Farrelly brothers , but I like other 80's comedies better. Still , if you like this type of humor you will probably enjoy yourself. I give it 8\/10.

De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life.Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome Hell's Angels get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl.Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings.No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.
