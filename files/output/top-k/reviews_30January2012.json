Aurora (MacLaine) is a controlling, finicky and over-protective mother who, after her husband's death, raises her daughter to be like her mother. However, Emma (Winger) is not what Aurora conditions her to be, as she becomes a more open, carefree girl who dresses and snorts like a tomboy and falls in love with a bum. Aurora, in one of the scenes, rebukes her for marrying such a man, and Emma suggests that she not come for her marriage. When Aurora, like a typical mother, acts as though she is hurt by her daughter's reply, Aurora cheekily tells her friend 'Oh, my own mother is not coming to the wedding like that makes her wedding unique. Flap (Daniels) is a teacher who lives in a shabby house where second-hand books replace furniture, a stark contrast to Aurora's own neat-and-clean bungalow with a large backyard embellished with flowers of multiple colors. Aurora can't bear Flap's flippant attitude and unrefined appearance and manners &#x96; she seethes inwardly when Flap takes a bite out of her meticulously prepared and decorated fish using his hands like a bumpkin. She feels insulted and livid by Flap's humorous remark to her reaction to Emma's pregnancy. Aurora is a difficult woman to like &#x96; like a cat she purrs around two men who are head over heels infatuated with her but does not let them bite her. Only a big bad prowling wolf like Nicholson can really seize her. Emma becomes a simple housewife who worries about her husband and children and the increasing financial tensions. When she leaves Texas, Emma maintains contact with her mother through the phone and both exchange talks about their lives. Emma falls for another guy but is still possessive about Flap while Aurora's heart is conquered by Garrett (Nicholson). Flap himself begins a secret affair with a student named Janice. In all this, the dreaded cancer strikes Emma and then all the attention diverts to this matter.I do not favor such an ending, because I feel it lacks a proper resolution and goes for cheap tricks instead. The cancer subject was treated better than many other films &#x96; the ten-fifteen minute cancer trauma in 'Love Story' was shabby and the 'Oh Hi Cancer! in 'The Room' was spectacularly bad. Terms of Endearment at least treats the cancer matter more seriously, but then there is a feeling of dissatisfaction of not getting to see a more fulfilling ending of all relationships. Some characters are trimmed off in the end and some unnecessary albeit well acted scenes between the four prime characters take place. In 2008s Revolutionary Road, Kate Winslet's character had deliberated about abortion in the beginning but then quickly dismisses the idea. But as circumstances turn for the worse and she cares less and less about the baby, Kate is driven to abort the baby illegally. I prefer such endings where some thread left loose in the beginning is brought back in the ending. Of course, Terms of Endearment would not need such a disturbing ending, but what if Emma had admitted about her affair to Flap? Or Tommy refused to live with Emma? Don't blame the director here though; it has to be loyal to the book. Otherwise, the movie has fine acting moments. Shirley MacLaine channels Aurora with the perfect aura &#x96; when she is in bed with Garrett and he is telling her about his space journey, she blushes and smiles and starts resembling her daughter. Sometimes Emma, played beautifully by Winger, begins to sound like her mother. Both the characters may be different in their thinking, but the actresses try to bring out certain traits that are similar between mother and daughter, for example their over-the-top nature. Nicholson is d the right man for the right job while Daniels is acceptable even though he does not lend individuality to his character. Lithgow was good in his parts, though his character went missing after the cancer tale. The actor playing Tommy too was fine &#x96; at the age of 10-12, many kids have this brashness and aloofness that Tommy had. I can cite the example of my ten year old cousin who really tries to act too mature and leave-me-alone type at times. Plus it is difficult for a ten year old kid to actually understand the feeling of loss &#x96; I was nine when my aunt passed away, but I could not really grasp that loss because I was too young.MacLaine deserved the Oscar, the tiny additions to her character like the constant movement of her fingers or the naturally expressive eyes are lovely to watch. Debra is equally great if not better, but yes, MacLaine was Wow!
