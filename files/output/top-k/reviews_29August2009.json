The movie handles some great subjects, especially for its time. You have to consider that this movie got made really just after the war had ended. Yet it already handles some of the themes war WW II veterans and also lots of later war veterans had to deal with. The world, their families and themselves all changed, with brings along some at times devastating effects but also often some hopeful things. They have to pick up their 'normal' lives again, with a job, their wives and the rest of their families. It shows how the veterans were often being treated and looked upon. This isn't just a movie glorifying the WW II veterans but also one that has the guts to be bold and straight-forward, by showing life how it truly is but never without the respect those deserve who all fought in the second world war.I guess you still have to be an American though to fully appreciate this movie. You could say that this movie is a real Americana one, filled with pride and hope, for and about a generation, that should make American's feel warm from the inside. Not that the movie is being overly patristic or anything, it's just pride in a good and understandable way, that is still best appreciated by American's themselves.The movie is being quite epic, mostly due to its long running time. Director William Wyler used its long running time to slowly set up its characters to build up the right themes and emotions for the movie. It makes The Best Years of Our Lives effective as a genre movie and perhaps still more accessible and less sappy than some of the other similar dramatic movies made during the same decade.It's of course also really a real actors movie. Luckily the movie has some great actors in it, such as Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews. Real WW II veteran and amputee Harold Russell attracted the most attention at the time and even took home two Oscar's for his one role in this movie. He received a special award dedicated to him 'for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance'. He lost both of his hands during the war due to exploding TNT during an exercise and ever since used hooks to get around. It's amazing how well he got around with them and how much he still could manage with it, without the help of others. This is mostly what earned him the Oscar because in all honesty I sincerely doubt that he would had won an Oscar otherwise.

G. Wells' classic novel, although it had famously been adapted for radio by Orson Welles. The producer George Pál was known for his science fiction films, and later produced and directed a version of Wells' The Time Machine. The War of the Worlds was directed by Byron Haskin, a frequent collaborator with Pál. As Orson Welles had done in 1938, and as Stephen Spielberg was to do when he filmed a version of the story in 2005, Pál and Haskin moved the setting from the South-East England of the 1890s to contemporary America, in this case southern California. In each case I think this was the right decision. Science fiction is a genre which concerns itself with what might happen in the present or in the future, not with what might have happened in the past. A modern film which showed Martians attacking Victorian London would be an odd mixture of sci-fi and alternative history (a literary genre which rarely transfers well to the cinema) and would probably look very quaint. The film follows the basic outlines of Wells' story. The Martians, whose home planet is a cold, barren world, cast envious eyes on the warmer, more fertile Earth. In the opening voice-over we learn that they have considered, but rejected, several other planets in the Solar System; the one that is not mentioned as a possible alternative home is Venus, probably because in the 1950s this planet was (wrongly) regarded by scientists as being suitable for life. They land on Earth in overwhelming force and begin attacking the planet's inhabitants with their advanced weaponry. Human weapons, including the atomic bomb, prove useless against the Martian war machines, and it seems that it will be only a matter of days before the world is overrun. Besides altering the date and location, the film also changes some of the emphases of Wells' novel. It omits (probably wisely) Wells' observations on imperialism, civilisation and the class system and has a more pronounced religious emphasis. The final scene in the church, where the survivors pray for deliverance, has no equivalent in the book, although even Wells, by no means a religious man, attributed to the workings of divine wisdom the microbes which prove to be the invaders' downfall. It is perhaps significant that the last words were hear are those of Martin Luther's hymn-And free us from all ills, In this world and the next. This film is sometimes quoted as one of the great science fiction films of the fifties, although, given that the genre had a deservedly bad reputation during the period due to the efforts of inept directors like Ed Wood, that might not be considered very high praise. It is, however, considerably better than most fifties sci-fi, and, indeed, I would rank it higher than Spielberg's version. It won an Oscar for its special effects, which are very impressive by the standards of the period, especially the depiction of the Martian attack on Los Angeles. One thing that the effects department could not get right were the tripods, the Martian vehicles described by Wells, with the result that the invaders go into battle in sleek hovercraft-type craft shaped like a flying-wing aircraft. (A human flying-wing is shown delivering the atomic bomb). One thing that is rather perfunctory is the characterisation. The two main characters are Dr. Clayton Forrester, a famous scientist, and his love-interest Sylvia van Buren, but neither is particularly well developed. There are no major stars in the film; Clayton and Sylvia are played by Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, neither of whom had anything like the high profile that Tom Cruise, who plays the leading role in the 2005 movie, enjoys today.There is, however, a reason for this. There is something of a modern convention that disaster films should follow a two-part structure, the first part introducing us to a select group of characters with whom we can identify and the second dealing with the disaster itself. This structure works well enough when we are following the attempts of the select group to escape from, say, a sinking ship or burning building, but it seems inadequate when the film concerns the future of the entire planet. In his version, however, Spielberg follows this convention too closely, as does M. Night Shyamalan in Signs, another recent alien-invasion film, with the result that the audience end up asking themselves can Tom Cruise survive? or can Mel Gibson survive?, when they should be asking themselves can the human race survive? Pál and Haskin avoid this trap; indeed, by 1953 this convention had probably not yet evolved. They were not trying to make a character-driven film concentrating on a few individuals, but a film about a threat to the entire world. Unlike Spielberg and Shyamalan, whose films are both very America-centric, they show us what is happening in other parts of the world and the efforts of world governments to co-ordinate their efforts. As a result this is one alien-invasion film that actually manages to convince us something immense is at stake. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 August 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This was the first cinema adaptation of H.

What a gal! This harrowing and brilliantly filmed tale is a complete tour de force from beginning to end. Why is it that these modest independent films are always ignored for American awards? Swinton's performance is really Oscar material, and so are the writing and direction by the pair Scott McGehee (spelling that surname requires some practice!) and David Siegel. The film is based on a novel by Elizabeth Holding, and whoever chose that as the basis for a movie was very clever. The young Croatian actor Voran Visnjic (pronouncing that is even harder than spelling McGehee, but is apparently 'vish-nyich') was a brilliant choice for the other lead role in this film. The third role is Swinton's gay son, played sensitively and just right by Jonathan Tucker. Rarely has female multi-tasking been better portrayed than in this film, as Swinton carries out a multitude of household chores simultaneously with phone conversations, ironing separate piles of clothes and delivering them to their respective rooms, giving instructions to her children, negotiating her way out of blackmail which threatens to ruin her family, raising money while her husband is away on a battleship in the North Atlantic (he is an absent naval captain), plotting how to save her son from a murder rap, looking after her resident father-in-law, saving him from a heart attack, emptying the garbage, and much else besides. Swinton manages to make herself as unglamourous as possible, in order to simulate a 'normal American wife'. Of course there is no denying that she is one the strangest looking people on earth, a kind of alien in our midst. In certain shots, with the sunlight at a particular angle, the eerie green of her eyes shimmers like something from a sci fi film. Her very weirdness compels our attention, as we see this bizarre creature that she is enacting human roles, as if she were not really from outer space after all, but were 'one of us'. (I say 'us' for all those who really are from this planet.) Her genius is not just acting talent, it is the capacity to cast a spell. So you see, she really is another species, because she bewitches the viewer with some kind of extra-terrestrial magic, so that you become so absorbed you forget where you are. You could almost believe it is a Martian movie and you are on Mars watching it. That would fit. But then 'bang!' you are back to Reno, Nevada, which is all too earthly! There are lots of shots of the beautiful Lake Tahoe, beside which Swinton lives. And into her life comes the young blackmailer from a world of vice played by 'vish-nyich'. He is incredibly sensitive in delineating a 'lost' young man who slowly gains some humanity and reforms his character right before our eyes, a truly magical instance of character transformation, and frankly one of the most extreme examples of 'screen character development' in a mere 96 minutes ever filmed. The fact that 'vish-nyich' makes this convincing is a tribute to his profound acting skills. He has that handsome weak face that reminds one of the young Alain Delon. His thin cheeks even wobble in the same way at moments of stress. He conveys without any dialogue to support it at all his entire life history, how he never had a family, never knew a loving and attentive mother, always had a hard time and decided to become hard in turn, and proves how shallow the roots of all this ruthlessness really are within him. This film is truly a profound one, a masterpiece of film-making by all concerned, and it is a tense nail-biting thriller which has you on the edge of your Martian couch.

Swinton's performance is really Oscar material, and so are the writing and direction by the pair Scott McGehee (spelling that surname requires some practice!) and David Siegel. The film is based on a novel by Elizabeth Holding, and whoever chose that as the basis for a movie was very clever. The young Croatian actor Voran Visnjic (pronouncing that is even harder than spelling McGehee, but is apparently 'vish-nyich') was a brilliant choice for the other lead role in this film. The third role is Swinton's gay son, played sensitively and just right by Jonathan Tucker. Rarely has female multi-tasking been better portrayed than in this film, as Swinton carries out a multitude of household chores simultaneously with phone conversations, ironing separate piles of clothes and delivering them to their respective rooms, giving instructions to her children, negotiating her way out of blackmail which threatens to ruin her family, raising money while her husband is away on a battleship in the North Atlantic (he is an absent naval captain), plotting how to save her son from a murder rap, looking after her resident father-in-law, saving him from a heart attack, emptying the garbage, and much else besides. Swinton manages to make herself as unglamourous as possible, in order to simulate a 'normal American wife'. Of course there is no denying that she is one the strangest looking people on earth, a kind of alien in our midst. In certain shots, with the sunlight at a particular angle, the eerie green of her eyes shimmers like something from a sci fi film. Her very weirdness compels our attention, as we see this bizarre creature that she is enacting human roles, as if she were not really from outer space after all, but were 'one of us'. (I say 'us' for all those who really are from this planet.) Her genius is not just acting talent, it is the capacity to cast a spell. So you see, she really is another species, because she bewitches the viewer with some kind of extra-terrestrial magic, so that you become so absorbed you forget where you are. You could almost believe it is a Martian movie and you are on Mars watching it. That would fit. But then 'bang!' you are back to Reno, Nevada, which is all too earthly! There are lots of shots of the beautiful Lake Tahoe, beside which Swinton lives. And into her life comes the young blackmailer from a world of vice played by 'vish-nyich'. He is incredibly sensitive in delineating a 'lost' young man who slowly gains some humanity and reforms his character right before our eyes, a truly magical instance of character transformation, and frankly one of the most extreme examples of 'screen character development' in a mere 96 minutes ever filmed. The fact that 'vish-nyich' makes this convincing is a tribute to his profound acting skills. He has that handsome weak face that reminds one of the young Alain Delon. His thin cheeks even wobble in the same way at moments of stress. He conveys without any dialogue to support it at all his entire life history, how he never had a family, never knew a loving and attentive mother, always had a hard time and decided to become hard in turn, and proves how shallow the roots of all this ruthlessness really are within him. This film is truly a profound one, a masterpiece of film-making by all concerned, and it is a tense nail-biting thriller which has you on the edge of your Martian couch.

The two films are pretty straight forward in terms of their story. The homeless Apple Annie (Davis) is considered a hero by gangster Dave the Dude (Ford) who believes that her apples bring him luck. Annie eventually is shocked to learn that the daughter she hasn't seen since a baby is coming to visit her with a rich Duke and doesn't want her to know she's homeless. With the help of Dave, Annie transforms into a royal mother. I enjoyed LADY FOR A DAY for its heart and charm but the same can't be said for this overlong remake that just goes on and on and on. The movie runs a whopping 137-minutes, which is about, at least, half an hour too long. This film and the original tell the exact same story but like a lot of remakes from this era, this film has to throw in countless subplots and must expand the film as much as they can and in doing so they kill everything good that it does have going. The main reason to watch this film is for the performance by Davis who really shines in both parts of her character. I found her incredibly touching as the homeless woman and this is especially true during her scene in the hotel where she's trying to get a letter that her daughter wrote her. Davis also does a very good job in the rich style and this includes when she first pops out of the bedroom to display her new self. That walk and facial gesture she gives is priceless. Hope Lange, Peter Falk and Ann-Margret, in her first film, all turn in nice supporting performances. The weakest link is Ford, believe it or not. He's a great actor but this role just wasn't right for him. A lot of this is due to the screenplay, which makes him too much of a jerk but even Ford appears to be sleepwalking through a lot of the wondering scenes. Capra's direction is decent throughout and he still knows how to hit the heart but the comedy is lacking and there's certainly no reason for the extended running time. Even though there's some nice stuff here, in the end you can't help but look at this as a disappointment considering Capra, Davis and Ford are doing the work.

Looked at in that way, I thought Goodfellas was the superior movie - actually, not even close. Where some of the characters in The Godfather (especially Brando's Don Corleone) had an almost cartoonish aura around them, everyone in this movie seemed very real. There were no cartoonish elements to this, and no one in this movie was ever fated to be a caricature, in the way Brando as Corleone was. This was a down to earth, realistic story about life in the mob, shown mostly through the eyes of Henry (Ray Liotta), who, as an Irish Italian kid, glamorizes gangsters and gets involved with them as a kid, and then lives his life among them. Liotta was very good, as were all the main actors is this - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco all did well with their respective parts, and you come away from this movie thinking that you have a feel for what it's like to live this life. As the movie comes to an end, and Henry becomes a snitch, testifying against some of his former buddies, you also get a dose of reality. These guys don't go to the cops out of any real change of heart or because they're suddenly stricken by a guilty conscience and decide to go straight. Henry suddenly realized he was in danger, and the only way to protect himself and his family was to testify. In the voice-over narration the point is well made that, even as he's testifying against these guys, he still envies them their lifestyle and enjoyed sharing it for a good number of years, and going straight is the price he has to pay for safety.Certainly, a better move than The Godfather. In all honesty, I think they're both over-rated on this site as the 2nd-best (Godfather) and 15-th best (Goodfellas) movies of all time at the time of writing.

The two men get work on a ranch where they dream of owning their own land but fate always has a way of finding Lennie. Even though this film has the reputation of being a classic, I can't help but wonder why it isn't talked about more when it comes to some of the all time great movies.

That childlike quality that Chaney brings to the role is unforgettable and the sympathy he gains is unmatched. The film shows what a great actor Chaney could be if given the right parts. It's a shame he didn't get to do more dramatic roles in his career. Meredith, a fine character actor, is another one who never got enough credit in his career.

Of course you can predict just about everything that happens but it's so well written and the cast good enough that it should entertain most people.Grant is a grizzled, irritable, hard-drinking loner in New Guinea at the start of World War II and is finessed by the local Navy Commander, Trevor Howard, into manning a coast watcher station on an isolated island. Howard and his crew have buried bottles of whiskey around the thatch-roofed hut and arranged for the location of one bottle to be revealed with each confirmed sighting of Japanese aircraft or ships.Before long, circumstances force Grant to accommodate Caron and her diverse little charges -- two French, one Australian, and the rest British. There follow innumerable conflicts, small and large, as the unshaven, slovenly Grant is forced to sleep on his boat and does his best to avoid the kids, grumbling at their disruption of his unique life style and Weltanschaung.Largely because of Grant's superb comic timing and his expressive features and body language, the encounters are far more often funny than silly. Nor are they over-written. Example While the others are out somewhere, Grant sneaks back into the hut to search for the whiskey that Caron has hidden from him -- again. One child has been left behind and she stares at him silently as he rummages through the junk. Balked, frustrated, he glances sideways at her, there is a lengthy pause, then he speaks Beat it. Example two Believing Caron to have been fatally bitten by a venomous snake, Grant cuts the wound and sucks on it, then gets her drunk to make her death easier. Caron What did it taste like -- my blood. Grant How would I know? I'm not a vampire. Caron Was it salty? Grant is nonplussed Well, a LITTLE salty. Caron OHH, was it TOO salty? Grant (at his wit's end) No -- it was JUST RIGHT. Caron sobs a little and says No, I know it was too salty. On the screen, with Cary Grant at his best and Caron doing a fine job, it's not nearly as ridiculous as it sounds. Grant delivers exactly the right measure of chagrin.It's not an important film, not enough to go on about, but it's largely effective and should keep the kids laughing as well as the adults. The alcohol abuse we see is genteel. Grant swigs it straight out of the bottle but it's good Black & White scotch and he's never drunk. He is naturally reformed at the end. He even drinks a non-alcoholic beverage at dinner. Coconut milk. Mmmm. Young coconuts must love it.

He wasn't even the first to be considered for the role, in fact, he had to fight for the role and received very little pay for it. The story begins with Renfield(Dwight Frye) going to see Dracula after he purchased a home in England, but Transylvanian villager warn him about Dracula and he does not listen to the people of Transylvania, and becomes a servant of Dracula. They then sail for England and Dracula kills the entire crew of the ship and Renfield is taken to a mental home. Dracula then attends a show, in which the head of the mental ward, Dr. Seward(Herbert Bunston) attends where he takes a family friend, Lucy(Frances Dande), his daughter Mina(Helen Chandler) and her fiancé John Harker(David Manners). Dracula kills Lucy in her sleep and making her a fowl creature of the night like himself, and then makes numerous attempts to lure Mina into his control. Along the way, Dr. Van Helsing(Edward Van Sloan) discovers Dracula is a vampire even though the other characters do not believe him. The highlights of this movie are Dracula, Renfield, and Van Helsing. Lugosi plays a very hypnotic seductive Dracula. Frye plays a man who is striving for his own sanity, and Van Sloan plays a wise, Van Helsing. The ending is not the best, but to be honest, this film makes up for that. Dracula has many scenes that have complete silence, and they work beautifully, but were also used because directors like Tod Browning, were afraid to deal with dialog and Dracula was the first talking supernatural-thriller.

It is very hard to explain and justify the value of such piece of art as Yojimbo.

I have to emphasize that best of them are not even close to Yojimbo. Not even close considering anything, so I will just sadly disregard dumb comments posted as Kurosawa Vs Sergio Leone. Is there anyone of you that can say Mozart Vs Moricone? Is that comparable? Well, I let that judgment to your gray cells responsible for art value and taste. Toshiro Mifune had represented the whole new movie culture until that time, the film idea of one man against the whole world. Yojimbo is someone who serves that idea originally and never seen until then - in traditional Japanese way. His later decent, Bruce Lee is putting that idea practically in the modern form English language, western manners and western money. This is why I like to call Toshiro Mifune the spiritual father of modern action film, while Bruce Lee is a hero who was a practical establisher. Kurosawa is without doubt the greatest master of action movies of all times. His sense for dramatic directing, smart camera, short and dynamic dialogs and far best usage of music in action films makes him the grandmaster of its kind. He is manipulating with deepest human emotions of the spectator and by that Yojimbo is far from just action movie which makes it number one.

It is a case study of a perfectly delusional but perfectly charming middle-aged man who despite those around him believing him insane, ends up making them drive themselves crazy.Based on Mary Chase's Pulitzer-winning play (Chase also had a hand in the screenplay), Harvey tells the story of Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart), who as mentioned appears to have an imaginary friend rabbit who accompanies him to the bars where he meets people and invites them to have drinks at his house sometime. He appears to have no job and his older sister Veta (Josephine Hull) is embarrassed by his behavior, enough to the point where she finally takes him to a mental hospital to be committed, where farce-like humor ensues.Stewart, who has always fallen nicely into roles involving naive people passionately committed to something, is an ideal choice for Elwood. He gives the role a dreamy quality few of the other great actors of the '40s and '50s could have. Elwood is warm, kind-hearted, complimentary and other than drinking a lot and talking to an imaginary rabbit, seems devoid of any other vices or character flaws.As the doctors and nurses at the mental hospital get involved, we learn more about Elwood. The film is like a psychological case study in which we become so focused wanting to know what is triggering his delusion that we miss the point. That is until Chase's wonderful script makes sense of it toward the end.The film has the vibe of a very straight play adaptation. My guess would be that little of script changed; there's a lot of expository dialogue in the beginning. There's also not a whole lot of interesting visual storytelling. About the best thing director Henry Koster does other than not actually show Harvey is include where Harvey 'is' in the frame of his shot, which as I read was suggested by Stewart.

It is a case study of a perfectly delusional but perfectly charming middle-aged man who despite those around him believing him insane, ends up making them drive themselves crazy.Based on Mary Chase's Pulitzer-winning play (Chase also had a hand in the screenplay), Harvey tells the story of Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart), who as mentioned appears to have an imaginary friend rabbit who accompanies him to the bars where he meets people and invites them to have drinks at his house sometime. He appears to have no job and his older sister Veta (Josephine Hull) is embarrassed by his behavior, enough to the point where she finally takes him to a mental hospital to be committed, where farce-like humor ensues.Stewart, who has always fallen nicely into roles involving naive people passionately committed to something, is an ideal choice for Elwood. He gives the role a dreamy quality few of the other great actors of the '40s and '50s could have. Elwood is warm, kind-hearted, complimentary and other than drinking a lot and talking to an imaginary rabbit, seems devoid of any other vices or character flaws.As the doctors and nurses at the mental hospital get involved, we learn more about Elwood. The film is like a psychological case study in which we become so focused wanting to know what is triggering his delusion that we miss the point. That is until Chase's wonderful script makes sense of it toward the end.The film has the vibe of a very straight play adaptation. My guess would be that little of script changed; there's a lot of expository dialogue in the beginning. There's also not a whole lot of interesting visual storytelling. About the best thing director Henry Koster does other than not actually show Harvey is include where Harvey 'is' in the frame of his shot, which as I read was suggested by Stewart.

It was not yet the big professional football championships and their violence in Liverpool or Manchester, but it was just the same thing violence, sex, drugs, alcohol and music.

The main character is Olivia Lawrence, a young heiress who has been left tremendously wealthy by the recent death of her mother. (Olivia's father has died several years earlier). Olivia forms a relationship with Tim Whalen, a yacht skipper, but this causes friction with her stepfather Tony Gateworth, who suspects that Tim is only interested in Olivia for her wealth. There may be something in his suspicions, as Tim is also carrying on with attractive older woman Brooke, his employer's wife. Gateworth's objections to Tim, however, seem hypocritical, as it is obvious that he only married Olivia's mother for her money and has lost no time since her death in moving his new mistress, Anne, into the family mansion.The title is significant. Masquerade is the name of Olivia's yacht, but the word masquerade, literally a masked ball, can also signify a charade or pretence, and several of the characters are pretending to be something they are not, pretences which are revealed in a series of twists. Tim and Gateworth seem to hate one another, but it is suddenly revealed that they are plotting together to murder Olivia for her money. During a confrontation between Gateworth, Tim and Olivia, however, Gateworth is killed when his pistol goes off during a struggle with Tim. Officer McGill, a local cop and former boyfriend of Olivia, is put in charge of the investigation into Gateworth's death.There are no really outstanding acting performances in this film, but Meg Tilly makes a convincingly innocent Olivia, even though at 28 she was several years older than her character. Rob Lowe does enough to show that he was more than just a Brat Pack pretty-boy, even though he shows enough flesh to keep his most ardent female fans happy. (Tim is supposed to be older than Olivia, but in reality Lowe was four years younger than Tilly). There are certain similarities between this film and Wild Things, a thriller from 1998, which also has a plot involving yachting and differences in social class. (That film, however, was set in Florida rather than Long Island). Masquerade, however, is by far the better of the two films, and part of the reason, I think, lies in the way in which the thriller genre developed over the intervening ten years. Although the plot of Masquerade contains several twists (there are a couple more after those mentioned above), it always remains perfectly comprehensible. By 1998, however, there was a tendency (one which has continued into the twenty-first century) for the scriptwriters of films like these to demonstrate their cleverness by devising excessively complicated plots; that of Wild Things contains so many twists that it ends up twisted out of all recognition, and almost totally incomprehensible to the average viewer, even with the assistance of a series of flashbacks interspersed with the closing credits and intended to make good all the numerous plot holes in the actual movie. Pauline Kael described Masquerade as a tranquil and sophisticated thriller. Tranquil may seem an odd choice of adjective to describe a thriller, especially one in which several characters meet violent deaths, yet I know what she meant. Masquerade lacks not only the silly-cleverness that mars films like Wild Things, it also lacks the cynical amorality that is their stock-in-trade. Towards the end I was waiting for some truly devastating silly-clever twist, like Olivia 's mother and Gateworth both coming back from the dead, or Olivia turning out to have planned the whole thing with her lesbian lover Brooke. Yet nothing like this happens. The twist is that there is no twist. There is no assumption that an obviously innocent person must be guilty; Olivia turns out to be just as sweet and naïve as she has always seemed. Moreover, Tim, whatever his original motives may have been, turns out to have genuinely fallen in love with her and selflessly sacrifices his own life while saving hers. It comes as quite a surprise to come across a thriller that does not take a completely cynical view of human nature. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 August 2009","score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Masquerade is a crime thriller set among the wealthy inhabitants of the Hamptons, a socially exclusive part of Long Island.
