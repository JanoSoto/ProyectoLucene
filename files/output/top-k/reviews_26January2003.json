A totally childish and idiotic plot can not become a good movie with the best actors on this world. But just think what you can get if you have this plot and a bunch of pathetic actors! Oh my...

Even the tumultuous production of the record-budgeted Waterworld resulted in a positive balance-sheet for the studio, so why not keep a good thing going? And this leads us to The Postman.Playing to the leading man\/director's strengths, the film releases its hero into a vast wilderness, doomed to wander until he finds a purpose. In Dances With Wolves, it was an adopted people and identity. Here it is a messianic mission, to unite remote communities through written mail against a tyrannical oppressor. Whereas Wolves was a perfect storm of harmonious parts, Postman is handicapped from the start by a number of fatal flaws.The first flaw is conceptual given the earnest tone Costner goes for, the choice of a Postman as a messianic figure could not have struck a worse cord with audiences around the world, where hardly any culture views mailmen as the epitome of courage, competence or decency. It might be unfair, but it results in a huge negative bias against the protagonist and the film from the get-go.The second flaw is the result of an artist misunderstanding his own strengths. At around 4 hours, Dances With Wolves was a huge success, commercially and critically. But rather than create a compelling story and allowing it to play out at the required pace, Costner turns that logic on its head, seemingly intent on crafting a 3 hour opus and then worrying about content. This makes it come across as a much longer, slower experience than his earlier film. These two main flaws would still allow the Postman to become an interesting misfire, even one with fine touches, but the end product is an embarrassment beyond measure.The screenplay, bafflingly written by Brian LA Confidential Helgeland and frequent Michael Mann collaborator Eric Roth, is a complete disgrace, a pileup of predictable, derivative set-pieces and cringe-worthy dialogue, the crown jewel among stiff competition being You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket. Say what you want about the Razzie Awards, this kind of thing is the reason they exist in the first place, and so they logically awarded it a trophy for worst script (one many the film justly earned).The performances are bland almost by design, as if Costner resented Dennis Hopper for stealing Waterworld from under his feet. No chance of the spotlight getting stolen this time around, with even capable veterans hung out to dry, and villain duties passed on to a very forgettable Will Patton. These are all lethal handicaps for a supposed epic.Having ensured that the film's grandeur would not stem from the human element, Costner also fails in conjuring any visual poetry not only is the cinematography as bland as the characters, a feat in itself for a film of this scale, but the action is poorly staged and even more badly edited. Even the great James Newton Howard, able to find poetry in the worst flop even on a bad day, fails to deliver a merely serviceable score. It says a lot about your prospects as a director when you just bring out the worst in everyone, an ability Costner transcends in the worst way imaginable by taking part in the dreadful closing song.The Postman was the worst film of the year despite hard competition from the likes of Batman and Robin, Speed 2 and Anaconda, all eclipsed by the epic arrogance of this particular dud. Even the worst sort of patriotism managed to save its performance on US soil, and that's saying something, and though Costner learned a lesson or two as evidenced by the admirable Open Range, his own career never truly recovered.As bad a film as you can come across outside the limits of IMDb's Bottom 100, where in truth it all to much belongs.

The first (and biggest) problem with this movie is the screenplay.  It might as well have been written by a nineteen year-old gangster film buff.  It reads like it was written by someone who learned everything they know about the mafia through watching movies...and doing a poor job at even THAT.  The family business and Sullivan's relationship with the Paul Newman character is only assessed in a brief spatter of dialogue in which Hanks explains the family business to his son. One of the principle characters, Al Capone, (whose iron will results in the murder of the only female star in the film less than twenty minutes into the first act and Sullivan's youngest, forcing him and his oldest son to go on the run) is never even seen!  Instead we see one of his underlings played an extremely miscast and unusually subpar Stanley Tucci, in what could have been a bit part.  The subplot of the hitman searching for Sullivan feels so tacked on, it's almost as if the producers included the Jude Law character in a last ditch effort to ensure that at least  ONE teenage girl would go to see the masculine dominated piece of shite.  This is in no way a gangster movie like The Godfather (to which it has been compared by a small collected of narrow minded imbeciles who probably can't even tell me which movie leave the gun, take the canoli comes from) nor is it in any way a family movie.  The Godfather defined two genres.  The gangster film and the family film.  If films were people Road to Perdition isn't worthy enough to kiss the Godfather's ass.  There are two female characters in the entire movie sic (both of which could have been bit parts) so how the hell could this be considered a family movie.  I can't believe feminists haven't taken an interest in what could be considered a male chauvanist movie solely because there are no female character for the entire 2nd act, and the better part of the 1st and 3rd.  This is a shrewd, pointless, cliched story about fathers and their sons and bringin' home the bacon and as if the ONE scene in which we see Sullivan do his dirty work wasn't irritating enough, there's a tacked on voice over of a grown Michael sullivan Jr. talking about how after the day his father died he never picked up a gun again.  There's nothing this film has accomplished that even the worst life in the hood movies have.  The visual structure is a different story alltogether.

Following a curse provoked by a witch, Godefroy de Montmirail (Jean Reno) is induced to kill the father of his beloved. By trying to come back into the past, he and his horseman are landing in the twentieth century. They discover this new world, its curiosities ans especially their descendants... You can guess it, our visitors feel anxiety, astonishment and curiosity on this world of the twentieth century. In this way, the movie's screenplay appears like thin, a bit predictable and sometimes clumsy it's obvious that Reno and Clavier are going to launch disasters, not only on the objects but also on several people the police, Jacquart etc... But in parallel, some elements of the plot make the screenplay agile Valérie Lemercier doesn't know until the end that her cousin Hubert is actually a time traveler. The tandem Reno-Clavier works rather well, besides Clavier is the essential comical character. Above all, he's the one who makes the spectator laugh and without him, the movie wouldn't have been so funny. Another excellent actor Christian Bujeau, irresistible in his role of exasperated and angry man. By contrast, Valérie Lemercier is more quiet and discreet. It's even a double contrast because she's Reno's descendant and she's all the contrary of her ancestor... The sequences by Lemercier's house are the funniest of the movie but this one loses a little of its appeal in the second part which takes place in Jacquart's castle. At this moment, the movie especially focuses on Reno and Lemercier's efforts to find a way to come back into the past and neglects the comical side in spite of good comical sequences. Nevertheless, as we said you mustn't deny yourself a good thing. So the visitors remains a good funny movie.

Unlike Major League or Unnecessary Roughness both of which I like, it isn't about a bunch of misfits who stink but then find the will and way to win. Slapshot is about a bunch of guys who have the talent to win but can't, but eventually find the way. In the first game, we see that Ned Braden is the league's leading scorer. A few guys speak little English, which would add to their troubles. The team had some hope. Yes, it wasn't until the Hansens showed up that the team started to win, but the Hansens brought in a whole new aspect to the movie to play fairly and lose, or to play the dirtiest hockey ever and win the whole thing? Another thing that makes it great is that its not a pro team, instead its a minor league in some part of America, we don't know where. Another great thing about Slapshot is that the only person you've ever heard of or seen before or after is Paul Newman, who isn't even the most popular character! Slap Shot is without a doubt, the greatest hockey movie ever made. If profanity and violence are your thing, that this is your movie! If you are a major hockey buff, this is your film! If you like to laugh, this is your moving picture!  It seems like massive beatings are handed out by the second! Enough blood to fill a small swimming pool... not to mention enough profanity to last for the rest of your life... but hey, that's hockey! Any hockey fan will tell you that this movie is the best in the genre, so why should I tell you different?  Also Slap Shot takes the time to investigate an array of pro sports themes sadistic player violence; boorish sexuality; fan behavior; fan loyalty to athletes and vice-versa (or total absence thereof); the bloodless, detached world of athletic club ownership. But the film is better than the snide satire it has been portrayed to be, and in its own manic way, it conveys much of the joy of sports.  That was what made some of the films of the 70's great. They weren't the predictable fare we see today. Big stars weren't above making character movies or just having some plain old, goofy fun. What other decade gave you Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now and Superman?   Slap Shot is a movie that is more than the foul language or the violence. It's about a hockey team's last ditch effort to save itself. Reggie Dunlop may con and manipulate his way to the championship, but that's what is great about his character and this movie, and that is the psychology within. There's something in all of us that is like Dunlop and his players...we're all underdogs, we fight for what we believe in and may even be a little underhanded to get to where we need to get. More important, Dunlop has something to prove...that he can be a winner, and he can be successful. It's what he wants for himself, and for his players. Also the characters and the subplots still have me laughing out loud Dunlop putting a bounty on a competing player's head, the rug-wearing radio announcer (wonderfully played by Andrew Duncan), the French Canadian goaltender (Yvon Barrette) , the underhanded general manager (the late, great Strother Martin), the unexpected striptease by the Chiefs leading scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) which catches many players, who were beating each other on the ice, totally off guard. I love the line by Ogle Oglethorpe (Ned Dowd, Nancy's brother) after beating up a Chief player and then seeing Braden taking his uniform off This is disgusting.... How about that for irony!  The only thing that could improve this movie is for their to be more Hansons arrive and to see them do funny things like beat people up in creative ways   Paul Newman sees the Boys playing with their slot cars and comments that they brought their TOYS with them! on the road trip. This is funny and should have been explored more, but it isn't. As a matter of fact, the Hanson's and their background are not explored at all, and they have a small amount of total screen time. This is too bad because they are the best part of the movie. . But if you are like me and want to see cool hockey footage of guys playing without helmets, wacky stuff happening at the rink, the Hanson brothers doing their thing, etc. , there just isn't enough of it there. If this movie was made today, there would be less social commentary, less human interest, more Hansons, and more hockey. And, sadly, it would probably be a better movie because of it.

Just make sure you have a tissue ready because it is a tear jerker. It never lowers itself to petty sentimentality though. The Whole Wide World will touch you via pure emotional story telling - kudos to the writer who adapted Price's novel.It's criminal that the DVD and video are not available in the United States! Various cable channels are playing it regularly, and the DVD is available in Canada. Try to catch it if you can!

In an era of the Rules of Attraction and A Guy Thing it is hard for me to even watch teen movies. But this was a teen movie from a completely different era.  This teen movie talks about many different facets of life in an excellent way.  Seeing this movie I was a bit skeptical, but this is definitely a world-class movie.The plot is relatively simple.  Five children are kept on a Saturday after all of them do something wrong at their high school.  The Principal, played excellently by Paul Gleason is not very nice to them.  He watches over them on Saturday and makes sure they do nothing wrong.  The students are excellently done themselves.  Judd Nelson plays the really bad guy, a punk type very close to dropping out of school.  Ally Sheedy is a very unusual and extremely quiet girl.  Molly Ringwald is the popular girl, Emilio Estevez is the athlete, and Anthony Michael Hall is the smart kid.These four people come together for an unusual Saturday afternoon and they learn so much about themselves, where they are going and where they have been.  I liked this movie I liked it a lot.  Watching it ten years later going into the theater (I saw it in my college theater) I was wandering why it was so many people said such good things about this.  With teen movies the way they are today I try to avoid them.  But this was actually very good.The movie has funny moments, poignant moments, sad moments and very intense moments.  We learn about the intense relationship these people have with themselves, their family and their school, or even if they have a relationship with their school.  I liked this movie because it pegged my sentiments about high school.  I suffered through it and didn't like it, and it appears the people here were saying exactly what I said.I was not an athlete but the character I most identified with was Emilio Estevez.  I was not an athlete in high school but I know what it is like to have to live up to someone else's standards.  Granted I never did what he did in the film but I did put up with a lot at home and at school as to what I was supposed to be.  Not to say others didn't do great they all did equally well, he just stuck out to me.  Paul Gleason is dead on as the prick principal.  I dealt with too many people like them in school, they think they are such bad a#$es but in the end they are not that smart.Director Chris Columbus set this one outside of Chicago, where most of his movies are set.  It's an interesting touch.  The quote by David Bowie at the beginning is very well put.  This movie is many things, it is a comment on the way that society looks at children it is a comment on the falling society around it the movie is a comment on a big generation gap that exists today.  The movie has lost little of it's meaning today, it could be made today, the only things that might be dated are the Barry Manilow jokes. This is a very well done, well-acted look into Ronald Reagan's America as some of us may or may not remember it.  Looking at the deterioration condition of the school they were in I saw something similar to mine.  This movie defied my expectations and turned out to be really good.  What is sad is that none of these people are famous today.  It's too bad, they were very talented, especially Ally Sheedy, who I used to have a crush on.

THIS takes the cake for the worst movie of all time. I can't believe I even paid any money for it! I actually thought that this wouldn't be as bad as everyone says, and it did have a really cool trailer. Instead it ended up being worse than I expected. It carries the basic elements of a good movie (action, romance, etc.) and under uses them. Okay, so those elements don't always make a good movie. But they could have been excellent sub-plots in this film, as they appeared to be at first. I can't even believe this is called a movie. It's more like a bunch of big actors overplaying their parts and spewing unflattering and stupid dialogue during a bunch of dumb scenes. Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, and of course, John Travolta all shame themselves in this mess. They are very good actors and I respect a lot of the choices they have made throughout their careers. But their performances in this smell worse than rabbit feces. There is a plot to speak of that's easy to describe, but it's so dumb I don't really want to put any effort into deciphering it. Oh well, here it goes.It is the year 3000, and man is now an endangered species. They are scattered in groups all over, hiding from the Psychlos, an alien species that has ruled earth for the last 1000 years. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) sets out to find a beast that was described in a cave tale and is captured by the Psychlos. He then encourages all of the other captured humans to revolt against the Psychlos. The plot gets dumber and more complex, mainly because it lost my attention after about an hour and thirty minutes. What's to say? Well, actually there's a lot to say. First off, you'll know the film is going to be bad as soon as it starts with incredibly sucky scene transitions, and it continues for the rest of the film. First Tyler learns about his parents' deaths, which cuts to a second long shot of him at their graves, and is instantly followed by the cave scene. The connection between these (and just about all of the other) scenes was really choppy, and the opening doors effect just didn't cut it. To add to the ridiculously giant plot holes, only about seven of the characters are properly introduced. Sheesh! I hope that whoever edited this never works in the movie industry again. Oh, and did I mention that John Travolta sounds more like a kid in a candy store than a villain? I would also have to agree with just about everyone else on the statement that he looks like a moron. Now jump to when Jonnie is captured by the Psychlos, which is followed by scene after scene after scene of him running away, and each one ends with him getting shot by guns that look like Nerf pistols. And the guns don't even kill him! Wouldn't the Psychlos consider using a more lethal weapon after the first two or three chases? Guess not. The rest of the scenes mainly just show Terl and Ker having discussions with either each other or some guy who has a neck bigger than earth itself and Barry Pepper and his nameless friends easily finding out how to save earth. Gee, if I were a Psychlo, I think I would believe it would make perfectly good sense to not let my enemies have access to potentially vital information, even with the biggest guarantee that there would be nothing that could help them. There's also the incredibly lame Psychlo language session, the freaky chick with the huge head and long tongue, and the cavemen instantly learning how to fly fighter jets. Sure they've had to hide in caves for hundreds of years, but to have them marvel at being able to pronounce warning is just plain dumb. And how many times did they say piece of cake? I wonder if it outnumbers the number of scenes showing Jonnie getting captured and worthlessly beating up somebody. As much as I love action and big battles, the jet fight wasn't really thrilling, nor was the gun duel. They were just plain bad, but the fact that the movie has most likely bored you to tears by then isn't much of a benefit itself.Another bad thing in this film is that there are parts that will remind you of better movies. Pepper's hair and the guy who looks like Aragorn are likely to make you think about Lord Of The Rings, the detonator removal scene is reminiscent of The Spy Who Loved Me, and the Fort Knox scenes will trigger thoughts of Goldfinger. All three are movies I should have been watching instead of this. But to ease the suffering, my sister and I did spend about 60 minutes making fun of it, and I recommend that you come up with your own plan to pass the time if you plan on watching it as well. The only positive factor I can arouse when referring to this movie is that it would make a fantastic episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But since that was canceled before this was made, there are no existing aspects of the film that are half enjoyable.By now you should get the picture. This film sucks big time. It's so bad that when I got up to get some orange juice in the kitchen, I could feel my brain rotting. It also fueled a nostalgia for Plan 9. Really, it did! Roger Christian ought to be ashamed of himself for making this. Amazing how a guy who worked on something like The Phantom Menace could be responsible for something this bad.

I actually thought that this wouldn't be as bad as everyone says, and it did have a really cool trailer. Instead it ended up being worse than I expected. It carries the basic elements of a good movie (action, romance, etc.) and under uses them. Okay, so those elements don't always make a good movie. But they could have been excellent sub-plots in this film, as they appeared to be at first. I can't even believe this is called a movie. It's more like a bunch of big actors overplaying their parts and spewing unflattering and stupid dialogue during a bunch of dumb scenes. Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, and of course, John Travolta all shame themselves in this mess. They are very good actors and I respect a lot of the choices they have made throughout their careers. But their performances in this smell worse than rabbit feces. There is a plot to speak of that's easy to describe, but it's so dumb I don't really want to put any effort into deciphering it. Oh well, here it goes.It is the year 3000, and man is now an endangered species. They are scattered in groups all over, hiding from the Psychlos, an alien species that has ruled earth for the last 1000 years. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) sets out to find a beast that was described in a cave tale and is captured by the Psychlos. He then encourages all of the other captured humans to revolt against the Psychlos. The plot gets dumber and more complex, mainly because it lost my attention after about an hour and thirty minutes. What's to say? Well, actually there's a lot to say. First off, you'll know the film is going to be bad as soon as it starts with incredibly sucky scene transitions, and it continues for the rest of the film. First Tyler learns about his parents' deaths, which cuts to a second long shot of him at their graves, and is instantly followed by the cave scene. The connection between these (and just about all of the other) scenes was really choppy, and the opening doors effect just didn't cut it. To add to the ridiculously giant plot holes, only about seven of the characters are properly introduced. Sheesh! I hope that whoever edited this never works in the movie industry again. Oh, and did I mention that John Travolta sounds more like a kid in a candy store than a villain? I would also have to agree with just about everyone else on the statement that he looks like a moron. Now jump to when Jonnie is captured by the Psychlos, which is followed by scene after scene after scene of him running away, and each one ends with him getting shot by guns that look like Nerf pistols. And the guns don't even kill him! Wouldn't the Psychlos consider using a more lethal weapon after the first two or three chases? Guess not. The rest of the scenes mainly just show Terl and Ker having discussions with either each other or some guy who has a neck bigger than earth itself and Barry Pepper and his nameless friends easily finding out how to save earth. Gee, if I were a Psychlo, I think I would believe it would make perfectly good sense to not let my enemies have access to potentially vital information, even with the biggest guarantee that there would be nothing that could help them. There's also the incredibly lame Psychlo language session, the freaky chick with the huge head and long tongue, and the cavemen instantly learning how to fly fighter jets. Sure they've had to hide in caves for hundreds of years, but to have them marvel at being able to pronounce warning is just plain dumb. And how many times did they say piece of cake? I wonder if it outnumbers the number of scenes showing Jonnie getting captured and worthlessly beating up somebody. As much as I love action and big battles, the jet fight wasn't really thrilling, nor was the gun duel. They were just plain bad, but the fact that the movie has most likely bored you to tears by then isn't much of a benefit itself.Another bad thing in this film is that there are parts that will remind you of better movies. Pepper's hair and the guy who looks like Aragorn are likely to make you think about Lord Of The Rings, the detonator removal scene is reminiscent of The Spy Who Loved Me, and the Fort Knox scenes will trigger thoughts of Goldfinger. All three are movies I should have been watching instead of this. But to ease the suffering, my sister and I did spend about 60 minutes making fun of it, and I recommend that you come up with your own plan to pass the time if you plan on watching it as well. The only positive factor I can arouse when referring to this movie is that it would make a fantastic episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But since that was canceled before this was made, there are no existing aspects of the film that are half enjoyable.By now you should get the picture. This film sucks big time. It's so bad that when I got up to get some orange juice in the kitchen, I could feel my brain rotting. It also fueled a nostalgia for Plan 9. Really, it did! Roger Christian ought to be ashamed of himself for making this. Amazing how a guy who worked on something like The Phantom Menace could be responsible for something this bad. So in short, cavemen can fly jets, Psychlos look like the Coneheads, learning a new language can be done by zapping it into your eyes, and Pepper has hairstyles that make him look like a girl.

I watched One Night at McCool's yesterday, and all I can say is, Wow.Here I go.  MAJOR SPOILERS.Would you like a summary of the plot, just to see how stupid and pointless this movie is?  I would never tell anybody to watch it, unless I was out to inflict pain upon them.  Anyway, here's a glimpse (or a huge chunk) of the plot.Randy works for a bar, McCool's.  He meets up with this woman named Jewel who convinces him to, surprisingly, have sex with him.  Her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to rob them and gets killed.  Randy and his cousin and the detective at the scene of the crime all fall for Jewel.  She, being the mascot of stupidity, uses every one of these guys to get what she wants, involving a DVD player.  Randy hires a hit man to kill her, and eventually the detective is killed by the ex-boyfriend's psycho brother and the hit man and Jewel take off.Seriously.  That's it.  I left hardly anything out, except for a few more sex scenes and a nearly-pornographic scene of Liv Tyler as Jewel using a hose to flaunt her sexuality.What was the point of this movie?  To be honest, I think it was so that the producers and directors could show off their male urges.  Which I think is absolutely uncalled for and just plain stupid.  When I watch a movie, I want a plot.  I want characters.  I don't care about sexy woman flaunting anything they might have.  Something should happen in a movie, for goodness' sake.  This is as bad as Fight Club.It gets even worse.  John Goodman is the detective devoted to the higher being.  I myself wondered why Goodman would play in something so outrageously pitiful as this, but then I remembered that he was in O Brother, Where Art Thou? as well.  His reputation just went down a notch.Liv Tyler was an amazing actress in the Lord of the Rings series.  In this movie she is nothing more than an unintelligent slut who wants nothing but her way.  Her reputation has gone down seven or eight notches, to me.I am amazed, simply AMAZED that people would work so hard to make something so stupid.  The music is absolutely crappy (having YMCA play while John Goodman's character is being killed doesn't really fit), the characters are totally unlikeable, the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man, and to top it off, it doesn't even fit into any genre.  The closest it gets to is pornographic comedy.  If it was even supposed to be funny. Which it wasn't.I think I'm done ranting now.  But let me just assure you that nobody in their right mind would ever, ever want to see this movie.  Unless they lust for Liv Tyler as much as the characters do, that is.

Most of us know this wonderful tale of male bonding and intrigue from the many translations of this series and, for those who don't like to read, from the many films which have appeared.  The role of D'Artagnan, the young farmer's boy from Gascony, who comes to town to join the King's Musketeers has been brought to the screen by the likes of Douglas Fairbanks, Gene Kelly and Michael York.  This role and story makes for lots of cinematic fun and the lead role is a great one for a scene-chewing ham.  But, with Chris O'Donell, we don't get ham, we get bad baloney.  The truth is, this film, like the gharish DeCaprio sequel which appeared a year or so later, Man in the Iron Mask, is a made-for-high-school-kids, costume teen flick.  That, I guess, is forgivable but this version is a bad one.  Tim Curry, of Rocky Horror fame is a grinning parody of the insidious Richelieu and the supporting fellows of the wannabe musketeer, O'Donnell, Sutherland, Platt and Sheen-- while competent actors in their own rights-- seem to stumble through their roles making the entire film, a caricature of this wonderful classic tale.If you love costume drama and the classic tales of adventure, you'll no doubt be very disappointed with this piece of celluloid manure.  If, on the other hand, you're a teener with a love for loud music, catchy & defiant phrases and pure nonsensical action that has neither historical connection nor relevance to life in general, then you'll likely find this film worthy of the price of a Blockbuster rental.Alas, the bitter truth, with the array of talent such as Curry, Platt, Sheen and Sutherland, this could have been a decent film.  Having seen all of the classic remakes of this film, including all of the offshoots that I could find, I found this mindless, poorly written abuse of a great story to be the worst.
