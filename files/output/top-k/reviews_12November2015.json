This was the problem of answering empirical skepticism which he spent the whole work pursuing. The movie's writing, its philosophical depth, is often lost amidst the excellent action movie surrounding it. Why it works so well is even the first showing you never are sure who is right The Oracle or Morpheus? It plays with you all the way until the end with Neo apparently dying from Smith emptying a whole clip into him. I would like to point out to you the moments I loved as a philosopher. My favorite when Neo sees the Matrix, notice this proceeds his invincibility what an excellent existential metaphor for human existence. Yes, my friends, see the phenomenal matrix about you it is just as unreal. He stares at everything eyes filled with astonishment everything is an illusion. This is what Morpheus had been trying to get him to understand the entire movie. You think that is real air you are breathing? The philosophical power of the movie is why it resonates by the way. This epiphany of seeing the Matrix as the phenomenal construct of his mind has implications that are quite transposable to the 'real world' our minds construct for us.The red or the blue pill? How many people do you know that are like Cypher? They want the blue pill oblivious to it being a world of deceit and illusion, again, what a metaphor for so many people, they prefer a happy lie to an unhappy truth. I love the movie for it conveys the struggle of Neo; we wish it for him as he fights and fails. This is the core of its success in contrast to the sequels. He fails the building jump, the fight with Morpeus and the subway showdown with Agent Smith. When I saw this there was an audible gasp when The Oracle says that Morpheus is mistaken and delusional. Even by this point, the audience is so wrapped up in rooting for Neo to be The One that it showed how well it had grabbed hold of the viewers. You never know until the very end when he resurrects and stands back up. Action movies' fate are predicated upon the strength or weakness of their villains find me a better villain than Agent Smith,Human beings are a disease; we are the cure. He looks upon us as loathsome, bad smelling, meat sacks which he destroys whenever he gets the chance. The battle to be The One, his many failings and our doubts followed by his majestic rise up from the floor, this is why this became a masterpiece. The action is breathtaking with state of the art effects that still are great to see. This can be said for many bad modern films; what differentiates this is the Quest Motif of the Hero Archetype. Within the movie are profound questions of epistemology What is Truth and would you prefer a pleasure filled illusion to a stark, cold and dangerous world of truth? How can I tell what is real from what is illusion? Also, how controllers use pleasureful lies to control their slaves. See if you can find another movie so deeply filled with the central questions of philosophy? Descartes' solution was that he had certain 'clear and distinct' ideas the negation of which was a contradiction. God would never have made his mind oppose itself like this, such as 2 plus 2 equals four, ergo, the phenomenal world must be real. I know, if you desire better answers read Immanuel Kant's Critique Of Pure Reason. This is a stand alone masterpiece with great philosophical depth. Almost twenty years old and it still resonates as well as it did when it was released. I never blame the brothers for the sequels, this film can never be part of a series; it is a one of a kind classic. Enjoy! Q.E.D.For Any Test We Can Devise We Could Also Dream Of Taking.
