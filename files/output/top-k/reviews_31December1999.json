It's the sort of film that everyone really should see, but no-one would blame you if you didn't! The film makes you wonder How on earth did the censor let them get away with that!, yet, in its own way, its a very strong argument against censorship, because the disturbing turns the story takes are what make the film such a unique and realistic portrayal of a very bad part of life.Nicholas Cage plays a private investigator who is called upon to investigate a snuff film, which was found in a safe after a wealthy man's death. The question his widow wants to know is - is the man she adored and to whom she was married for forty-five years really the distinguished gentleman she has always believed him to be, or was he a mentally-disturbed pervert who gets kicks out of watching innocent young girls being killed? And, worse still, did he pay for the girl to be killed on film, for his pleasure, when there were no other snuff films available?In order to find out, the investigator has to get down into the gutter of life, and search through the worst and most perverted porno manufacturing networks he can find. The girl went missing six years ago, and the police haven't got a clue, but there are clues on the film, such as a tattoo on the hand of the masked killer, and a fleeting image of a man in the background watching.So what exactly is so disturbing about this film? In order to explain properly, I'm going to have to write a SPOILER. So please only read on ONLY (a) if you have already seen the film, or (b) if you are completely sure you're not going to see it, or (c) if you want to know exactly why it's disturbing and don't mind knowing what happens in order to find out. OK? Here we go        *******WARNING ******* SPOILER ******* SPOILER *******The Disturbing FeaturesThe film is disturbing largely because the investigator is so shocked by what he discovers that he brutally murders the girl's killers, and gets away with it as well. He literally gets down into the same moral gutter that they are in.Another disturbing feature is that, in order to make himself angry enough to start killing, he cruelly calls the dead girl's mother on the phone, tells her how her daughter was killed, six years ago. When she naturally breaks down into hysterical sobs, crying out No, no, no! I love my little girl! it helps him to start the killing, just as he'd hoped.Another disturbing feature is that he insensitively calls the widow who started the investigation, and blurts out that her husband did indeed commission the film, and paid for the killing, so the elderly widow, unable to cope with the sudden dreadful news, commits suicide.And yet another disturbing event is that right at the end, he receives a letter from the girl's mother, emphasising that he did the right thing, in murdering her child's killers. So basically, this film is saying Forget about the police. They'll do nothing for six years or more. If someone has killed a child, the best thing to do is to take the law into your own hands.Some people on the internet who are concerned with pro-life issues, have been arguing that the message of the film also carries strong implications that those who shoot abortionists may be doing the right thing, the best thing, after all.

The Talented Mr. Ripley, the first effort of Anthony Minghella since The English Patient, is set in the backdrop of gorgeous southern Italy. It tells the tale of a young man, Tom Ripley, who goes to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf, an expatriate son of a wealthy shipping merchant. While in Italy, Tom falls in love with la dolce vita that he is all around him but at the same time so far out of his reach. Brilliant direction and an all star cast truly allow Ripley to shine in what is one of this year's best. The character of Tom Ripley is one of the most complex in recent film history, and Matt Damon delivers a flawless performance. When first meeting Dickie, played by Jude Law, Tom is utterly smitten with the lifestyle that Dickie and his girlfriend Marge, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, live in. Minghella does a terrific job of portraying this fascination that will eventually lead to obsession and even murder. Minghella does not conform to the cookie cutter format of having Tom fall for Marge and simply try to take Dickie's place. Instead, in an ingenious move, Tom's love for Dickie's lifestyle is played off with homosexual undertones. Damon does a great job in admirably taking on a role that could potentially shatter his golden boy image.  Not only does this put an interesting twist on what otherwise could be a great bore, but it also heightens the depth of the character of Marge. Gwyneth Paltrow gives yet another stellar performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley. Her character, Marge, finds herself perplexed by men yet gaining increasing understanding as the film progresses. This allowed for tremendous character development where there would have been room for little. Her entire world revolves around Dickie, so when he disappears she is not simply losing a boyfriend, but her whole world vaporizes. She sees through Tom's lies in her desperation when few others can; yet, her attempts to point him out are ignored. Though the character of Dickie is only in slightly more than the first half of the film, Jude Law is terrific in the role that is sure to thrust him from the Hollywood peripherals and into the industry limelight. Also making a mark with her very small, but still quite amazing role, is Cate Blanchett. An incredible director puts this all star cast to good use. Minghella does great justice to the Patricia Highsmith novel on which The Talented Mr. Ripley is based. He goes further away from the cliched format of a mystery film by letting the bad guy get away-almost. There is a certain insecurity in Tom Ripley, insecurity with who is that drives him to lie and murder. It is a feeling that, deep down, is felt by everyone. Therefore, Minghella, in a way, allows the audience to find themselves rooting for a sociopath. He expresses Tom's pain in a subtle and beautiful manner. When asked by Meredith (Cate Blanchett) if he was with anyone on the boat, he simply replies No, I'm alone, a desperate cry for help that he knows will not be heard. The film ends. Tom Ripley not only gets away with the several crimes he has committed, but also with a handsome amount of money. However, he is left to pay the ultimate price. He had finally found someone to love him for who he actually way, not who he wanted to be. He had finally acquired all he had ever wanted, but in the process created his own personal hell with the web of lies and deceit he had used to get him there. It is the tragedy of the situation that drives him to destroy the only thing he truly loves. It is hard to go wrong with an all star cast that is directed by the talented Mr. Minghella, yet they take it to the next level. Every person does their part in what ends up to be a hauntingly brilliant view of the darker side of the human psyche.

Also making a mark with her very small, but still quite amazing role, is Cate Blanchett. An incredible director puts this all star cast to good use. Minghella does great justice to the Patricia Highsmith novel on which The Talented Mr. Ripley is based. He goes further away from the cliched format of a mystery film by letting the bad guy get away-almost. There is a certain insecurity in Tom Ripley, insecurity with who is that drives him to lie and murder. It is a feeling that, deep down, is felt by everyone. Therefore, Minghella, in a way, allows the audience to find themselves rooting for a sociopath. He expresses Tom's pain in a subtle and beautiful manner. When asked by Meredith (Cate Blanchett) if he was with anyone on the boat, he simply replies No, I'm alone, a desperate cry for help that he knows will not be heard. The film ends. Tom Ripley not only gets away with the several crimes he has committed, but also with a handsome amount of money. However, he is left to pay the ultimate price. He had finally found someone to love him for who he actually way, not who he wanted to be. He had finally acquired all he had ever wanted, but in the process created his own personal hell with the web of lies and deceit he had used to get him there. It is the tragedy of the situation that drives him to destroy the only thing he truly loves. It is hard to go wrong with an all star cast that is directed by the talented Mr. Minghella, yet they take it to the next level. Every person does their part in what ends up to be a hauntingly brilliant view of the darker side of the human psyche.

The beginning wedding sequence, and the ending.  The dialogue is perfect, thanks to an incredible script by Mario Puzo and CoppolaEverything about this film is on target.  Nino Rota's beautiful score is one of the best, with the Love Theme ranking as one of the most famous pieces of film music ever.  The performances are all first rate.  Though Marlon Brando won the award, it is really Al Pacino who is the lead actor, and deserved the best actor Oscar.  James Caan also finds the right note as the aggressive, impulsive Sonny.  The cinematography and art direction are perfect.  And all this comes down to Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction.  There is no way Bob Fosse deserved the Oscar over Coppola.  Is this film better than Citizen Kane?  Tough to say. Both were ground-breaking classics that utilized new technical and narrative techniques.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"31 December 1999","score":"24 out of 24 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is possibly the best character study made in their last ten years. Taken from a biography of Lytton. This tells an emotionally complete tale of Dora Carrington and her love for Lytton. There is great drama here right from the start. Lytton is a homosexual writer who fancys young men. Dora is a painter who does not want to sleep with her friend, because she believes its just for the physical (Which the film later shows to be true). Initially Dora is put off by Lytton (as is the viewer) but later as she says to him, She is burdened by one of the most self abasing loves for him. He also in turn loves her. But as he states they can do nothing about sleeping together. This is the contrast which is kept up throughout the whole film. All of Carringtons lovers physically love her body, and one of them even loves her (in a selfish way). But Lytton and Carrington love each other without sex, and their love is the strongest. As with the best Drama's, the character development never stops the whole way through. Each character is so well drawn and acted (Special credit must go to Emma Thompson and Jonathon Pryce, although the rest of the cast is also good) that you know how they are feeling even when it is not directly said or implemented. there is spoken and unspoken conflict in every scene. The two main characters are already in conflict while being in love. She loves him and he loves her but he is only attracted by men. Great drama manages to have conflict in every scene, and this one does. Great music from Micheal Nyman manages to capture the sentiments of this film especially well. So many more things could be said about the excellent narrative structure and lovely cinematography. But to be safe I will simply keep with my opening line. See Carrington. It does not pander to the audiences or ever become exploitational. It is a rare movie where the climax to the film is so fitting that you really can feel the emotion involved in these final frames. This is a film not to be missed.

Exceptional stuff.I can't imagine anyone I know not liking this movie.  I've shown it to a LOT of people, college students mostly, of all races and religions, with different prides and prejudices, the result, amazingly, always seems to be the same I have some after movie comments here, and I quoteWow! ; That was NICE!; That was SO...GOOD! ;That giant is crucial, dog! ;It was good...yeah...I liked it!,; and Dang man, that joint TIGHT!.  If you actually read this review all the way, that's nice. Now forget everything I bumbled about and go see this movie, that way you can spent less time writing your own review than you did reading mine.

The overblown Brosnan era, all money-spinning set-piece explosions and dumbed-down formula is not for me. The best Bond since Connery is regurgitated by any critic going, yet all I see is a bland, shallow characterisation that trades in his licence to kill for indiscriminately machine-gunning his enemies.Yet whereas the two previous entries in the canon, Goldeneye particularly, treated their audience with no respect whatsoever, TWINE at least tries to shade in some detail around the formula.Watching the film makes you wonder what really goes in on Bond's head. For the millionth time he has a high-speed ski chase, yet this is no stunt man then close-up of Roger Moore in front of a filmed backdrop situation. Okay, well, it IS, but effects have improved so that it is almost believable that Brosnan is leaping all over the place and stopping four very nice flying bobsleighs. Does he think of his parents, killed in the novels during an avalanche? And what of his late wife from On Her Majesty's Secret Service? (The film which gave us The World Is Not Enough as Bond's family motto). Does Bond remember her when she is mentioned in this film, or think of her when he sees Blofield-lookalike Renard?But that was then, and this is very much the now, with a 007 that leaps onto the Millennium Dome with possibly the best title sequence in memory. A herd of Rorsharch ink blot tests fill the screen to a so-so song by Garbage, though sadly there is very little psychology in the film, amateur or otherwise. This pans out into a film that loses its muster ever-so-slightly, but still packs enough involvement to keep the viewer interested.Robbie Coltrane returns with the worst Scotsman-doing-a-foreign-accent since Connery had the lead role. Denise Richards appears as the not-very-good-entredre-and-frankly-quite-ludicrously-named Christmas Jones, who, with her generous figure, cupid's bow lips and pixie nose may not be the most sophisticated Bond girl (or anything approaching a nuclear physicist) but is probably the sexiest. John Cleese makes a cringingly unfunny cameo as Q's successor, and in all honesty, never mind tradition, wouldn't the 007 films be better without these perfunctory and wearily-predictable Q gadget scenes? They no longer even serve a plot specification, as many of Bond's gadgets aren't explained in this section, and are brought into play (including a crass watch that is more Batman than Bond) without explanation or signposting. As a mark of respect to Desmond Llewellyn (who sadly died Dec 19th, 1999) I feel the Q element should end here.But again I must insist this film is slightly better than Dalton's below-par Licence to Kill and easily eclipses Brosnan's earlier efforts. Okay, I'm not too keen on the lacklustre disco soundtrack that passes as incidental, I would've liked to have seen more of David Calder, and maybe we could have done without Renard's silly pun about nuclear family, but in criticising this film I am clutching at straws. What really holds it together is Robert Carlyle, an exceptional actor who breaks the previously-established rule that a good actor (Christophers Lee and Walken, along with Jonathan Pryce) doesn't necessarily make a good Bond villain. Okay, maybe he should have had more screen time, and maybe he should have been tougher (for someone that has no feelings, he sure says ow a lot when clobbered by Bond). But Carlyle's real strength is in upping the ante. In film, as with his brilliant turn as Trainspotting's Begbie, or even television, taking the lead as Hamish McBeth or playing opposite Coltrane in Cracker, his intensity is infectious, causing all around him to try that much harder. An outstanding actor with tremendous presence, particularly considering his height, I would stake Carlyle as the single greatest actor of the 90s and would argue that it is his presence alone that causes this movie to work so well.This higher level of acting even rubs off on the normally flat Brosnan, who gives his best performance by far with a genuinely nasty edge underneath. He's still to get the danger of Connery, be as funny as Moore, or achieve the depth of Dalton, but for once we get the impression of a real person, rather than someone going through the motions. Nice to see Bond doing a little detective work again, too, rather than the glorified action man he's been of late. Credit goes to Judi Dench, who, as an M in the field (not as ridiculous as it sounds), does sterling work and plays off well against the afore-mentioned Carlyle. Hard to believe that in television land she's a light sitcom actress.But what really sets this film out from the rest of 90s Bonds is its story, which, while hardly intellectually taxing, at least gives us enough twists and turns in the plot to ensure that concentration is required at all times.I would rate this as amongst the ten best Bond films, though in truth it still doesn't come close to Connery's legacy or what Dalton COULD have achieved given the right backing. Bond Will Return, and these noisy, flashy, 007-by-numbers movies are raking it in by the bucketload. And that's all that really matters... isn't it?

He sees the world through the camera lens for what it really is.  One of the greatest examples of which is his scathing satire, A Clockwork Orange.  Here, we see a world not too other worldly from our own.  It's riddled with derilict buildings, wicked gangs, and a government that can do nothing to change it all.  The most frightening aspect of the film is the examination and study of the main character, Alex.  He is a vicious, violent criminal who kills, robs, and rapes.  In the rape scene while singing 'Singin' in the Rain', he wears a long, protruding 'Pinnochio' nose, as an example of a man with no conscience.  His parents do nothing to raise him, and he doesn't go to school.  Later, he attacks his own gang members, gleefully slashing the hand of one of them.  Here, all the details of a criminal have been laid out.  Now comes the second half of the film.  Instead of keeping him in prison, he is given a treatment making him sick every time he sees or is exposed to violence, sex, and his true love, Beethoven.  He is cured, or so it is said.  After being released back into the world, those he did harm to now have a chance of retaliation.  After it's all over, the drugs wear off, and he becomes his old self again, revealing he never was cured to begin with.  What makes this film so stunning and so powerful is that it doesn't go over the top or exaggerate.  It merely looks on at the real world, and foreshadows things to come.  It's actually really creepy.  But Kubrick tells the story through the eyes of the criminal, making it somewhat easier to watch, even though we should be terrified and disgusted.  Kubrick's choice of music is superb, so good that I bought the soundtrack and frequently listen to it.  Ultimately, A Clockwork Orange satirizes the world we live in today, and leaves us not only with an anti-violence message, but pops a difficult question upon the audience, which would you rather?

Here, all the details of a criminal have been laid out.  Now comes the second half of the film.  Instead of keeping him in prison, he is given a treatment making him sick every time he sees or is exposed to violence, sex, and his true love, Beethoven.  He is cured, or so it is said.  After being released back into the world, those he did harm to now have a chance of retaliation.  After it's all over, the drugs wear off, and he becomes his old self again, revealing he never was cured to begin with.  What makes this film so stunning and so powerful is that it doesn't go over the top or exaggerate.  It merely looks on at the real world, and foreshadows things to come.  It's actually really creepy.  But Kubrick tells the story through the eyes of the criminal, making it somewhat easier to watch, even though we should be terrified and disgusted.  Kubrick's choice of music is superb, so good that I bought the soundtrack and frequently listen to it.  Ultimately, A Clockwork Orange satirizes the world we live in today, and leaves us not only with an anti-violence message, but pops a difficult question upon the audience, which would you rather?  A criminal, or a 'clockwork orange', a criminal crippled within reflex mechanisms?   ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"}]
