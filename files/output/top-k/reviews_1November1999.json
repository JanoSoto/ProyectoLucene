You can attribute that to the the charm of Perry and Campbell and of course Platt's presence was quite nice as well.

There is just something about him that does it, he has an incredible sense of timing and his delivery is so true and honest that you never really think of him as Oliver Platt, he is the character that he plays, in every movie.Besides the film being funny it is also quite the statement about homosexuality.    But the true strength of the film is Perry and Campbell  both Canadians I might add ).  They are funny, observant and they have some humourous lines about movies that comes into play rather nicely at the end of the film.  The fact that Neve thinks Perry is gay enables us to hear many great observations about dating and relationships from a woman's point of view and I enjoyed that.  I, myself find women to be an enigma and perhaps I will never understand them so I have to rely on movies to give me some of the answers.

I started to think that this film was targeted towards the 15 - 25 year old males out there that are struggling to find themselves in this world, MEN-X if you will. Not that that's a bad sector, who says any other demographic has found themselves, and certainly the social messages that the film is addressing pertain to every one of us.But...If this film is indeed targeting that specific group, young men, then what can be said about how the film portrays their would be female partners? Certainly Helen Bonham Carter's character is just as screwed up as Edward Norton's but we never delve into how she tries to resolve things. She is merely the punching bag for his characters emotional outburts, his lust, his basest desires and tirades. She comes back to him time and again though he treats her with no respect. Is that the best message around? Certainly she states that he is 'the worst thing to ever happen to her' but Nortons character laments the fact that he hadn't gone to watch her die, which of these is the stronger statement and which is the audience lead to sympathize with? The latter of course.Looking back on Fincher's other films, all of which I have loved and count 'Se7en' as one of my all time favorites, I have to say I am a little disturbed about his portrayal of women. Certainly Sigourney Weaver was a strong character but that was a franchise film that was based on Ripley being a strong character. Then we have Gwenyth in 'Se7en'. The sad powerless howsewife whose brutal death leads to the Pitt's main characters ultimate confrontation. In the game the lead female is certainly part of the 'crew' but when we meet her she is playing the role of a waitress. Her character does possess some bravado but she never the less is relegated to a subservient role in the film.Now, I'm certainly not calling Fincher a misogynist, and I'm definitely not trying to create a feminists 'operation mayhem' against this brilliant directors work. I just find it a little distressing that a director as in touch with the psyche of the times as David Fincher is can, in one of the best films of the year, portray a woman with a 1950's sentiment.Again, I loved the direction and art direction of this film. I think David Fincher is one of the most creative directors working today. It's just that in this film, a film that is destined to be viewed as a rallying point for allot of young men, he grossly abused his female character, to the detriment of all of us who truly admire his work.

There actually isn't much of a plot-- we see pretty much the whole thing in the previews. But like the old time Hollywood stories about heros from art, music, science, etc., that I used to enjoy so much on television (I wasn't alive when that kind of movie was still being made), there are little moments of drama and tension throughout the story, and of course the big built-towards climax. I may not be describing it right, but that's how it felt to me-- an old hero movie.Meryl Streep is amazing, as always. For example, I really liked how they had the character be a bit of a grouch at the start of the movie, and how even after this became one of the many, small dramas that rose up throughout the movie-- she was still a bit of a grouch at the end of the movie. That felt more real to me than any other possible treatments of her flaw of grouchiness. People don't usually have it in them to make radical personality adjustments anyway. Also, we got to see that the grouchiness was heartfelt, and a perhaps clumsy attempt at expressing her dedication to the children she was responsible for teaching. The character then got a chance to see that some of the evident failings of her students (forgetting a violin, not standing straight, etc.) weren't signs of their ineptitude, laziness, or other negative traits. Rather, we and the teacher got to see that often the kids were actually adapting and coping with some pretty horrible circumstances in their world in the only ways they could, and doing a remarkably good job of it, given the fuller understanding.In that light, her grouchiness did taper off a bit; and as more and more students and parents began to appreciate what she really was striving for, the movie showed how cooperation and other forms of support were more forthcoming-- and thus the occasion for grouchiness was further reduced. But I really did like how Streep was able to show the character's personality was essentially the same, but expressed in a variety of different tenors and tones, perhaps, as we might expect over the course of a difficult but successful decade.This movie was heart warming, and appropriately so. (Many movie critics become crazed with rage at anything with any emotion-- but bleep them!) I don't think there was a hint of fakery or manipulation. The conclusion was reached with just enough miracle and just enough accident and just enough mathematical result of events and the natural course of things-- so that it all felt real.

There actually isn't much of a plot-- we see pretty much the whole thing in the previews. But like the old time Hollywood stories about heros from art, music, science, etc., that I used to enjoy so much on television (I wasn't alive when that kind of movie was still being made), there are little moments of drama and tension throughout the story, and of course the big built-towards climax. I may not be describing it right, but that's how it felt to me-- an old hero movie.Meryl Streep is amazing, as always. For example, I really liked how they had the character be a bit of a grouch at the start of the movie, and how even after this became one of the many, small dramas that rose up throughout the movie-- she was still a bit of a grouch at the end of the movie. That felt more real to me than any other possible treatments of her flaw of grouchiness. People don't usually have it in them to make radical personality adjustments anyway. Also, we got to see that the grouchiness was heartfelt, and a perhaps clumsy attempt at expressing her dedication to the children she was responsible for teaching. The character then got a chance to see that some of the evident failings of her students (forgetting a violin, not standing straight, etc.) weren't signs of their ineptitude, laziness, or other negative traits.

He does not find Melanie Griffiths attractive (who appears fat to him but not to anyone else -- remember how spunky she was in Cherry 2000?).  His only interest in her is to gain access to the object of his desire.  He is acutely aware how inappropriate it is, but he's powerless to resist.  Thus the momentum is set for most of the entire film.With few notable exceptions, movies do not do justice to books, just as videos don't do justice to movies.  I would venture to say it would be impossible to find a 12-year old who had the maturity to act Lolita.  Not particularly attractive (nor unattractive) Dominique Swain at 15, makes a very believable 14 year-old (but not a 17 year old) and puts in a splendid performance in the title role.  Perhaps it was possible because she hadn't had previous acting experience.

Since I am of the view that Ludwig wrote half of the world's exquisitely beautiful music, the fact that I didn't notice the incidental music is high praise of it indeed.I find appealing incidental images such as the flowers in the hospital rubbish bin and the old lady on the porch waving to all the traffic, but some were made a little too obvious.  A longer shot would have made these images less obvious and to my mind more satisfying.  The rest of the cinema audience had left and didn't see the final few frames after the credits.  That sequence might have Bible fanatics upset, but I liked it.  Come to think of it, so might they....The proliferation of 1940s consumerism paraphenalia and the vacuuous pop music did not convey any sense to me of satire, but did do a fairly accurate job of setting the social atmosphere.  With no sense of the satiric or comedic, the shooting scene just looked silly.  How come this guy's still walking even though he's been shot three times?  Since the story is told from HH's perspective, I took that to indicate he did not have a good grip on what was objectively observable.Excellent photography almost as good as Nicolas Roeg's (e.g. Walkabout or Don't Look Now) combined with great acting and music makes a film that anyone who has ever felt manipulated by another could relate to, even if they confuse love and lust.

There was only one time that this movie could have made me jump, when they were in the tent and the sides were being pounded on, but by then I was just so annoyed by the annoying personalities, I just wanted the movie to end.  I will say that I am sorry that I feel this way, I really wanted to like and be scared by this movie, but it just wasn't the case.  I could see that the three students were scared, at least by their level of swearing, they seemed to be, but their fright was not properly passed on to me.  What would I have done different? First off, make some of the shots a little clearer, when Heather was opening the stick packet and found the bloody mess, I couldn't make out what it was. I understand that it was part of Josh, but WHAT WAS IT?  It just added to my annoyance.  Add the outside perspective, not just one of the characters shooting.  After the 2nd or 3rd night of horror, they could have realistically set up a camera to record the campsite so we could see something happening.Like I said, I've been waiting for a movie to really scare the s**t out of me and hoped this would do it, but I was severely disappointed.

It is not a very flattering portrait of the master, but it gives one insight into his art.  Anthony Hopkins gives a convincing portrayal of the bad and the good qualities of the man.  He had a charming playfulness about him which the women in his life fell for despite themselves and the knowledge of his reputation.  Of course, his dark side was his maniacal desire for control of his women's lives, even after the romantic sides of their relationship had long since died.  My question about those women is why they went out of their way to get into a relationship with him, knowing he had already ruined the lives of others.  Francoise, the main character, thought herself strong enough to stave off any emotional harm he could do her, but when you get into a romantic relationship with someone, your reason disappears.  Nobody's strong enough to not be hurt by someone they are emotionally involved with.  The trick is to meet only the people who you feel reasonably sure will not do you harm.   One would think an intelligent woman like Francoise would know that.  If this were a piece of fiction, I would find it hard to believe, but given that the movie is based on fact....  This knowledge added a great deal to the intrigue of the movie, and a great deal of depth to the characters.The acting is first-rate.  I've seen a few of the other movies in which Natascha McElHone has acted, but those parts were not large enough to show her range.  I was extremely impressed.  She has a very expressive face, capable of portraying an entire pallet of emotions, and, most importantly, she is obviously an intelligent woman, capable of convincingly playing an intellectual.  Of course, the fact that she is elegantly drop-dead gorgeous has not colored my emotions about her performance one bit.Hopkins as usual does a brilliant job.  I have never seen him express ebullience as he does here.  He does a good job of showing how charming Picasso could be, supplying some motivation for why women fell for him, knowing his infamous past.Seeing this movie lent new meaning to some of his paintings which I have seen recently.  There is a portrait of Dorra Marr (sp?) in the Belissario Hotel in Las Vegas.  One half of it portrays a happy woman, the other half is tinged with sadness.  I now know the story behind this painting, making it all the more memorable.  Like the first reviewer, I'm not a big fan of Picasso, but knowing what lies behind some of his paintings will add interest in the future.
