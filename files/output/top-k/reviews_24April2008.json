That was about 3 or 4 years ago and the last year I saw for the very first time the Region 4 DVD so I get my own copy of the film and enjoyed for the second time. Last week I saw The Transporter and I decide to enjoy once again this magnificent work so I'm here writing, after a third view, my thoughts about Guy Ritchie's first feature film.The story introduce you this four friends Eddie (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher). They have different ways to get money but finally they decide to enter in a big game. They put together £100,000 to play a card game, taking advantage of the great abilities of Eddie. But they are playing against Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty) who is a porn king and now they owns him £500,000 and Harry is the kind of man that if you own him you better pay him. I really love how the story makes that you care and, at the same time, feel sorry for the four friends because they put in that card game all of their savings and now they need a real miracle to get the money in only one week. At the same time were are watching this, we also watch some other characters that, if you think first, doesn't have anything related with the four friends but you will see how little is the world. There are many secondary characters but basically there are just group of friends and partners the drug growers, the criminal neighbors of Eddie, the two guys from the North and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) with his son, Little Chris. And all know Harry and Rory (Vas Blackwood) that are the big bosses. There are two more characters that are the ones that connect everything, specially the second one Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) and Nick the Greek (Stephen Marcus). This story might look a little complicated with a lot of connected subplots but the way that is shown is just perfect, enjoyable and easy to follow. The style of Guy Ritchie is just so cool, for example the first sequence is just brilliant, and there are many funny situations just as many ironies in the entire story, being the one in the very end the biggest of all.Cast Just brilliant. Eddie could be the main character and Nick Moran is just great. Jason Statham is great but he has a support role as part of the four friends so he doesn't stand out of the four because the four are a team and are great. As I watched first Snatch I found here many familiar faces like Vinnie Jones and Alan Ford. The last one has a very small role as the bartender but he is also the narrator with his unique voice. Also Sting appears as Eddie's father making a really good performance and the hardest man in Britain, Lenny McLean, is terrific as Barry.Conclusion Well for me this is nothing but a brilliant film. Great story, great characters, funny situations with a lot of irony. I mention in this comment many times the film Snatch and the only reason is because is a similar film, brilliant too so I highly recommend both. In this case Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels deserves a perfect and beautiful 10.

It came with English subtitles and - although usually a hindrance - within 5 minutes I had forgotten. The dialogue was simple and terse. It was easy to keep reading apace with scene changes. That is something the French invariably forget. It opens in Italy in the peaceful, barmy sunshine and the drunkenness of soldiers on extended leave. They are bawdy and crude like the crew of 'Das Boot', and I sometimes get the impression from both that vulgarity is used as a cheap substitute for more intelligent script. The colours are beautiful. The clear blue sky finds even deeper shades of reflection in the sea. Italy is still untrammelled by allied assault and the towns are mellow and picturesque. But the movie is called 'Stalingrad', and you know this is the calm before the storm. Their leave ended, the troops are shoe-horned into cattle trucks and head east. Through the soldiers eyes, the camera shows the unfolding landscape of conquered territories - the new lebensraum. They sneer at local peasants and sit in awe of endless flat vistas of the steppes. It's their land now; or so they think. But the conquest has come to a grinding halt at the city of Stalingrad. And it's a battle that neither side can afford to lose. The movie changes here. The sun is gone. The sky turns permanently leaden. Life assumes the military colours of rancid filth. The scenes of combat are hideously graphic. In one exchange a soldier is blown in half by a tank shell. His torso pleads briefly for help. The situation deteriorates and winter finally crushes what little life and hope is left. The disintegrating order is extremely harrowing. The makers have recreated its chaos and despair with astonishing conviction. It is easy to moralise. The Germans got what they deserved. Or they were young men just obeying orders. And so on. The suffering was indescribable, but Stalingrad was a necessary evil. It was here, if anywhere, that the third Reich broke its heart. If there had been a German victory, the Russians would have been expunged en masse. Heaven knows, as things were, Nazi murder squads slaughtered more than could be counted. And sooner or later, Hitler would have returned to the matter of that inconvenient little island just north of France. By then he might have had the atom bomb.There has been a quiet attempt amongst some intelligentsia to rehabilitate the German people of this time. As if their suffering justified recognition, and from recognition - sympathy. We see a similar presentation in 'Das Boot', where submariners are ultimately depicted as victims - victims who sent thousands of ships and merchant sailors to the bottom of the sea, cheering as they did so and boasting about the 'happy times' before Britain developed effective counter-measures and paid them off in the same coin. However tragic the war for the German people and their armed forces in defeat, any prospect of their victory would have been a calamity too great to contemplate.Those who watch Stalingrad and feel an up-welling of compassion for its idealistic and doomed young Germans, should watch 'The Holocaust' afterwards.

I find it much easier to write about the ones that are bad; not the ones that are badly made but entertaining in their earnestness, but the ones that Hollywood keeps churning out to a worldwide audience that grows exponentially. The ones that Karl Marx might today call the opiate of the masses; although I, having experienced both, am here to say that opiates are much more enjoyable than Die Hard 9 or any film with Jerry Seinfeld providing the voice of a bee could ever be. I could just get off my soapbox and let it go, but the tragedy is that most Americans are f'ing idiots who, by substituting Hollywood's audience tested, product placed, fast food promo'd exercises in greatest common denominator blandness for any real and meaningful interaction with their fellow humans, make it so insanely profitable for the film INDUSTRY to churn out these movies that they lead other countries who previously produced great small films like Love Serenade into a sparkling future of uncompromising blandness.Fortunately Australia, probably through the sheer good fortune of being so far away from the USA, has not been bitten as hard by the bug as, say, Great Britain has (and I am a certified Anglophile - please UK, turn it around before it's too late!). They still make films like this one in Oz today, and, speaking of this one, I am supposed to be reviewing it, right? Blowhards on soapboxes going off-topic are almost as bad as bland Hollywood movies! But any time that I start to give my countrymen the benefit of doubt I hear something like America's favorite singing rodents - so perhaps at worst you can grant a terminal malcontent his eccentricities and at best stop giving the bloodsuckers your money?So- back to the subject at hand. This is a great movie! I loved everything about it. I'd have to say that the fish sub-theme is biggest stretch here, but it was not obtrusive and seemed to fit, sort of, in some way that will probably hit me at 3am on some sleepless night in the future. I like fish, anyway; I mean to look at them. I stopped fishing because I felt bad about killing them, although I did eat them and wasn't some a-hole on the pro bass fishing circuit (think about those four words for a moment - when did we become a people that needs a pro bass fishing circuit?) who found his American dream at the expense of the dream of a lot of fish. Yeah, they release them, but how would you like to be repeatedly jabbed with a hook and pulled from your house, unable to breathe while people did strange things to you, then released only to have it happen again, every year like clockwork; while a bunch of loud and strange machines fly about overhead and make your eyes burn and everything smell bad? And of course many of those fish swallow the hook and die, or die from the stress. So a bunch of fat morons can get rich and famous. We're not talking one guy standing on the shore with a fishing pole here. What's NOT for sale in America? OK soapbox guy emerged again, sorry! But the fish topic is relevant here. For a movie that's not about fish, it's about fish a lot. Characters Ken Sherry - talk about love\/hate. I alternately thought he was sorta cool (he wasn't, but I am an Anglophile, remember?) and a slimeball (he was). The girls, I'd never heard the name Dimity before but if I ever have a daughter I'm gonna name her Dimity. I like it. And yes, she IS odd. Her sister is annoying, but not TOO annoying. Both are cute to look at and likable in their ways. Albert is the sleeper here. Just about everything he said was gold. And I swear to you - I have had the urge to break into Wichita Lineman for absolutely no reason before, and have. Long before I ever saw this film. Did I tap into some universal unconscious Wichita Lineman thing? Who knows? But I do know that that soundtrack was excellent. Spot on. And Ken's semi-profound soliloquy? I knew where it came from, but if you don't then you will be quite surprised if you ever do find out (it's not credited but it is on an album by a famous person). If you prefer pirate Johnny Depp to Dead Man Johnny Depp, don't bother with this movie. Actually you are probably not even reading this, and if you are reading it, you have no idea that I've been making fun of you the whole time. You and I have absolutely nothing in common. But I will give you some great advice - you'd enjoy a couple of hours at Wal-Mart a lot more than you would watching this. For the rest of you, enjoy it. And a bit of knowledge about the end (which I did not know until later) makes it all the more poignant. RIP.

I could just get off my soapbox and let it go, but the tragedy is that most Americans are f'ing idiots who, by substituting Hollywood's audience tested, product placed, fast food promo'd exercises in greatest common denominator blandness for any real and meaningful interaction with their fellow humans, make it so insanely profitable for the film INDUSTRY to churn out these movies that they lead other countries who previously produced great small films like Love Serenade into a sparkling future of uncompromising blandness.Fortunately Australia, probably through the sheer good fortune of being so far away from the USA, has not been bitten as hard by the bug as, say, Great Britain has (and I am a certified Anglophile - please UK, turn it around before it's too late!). They still make films like this one in Oz today, and, speaking of this one, I am supposed to be reviewing it, right? Blowhards on soapboxes going off-topic are almost as bad as bland Hollywood movies! But any time that I start to give my countrymen the benefit of doubt I hear something like America's favorite singing rodents - so perhaps at worst you can grant a terminal malcontent his eccentricities and at best stop giving the bloodsuckers your money?So- back to the subject at hand. This is a great movie! I loved everything about it. I'd have to say that the fish sub-theme is biggest stretch here, but it was not obtrusive and seemed to fit, sort of, in some way that will probably hit me at 3am on some sleepless night in the future. I like fish, anyway; I mean to look at them. I stopped fishing because I felt bad about killing them, although I did eat them and wasn't some a-hole on the pro bass fishing circuit (think about those four words for a moment - when did we become a people that needs a pro bass fishing circuit?) who found his American dream at the expense of the dream of a lot of fish. Yeah, they release them, but how would you like to be repeatedly jabbed with a hook and pulled from your house, unable to breathe while people did strange things to you, then released only to have it happen again, every year like clockwork; while a bunch of loud and strange machines fly about overhead and make your eyes burn and everything smell bad? And of course many of those fish swallow the hook and die, or die from the stress. So a bunch of fat morons can get rich and famous. We're not talking one guy standing on the shore with a fishing pole here. What's NOT for sale in America? OK soapbox guy emerged again, sorry! But the fish topic is relevant here. For a movie that's not about fish, it's about fish a lot. Characters Ken Sherry - talk about love\/hate. I alternately thought he was sorta cool (he wasn't, but I am an Anglophile, remember?) and a slimeball (he was). The girls, I'd never heard the name Dimity before but if I ever have a daughter I'm gonna name her Dimity. I like it. And yes, she IS odd. Her sister is annoying, but not TOO annoying. Both are cute to look at and likable in their ways. Albert is the sleeper here. Just about everything he said was gold. And I swear to you - I have had the urge to break into Wichita Lineman for absolutely no reason before, and have. Long before I ever saw this film. Did I tap into some universal unconscious Wichita Lineman thing? Who knows? But I do know that that soundtrack was excellent. Spot on. And Ken's semi-profound soliloquy? I knew where it came from, but if you don't then you will be quite surprised if you ever do find out (it's not credited but it is on an album by a famous person). If you prefer pirate Johnny Depp to Dead Man Johnny Depp, don't bother with this movie. Actually you are probably not even reading this, and if you are reading it, you have no idea that I've been making fun of you the whole time. You and I have absolutely nothing in common. But I will give you some great advice - you'd enjoy a couple of hours at Wal-Mart a lot more than you would watching this. For the rest of you, enjoy it. And a bit of knowledge about the end (which I did not know until later) makes it all the more poignant. RIP.

It has always been my theory that this film is less about exploring the vampire mythology previously rendered on film so many times before, and more to do with the idea of exploring the disintegration of post WWII Germany and the soulless abyss left in the wake of Hitler and the Third Reich. Herzog himself has even said that the intention behind the film grew from the idea that his generation of German filmmakers were a generation without fathers, in the respect that the previous generation of directors had either submitted to the lure of the Nazi party or abandoned their country completely. Herzog has in mind an interesting philosophy, and one that would lend itself to varying layers of reference, from Bram Stoker's original (and best) rendition of the Dracula myth, to the expressionist realms of F.W. Murnau's classic silent film, Nosferatu; a Symphony of Horror (1922).The film is characteristic of Herzog's work, to an extent; recalling elements of the period look of greater films like The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (1974) and Heart of Glass (1976), as well as the more intense film that he had previously made with Kinski, Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972). As always with Herzog, the film becomes a battle between these two separate elements, in this instance, a battle between an actor and director clearly attempting to make two very different films. Kinski is trying (and to some extent succeeding) to create the most realistic and humanistic vampire that modern day cinema has ever seen - with the defeat, desperation and occasional flicker of frailty presenting us with a Dracula very much worn down by the natural requirements of their existence - whilst Herzog is busy filling his images with an impassioned openness, a preoccupation with spatial, architectural presentation and a cinema of landscapes. The only time the two forces come together is in the creation of a melancholic detachment apparent in both the acting and design, but overall, we never get the feeling that the film fits together quite as well as it could have done.In this respect, I would compare the experiment to Tarkovsky's adaptation of Solaris (1972), another film that saw the consequences of a highly-personal and poetic filmmaker attempting to apply their own unique vision alongside the broader conventions of. It's not a bad film by any means, but certainly it is something of a problematic adaptation of the vampire myth and one of the least successful films that Herzog produced during this most prolific and rewarding period of his career. Where it succeeds is clearly in the creation of a grand, Gothic atmosphere and the director's surreal visions of plagues, pestilence and death. This gives way to a number of vividly impressive moments of pure, visual film-making; for example, the sight of the majestic flagship drifting silently down the street-side canal - and over-flowing with plague ridden rats - recalling that stunning scene from Aguirre with Kinski's raft overrun by rampaging monkeys, or a grinning and salivating Renfield held central to the frame by two mannequin like police officers.More astounding is the depiction of the town stricken with illness and death, with its decomposing fruit and rancid meat lining the gutters and Kinski stalking the streets like an anaemic old man. It is here that Herzog creates a further coalition between his film and the more subtle rendering of the Holocaust, with coffins lining streets, the bereft searching through corpses for their missing relatives, houses boarded up and tables dressed for banquets left completely ignored. It is within these images that we finally see the subtle, subconscious blending of Herzog's polemic in complete contrast with Kinksi's desire to create a Dracula that is threatening and pathetic in equal measures; an idea that will lead us to that ironic final and the general off-kilter, fairytale-like feeling that film creates throughout. However, what really flaws this film for me is the continual sense of Herzog building to an intelligent and interesting idea that never fully develops. Simply, the film for me lacks the personal touch and sense of passion and drive found in the filmmaker's better films from the same period.It didn't shock me like Even Dwarfs Started Small (1970), nor did it truly affect me on an emotional level like The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, Stroszek (1977) or his following film with Kinski, Woyzeck (1979); a literary adaptation done right. However, with that said, the film still has some interesting elements in keeping with those much greater works. It may be inconsistent, and it may not work as a conventional vampire film (or even as a conventional Herzog film), but like Oktyabr, this is a picture that is filled with passion and rage; a film that masks it's ideals under an air of artistic creativity, that is never less than political. Had I not discovered this similarity then I, like the majority of commentators here, may have been even more critical of Herzog's bold departures, his literary bastardisations and his use of that slow, lingering pace.

The first half looks at how recruits were trained, and how Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) was bullied by his Drill Sergeant (R. Lee Ermey) and other recruit to point he is driven to looking his mind, murders and before committing suicide. The second half shows that the US army was fairly hopeless during the war, destroying Vietnamese towns and killing and exploiting or killing the locals. A few women were prostituting themselves to American soldiers. At the end of the film it is shown that a 12-year-old girl was a sniper and ends up getting killed. Some people have argued that Full Metal Jacket was a neutral film however it is obvious that its an Anti-War film.The first half of the film is the best, but the second half is still very good compared to other films. The opening scene was a classic bit of cinema and R. Lee Ermey does steal the show with his performance. A little be of trivia is that Ermey was hired to be an adviser to the person who would play the Drill Sergeant. However Kubrick saw a video of him shouting 15 minutes worth of insults without stopping or repeating himself, so Kubrick casted him in the role. The Drill Sergeant is shown to be a religious and sadist, but a stereotype. During this part of the film shows how the human soul is destroyed by the training and how recruits become heartless beings. The second half shows how the war was fought and that soldiers were at times heartless. Full Metal Jacket takes a different approach to other Vietnam films by showing a urban battle, and how brutal an affair it was.The film has some great dark comedy in it, a trait of Kubrick, shown in Dr. Strangelove, Lolita and A Clockwork Orange. The Drill Sergeant was the best at it and comes up with some classic film quotes. Joker was also a good comedic character and other characters do come up with witty comments. Kubrick's anti-war politics is show and Full Metal Jacket shows how destructive the Vietnam war was on the country. Kubrick's other anti-war films were Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove.The film is excellent, the only two problems what the second half being a little weaker and that it was filmed in England, and therefore doesn't have quite the same feel to other Vietnam films.Full Metal Jacket is Kubrick classic and a must see for film lovers.

Full Metal Jacket is an Anti-War, as well as an Anti-Vietnam film and shows Kubrick talent and politics.Full Metal Jacket is a movie in two halves, first on boot-camp and the dehumanising of recruits and the second in Vietnam, looking at Private\/Sergeant Joker's (Michael Modine) career as a military journalist, the Tet Offensive and the Battle of Hue. The first half looks at how recruits were trained, and how Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) was bullied by his Drill Sergeant (R. Lee Ermey) and other recruit to point he is driven to looking his mind, murders and before committing suicide. The second half shows that the US army was fairly hopeless during the war, destroying Vietnamese towns and killing and exploiting or killing the locals. A few women were prostituting themselves to American soldiers. At the end of the film it is shown that a 12-year-old girl was a sniper and ends up getting killed. Some people have argued that Full Metal Jacket was a neutral film however it is obvious that its an Anti-War film.The first half of the film is the best, but the second half is still very good compared to other films. The opening scene was a classic bit of cinema and R. Lee Ermey does steal the show with his performance. A little be of trivia is that Ermey was hired to be an adviser to the person who would play the Drill Sergeant. However Kubrick saw a video of him shouting 15 minutes worth of insults without stopping or repeating himself, so Kubrick casted him in the role. The Drill Sergeant is shown to be a religious and sadist, but a stereotype. During this part of the film shows how the human soul is destroyed by the training and how recruits become heartless beings. The second half shows how the war was fought and that soldiers were at times heartless. Full Metal Jacket takes a different approach to other Vietnam films by showing a urban battle, and how brutal an affair it was.The film has some great dark comedy in it, a trait of Kubrick, shown in Dr. Strangelove, Lolita and A Clockwork Orange. The Drill Sergeant was the best at it and comes up with some classic film quotes. Joker was also a good comedic character and other characters do come up with witty comments.
