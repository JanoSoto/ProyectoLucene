For Franka Potente, Lola is still easily the most known performance of her prolific career. Together with The Bourne Identity maybe. For Bleibtreu, it is probably still Das Experiment as he is the undisputed lead there. Lola rennt was a BAFTA nominee, but lost to Academy Award winner All about my Mother. At the German Film Awards, however, it won all the categories it was nominated for film, direction and both supporting categories. Potente did not get in, however. There are many slow movies out there, but this one here is probably the exact opposite. And that is not only because it runs for just 75 minutes (without credits), but mostly because something essential happens all the time. A lot of it is thanks to its great cast Knaup, Rohde, Petri, Monica Bleibtreu (Moritz' mother), von Borsody, Król, Pistor and Ferch belong to Germany's acting elite to this day. The film's director and writer is Tom Tykwer, one of Germany's most famous directors in Hollywood. Maybe you have seen Cloud Atlas not too long ago. He was also in a longtime-relationship with Potente when Lola rennt was made.I liked how future events were told when Lola was running by people. But in the core, it is all about her fate. And about her boyfriend's. Both get killed at one point, but Lola gets the chance to relive certain situations in order to avoid disaster. Will she manage to get 100,000 Marks in 20 minutes? Does she even have to? The story is always a bit different. One of the most lauded things about this film is probably the music. Heil, Klimek and Tykwer worked on several projects together and scored a BAFTA nomination for the previously mentioned Cloud Atlas as well. The main theme from German rapper Thomas D. and Potente herself is used repeatedly in this film and never impressed me really. I remember it was a big hit back then, but I personally would have been happier with an exclusively instrumental soundtrack. In the end, we watch three different scenarios until the two protagonists finally find happiness. I like how they did not include a fourth and kept the film very short and essential instead as there certainly would have been the danger of becoming a bit repetitive and starting to drag. However, why would Bleibtreu's character give the gun to the homeless guy. That did not really make any sense to me. And I found the casino scene a bit random and could have done without it, but I actually liked the ending and the final shot\/question. Nicely done.While I enjoyed it, I cannot really see the big impact this film had, but nonetheless I give it a thumbs up. Potente and Bleibtreu were in their 20s when this was made and it is one of the best examples of new wild German cinema. I don't think it is necessarily great movie making, but it's a very creative approach and idea and good execution of it, which makes this film so memorable. It is certainly a fairly unique piece of movie-making. Recommended.

A psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher) plans to prove via science that everything that happened to the young girl can be explained. While that is going on, the Catholic church has asked Father Lamont (Richard Burton) to find out what really happened to Father Merrin (Max von Sydow).EXORCIST II THE HERETIC has been considered one of the worst movies ever made since it's first screening. The stories behind the opening day and weeks of this movie have become legendary and even though the movie made money for Warner, the studio was still highly embarrassed by it and the following decades haven't been kind to the picture. You really have to place blame at director John Boorman's feet because he's the one who agreed to the screenplay and according to all records, he's the one that kept out some pretty interesting ideas that they had for the film. In later interviews the director seemed to admit that he simply didn't deliver a film that people wanted to see.That's certainly an understatement because this thing is just a complete mess from the opening sequences to the incredibly awful finale. It's clear that Boorman didn't want to just copy the first film and for that you can respect him. With that said, a direct rip-off of the first film would have been much better than what we actually got. It's funny but there were countless rip-offs of THE EXORCIST that happened since the time that film was released and this sequel was released and what's sad is that the majority of them were better than this. The biggest problem, for me anyways, is that there's really nothing that happens throughout the two-hour running time. The film's pacing is so incredibly slow that by the forty-five minute mark I was already about to fall asleep.What follows doesn't get any better as we got the psychiatrist and the priest going at one another while Regan is curing sick children (really?). Then you've got Father Merrin working in Africa, which just adds up to nothing. Look, I realize this film has its defenders including Martin Scorsese, but for my money it's a complete waste of time. The finale is just downright stupid and appears to be trying to match the original film but there's no drama, no suspense and nothing memorable at all. Even worse is that the special effects really aren't that impressive nor is the music score.There are a few good things with the film including some of the performances. Blair does a good job in her role but sadly she really isn't given too much to do. Fletcher and von Sydow are both good in their supporting roles and Kitty Winn, James Earl Jones and Ned Beatty do what they can with the screenplay. However, Burton doesn't come off very good and at times he's quite laughable as he overplays everything and some of his line delivery makes you wonder how much he had to drink before filming. It's obvious this was just a paycheck to the actor and lets hope he enjoyed the money.EXORCIST II THE HERETIC might not deserve its reputation of being one of the worst movies ever made but it certainly deserves to be called one of the dumbest. Again, I can respect the fact that Boorman didn't want to just deliver another possession film but I think most people would have preferred that over the mess we ended up getting.

In 1992, both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston could do no, wrong. At the time, Kevin Costner was one of America's most accomplished thespians and Whitney Houston was one of the most popular singers. When you combine them, in the movie, 'the Bodyguard'. You get a semi-OK-masterpiece. This schmaltzy proposal for this film was rejected 67 times before Kevin Costner got the rights. It was originally written by Lawrence Kasdan for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the 1970s. Directed by Mick Jackson, the movie tells the story of Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a former Secret Service Agent for the President, who became the private bodyguard for international pop star and actress, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) after she been, receiving death threats from a dangerous stalker. Can Frank save Rachel or will the killer win out in the end? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, I found Kevin Costner's acting in this, pretty dull. I know, that his character is supposed to be stern, but gees&#x85; they could have, lighten up, the character, a bit. Even, in the lake scenes. He was pretty blend. Despite, that, he made a pretty realistic bodyguard. He was also, a pretty cool, action star at the time. He deserve more credit for this movie, from stopping it from totally tanking with his action scenes. The scene where he was chasing the killer, through the woods was intense. Kevin Costner was so insistent that Whitney Houston and no other black singer\/actress play the part that the film production waited 1 year for Whitney to be available to film. In my opinion, it was a good choice. She was a good singer, but not a good actress, even when seemingly playing a variation of herself. Whitney Houston as Rachel, was mediocre, at best. I give her some credit, for at least, trying to act. She did suffered a miscarriage during production and missed a couple of weeks of production recovering, and you can't tell, by her performance, how truly depress, she must have, been at the time. I just glad, Whitney Houston's character wasn't playing like a gimmicky black singer stereotype. Still, most of the movie, I felt that her character was a bit annoying. Even, test audiences, couldn't stand all, her b*tching as the film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting. Still, with those cuts, her character never truly understood, how much, she was in danger, even when, things became really serious and it bugs the living hell out of me. I know, she supposed to play a diva, but I didn't like, how much, Rachel and Frank fought against each other over, how much protection, she needs. It made the romance seem so unrealistic. I didn't think, that the actors have that much chemistry on film. Still, they both look, beautiful, together. One thing that I kinda love about the film, is how brave, the filmmakers were in showing interracial relationships. Even in the 1990s, seeing this was rare. Houston's mainstream appeal allowed people to look at the movie color-blind, and never once, did I find the fact that a black woman and white guy falling in love, jarring. Still, controversy arose as some felt the film's advertising intentionally hid Houston's face to hide the film's interracial relationship. I think, this was made to keep, the movie from being spoiled. The reason The Bodyguard scored more than $410 million worldwide is not, because of the two stars sex appeal. It's the film soundtrack, which to date, as of this writing, stands as the highest selling in movie history. It features six songs by Whitney Houston, including Queen of the Night, a remake of Chaka Khan's I'm Every Woman, I've Got Nothing, and, of course, her signature cover of Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You. Although her songs make up half of the soundtrack, she is credited for the album's popularity, which in turn drove people to see the film. Two songs from the film, Run to You and I Have Nothing, were nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song. While, 'I will always love you' got her, multiply rewards and became one of the best-selling single by a woman in music history. The character of Rachel was originally going to sing What Becomes of the Broken Hearted instead of I Will Always Love You, before 1991's film, Fried Green Tomatoes used the former song. Kevin Costner is the one who wanted the song written by Dolly Parton to be sung by Whitney Houston. He convinced Whitney to sing it a capella for the movie. Whitney's rendition became so good, that Dolly Parton pretty much, disowned it and gave it to Whitney. Regardless of whether you're a Houston fan, her talent as a singer is what makes the movie halfway watchable. If this movie was made today, it might be an all-out-disaster. Both celebrities went into a shaky time in the late 1990s\/early 2000s. While, Whitney Houston's career never really, bound-back, to the success of this film and its soundtrack. She did have some minor hits, before dying in 2012, in a drowning\/drug overdose accident. Kevin Costner was able to have some success after his double whammy of post-apocalypse sci-fi flops movies in the mid-1990s, and his career is still going strong. In many ways, he always thought of this movie, as one of his greatest works, and always felt open in making a sequel or remaking it. Celebrities like Rihanna, and Princess Diana was once sought for re-dos. Who knows, if a sequel will be made? Overall Yes, it could had been better, but I quite enjoyed the film. I do recommended, at least, seeing it, once. In the end, if you don't bother watching the film. At least, try to listen to the soundtrack. You'll probably enjoyed it.

Still, with those cuts, her character never truly understood, how much, she was in danger, even when, things became really serious and it bugs the living hell out of me. I know, she supposed to play a diva, but I didn't like, how much, Rachel and Frank fought against each other over, how much protection, she needs. It made the romance seem so unrealistic. I didn't think, that the actors have that much chemistry on film. Still, they both look, beautiful, together. One thing that I kinda love about the film, is how brave, the filmmakers were in showing interracial relationships. Even in the 1990s, seeing this was rare. Houston's mainstream appeal allowed people to look at the movie color-blind, and never once, did I find the fact that a black woman and white guy falling in love, jarring. Still, controversy arose as some felt the film's advertising intentionally hid Houston's face to hide the film's interracial relationship. I think, this was made to keep, the movie from being spoiled. The reason The Bodyguard scored more than $410 million worldwide is not, because of the two stars sex appeal. It's the film soundtrack, which to date, as of this writing, stands as the highest selling in movie history. It features six songs by Whitney Houston, including Queen of the Night, a remake of Chaka Khan's I'm Every Woman, I've Got Nothing, and, of course, her signature cover of Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You. Although her songs make up half of the soundtrack, she is credited for the album's popularity, which in turn drove people to see the film. Two songs from the film, Run to You and I Have Nothing, were nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song. While, 'I will always love you' got her, multiply rewards and became one of the best-selling single by a woman in music history. The character of Rachel was originally going to sing What Becomes of the Broken Hearted instead of I Will Always Love You, before 1991's film, Fried Green Tomatoes used the former song. Kevin Costner is the one who wanted the song written by Dolly Parton to be sung by Whitney Houston. He convinced Whitney to sing it a capella for the movie. Whitney's rendition became so good, that Dolly Parton pretty much, disowned it and gave it to Whitney. Regardless of whether you're a Houston fan, her talent as a singer is what makes the movie halfway watchable. If this movie was made today, it might be an all-out-disaster. Both celebrities went into a shaky time in the late 1990s\/early 2000s. While, Whitney Houston's career never really, bound-back, to the success of this film and its soundtrack. She did have some minor hits, before dying in 2012, in a drowning\/drug overdose accident. Kevin Costner was able to have some success after his double whammy of post-apocalypse sci-fi flops movies in the mid-1990s, and his career is still going strong. In many ways, he always thought of this movie, as one of his greatest works, and always felt open in making a sequel or remaking it. Celebrities like Rihanna, and Princess Diana was once sought for re-dos. Who knows, if a sequel will be made? Overall Yes, it could had been better, but I quite enjoyed the film. I do recommended, at least, seeing it, once. In the end, if you don't bother watching the film. At least, try to listen to the soundtrack. You'll probably enjoyed it.

(Maybe to suggest Ballin' Munson?).Welcome to Gilda's alternative universe, my friend, one which succeeds on an anthropological plane of investigation; helping we poor mortals of the 21st century determine what kind of escapist entertainment our ancestors found amusing.In sum, Gilda is just a vehicle for Rita Hayworth to strut and dance around inher glittering designer gowns, waving her gorgeous locks of hair, and uttering lines of dialogue she would never be clever enough to come upwith on her own. And her guitar playing? Ha! Hayworth doesn't even bother trying to fake it, merely putting all four fingers over the strings and sliding them up and down like a spastic paralytic. You may as well throw your suspension of disbelief out the window if you have any hope of getting through this overrated piece of schlock. Film noir?

My favorite movie, Pulp Fiction, has a stunning and nearly mind-blowing ending. The same goes for other films I love such as Psycho, Memento, The Prestige, and It's a Wonderful Life. But when I read Blade Runner I read it as a boring movie with a great ending which gives the film great meaning. I haven't seen the theatrical version, but I have seen clips of it, and I think the voice-overs by Deckard take away from the film even more. While the noir film usually relies on narration, this film is fine with this aspect taken away, leaving Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous to us as an audience.I have to admit I think the concept of the film is intriguing. We learn with the help of text at the film's opening that replicants have been created as slaves, but since they are intelligent they have turned on their creators. The title of the film refers to those who are meant to retire these replicants.The mise-en-scene of the film has a Gothic quality to it which really leaves me with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. It fits into the noir aspect of the film since it is so dark, but it also has a really creepy quality to it which the film does not need. In scenes revolving around Sebastian, the man creates these friends for himself, these living puppets in a sense, which underscores the motif in the film of playing God, or creating life. The replicant Pris seems to blend in with these creations since she looks otherworldly, with white makeup covering her face, black around the eyes, hair almost as light as her makeup. It's like she is from the circus, which does not belong in a movie revolving around city life.Perhaps the mise-en-scene will grow on me over time; I hated it on first viewing, but I realize it adds to the dark tone of the movie and is fitting. In a final fight between the Blade Runner and Roy, Roy shows compassion and helps Deckard to live since he is about to die, but we have no idea when Roy is meant to die, just that his life is running out due to a four year lifespan. While he gives a brilliant monologue, Roy dies with no preparation for the audience. We might have viewed Roy with more empathy if we knew he was going to die in a matter of minutes, but it is still a powerful death.The movie has a brilliant ending in which an origami unicorn is placed in Deckard's place. It is said that replicants have built-in memories, and earlier in the film he dreams of a unicorn. The cop knowing about the unicorn suggests that Deckard is perhaps a replicant himself, which is a brilliant ending which gives the film a whole new meaning.

While the noir film usually relies on narration, this film is fine with this aspect taken away, leaving Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous to us as an audience.I have to admit I think the concept of the film is intriguing. We learn with the help of text at the film's opening that replicants have been created as slaves, but since they are intelligent they have turned on their creators. The title of the film refers to those who are meant to retire these replicants.The mise-en-scene of the film has a Gothic quality to it which really leaves me with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. It fits into the noir aspect of the film since it is so dark, but it also has a really creepy quality to it which the film does not need. In scenes revolving around Sebastian, the man creates these friends for himself, these living puppets in a sense, which underscores the motif in the film of playing God, or creating life. The replicant Pris seems to blend in with these creations since she looks otherworldly, with white makeup covering her face, black around the eyes, hair almost as light as her makeup. It's like she is from the circus, which does not belong in a movie revolving around city life.Perhaps the mise-en-scene will grow on me over time; I hated it on first viewing, but I realize it adds to the dark tone of the movie and is fitting. In a final fight between the Blade Runner and Roy, Roy shows compassion and helps Deckard to live since he is about to die, but we have no idea when Roy is meant to die, just that his life is running out due to a four year lifespan. While he gives a brilliant monologue, Roy dies with no preparation for the audience. We might have viewed Roy with more empathy if we knew he was going to die in a matter of minutes, but it is still a powerful death.The movie has a brilliant ending in which an origami unicorn is placed in Deckard's place. It is said that replicants have built-in memories, and earlier in the film he dreams of a unicorn. The cop knowing about the unicorn suggests that Deckard is perhaps a replicant himself, which is a brilliant ending which gives the film a whole new meaning.

I'm glad to say that 'Airplane' is the exception to the rule. It's one of those 'spoof' films which sacrifices story in favour of joke after joke after joke. Nowadays, similar humour is applied to spoof movies which lampoon one or two individual films. Back in 1980 when Airplane was made it was less fashionable to make fun of just one film, instead 'disaster movies' in general are the topic of ridicule. And, luckily, the plot is pretty simple &#x96; the titular airplane loses all its pilots (and many of the passengers) to a freak food poisoning accident (just don't eat the fish!) and a former war pilot, with a questionable track record at the helm of flying machines, must step up to save the day.You need to know that 'Airplane' is hardly 'highbrow entertainment.' It never was. It never will be. And, most importantly, it was never intended to be. The film is filled with 'pratt-falls' and dumb and silly jokes. If you've watched any of the 'Naked Gun' films, or those 'Scary\/Superhero\/Disaster\/Delete As Applicable' Movies, then you'll kind of know the drill by now. Only Airplane was basically 'the original' of this type of film, therefore it's definitely the funniest!Part of its appeal is the fact that the film-makers seemed to steer towards casting 'non-comedic' actors is as many of the lead roles as they could, meaning everyone plays their parts 'straight' and totally deadpan. Of course the main characters are great, but it's Leslie Neilson who steals every scene in what was his first comic role on screen (but definitely not his last!).Airplane isn't the kind of movie you need to think about. You just need to be in the mood for something a bit silly (and sometimes irreverent!) to get enjoyment out of this. Even after over thirty-five years, it still outclasses all those other 'spoof' movies. It is truly the original&#x85; and best.And don't call me 'Shirley!'

I won't go into too much of the plot, because a lot of people should know what is the main premise of the story in this film and the other Fast and Furious movies. The franchise would later go to move away from the underground street racing plot into a plot much more cooler with the heist of $100 million dollars, gun fights and brawls and the movie that would change this franchise and bring new life into it would be the fifth entry in the series, released in April of 2011, Fast Five.The story is just really cool and amazing, but is not Oscar worthy, but the dialogue is the movie can get a little weak on a few occasions, but not throughout the whole darn movie.The action is just top-notch and the car chases in this film is as intense and action-packed as they would be later on in the franchise. My favorite car chase is at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film involving Dominic and Brian driving.The acting is just dreadful, but not all of it is. I will give credit to Vin Diesel, who plays Dominic Toretto and he pulls it off wonderfully, but while it's not Oscar worthy, he does show emotion, drama and laughter into his character. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, is great in this film and she would remain in that part for the other films and she would play in James Cameron's groundbreaking special-effects extravaganza Avatar and in the 2002 action-horror \/ zombie movie film based on the survival video game, Resident Evil.The other two that also does a great job is definitely Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto, and they do a very decent good job with the material written for them and they have such a great chemistry on the screen.Dominic Toretto's team members are just good. The actors who play the people in his crew is just incredible, with the exception of Matt Schulze as Vince.The music and soundtrack is really cool and Ja Rule is in this film, playing the role of Edwin and he provides music on the soundtrack.Overall, The first and original FAST AND THE FURIOUS is really good, but can get a little confusing in a few areas. I give it a 6 out of 10. It's not the best score, but certainly not the worst.

Where Harold was an old-fashioned, respectable gangster who had excelled in his business now looking to go straight, Mona Lisa's George is a petty crook fresh out of a long stretch in prison. They are both fascinating, detailed portrayal's, but I feel George is the more complex performance, serving as a sad reminder of the fact that the world lost one of it's finest actors last year.Thrust back into a world that seems to evolved without him, George manages to land a job driving call girls from client to client. His first customer is Simon (Cathy Tyson), a beautiful, upper-end call girl who clashes with George's bull-headed personality. She gives him money to buy some decent clothes, and he shows up in a Hawaiian shirt and leather jacket. With time, their differences become their bond, and Simone asks George to help her find her old friend, a young girl named Cathy (Kate Hardie), who is still in the hands of a sadistic pimp (played by The Wire's Clarke Peters). Meanwhile, George's old boss Denny Mortwell (Michael Caine) is suspicious of their activities and demands that George provide information on Simone.The movie doesn't go over-the-top with its depiction of the capital's seedy underbelly, but is far more subtle in the way it plays on our expectations. We're all aware of the presence of prostitutes in practically every town in the country, but do we ever really consider what they spend their money on? How they are treated? Where do they sleep at night? We glimpse the true barbarism behind the red lights here, something that George finds difficult to deal with. However, the film is by no means grim, with an excellent script by director Neil Jordan and David Leland providing many amusing moments, particularly in the exchanges between George and his detective story-loving friend Thomas (Robbie Coltrane).The performances are excellent all round. Hoskins is a rather lovable lunk, proving to be almost insistent at drawing unwanted attention to himself and Simone; at complete odds with this new world he stumbles across. He's the type of guy who asks for a cup of tea at a strip club. Tyson too (what happened to her?) projects real vulnerability under her mask of confidence and beauty. When the movie shifts from drama to thriller in the last third, Caine becomes a menacing presence with a unnerving lack of emotion. All the filth we witness is all just business to him.

By the end, as what I initially thought was a character-driven relationship drama turned into something else entirely, the film had subverted my expectations so much that I had to just sit back and admire.

Maybe it is bad luck, for the stress is finally getting to him and, when he mistakes a fly on his screen for an airplane, he is called into the office. He MUST take a four week vacation or be let go. Naturally, with a wife and three kids, he doesn't want to lose his position! So, its vacay time, to the delight of his family. From Atlanta, the group decides to travel to a resort city in Florida. When they arrive at the rental home, their good fortune is almost beyond belief. The house, on the water, is large with every amenity. All are thrilled. Yet, there are problems. Almost immediately, Jack has a run in with a local rich big wig, Al (Richard Crenna) who despises temporary renters. Then, folks try to break into the house one night. But, alas, they are the home owners, who quickly point out that Jack has the wrong address! Fortunately, they don't press charges if all go immediately. As can be expected, the correct rental address is a rundown shack with heavy beach traffic. Then, too, Al is able to bump Jack's loved ones to a lower place on a restaurant wait list and eats the last lobsters available. In a huff, Jack and the troop go to Scully's (Rip Torn) smaller place where they make friends and have a great meal. In fact, Scully teaches Jack how to sail. This becomes important as Jack challenges Al to winning a local sail race. Can the renter get his revenge on the snooty Al? This is a fun film, made better, naturally, because of Candy's great talents. Watching him chase unwelcome guests out of his rental house, on crutches, is pretty funny. Crenna, Torn, and all of the others do funny work as well. In addition, the beach setting is lovely while the script has plenty of hijinks and laughs. An energetic direction completes the picture. This was the first film I ever bought on video and when I re-found it the other day, I was happy. Nearly 30 years later, its still a very entertaining film for all.

Batman's popularity skyrocketed since the release of Batman in 1989. A lot of things have occurred which owe the movie Batman a lot of credit. Bat-mania was a pop culture phenomenon which spread like wildfire and to this day has not dwindled. Batman merchandise is still very popular amongst many Batman fans as well as many movie fans.Batman starts off with showing us that Gotham City is indeed a dangerous place to live in with crime and corruption plaguing the great city. The Mayor has ordered District Attorney Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) and Police Commissioner James Gordon (Pat Hingle) to increase police activity and to combat crime in preparation for the 200th Anniversary Gala celebrating the birth of Gotham City. Amongst Gotham City's undesirables include mob boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) and his second in command Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson). Jack Napier and several henchmen are sent to raid the Axis Chemicals plant which turns out to be a set up by Grissom in revenge for Jack Napier having an affair with his mistress Alicia (Jerry Hall). During the shootout between the police and the criminals, Batman (Michael Keaton) appears to thwart the getaway of Jack Napier and the henchmen and in the ensuring battle, Jack Napier is knocked into a vat of chemicals and presumably killed. Batman escapes into the night after the police attempt to stop him, dismissing him as a costumed vigilante.Reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) are assigned to uncover Batman's identity as well as the reasons behind Batman's actions.Batman is actually revealed to be billionaire and philanthropist Bruce Wayne, who is troubled by a tragic past in which he witnesses the death of his parents as a child by a mugger. Bruce Wayne lives a secluded lifestyle in a mansion away from the city with his trusted butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough).Jack Napier has managed to survive the accident at the Axis Chemicals plant and through the help of a doctor has managed to salvage what was left of him. Jack Napier has left his identity behind and with his new look of bleached white skin, green hair and a permanent grin he reveals himself to be known as The Joker. The Joker brings it upon himself to wage a new campaign of terror amongst Gotham City as well as Batman with his promise Wait till they get a load of me.Batman must also take on The Joker, as well as continue to keep his identity a secret from Gotham City, as well as his new found love interest Vicki Vale.Tim Burton, previously known for his work with Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985) and Beetlejuice (1988) cemented his reputation as a uniquely visually dazzling director. Tim Burton introduced a dark and sinister universe to Batman, in contrast to the camp and comical take on Batman which audiences knew and loved with the 1960's show Batman. Also full credit to Tim Burton for omitting Batman's sidekick Robin and just focusing on Batman\/Bruce Wayne. Michael Keaton attracted a lot of controversy when he was selected to play Batman\/Bruce Wayne, as he was widely known as a comedic actor with movies such as Mr Mom (1983) and Beetlejuice (1988), and as a result caused an uproar amongst many Batman fans with 50,000 protest letters sent to the offices of Warner Bros. studios stating their displeasure. Many fans were fearful that this was going to be another camp Batman movie. It goes without saying that those that criticized Michael Keaton as Batman have not been heard from since. Michael Keaton also added another string to his bow by establishing himself as a dramatic actor with a darkly comic personality. Jack Nicholson fits into his role perfectly as The Joker with this being one of his many memorable roles in a stellar career which includes but is not limited to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), The Shining (1980), A Few Good Men (1992), As Good as it Gets (1997), and The Departed (2006). Kim Basinger was very memorable as Vicki Vale, the beautiful and talented photojournalist. I always liked Kim Basinger as an actress and here she is stunning. I must admit I had a secret boyhood crush on her as a young kid following Batman.It's hard to believe that Batman celebrated its 25 year anniversary last year in 2014 and today, Batman is still a strong influence on pop culture. Although it is dated now there's no denying that Batman was the word on the street upon it's release. Batman was a runaway box office success in 1989 which grossed over $400 million worldwide and made a lot more through home video.It's no use comparing and contrasting Batman (1989) to The Dark Knight (2008) or any of the other sequels for that matter. Though they are both equally excellent movies, they are still two separate unique movies. Michael Keaton and Christian Bale has their own unique take as Batman. Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger also have their own unique take as The Joker although not taking anything away from Heath Ledger his role was the more memorable given his untimely passing in 2008.If Batman was not a success, any hopes for a franchise would have been lost in the night. This franchise owes a great deal of gratitude to the 1989 blockbuster Batman. Although The Dark Knight trilogy was excellent in its own right, Batman is still one the greatest movies I still get a thrill out of watching. Batman is still a pleasure to watch years later and Michael Keaton as Batman\/Bruce Wayne lives on as one of my childhood heroes.9\/10.

I'm usually fond of drama movies and TV shows, but this one just seemed shallow and uninteresting. I couldn't get myself to give a sh!t about any of the characters or their stories, as there was nothing for me to relate to.

Some of the positive reviews I read here reminded me of the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, feeling that if it wasn't for the variety of individual tastes, I'd be one of the kids who would shout that the emperor was naked. But then again, can't argue with taste, so I can only express my own opinion here, which may or may not be similar to what anyone else is thinking.My bottom line here, is that after reading some of the reviews and watching the movie myself, it's obviously not for everyone.
