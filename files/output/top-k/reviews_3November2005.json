This is one of the few films that I've ever actually paid full price to see and then walked out in the middle with zero regrets. I still suffer PTSD from the hour of my life that was stolen from me by this pretentious tripe. I wish I had one of those magic tickets from The Last Action hero so I could enter the movie, tip off the enemy and watch these idiots get massacred by the Japanese. This movie is like Apocalypse Now, if Martin Sheen decided to never get off the boat and instead drove around the river in circles, talking to a young Lawrence Fishburn about the nature of man and what causes him to be violent.

Clarke's novel does not follow every scope of the screenplay, every one shall understand the open and totally interpretation worthy ending of the film like he wants to - you wouldn't come up with two consistent opinions. Is it about spiritualized aliens that keep the humans or about the termination of humans' evolution or has it a religious background - maybe all three aspects together? Without reference to that, '2001 A Space Odyssey' became a milestone of the science fiction genre. Clarke said rightly that those genial special effects could have been made more impressively only 'on location', means directly in outer space. The weightlessness, the workings of the technology, the levitating monolith - it's all a grand, breathtaking symphony for your eyes! After decades of thundering and roaring spaceship engines in a cosmos without sonic comes now an absolute silence into the outer space - perfectly highlighted with the music of Richard Strauss.

Its richness, its tempo, its unpredictability &#150; all adds up to one of the best flicks I have ever seen. The Finn taxi driver (and the entire ride) is an extremely well played part which brings Kaurismäki to mind (and of course, that actor is also found in several Kaurismäki movies). Winona Ryder is excellent as the everyday girl who makes ends meet. The New York ride is also unforgettable for its switch between who is leading the ride and who is riding - fantastic. The ride in Marseille is a socially intriguing dialog. The Rome ride is maybe the weak part of the film but still fantastic for the scenery and the moody pictures. And the Helsinki ride is as stated previously a heartbreaking scene in the coldest and loneliest of winter nights.See this movie &#150; and see it several times!

The animation is not very detail-oriented, but it does a very good job of showing the emotional drama and turmoil of the characters. Bruce Wayne is a man who finds himself torn in two as Batman, he's a fearsome avenger of the night who is always alone and as Bruce Wayne, he's a rich fop and a womanizer who is also always alone. At a party, he thinks back on his first romantic love with a beautiful heiress named Andrea Beaumont and what his life could have been like with her. Andrea's reappearance coincides with the sudden arrival of (another) masked avenger named the Phantasm who is killing the mob bosses of Gotham &#150; and letting Batman take the blame for the murders. The last mob boss, convinced that Batman has gone nuts and is murdering his old compadres, offers the Joker $5,000,000 to kill Batman&#133;an offer that the Joker gleefully accepts. So, you've got Batman battling the Joker, the Phantasm, and the Gotham PD who want to bring him in for murder. On top of that, he's got the emotional turmoil of reliving his first love and the reasons she left him&#133;and the fact that maybe he's tired of being Batman, that he wants a normal life but he still feels driven to work off the guilt of his parent's death and the pressure of the vow he made to them. It all collides at the old Gotham's World Fair in a spectacular animated fight sequence between Batman, the Joker, and the Phantasm. This is an animated film with an unusual amount of emotional weight and resonance that is balanced with a strong dose of action &#150; a gem all the way.
