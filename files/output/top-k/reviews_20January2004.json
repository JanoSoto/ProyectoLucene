The Tango Lesson is nothing if not self-indulgent (as well as self-referential!), yet somehow it all WORKS; even the extremely corny action in the movie shoots that serve to point up Ms. Potter's fictional (or is it real?) frustration with her craft, have some kind of wacky propriety to them in the context of this very unusual story.

I think that the main problem is the over-playing of the Catholic miracle themes in the script, to the point where neither logic or artistic truth is left. There are some good moments of cinema, after all Neil Jordan was the director of 'Mona Lisa', although  in my opinion he is still to get back to the level of that masterpiece of the eighties. Acting is also good, with Ralph Fiennes and Julianne More in two of their best roles. Unfortunately, the religious conflict between carnal and divine love is too much emphasized, to the point that it spoils the whole movie, as happens in my view with many of Graham Greene's novels. It is worth seeing, but it gets only a 6 out of 10 on my personal scale.

This is the film that I'm sure will go on for generations to come, I just showed it to my cousin recently, he's 6, and he just loves it as well. I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl and I just wanted a friend like Sebastian, he was so much fun, even though he's somewhat of a buzz kill, he can really get the party going. Just the whole story is a blast to watch and is so beautiful.Ariel is one of the many princesses of King Triton's mighty kingdom under the sea, but she has a different dream. She goes up constantly to the shore to collect human items and wonders what it would be like to be a human instead of a mermaid. One day when she gets into a nasty fight with her father, Ursella, an evil octopus woman who wants to take over King Triton's kingdom, grants Ariel's wish, but she can only stay human if she can get her crush, Eric, to say her name, sounds easy, right? Well, Ursella takes her voice away, but her intentions are for Ariel to fail and make sure that she takes over the kingdom.The Little Mermaid is such a fun Disney film and is a great treasure of our time. I just love the song Under the sea, it's so much fun to sing and dance too, I admit it, I'm a dork, I still sing and dance to it when I see it.

When he is born he is born a half-breed.  As an adult he has been joined by Abraham Whistler, a vampire hunter, to fight the secret war against the vampire culture.  He hunts the impure-blood vampire Deacon Frost who plans to summon La Magra - the Blood God.Now approaching it's second sequel, this film was a dark surprise to me as I didn't expect too much from it.  The plot sees Blade hunting a dangerous vampire seeing to unleash the power of La Magra and take vampires from their shadows into the real world; we also get a bit of back story as well. This plot gives all the best lines to the vampires and not enough good scenes with Blade himself.  I like Blade for the same reason as I like Batman - they are both messed up superheroes of a sort.  The film tells us how Blade was created but it doesn't delve deep enough for my tastes - only once or twice did I really get a feel for his cruel, darker nature (`Please, I only work for them').  I suppose this was to be expected and it certainly manages the darker tone much better than the Batman films did (in the long run).The action is good although it never really gets to the peak of the opening nightclub scene but is good nonetheless.  Some of the effects in the final fight are a bit lacking and they make the usual horror movie mistake of showing too much and having it be less effective than the build up and suggestion of the monster was.Snipes doesn't exactly display a great emotional range here but he is good in the title role nonetheless.  He is a commanding presence and physically good at the action stuff.  Dorff is pretty good as the main vampire - he is slick and plays it well to be a good representation of the `new breed' as the script requires.  Kristofferson is cool and Wright is sexy while still being a good actress!  The support cast contains no real standouts; Lathan is no more than a cameo and isn't really good while people like Lords only stick in the memory due to their name and not their performance.Overall this is an enjoyably slick vampire\/action movie.  The end product may be more style than substance but the character of Blade is darkly interesting, even if neither Snipes nor the film really give too much away in terms of his inner workings.

The end product may be more style than substance but the character of Blade is darkly interesting, even if neither Snipes nor the film really give too much away in terms of his inner workings.  I have yet to see the sequel but I would hope that it keeps the same dark tone that makes this film stand out.

However, in seeking the domain of the gods he walks into the middle of a three-way battle between the samurai, who want Iron Town's iron deposits; Lady Eboshi who rules Iron Town and is stripping the forest of it's trees to mine it out; and finally the animals and spirits of the forest who must defend their homes, fighting for them is the human Mononoke, a young woman raised by the wolves.It is hard to top Spirited Away, and it is maybe unfair of me to come to this film after I had seen that.  This film cannot match the sheer wonder that I felt when I saw that film but this is still an accomplished film who's story is it's strength and weakness.  The story is a pretty good tale that paints a reasonably good picture of this far off land, although some elements of the plot are a little thinner than I would have liked (namely the samurai).  However it still manages to be engaging despite this - although of course it was never going to be as personal a story as Spirited Away.  The obvious message of peace between man\/industry and nature is more than just the usual one; where Lord Of The Rings was very much nature good, iron bad; this film is a lot more balanced and doesn't look at either badly.While this runs in the background everything is fine but, when the film has to tie everything up it doesn't quite manage it.  The ending is strangely very fast in happening and it ends on a morally good solution but one that I found to be emotionally quite unsatisfying.  I must admit that the final 5 minutes left me feeling a little abandoned by the characters.  However other than this the story is pretty exciting and the two hours go by pretty quickly.The characters are interesting but I never managed to really get behind anyone other than Ashitaka.  Eboshi was too unpleasant to relate to while Mononoke herself was too distant despite the occasional times where I felt for her.  Part of this may be down to the voice cast in the US version. In Spirited Away the US cast fitted the film really well, here it is less the cast.  Crudup is, ironically, one of the best voices in the cast.  I say ironically because I couldn't place him in comparison to the more famous cast.  Driver is OK but her character wasn't.  Danes is pretty good and I felt that her character improved due to her good voice work.  Anderson was miscast and her voice simply didn't fit her character at all (even with the echo added).  Thornton was good for the more comedic role but slightly took away from the dramatic impact of the samurai.  Pinkett-Smith brings her attitude to the role well and both she and Keith David are funny.Visually it is as impressive as you would expect from Miyazaki.  It all looks great, the whole land is filled with detail and it flows so freely. The spirits and gods are imaginative and very well drawn and the people show up just how basic stuff like Pokemon really is!

Emillio Estevez does not deliver an Oscar-worthy performance here, but all movie producers out there aren't concerned with such achievements. In my humble opinion, all movies are out there to do one of three things. They either want to touch you, entertain you, or make you think. Some aspire you to do a combination of these three goals, while others don't seem to have any goal whatsoever. This one does; it entertains and it endeavors to make you think. While there is a bit of tongue-in-cheek delivery, it isstill a serious sci-fi\/thriller, and should be viewed as such.The effects are stunning, and the direction is solid, as is the story line. The dialog is what makes this movie a bit campy at times, but if you can't have fun, then why play the game? Honestly, I had hoped that Mick Jagger would make a stronger villain than he does here, but all in all to have had no experience, he was NOT as bad as some critics claim. Personally, I found the story to be quite compelling, and there are some good solid elements here. And while this is not the most intelligent movie I've ever seen, it is quite entertaining, with a good basic premise, and some decent action.

The cast is amazing(Gary Oldman is my favorite actor)Anthony Hopkins, Ray Liotta Julianne Moore, et al. I am tired of hearing people whine about Foster, as she would neither make or break any movie in my view.Julianne was not only an acceptable replacement, she was better in the role of Starling. Also, for those of you who p**s and moan about the gore, consider this The title character is a cannibal, and the movie had a provocative script. A slasher film usually has bad writing, directing, and acting, and thus uses blood and guts as its only means of keeping an audience. On the other hand,when a movie(ala Hannibal) has all the goods, the brutality is a hell of alot more intense and realistic. I saw this on its opening weekend, and I ofcourse own the dvd. When, less than 2 years later, Red Dragon was released, I saw it and was thoroughly DISAPPOINTED! I wish Dr. Lecter would feed Brett Ratner's face to dogs, sautee his brain in butter, shallots, and caperberries, then throw his remains in a pit of wild pigs. Bret Ratboy should stick to Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker movies. Anyway, see Hannibal. If you did, see it again.

'Carrie' has a few Hitchcock touches to be sure (mainly in the score which mimics 'Psycho'), but nowhere near as much as 'Sisters' or 'Dressed To Kill'. In several sequences I was more reminded of Dario Argento, but 'Carrie' has a stronger narrative than most of Argento's work. One thing that struck me on re-watching this (for the umpteenth time) is that like Argento, De Palma is often regarded as a cold director more interested in visuals and fancy shots than acting, but the main thing that makes 'Carrie' work is the terrific performance he managed to coax out of Sissy Spacek. Spacek had already given an impressive turn in 'Badlands' a few years earlier but this role is what really launched her career. It also did a lot of good for Stephen King! I would say that 'Carrie' ties with Kubrick's 'The Shining' and Cronenberg's 'The Dead Zone' as the most satisfying King adaptations to date. While Spacek all but steals the movie Piper Laurie is also very good as Carrie's fanatical Mom, in an over the top performance which for me really works. The cast is full of young actors many unknowns who went on to greater success, like Travolta and Nancy Allen (interestingly enough later teamed up by De Palma in his underrated 'Blow Out'), Amy Irving and P.J. Soles, who appeared in another influential 70s horror classic 'Halloween' not long after this. I also enjoyed seeing the great character actor Sydney Lassick in a supporting role as a sarcastic teacher. Lassick played Charlie Cheswick in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' and I always get a kick out of seeing him on screen. (Sadly he died last year with little fanfare). De Palma is still one of the most underrated name Hollywood directors. His movies have been pretty disappointing for the last ten years or so, but when he was good he was REALLY good, and 'Carrie' is testament to that.
