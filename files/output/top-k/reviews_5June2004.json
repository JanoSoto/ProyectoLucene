One thing I did not notice before is that the son is 35 years old.  I always thought he was younger. To me that changes his character and the way I look at him.  He is way too old to act the way he did. And I believe his mother babied him too much and made excuses for him. I wonder if that is also a lesson to be had. He has a wife who works like a dog a young son and a kid on the way and he  acts like a teenager. He and the mother made me angry this time around. Another thing is the Diana Sands character,  she is delightful. I think she was right in being very angry with her brother, I wanted to kill him.  I loved her independence.  It is a shame Diana Sands died so young,  what a great loss. It was very interesting to see the neighborhood welcoming  idiot.  I know this happens,  but I feel it is less subtle in real life.  The real estate companies do all the dirty work for the white neighbors by not even showing black people houses in the white neighborhoods.  The revival of the Broadway play with P Diddy has John Fieldler in it too I believe.  This is a great movie to be seen by all.

Young children don't really know why we have Christmas, and this movie gives it a quirky twist. Zero is my favorite character. This ghost-dog, brings so much reality to the screen for those of us who need something real. It sounds funny saying a ghost-dog gives something 'reality.' But I feel that it really does. I really do wish that they made more movies like that now-days. But i have no doubt that any movie will ever be as great as The Nightmare Before Christmas. There is no way to really explain how this movie is great, it just is! Its so, just, classic, its unreal.

Once again Shirley Maclaine and Jack Lemmon are teamed up romantically - she playing the title character, a Parisian prostitute, and he a policeman. In this particular section of Paris, the prostitutes, pimps, and policemen are all in league with each other - the girls work the streets, the pimps get the money from the girls, and the policemen get paid by the pimps. Everyone looks the other way - until Lemmon comes along.Unfortunately after Lemmon raids the Parisian neighborhood, he loses his job. He falls in love with Irma and becomes her protector, or pimp. Once again we see Lemmon playing a nice guy who puts up a front of dishonesty so he can protect the woman he loves. He has to resort to working in the meat market during the day while Irma sleeps and pretending to be a wealthy Englishman, Lord X, in order for other men not to have sex with her. Sounds muddled? You bet it is!However, the story did have its moments. Jack was funny as always playing the policeman-turned-pimp Nestor Patou and the dual role as Lord X. He did some fantastic physical comedy, such as the scene where he beats up Irma's pimp in the bistro. Maclaine was sweet, cute, and sexy as Irma. Notice how she predominantly wears green in the movie (green with envy).There were a couple of sexy scenes, like the one where Patou first goes to Irma's apartment and she's watching him undress while she smokes a cigarette in bed, or when Irma's telling Lord X a fantasy about a harem in Baghdad. Other than that, it was an okay movie, average. I was surprised to see an unwed pregnant character in a movie that was made in 1963, when it was still unheard of. I'm sure this movie must have been quite racy and provocative in its day. This movie was a bit overlong as well.Want to see a far better Maclaine\/Lemmon\/Wilder comedy?

The first time I watched this flick a year or two ago I bashed it, and considered it one of the worst films I have ever seen. I basically rewatched it because I heard that the second film, Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, was an improvement but I felt it was nessesary for me to refresh myself with the Potter universe before delving into that film. Watching it a second time, I don't consider it one of the worst films I have ever seen, just a flawed and boring one.The problem with this film is that it spends no time with furthuring the plot, not at least until the last forty minutes or so. Until then the audience is subjected to introducing every single minute detail of this Hogwarts school. The film does this by simply throwing little scenes together where some magical stuff happens and they expect any of us watching to gaze and wonder in awe about this magic. I'm sure people who read the books are sitting there, recognizing this scene and that scene from what they have read and are having a jolly old time. I sit there and wonder what this has to do with the plot and why I should care. A movie has the problem that it expects everyone to have read the book, and a movie can't do that. That is the fatal flaw of this film.Other than that, the film is full of decent performances by the kids, sometimes good, sometimes their lack of acting made me want to cringe. The supporting cast, made up of probably every character actor in England, are well played and enjoyable to watch, especially Alan Rickman who with that black wig on looks like the lead singer of Nine Inch Nails. The film also has lavish sets, some both great and horrid special FX, and yet another fantastic score by John Williams (the man can do no wrong).So in the end, if you love the books memorized every page, go see this, you'll enjoy it. If you just want to watch the movies, skip this flick and see The Chamber of Secrets, it's much better, it actually has a plot.

There was nothing in this film for me to like. It seemed like a stupid idea of some amateurs, aiming to make a film that would be vulgar, violent, raw and stupid in the extend that wasn't done before. Strangely and to my disappointment this movie seems to have a favorable audience. I won't even try to understand why is that. It is beyond my power to do anything about it, other than to state my opinion, to have illusions of a clear conscience. The film is a rough and clumpsy needlework of scenes, that while they follow a timeline, seem to lead nowhere, other than the next violent act, gruesome killing or an exchange of gunshots. Somewhre in between the main character is raving about his theories on contemporary life style and culture, - a lot of boring stuff that you could have heard from any drunk if you ask me - and then goes on to the next murder followed by the camera crew which seem to approve and even help him in his criminal activities. So much for the plot.Since the whole thing is shot from a hand held camera, there is no point in talking about photography or a soundtrack. There was no provision as to those. As for the secondary characters, they come and go serving little or no purpose, as the film moves to a pointless -yet cliché- ending.I have read through other people's comments, who said they laughed many times during the movie. I didn't. I was bored yes, disgusted yes, but amused NO. Even if there was a funny part in this movie, it would be overshadowed by all the rest low life stuff, so I could not have noticed it...And the truth is after watching the movie, I could not feel like laughing for anything at all. In the end you get nothing out of this film, not a moment of emotional movement, you surely cannot sympathies with the serial killer or his crew, you cannot learn anything from the story and you surely cannot recommend it to your friends...Well not your real -and in right state of mind- friends anyway. On the other hand, the film TAKES things from you. Things like your sense of humor (definately), your sensitive attitude towards watching lifes being taken wrongfully, your mental balance (very likely)...I felt like something died inside me watching the movie and I fear that movies like these have their share of responsibility in making people a little more accepting and tolerant towards the ruthless taking of lives.The plain fact is shooting a movie that emphasizes on killings and violence in many other forms, is just wrong in so many ways. Bottom line the movie is garbage. It sadly lowers our expectations of modern filming achievements. I am very sorry to have watched it and it does not deserve the high rating it's got here.

The film is a rough and clumpsy needlework of scenes, that while they follow a timeline, seem to lead nowhere, other than the next violent act, gruesome killing or an exchange of gunshots. Somewhre in between the main character is raving about his theories on contemporary life style and culture, - a lot of boring stuff that you could have heard from any drunk if you ask me - and then goes on to the next murder followed by the camera crew which seem to approve and even help him in his criminal activities. So much for the plot.Since the whole thing is shot from a hand held camera, there is no point in talking about photography or a soundtrack. There was no provision as to those. As for the secondary characters, they come and go serving little or no purpose, as the film moves to a pointless -yet cliché- ending.I have read through other people's comments, who said they laughed many times during the movie. I didn't. I was bored yes, disgusted yes, but amused NO. Even if there was a funny part in this movie, it would be overshadowed by all the rest low life stuff, so I could not have noticed it...And the truth is after watching the movie, I could not feel like laughing for anything at all. In the end you get nothing out of this film, not a moment of emotional movement, you surely cannot sympathies with the serial killer or his crew, you cannot learn anything from the story and you surely cannot recommend it to your friends...Well not your real -and in right state of mind- friends anyway. On the other hand, the film TAKES things from you. Things like your sense of humor (definately), your sensitive attitude towards watching lifes being taken wrongfully, your mental balance (very likely)...I felt like something died inside me watching the movie and I fear that movies like these have their share of responsibility in making people a little more accepting and tolerant towards the ruthless taking of lives.The plain fact is shooting a movie that emphasizes on killings and violence in many other forms, is just wrong in so many ways. Bottom line the movie is garbage. It sadly lowers our expectations of modern filming achievements. I am very sorry to have watched it and it does not deserve the high rating it's got here.

Of course, taste varies (which probably answers the rhetoric question I just posed). 15\/15-Death Scenes All the death scenes are ingenious, original, well-made, different from one another and surely not gratuitous.

A combination of Tom Hanks, Jude Law, Sam Mendes and clever enticing trailers persuaded me I should watch it at the cinema. I did so and came away reasonably entertained. A decent atmospheric movie, captured the times wonderfully, it looked so good on a big screen.Having just seen it again for a second time on TV I can't believe I was so taken in. What is it all about? American fealgood?A ruthless, psychopathic, low life, gangster hit man? Hang on a bit now, we are talking Tom Hanks here. We can't have that! We all know Tom is a good guy. A family man. An all American guy but in this case, a tad emotionally suppressed, not unlike the crew cut nutter in American Beauty. In true Hollywood style there is an excruciatingly sentimental attempt to re-write a violent era of American history. Sullivan, a perpetrator of violence for profit, is portrayed as a victim. OK, in the past, he has had to murder lots of low life's to keep his family in fried chicken but, deep down, all he wants to do is help the poor dirt farmers? He's Robin Hood at heart. Good old Tom. The solid Irish guy Rooney does the decent thing by holding his hands up and saying I'm glad it's you. I ask you, how on earth could any decent Irish American expect Paul Newman to endure anything less than such a dignified death. What a great guy! Even Nitti, the top anti social degenerate, is portrayed as a kindly sage. Come off it! What a load of (expletive).The ending, reminiscent of the Superman orphan scenario, goes a little way to redeeming the film, but a high price is paid for getting there.I like Tom Hanks. He's a fine actor, never less so than in the Green mile, but if he carries on like this he will go down as some kind of John Wayne. Perhaps he's happy with that?It's a five because it looks good.

They're pretty accurate, except for some of the metaphysical rambles.Simply put, this is the best baseball movie ever. If you are a baseball fan, a true baseball fan that loves the atmosphere of the game and understands baseball humor and lingo, then you will love this movie. It's that simple. And it's that good. If you are watching this movie to see a romantic comedy, you're just not going to get it. This is the most realistic portrayal of baseball life that I have ever seen, including the humor, sex, frustration, and warts of being a professional ballplayer. Every actor and actress is perfect in their roles. While Annie's character isn't very believable, it's absolutely necessary to the story in a metaphorical sense, and played brilliantly by Sarandon. Tim Robbins, although I never pictured him as a baseball player before, ended up being the perfect casting choice. His facial expressions throughout the movie and acting skills were hilarious! And although I rate Dances With Wolves a hair higher (they're both 10's), I still consider this as Costner's best performance. When I think of Costner, I think of Bull Durham. Rarely is a movie and an actor so perfectly matched.The movie is filled with hysterical anecdotes and speeches. Things that you will find yourself saying one day to your baseball fan buddies, and everyone will smile and know you watched Bull Durham. The conversation on the mound among the players and the coach cracks me up just thinking about it. Again, unless you understand baseball, all these little hysterical nuggets will just fly over your head.
