In Scream 2, the characters have seen a movie about the first killings, and are caught once again in a slasher fantasy. Like all sequels, this one is a see-through endeavor to cash in on the original, but, naturally, it knows it is, and features its own educated discourse on sequels. The finding is that a mere handful of sequels have been as good as the originals; the characters particularly like Aliens and The Godfather Part II. As for Scream 2, it's, well, about as good as the original. Both movies use a narrative contraption for making the audience flinch and gasp and grasp their pillows. The shocks this time come from a mad slasher in an oddly unsettling Halloween ghost mask, who ambushes a slew of college freshmen who lived through the initial murders. The killer is also concerned with such hangers-on as a TV newsman and a physically and emotionally wounded former deputy sheriff.Kevin Williamson's basis this time is that violence is swiftly rendered into commercial ritual by the media Because he is doing that very thing in Scream 2, there are paradoxes within paradoxes here. The movie is so expressive about what it's doing, in fact, that you can't knock it on that basis because it gets there first. Do movies prompt people to commit violent acts? Scream 2 seemed to think so, or is that a mocking position, to make the movie more effective? Have movies like this, by enlightening its audience to the traditions and ridiculous banalities of horror films, pacified their violence and make them less apt to be persuaded by the violence? Now there's an interesting thought.The movie's brilliant beginning sequence involves a theatrical premiere of Stab, a movie based on the killings in the first film, and at the screening two audience members are, well, see for yourself. Soon the slasher has moved to a neighboring campus, where survivors including Sidney Prescott are students, and the wounded Deputy Riley has found a job as a security guard. Also loitering is TV newswoman Gale Weathers, who---this is priceless satire---covered the first murders and wrote a best-seller about them that became Stab and has thus influenced the new murders. Also brooding around is Cotton, accused by Gale in the first film but found innocent, and now urging a second helping of his 15 minutes of fame. There is no way to predict the identity of the killer, and everyone who acts leery is (almost) certain to be innocent.The Williamson screenplay employs the horror scaffold as a rocket platform for considerable parody. I'd like to have seen him work on a more serious film. When Courteney Cox, playing the TV newswoman, is asked about her nude photos on the Internet, she replies, It was just my head. It was Jennifer Aniston's body. And a killer says he wants to be caught, because he's already determined his plan of action The movies made me do it, he'll proclaim, and he plans to have Bob Dole as a witness for the defense. I'll get Cochran! he boasts. The Christian Coalition will pay for my defense! Wes Craven was made to direct the Scream films. One of the most productive of horror filmmakers, he made The Hills Have Eyes and the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and was already headed in the same metatextual trajectory as Williamson when he wrote and directed Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994, which took his own series' blurring of reality and nightmares to a new extreme, Freddy crossing over to attack the filmmakers in the real world. There's a difference here in the Scream movies where an all-new slasher killer causes the post-modern irony to be more disguised, and what might be the most ironic thing about these ever more ironic movies is that it resuscitated the entire genre.

They plot a revenge job which goes well, but are then blackmailed by a shadowy figure, Keyser Söze, into hijacking a big drugs buy. Is Söze for real, and if so, what is his secret agenda ?In my view, The Usual Suspects is the best crime thriller of the nineties and one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Perhaps what's most astonishing about it is the confidence and style of director Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie, both of whom had only made one feature film before (the low budget Public Access). The movie was made independently and for pretty meagre money but looks sensational, has a deliciously harebrained mind-bending plot, truckloads of fancy-pants dialogue (Now you talk to me, or that precious immunity they seem so fit to grant you won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on.), an elegant and stylish atmosphere, and a payoff of such witty proportions that I guarantee you will never forget it. Most movies, if they're well made, have maybe two or three really interesting characters in them - this one has at least eight, and every crazy situation they're thrown into brings out all of their intriguing facets. Why did Keeton reform ? Who is Kobayashi, and does he even exist ? Why is McManus such a hothead ? What is Fenster saying ? And of course, is Verbal really who we think he is ? These characters dance around each other in such variable and complex circles that just when you think you've got a handle on things the movie pulls the rug out from under you again. Repeated viewings only enhance the delicious enjoyment of this, and the entire cast seem to peg exactly the tone Singer is going for. Spacey is simply unforgettable (watch his eyes as he reads the cue card in the lineup) and won an Academy Award, Byrne is a supercool bad apple, Del Toro gives an amazing, career-making, what-in-the-hell-was-that physical performance, and Palminteri takes the standard cop exposition part and revs it up so high it shifts the entire movie up a gear. Another crucial element is the combination of the equally brilliant score and editing, both by John Ottman. The link between music and cutting is vital in any film, and how many professional movies have it done by the same person (aside from Ottman's work with Singer, John Carpenter's Assault On Precinct 13 is the only other example I can think of). There is a delicious tap-tap-tap suspense score with heavy strings which ticks along like a pressure cooker, and pares everything to the tense minimum; the action scenes are taut and fast, and Ottman carefully reserves a few choice moments to take his time, like the scene where Verbal shoots the jewel dealer. The movie is a textbook in good editing for pacing, atmosphere and suspense. There are some films which just seem to gel together seamlessly and this is one - it's a gleefully evil flick, hand crafted with loving care by and for those who love crime stories and gangster pictures. McQuarrie (who was twenty-seven) deservedly won an Academy Award for his script; Singer (a ripe old thirty) should have won as well - the two have since teamed again on Valkyrie.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"20 May 2010","score":"","review":" Harold & Maude directed by Hal Ashby and the written by Colin Higgins tells the story of the young Harold (Bud Cort) and Maude the spontaneous and elderly woman played by Ruth Gordon. The story starts with a confused 19 year old Harold and his various acts of fake suicides to catch his mother's attention with an overall obsession with death. As with Maude however, a 79 year old woman who seems spontaneous, doing whatever she pleases, seems to have a view of all people should live to 80 and that should be it. Whereas the characters seem to be a bit unique in their own ways the plot seems to carry that throughout the film. The use of narrative elements, film maker's craft, and acting allows for this film to be truly phenomenal.             The narrative elements in this film produce a stable structure for the rest of the film to build off. The movie itself takes place in an area around the San Francisco Bay; this can be seen through various screen shots of the bay and the cliffs overlooking the ocean. The viewer can see that much of Harold and Maude's time is spent in Maude's home composed of a Pullman car when Harold enters her house for the first time. The conflict can be seen through mostly his mother. Harold's mother, Mrs. Chasen, is obviously the antagonist in the story she does not seem to pay her son enough attention and in doing so he fakes suicide to get some. Eventually she gets sick of his unusual acts and tells him it's time now to put away childish things&#x85;time for you to get married. Whereas the conflict seems to be his mother trying to get him to marry the plot seems to be him continuing to commit fake suicides and falling in love with Maude. Even with all of these very unusual events going on I was able to pull an overall theme out from all the controversy. Maude says that she likes to watch things grow&#x85;cycle of life. Both Maude and Harold seem to have fascinations with death so it would only seem right that one theme would be about the cycle of life. The film maker's craft adds to the content to make the movie one worth watching. Editing seems to be one element that stood out the most to me in this film. The director did a great job cutting in and out of shots to make things appear to happen that did not. We can see Harold create this mock immolation of his own death. To the viewer it almost seems evident that it is actually Harold, but as the scene continues Harold comes into the picture and its impressive how the director is able to confuse not only the other characters in the scene but the viewer as well. SPOILER ALERT Another example of this in genius editing by the director is another fake suicide we see Harold attempt when he runs his car off the ledge it does not seem reasonable that Harold lived through it, but we are again fooled by this amazing editing skills by the director. Another element that the director does a good job showing is the realism of the suicides. It is obvious to me that he put a lot of time into making these scene seem so real. We see Harold cut his arm off and blood comes out it looks so real and the viewer is fooled just like the date in the scene. The realism of the fake deaths put on by Harold is so well composed by the director it helps this movie in being as incredible as it is. The acting is also unique and played very well within the film. All of Harold's acts of faking suicide are very well played out. The first scene when he pretends to commit suicide by hanging himself could not have been played any better. I was almost appalled by the start of the story thinking for sure that this character was already dead. The believability of Harold's fake deaths' is amazing it was hard for me at times not to think that Harold was dead even after the second and third times of seeing him fake them. When he is pretending to be drowned in the pool this is just another example of how well the acting in this scene is. When we meet Maude we are able to see how well Ruth Gordon plays her part. Maude is sitting eating an apple during a funeral of someone she did not know either. Ruth Gordon does a good job at perceiving a character that seems to know what she wants and a very spontaneous personality. Not only are the narrative elements, filmmaker craft, and acting spectacular in this film it does however shed a bit of humor. The scene that takes place between these two intervals is shocking, very unexpected, and unconventional. When I combine these three descriptions together and the circumstance I find this part of the movie to be very humorous. Other times in the film that seem humorous occur not only when people are talking but just screen shots as well. His mom and his date come out to see his Jaguar, but it has been remodeled and the expression on his mother's face leave myself laughing. Overall this film seems to have all the components to being great and I myself believe that that is an understatement.  ","genre":null},{"date":"20 May 2010","score":"","review":" Harold & Maude directed by Hal Ashby and the written by Colin Higgins tells the story of the young Harold (Bud Cort) and Maude the spontaneous and elderly woman played by Ruth Gordon.

The story starts with a confused 19 year old Harold and his various acts of fake suicides to catch his mother's attention with an overall obsession with death. As with Maude however, a 79 year old woman who seems spontaneous, doing whatever she pleases, seems to have a view of all people should live to 80 and that should be it. Whereas the characters seem to be a bit unique in their own ways the plot seems to carry that throughout the film. The use of narrative elements, film maker's craft, and acting allows for this film to be truly phenomenal.             The narrative elements in this film produce a stable structure for the rest of the film to build off. The movie itself takes place in an area around the San Francisco Bay; this can be seen through various screen shots of the bay and the cliffs overlooking the ocean. The viewer can see that much of Harold and Maude's time is spent in Maude's home composed of a Pullman car when Harold enters her house for the first time. The conflict can be seen through mostly his mother. Harold's mother, Mrs. Chasen, is obviously the antagonist in the story she does not seem to pay her son enough attention and in doing so he fakes suicide to get some. Eventually she gets sick of his unusual acts and tells him it's time now to put away childish things&#x85;time for you to get married. Whereas the conflict seems to be his mother trying to get him to marry the plot seems to be him continuing to commit fake suicides and falling in love with Maude. Even with all of these very unusual events going on I was able to pull an overall theme out from all the controversy. Maude says that she likes to watch things grow&#x85;cycle of life. Both Maude and Harold seem to have fascinations with death so it would only seem right that one theme would be about the cycle of life. The film maker's craft adds to the content to make the movie one worth watching. Editing seems to be one element that stood out the most to me in this film. The director did a great job cutting in and out of shots to make things appear to happen that did not. We can see Harold create this mock immolation of his own death. To the viewer it almost seems evident that it is actually Harold, but as the scene continues Harold comes into the picture and its impressive how the director is able to confuse not only the other characters in the scene but the viewer as well. SPOILER ALERT Another example of this in genius editing by the director is another fake suicide we see Harold attempt when he runs his car off the ledge it does not seem reasonable that Harold lived through it, but we are again fooled by this amazing editing skills by the director. Another element that the director does a good job showing is the realism of the suicides. It is obvious to me that he put a lot of time into making these scene seem so real. We see Harold cut his arm off and blood comes out it looks so real and the viewer is fooled just like the date in the scene. The realism of the fake deaths put on by Harold is so well composed by the director it helps this movie in being as incredible as it is. The acting is also unique and played very well within the film. All of Harold's acts of faking suicide are very well played out. The first scene when he pretends to commit suicide by hanging himself could not have been played any better. I was almost appalled by the start of the story thinking for sure that this character was already dead. The believability of Harold's fake deaths' is amazing it was hard for me at times not to think that Harold was dead even after the second and third times of seeing him fake them. When he is pretending to be drowned in the pool this is just another example of how well the acting in this scene is. When we meet Maude we are able to see how well Ruth Gordon plays her part. Maude is sitting eating an apple during a funeral of someone she did not know either. Ruth Gordon does a good job at perceiving a character that seems to know what she wants and a very spontaneous personality. Not only are the narrative elements, filmmaker craft, and acting spectacular in this film it does however shed a bit of humor.

But most of the times it's a shocking thing to see one and think about what happened and why happened and who got injured or died. And of course we know that there are people who likes to live fast, die young, leave themselves a beautiful corpse quoting James Dean. In David Cronenberg's film Crash we see a different kind of people those who like to get involved in car crashes and\/or have sexual relations after a car crash or inside of a damaged car. Here, James Ballard (James Spader) is a film director who got involved in a fatal car crash that killed a man and injured a woman, Helen (Holly Hunter) and they both start a strange relationship (I don't know if I can say if they're friends, lovers or something similar). He is married with Catherine Ballard (Deborah Kara Unger) but here's another awkward thing between these couple they're unfaithful to each other and still they don't find anything wrong with that. And more, they find this factor something more exciting to their relationship. Helen presents to James a different world when people enjoy re-enactments of famous car crashes (such as James Dean and Jayne Mansfield accidents). Vaughan (Elias Koteas) is the leader of a group who enjoys these re-enactments and he present these famous accidents along with some stunts. Serious things, they smash one car against another to feel more live, or sexually excited. Vaughan introduces James into this new world where there's no limits, everything is allowed including induce an accident in a highway filled with another cars (by the way James's wife is included in these accidents); plan re-enactments; switch sexual partners and other bizarre things.An interesting point in this film is that there's no limit of what characters want sexually from each other here. Vaughan is sexually attracted by James and they have their moment together and so the female characters with each other. They got so involved in share their feelings, their emotions, their sexuality, that they don't stop what they're doing and they go along. And yet no one can label these characters as gay, bisexual or lesbian, no, they're only share an experience. This might work for some viewers. In fact the whole movie might work well for very few people. It's a deep film about the complexities of the human mind, looks very much like The Silence of the Lambs (I choose compare this films because both are stories of people you don't see everyday and their strange and peculiar worlds. Besides that it's almost impossible compare these two films). All characters are sick people but they just don't know that and the more danger they get, more closer to death they get the more they liked it, the more closer they get to an orgasm or a different sensation. It's very similar to the movies featuring a psycho killer that feels pleasure in what he does and he can't stop doing it because he feels better this way. Vaughan is a dangerous psycho killer in a certain way. Those re-enactments are dangerous things and he jumps in the car knowing that he might die by crashing with another car, face to face with death but after the crash he only lift his hand to the audience and says And that's how James Dean entered to immortality and everyone is applauding. For the common viewer it's difficult to see some of the images (more about sex and not the car crashes), and even to follow Cronenberg or J.G.Ballard's idea (who wrote the book). Sometimes it might look a shallow and pointless movie but it has something more, something appealing for those who like twisted obsessions, or for those who might feel that the characters behavior is a normal thing. Once again another great and controversial work from David Cronenberg. Good performances here too (most notable Elias Koteas for his terrifying portrayal of a strange person and James Spader). Such an unforgettable movie but don't get confused with Crash (2004) directed by Paul Haggis. Lucky that both movies received an subtitle in my country so it's almost difficult to confuse them Cronenberg's was released under the name of Crash - Strange Pleasures and Haggis's Crash - Living on the Edge.

You either love him or you hate him; there is rarely an in-between. I personally love his work (most of it), which is what saddens me a bit about 'Blue Velvet'. This is one of those films that is lauded above all his other work as being the best of the best, but it struck me a little cold. The script is flawless (I love the ambiguities that lie within Lynch's work) and the direction, pace and mood acquired is effortlessly captivating, but the film falls short in a very central area; the acting.Don't pelt me with stones just yet.The film revolves around Jeffrey Beaumont, a young man who returns to his hometown after his father falls ill suddenly. Upon his return he finds a severed ear in a field and his journey then begins. With local high school girl Sandy (whose father happens to be the Detective Jeffrey shows the ear to) Jeffrey decides to try and uncover the mystery behind the ear, and this attempt brings him into the lives of quite a few interesting people. First there is Dorothy Vallens, a beautiful woman who is victim to a strange and violent man named Frank Booth; and sliding into their lives, Jeffrey finds himself in desperate need for help as he watches his life slide further and further towards its end.Lynch, like I mentioned, has a unique style of direction. If you are familiar with 'Eraserhead' or 'Mulholland Drive' then you already know how this film is going to progress. He allows the scenes to move at their own pace, manipulating them just slightly. This may come off to some as dry or even stale, but this is Lynch's way of using everything at his disposal to create a mood, an air within each scene.I have no problem with this.The script is also brilliantly done. The slow progression of junior detective is effective and consuming as we anticipate how things are going to turn out for Jeffrey. We are interested in his relationship with Dorothy, and especially Sandy. We want to know how these two women are going to affect the outcome of his life, and we are terrified at the revelations about to be revealed by the repulsive Frank Booth.I adore these aspects of the film.Like I mentioned, the only fault I have with 'Blue Velvet' is the acting, and not as a whole but in parts. I'll start with the good. Isabella Rossellini is a stunning woman who really uses everything within her to create a woman of believable desperation. She is conflicted in every scene, and this is scene marvelously. We can see each fragment of her dissension into chaos. Laura Dern is even more splendid. She delivers such a richly honest performance as young Sandy, fascinated by each new discovery, no matter how terrifying it winds up being for her. But as great as these two actresses are, the film starts to crumble when left up to the men. Dennis Hopper (who actually received praise for his performance) is just one gigantic gimmick. He never really transcends his characters stereotypes. He's a crazy psychopath, nothing more. He delivered (the same year) a wonderfully controlled performance in 'Hoosiers' that I am disappointed he wasn't able to control this a little more. That said, he is still much more interesting than Kyle MacLachlan who may very well be the most boring actor since Keanu Reeves. I just really wish that someone, anyone else would have landed this role. MacLachlan just killed the high the film as a whole effectively sets.All this said, I am fond of this film. It has so much going for it, and Lynch is just such a unique and original director who always stays true to himself. There are very few films like this one, and the ones that come close are also directed by Lynch.

The characters, atmosphere and humour that was evident in the movie was very realistic. The movie intended to present a picture of high school student rivalries and how peer pressures can lead to ones isolation from others. In the second half the subject of 'teenage suicide' is explored as the students of Westerburg High are under the misunderstanding regarding deaths of fellow students. However I don't think the theme was explored in a mature manner. Treating it with a houmouristic tone was not suitable. It is a serious issue and to present it in this manner was totally absurd. Keeping that to aside the director Micheal Lehman has done a good job as a director. His camera angles and style of direction seem straight out of a horror movie.

I was not surprised by the high number of negative comments. In fact, I was pleased to know that most people negatively valued this movie. This made me laugh, because it reinforced what I already knew this excellent movie can not be properly appreciated if you do not have imagination, some culture, a brain and an open mind. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), many people lack the above mentioned requirements. It is indeed a movie for a minority. 1. The Main Character is great Here, we have a cynical and immoral book dealer (Johnny Depp), who starts the movie as a money-hungry materialistic mercenary, and ends up being a spiritual believer ready to risk his life in an uncertain adventure with an even more uncertain ending. The man who Boris Balkan trusts at the beginning of the movie because he can be bought with cash, ends up telling his boss Balkan that the Engravings are worth much more than money. The one who undertakes a journey of transformation from the material to the spiritual is Dean Corso. He is the chosen one, aided by fate (and green eyes, of course). He crosses indeed all the gates and lives a truly amazing rite of passage that leads to freedom and the acceptation of the supernatural. 2. The support Characters are impressive - The ambiguous Spanish twin brothers, the Ceniza Brothers, are magnificent. The apparently harmless brothers, always sarcastic and mysterious, convey very well the feeling that they do know something that you don't (it proves to be true in the end). They are deliciously and childishly malevolent and mischievous. - Victor Fargas, the Old Portuguese collector, is a great example of decadence, an old dinosaur who knows there is no place for him in this world, very much similar to the decadent intellectuals described by Edgar Allan Poe in his novels. He is very much like Roderick Usher. - Boris Balkan is the fanatical believer, utterly convinced that he is the only one, the chosen one to decipher the mystery and take the road that leads to equality with god. He stops at nothing to get what he wants and is a constant and menacing presence and influence. - Liana Telfer\/Saint Martin is great. Attractive, seductive, fishy, evil, immoral, manipulative bitch. - The Baroness Frieda Kessler, aristocratic, eccentric, probably lesbian, infatuated with the devil - Green Eyes, the beautiful Emmanuelle Seignier, is a profoundly disturbing character. She is the incarnation of Johnny Depp's fate, and incarnation of the devil, a beautiful succubus who aids Depp in his journey of self-discovery , change and transformation and actually chooses him to be her partner. The scene in which they make love in front of the burning castle is amazing. She is so beautiful, mysterious and captivating that the movie is worth watching only for her presence. It is wonderful when she watches and enjoys herself with a mischievous smile when Depp violently kills the black albino.The end of the movie is good, as it is an open end, suggestive and full of possibilities. When we see the light in the castle, we know that Depp is going to accomplish what Balkan failed. What did he accomplish? Well, he is going to take the road that leads to equality what god. No less¡¡¡¡¡ This end is wonderful, because it leaves all to our imagination. Therefore, those lacking imagination will hate it, because they will not see anything at all but frustration. This end is an intellectual end, an open end for those able to appreciate the full extent and implications of the movie. So, what's this movie about? This movie is about the transformation of an upper middle class materialistic person into an adventurer and spiritual believer. Johny Depp ends up being very much like his hated boss, Boris Balkan. The only difference is that Balkan was always a believer and a fanatical adept. But the devil clearly prefers those who are converted. What is more attractive? A man who has always been a Saint (or a devil), or a man who is a sinner and ends up being a Saint (or a devil) after a process of self transformation and a leap of faith? Clearly, the devil preferred Depp, the materialistic unbeliever that quickly transforms himself, and crosses all the gates. In a very short time, Dean Corso, the materialistic unbeliever who sleeps out of boredom at a conference about the devil and can be bought with cash and that only believes in his percentage grows accustomed with the supernatural and accepts it(green eyes), murders two people not for material profit but for spiritual knowledge and ends up daring to risk his life(just like Balkan) in a very uncertain but hauntingly beautiful end. Finally, it was him who dared to take the road that leads to equality with god. And after seeing the dazzling light in the castle, at the final scene, I daresay he accomplished what Balkan failed. This movie is a movie about inverse moral. We are used to see in movies bad guys who in the end turn up to be the good guys. However, here, the process is more complicated and malevolent. This is an inverse process of conversion. We have watched without knowing it what for the devil would be the process of choosing, grooming and rewarding a promising new adept, and rewarding him with the ultimate reward equality with god. No less. This is a movie for intelligent people. By the way, the devil was always in plain sight, which is an irony it was the girl, and she chose to reward Depp instead of Balkan. Balkan was already a believer, and Depp wasn't at first.

Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) comes home from college to visit his sick and bed-ridden father who had a tragic accident. Having made a startling discovery (to be more exact, a human ear lying in the grass), out of sheer boredom and driven by passion for adventure Jeffrey decides to proceed with this mystery and gets involved with a night-club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) living in a shabby apartment building, which is somewhat incongruous to the sleepy suburban paradise of Lumberton. Dorothy, a queer mixture, of damsel in distress and femme fatale, is in a middle of a life and death situation involving her husband and son. She is subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of violence by a psychopathic man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) and his demented associates. Jeffrey's further investigation reveals that one of the police detectives is also involved in the criminal activities of the gang, and that means that he will have to deal with these people using his own resources. He confides in Sandy, a good-natured and sweet blonde, whose father is a hard-working and honest policeman. Sandy is obviously fascinated by Jeffrey's recklessness, but her level-headed nature prevents her from becoming his full-time accomplice and ditching her boy-friend, at least, not until later on. Stylistically, Blue Velvet is a precursor to Lynch's notorious collaboration with Mark Frost - TV series Twin Peaks. These creations share a lot of elements including the small town setting, a dangerously attractive brunette, oldies often played under disturbing circumstances, dreamy angel-like singers (remember Julie Cruise in Twin Peaks), flame and even the famous red curtains. Although Blue Velvet is just a thriller without any supernatural context, somehow you expect the Dwarf to pop up and start dancing at any time. The blue velvet is a leitmotif of the film. Blue Velvet is a song that Dorothy has to perform in a club every night looking straight in the eyes of her tormentors. Dorothy also wears a blue velvet gown at home, and Frank has a fetish for blue velvet using it in his perverted sexual games. Blue velvet is a symbol of mystery, obsession and hidden passions lurking beneath the exterior of men. Lynch uses different colors for the scenes taking place in the normal world of American suburbia versus Dorothy's apartment or Ben's house. Lumbertown is depicted as idyllic joyful place with bright yellow tulips against the white fence and bright green grass. Everything involving Dorothy or the criminals is shot either in the darkness or unnaturally striking colors. The director makes an interesting application of the contrast between the two women in protagonist's life. Dangerous and seductive Dorothy is a voluptuous brunette wearing blue or red gowns, whereas Sandy is a slender blonde, your typical American next door cheerleader. Kyle MacLahlan is cute, adorable and gives an incredibly convincing performance. His love-making scenes with Rossellini are tasteful, beautiful and disturbing at the same time. Rosselini was quite adequate, especially if we take into account the complexity of the character, but I couldn't get rid of this thought in the back of my head that Sherilyn Fenn would have been much more memorable. Perhaps, I am irreparably spoiled by Twin Peaks... However, Rossellini's was Lynch's favorite at the time, so we can understand being a little bit biased here. Dennis Hopper is way over the top as Frank Booth, being psychotic, violent and pitiful at the same time. His every appearance on the screen is a an avalanche of emotions, swear-words and craziness. He is a dangerous man and Jeffrey who stepped in his way knows that the only way for him to stay alive is to eliminate Frank. Lynch decided to end this flick on a joyful note. Everything goes back to normal in Lumberton, Jeffrey and Sandy will probably go on to have a long and wholesome life together with children on the way. Dorothy is hugging her son in the final moments of the movie, and the robin as the symbol of good is devouring the bug just as in Sandy's dream. However, despite the obviously happy ending and triumph of the good over the evil, the final scenes have such a dream-like and surreal quality that one cannot help suspecting that something bad is doomed to happen again.

The problem is that it was a blatant attempt to cash in on the Nightmare On Elm St franchise and it's glaringly obvious, particularly with it's similarities to the third movie. I'll make my point with this list 1. Bad guy gets burnt alive and comes back to haunt people in dreams (although in 'Bad Dreams' it's more hallucinations really so I don't know why they called it such other than to attract Elm St fans.) 2. Both 'Bad Dreams' and Elm St 3 are set in very similar looking hospitals where they have group sessions and one of the patients is played by Jennifer Rubin. The patients begin to see visions\/dreams of a burnt man before dying.3. At one point needing a hall pass is mentioned which sounded like a reference to Elm St 1.4. A doctor in this is the same actor who plays a doctor in Elm St 1.5. In Elm St 3 Phillip falls from a high window to his death which appears like a suicide. The same happens with a character in this movie and the music in each of these two scenes are strikingly similar.I'm sure there were others but you get the picture. Otherwise they're really very different movies. Bad Dreams lacks the imaginative dream sequences and really over the top fantastic deaths of Elm St 3 but it plays things very seriously and a result is at least a much scarier horror movie.

I understand, however, that in those versions of the story the character of Hildy Johnson was male, and that when Howard Hawks made this version he originally intended to follow the original play in this respect. He eventually, however, changed his mind and made Hildy female. (At this period a girl Friday was a junior female office assistant; the application of the term to Hildy, an experienced journalist, is presumably ironic).Like many of the screwball comedies of this period, this one is a comedy of remarriage. (In the same year, 1940, Cary Grant made two other films of this type, My Favourite Wife and The Philadelphia Story). The normal plot line is that the male and female leads are a divorced or separated couple who end up rediscovering their love for one another, and the attraction of this sort of story for filmmakers was that it allowed them to deal with the theme of divorce, then considered very daring and sophisticated, while providing a happy ending which would please even the most hardened moralist by showing the triumph of conjugal love. (Although the heyday of comedies of remarriage was in the thirties and forties, they have never gone away; Bird on a Wire and Sweet Home Alabama are two more recent examples).Grant here stars as Walter Burns, a newspaper editor. Hildy (in this version it's short for Hildegard) is not only his former star reporter but also his former wife. Their marriage and their business relationship have now come to an end and Hildy intends to settle down to a quiet life of domesticity with her new fiancé Bruce Baldwin, a rather dull (and none too intelligent) insurance salesman. Walter, however, asks Hildy to cover one last story for him, the execution of convicted murderer Earl Williams, and she accepts, less as a favour to her ex-husband than because she wants to help save the life of a man she believes to be innocent. Which leads to many further complications, including the inevitable discovery that Walter and Hildy are still in love with one another.Although His Girl Friday is primarily a romantic comedy, it does contain some satirical barbs aimed at the American newspaper industry; Hildy's idealism and concern for accuracy set her apart from most of her colleagues in the press room, who are only concerned with landing a spectacular scoop which may or may not bear any relation to the truth. On a more serious level the film also has some things to say about the death penalty and about political interference in the judicial process; the city's corrupt mayor and sheriff are anxious, for political reasons, to see Williams executed so do all they can to bring this about, even trying to bribe the messenger bringing a reprieve from the governor to go away.The film is noted for its quick- fire dialogue, particularly in the battle of the sexes exchanges between Walter and Hildy. It manages to pack a large amount of verbal material into a relatively short running time. One notable innovation is the use of overlapping dialogue with one character speaking before another finishes. (This technique has also been used by a number of more recent directors, such as Robert Aldrich). This development not only has the effect of making conversations sound more realistic, it also adds a greater sense of pace and rapid movement.The film also plays games with a well-worn movie convention, the convention that nobody ever notices the resemblance between a fictional character and the actor playing that character. Normally all films starring (for example) Cary Grant take place in a parallel universe in which the actor Cary Grant does not exist. Here, however, Walter describes Baldwin by saying He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know...Ralph Bellamy! Bellamy was, of course, the actor playing Baldwin. (This line was, apparently, an ad lib on Grant's part, but the director Howard Hawks liked it and allowed it to remain). Another film which plays a similar game is the more recent Ocean's Twelve in which Julia Roberts plays a character who is pretending to be Julia Roberts because everyone says I look like her.Cary Grant had a natural gift for screwball comedy which made him the obvious choice to play Walter; Hawks had two years earlier directed him in another famous screwball, Bringing Up Baby. Rosalind Russell, however, was not the first choice to play Hildy; that was Carole Lombard, but the studio could not afford her. Nor was she the second choice; that was Katharine Hepburn, Grant's co-star in Bringing up Baby and The Philadelphia Story, but she turned the part down, as did several other actresses. Russell, however, makes the part so completely her own that it is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role, and combines well with Grant in a two-person comedy team. (I was not previously particularly familiar with Russell's work, except as the stage mother from hell in Gypsy, so I was interested to see another side to her).I would not rank His Girl Friday quite as highly as The Philadelphia Story, one of the best comedies of the period, but it is certainly better than My Favourite Wife, a dated, sentimental film which today comes across as more cornball than screwball. It is a fast-moving, witty comedy which still stands up well today. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 May 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I have never seen The Front Page, the stage play on which His Girl Friday was based, or either of the two filmed versions of it from 1931 and 1974.

Although the first was quite astonishing in that it was made for a mere $6.5 million yet looks more engaging and explosive than most big budget action flicks today, the sequel stands as one of the three or four films that actually surpass the original in every aspect. The story continues the Terminator mythology established previously, but also expands on it, giving more background details as well as dropping hints of what the future holds for the Connors and humankind. What is also surprising about this film is how well the acting holds up. Usually characters and plot are secondary to the action sequences, but writer\/director James Cameron weaves them together and the result is a very pleasing and satisfying experience that truly wraps you up completely in the story from beginning to end. By now, it is a well-known fact that Cameron is a master of visual effects and has done more than anyone, sans George Lucas, to make them progressive enough to be the foundation of blockbuster movies they are today. In seeing this and the original Terminator films, we see a more primitive style from Cameron. He must rely more on editing than he does now in order to hide some of the small details not able to be changed with computers or special effects. This gives a more intimate and personal experience to the viewer but cannot take away from the sheer brilliance of the effects used on the character of the T-1000. In seeing the special edition as I have, I must confess I have not seen the original cut so obviously I have seen more than was initially planned. Yet, I am sure that I have not seen too little of the incredible and painstaking ability and work put forth by Industrial Light and Magic in order to create a character made out of liquid metal, who can change shape into almost any physical specimen, walk through solid metal, and even coagulate after being frozen and blasted apart. Seeing this was almost groundbreaking for me, even though it was released some 20 years ago. The computer and digital effects look better than much of what is accomplished today, perhaps mostly because it adds to the story rather than diverting our attention away from it. On top of all that, this is simply a very well-made film that puts most other action pictures to shame. In looking at Cameron's filmography, his two bench-mark films are probably Aliens and Terminator 2 as with each of these he raised the bar of what can be acceptable as solid action and essentially paved the way for his less action but just as impressive films of Titanic and Avatar, which now reign supreme as the two highest grossing films of all time. I cannot express enough how enjoyable all of Cameron's films that I have seen are. He will probably never be compared to the likes of Welles, Kurosawa or Kubrick, but perhaps he deserves his own category as special effects and digital wonder pioneer.

In looking at Cameron's filmography, his two bench-mark films are probably Aliens and Terminator 2 as with each of these he raised the bar of what can be acceptable as solid action and essentially paved the way for his less action but just as impressive films of Titanic and Avatar, which now reign supreme as the two highest grossing films of all time. I cannot express enough how enjoyable all of Cameron's films that I have seen are. He will probably never be compared to the likes of Welles, Kurosawa or Kubrick, but perhaps he deserves his own category as special effects and digital wonder pioneer. In that regard, he truly is the king of the world.

Then two things happen. First he has an interaction with a robotic woman who seems to have a cure for some kind of plague disease that has wiped out most of humanity. Then he meets up with a street dweller woman who decides to aid him in his quest against a group of cannibalistic troublemakers who have taken the robot woman away.To start things off, a lot of the characters in this film seem to be named after guitars. Gibson Rickenbacker wanders around a wasteland of ugliness for a good portion of the film talking to ugly people about ugly things in an ugly way. The cinematography is... terrible. Everyone in the film looks sinfully grotesque, and that includes Van Damme, who I consider one of the most handsome action heroes of the early 90s. His character is awash with disgusting looking scars and he would probably look like a burn victim if the scars didn't look so fake. His face is coated with dust and dirt from start to finish, except in flashbacks where he looks like a stereotypical romantic hero on the cover of a romance novel.The whole film is full of recycled and unfinished landscapes from unfinished films and it's pretty obvious that the set-designer was pretty halfhearted in his attempt to put together a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The people who shot this film obviously did not have any idea how to shoot a film. The whole film looks like a bad home movie. The characters aren't framed well at all and you don't really ever get a good look at any of the characters at any time. The fight scenes are so badly edited that it becomes frustrating to watch. There's some especially bad jump cuts near the end of the film that really will grate on the nerves of anyone. All of the characters, at one point or another, end up shrieking in the face of the audience REALLY LOUD.It is also one of the most annoying films I've ever sat through, let alone listened to. There's a sequence where Van Damme is crucified for no particular reason, as well as a lot of other real disgusting acts of violence that come across as out of place for some reason and I'm left wondering, who was entertained by this? There's no cool moments of triumph, no good fight scenes or gore, no slick one-liners, no interesting villains, no interesting heroes, and no cool science fiction touches. It's ironic that the film's title is Cyborg, because the film doesn't exactly feature much in the way of electronic machinery. Essentially, this is basically a film in the style of Conan the Barbarian, only with some guns and a briefly appearing robot. Those are pretty much the only two things that make it in any way related to the science fiction genre. All of the dialogue in the film is pure exposition, and it's all pointless in every way. There is exactly zero chemistry between Van Damme and the opposite female lead, and their scenes together are often frightening and embarrassing.For a late-80s action film, you'd think it would be really tough to be lacking in entertainment value, in every possible way. Enter Cyborg, which is by far one of the least entertaining films I've ever watched. Please keep in mind that I love the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme and I actually really have liked a lot of his direct-to-video work. This is definitely the worst film in his filmography. Please do not watch this film.I urge you not to waste your time with this. I can pretty much completely guarantee you that you will not like this film. The film is 86 minutes long, but it is so horrible and utterly unwatchable at times that I can promise that it will feel at least an hour longer. By the time Van Damme leaves the village at the start of the film, before there are any fight scenes that last longer than thirty seconds, there is only an hour left of the film. It is the longest hour I have ever experienced with any film. It is so long that I struggled really hard to not fast-forward. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.

This movie begins like no other movie that has been reviewed; the story takes place in the San Francisco Bay area in 1971, where it starts off in this beautiful old fashioned large house with a young man walking through it. The music in the background and throughout the film is mostly all Cat Stevens. With almost a blink of an eye this happy (or what seems to be happy) man hangs himself; but only for pretend. Bud Cort stars as the young man, Harold, who enjoys pretending to kill himself to get his mothers attention. Little does he know, he has not been living to his full advantage, but practicing how to die to gain attention? While Harold is at his usual place for enjoyment, that is a funeral, he meets a crazy, spiritual, happy-go-lucky 79 years old woman, Maude. Maude, played by Ruth Gordon, eventually shows Harold how to live and what being alive is all about. When first seeing this movie, it strikes me as a wacky, not thought completely out movie. But, as the film continued to go on and build a story, I find it a beautiful story. Even though the story is unlikely and not usual, it gives people who are lost the hope that friendship, and love are out there somewhere no matter the age. Harold and Maude tell a great story of true love and happiness and the ability to live your life to the fullest.The way the film is conducted is rather modern which fits the era when it was made. The characterization is developed well through little hints that the viewer either sees a quick flash of, or is told a little story about background. For example, Maude has a troubling background, and for that she is insisting she will die when she turns 80. Maude continues to say this throughout the movie, but it is not until almost the end until we find out why she is going to die when she turns 80. The viewer does not get told why, but we are able to see a little bit of her arm that shows she was a prisoner in a concentration camp. An example of the film telling us little detail to help understand the past of Harold is when he tells Maude the reason he pretends to kill himself to scare his mother. Harold tells Maude, I enjoy being dead. With Harold and Maude becoming closer, there begins to be a problem. There great friendship is becoming friendlier. Most likely in other movies, this would not be a problem, but with Maude, whom is 79 and Harold whom is early 20s, people can predict this will lead to some trouble ahead. Not only are they falling in love with each other, but Maude in almost every shot says when she is 80, she will die.The theme is represented through the crafty dialog used, which viewers get the sense of Harold being a quite, dark young man through his lack of social talking. When Harold is seen in shots with his mother, and even Maude in the beginning, he answers with a simple, short sentence. 'What's the matter?' 'I have a sore throat.' This scene is at a fancy dinner Harolds mother put on where he answers her question with a straight to the point answer. When the viewer meets Maude, the speaking begins to be more abrupt. Maude is the most talkative person featured in the film; she almost never stops talking, which is the exact opposite of Harold. The dialog between both characters develop theme by showing how opposites can attracted, (literally) happiness can be found anywhere, and live your life to the fullest.The acting that Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon give is tremendous. They both portray their characters with grace. When witnessing their acting, you can not help but fall in love with them even with their appearance difference.Harold and Maude is definitely not like any movie I have seen from the way it begins, to the way it ends. The only complaint I would say is the sense of knowing what is going to happen in the future, but the movie is so different it works that the viewer knows what is going to happen. Plus, once the viewer is hooked, they forget what is going to happen down the road. Also, the film is full of awkwardness, laughter, joy, death, and other emotions that blow the viewer away. It would be easy to say that this movie is the weirdest, crazy, odd movie of all time, but there is also meaning that is built into it. This movie shows how to care, love, and live.

In the first scene you see a man walking in an old house with happy music playing then out of no where Harold has hung himself. The majority of the music in this film is by Cat Stevens. There are many scene's like these where there is happy music while Harold is dying you think he is dead, but in reality it's a cry for help. Maude played by Ruth Gordon is a free spirited, live life to the fullest sort of person who is 79 years old and when these to meet up it turns into a unlikely romance that won't be forgotten. The movie itself is a terrific story that shows that no matter what age you can still love life and have great friendships. In the movie Harold is determined to get his mothers attention even if that means committing a fake suicide. He does everything to get his mother's attention but it just won't seem to work. Harold's dark, suicidal side slowly starts to disintegrate when Maude comes into his life when they meet at a funeral, which is one of Harold's hobbies. Maude brings the best out in Harold and soon he seems as though he enjoys life somewhat, many of the scenes take place in Maude's home which is full of quirky gadgets. The theme of this movie would have to be friendship and love. These two people who you would never think to be friends a young man in his early 20's and an a 79 year old woman who thinks you shouldn't live past 80, these two become the best of friends and at the end of the movie you clearly see they are more than just friends. The scenes in this movie are somewhat dark and mysterious when Harold was around; Maude brought the light to the movie so to speak, whenever she would come into the room she would brighten the mood with her borrowing random cars and replanting tree's. Maude makes Harold feel as though he was important to someone and he shouldn't live life being mad. Harold always had this gloominess to him; he always had a pale face and dark circles under his eyes and thought about death all the time. Maude wore quirky outfits and lived life to the fullest. Both Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon did a fantastic job in the acting department. I don't think I could see anyone else playing Maude or Harold for that matter, the two together made the movie and they both did a great job.The importance of this film is that no matter what age you are you can always have fun and fall in love. Harold & Maude is a movie that I recommend watching, it's a touching story of two unlikely people who fall in love and the obstacles they overcome. This movie portrays that true love does exist and no matter what there is always a person like you in some way who will always be there for you. Harold & Maude is a terrific movie that you will love and want to watch over and over again, it's a love story that no one will believe unless you watch it.

Maude brings the best out in Harold and soon he seems as though he enjoys life somewhat, many of the scenes take place in Maude's home which is full of quirky gadgets. The theme of this movie would have to be friendship and love. These two people who you would never think to be friends a young man in his early 20's and an a 79 year old woman who thinks you shouldn't live past 80, these two become the best of friends and at the end of the movie you clearly see they are more than just friends. The scenes in this movie are somewhat dark and mysterious when Harold was around; Maude brought the light to the movie so to speak, whenever she would come into the room she would brighten the mood with her borrowing random cars and replanting tree's. Maude makes Harold feel as though he was important to someone and he shouldn't live life being mad. Harold always had this gloominess to him; he always had a pale face and dark circles under his eyes and thought about death all the time. Maude wore quirky outfits and lived life to the fullest. Both Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon did a fantastic job in the acting department. I don't think I could see anyone else playing Maude or Harold for that matter, the two together made the movie and they both did a great job.The importance of this film is that no matter what age you are you can always have fun and fall in love. Harold & Maude is a movie that I recommend watching, it's a touching story of two unlikely people who fall in love and the obstacles they overcome. This movie portrays that true love does exist and no matter what there is always a person like you in some way who will always be there for you. Harold & Maude is a terrific movie that you will love and want to watch over and over again, it's a love story that no one will believe unless you watch it.

It's still a darn good movie. One that I can watch many times.The characters are predictable. Someone took this as a negative, but the reviewer was quite far from proving his point. Well, in case of Rock Hound, you can't really say that, can you? And neither can you in case of Harry Stomper. Would you say that Colonel Willie Sharp was predictable? Or Dan Truman? Not so, sorry.True, the story is a little far fetched. Then again no one remembers Deep Impact, which was more or less about the same event, except written and performed so insignificantly, it felt into oblivion.The jokes. The funny situations. The funny dialogs. Gee, lady, I just came here to drill. So did I! This movie has the cinematographic equivalent of salt and pepper, and just about right mix of the laughing gas and tear gas.For a long time I didn't know that, but I have been turning into a Michael Bay's fan. I saw him 2 times in this movie. He acted pretty well as a 2nd level supporting actor, but his real value is in directing and producing. I never expected Transformes to get my attention, and they did, which in itself is a big achievement.

I've seen it several times, though upon writing this review after having watched it again, this most recent viewing marks the first time in about 8 years or so that I've seen it, and it's lost some of its sparkle.My main complaints concern several scenes of very stilted acting, particularly during the ret-con introduction. A new actor is playing Mike, and while the original actor wasn't an Oscar contender, his replacement is quite lackluster, though adequately naive. Reggie is back, thankfully, and now armed with a kick ass 4 barrel shotgun that is woefully underused. I also hated the unnecessary constant face close-ups that occurred several times. It gave it a bad-TV-pilot feel at times.This being said, I still enjoy the movie immensely, in spite of some of the obvious flaws of a low budget 80's production. A new sentinel sphere makes its grand entrance here, a golden ball of evil sporting some very nasty and effective hardware. I felt like the brain drilling scenes could have had more blood, but you can't have everything, I guess.Angus Scrimm is back(Boooooooooooy!) and he's great even though his speaking role is limited. The character of Alchemy is a rather silly and pointless addition to the cast, and she only shows up to reveal her small cup size(but, I can't really complain about that). And Liz has some weird mental connection with Mike that isn't really explained and no one really cares, anyway.This is my favorite of the series, followed by the original. I never cared for parts 3 or 4 and haven't seen either of them more than once.And remember, this is only a review. (No. It's not!)
