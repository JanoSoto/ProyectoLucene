Then this is a good choice. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is based on the Roald Dahl children's story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The basic story is Willy Wonka has placed five Golden Ticket in his chocolate bars and five lucky children will get a free tour and a life time's supply of chocolate. Charlie is a poor English boy who lived in a small house with his mum and grandparents. He is also a very unselfish child who works as a paper boy and uses his money to help his family. Charlie also wants to be one of the children who get one of the golden tickets. Charlie gets lucky and finds one of the tickets and get to go to the factory. The four other children who find tickets are Augustus Gloop, a very greedy German child, Veruca Salt, a very solid English child, Violet Beauregarde, a self-obsessed American and Mike Teavee a TV-obsessed American child. When all the characters get to the Chocolate factory they find a surreal place which offers the children everything they could want, but one by one all of them get weeded out because of their selfishness. The whole point of Willy Wonka is that it's a morality tale about being good and avoid being selfish.This film has some nice little songs; the ones that I think our best are 'A World of Pure Imagination' and 'I Want it Now'. I feel that the mood is just right and go for children of all ages. It is more lighter then the Tim Burton version which I think is better. The Oompa-Loompa are also great in the film and you can't help by like them. They have been parodied in a number of times, including in the Simpsons, Futurama and Family Guy. I think that they are a lot better in this version then the Burton version. Gene Wilder was also perfectly casted as Willy Wonka, getting the role just right and I think his version is better then Johnny Deep's.All in all Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a nice little film for all the family which shows it classes by being parodied. This film is better then remake.

I really don't know what else to say about this movie. *spoiler***************There is a scene where Steve Martin is working at a gas station and three Latinos are stealing gas and tires from him. He decides to show them by hooking up a roped hook to the car and puts the other end on a water pipe at a church next door. When the guys drive off, half of the church goes with them, wedding in progress. It was unrealistic and unfunny. I mean, I love ridiculous humor like the Scary Movie series or the Airplane movies, Funny Farm, Fletch movies, etc... but this is just stupid. Don't waste your time with this one. Sorry Steve Martin. The more I think about your work, like Father of the Bride, Three Amigos, and some other stuff, I really am coming to the conclusion that you are not that funny.

The brilliance of Alfred Hitchcock is that he doesn't go for the obvious - the great white shark, the rampaging gorilla, or the Jurassic dinosaur. What could be more welcome than a few songbirds to brighten up and add some cheer to an otherwise ordinary day? As the crows congregated in the schoolyard it seemed like they exuded evil in a strange way, foreshadowing an event outside the normal scheme of things. With all the slash and gore spectacle prevalent in horror films today, one has a keen sense as a viewer that nothing presented on screen is real. But take one look at the plucked out eyes of farmer Dan Fawcett slumped against the wall of his home, and you begin to wonder, wow! could something like that ever really happen?Offsetting the grim spectacle of the bird attacks, I thought Hitchcock did a nicely nuanced job with some offbeat humor that might not seem obvious at first. Would a pair of caged lovebirds really respond to inertia the way the ones in Melanie's car did taking those curves on the road to Bodega Bay? I thought that was a neat touch. And how about shortly after the sparrow attack at the Daniels home, when the diner waitress orders baked potato with the fried chicken? Hitchcock's little way of a preemptive strike on the feathered set before things really get going.One thing seemed kind of odd though. Recalling that sparrow attack down the chimney into the Daniels parlor, wasn't it strange that no one screamed? Not even a sound out of any of the people in the room, including little Cathy Brenner (Veronica Cartwright). That certainly wasn't played very realistically; I pictured myself in that room shouting out a few well chosen four letter words besides 'bird', I can tell you that.As for the players, Tippi Hedren did a commendable job in virtually her very first screen role. There was something mysterious to her persona that might have been construed as to contributing to the bird attacks. That idea was voiced later in the story by the panicked mother who wanted to leave town as quickly as possible with her daughter. I couldn't really warm up to the idea of Veronica Cartwright and Rod Taylor portraying a brother and sister with the apparent age disparity, but that wound up working out OK.The inconclusive finale left me feeling a little baffled since there was no real resolution to the problem with the birds back in Bodega Bay. It felt a little like the ending to the original War Of The Worlds (1953) where everything kind of worked out for the best, but with no sense of closure or comfort to it.Before closing I have to throw out this bit of ornithological trivia, and I'm curious why Hitchcok didn't use it in the film. There was in fact a reference to a flock of crows in the picture, but the more accurate description would have been a 'murder of crows'. Seriously, you could look it up, the term came about because a group of crows is known to kill an already dying animal in order to feed. A whole bunch of them looks kind of spooky too!

Watching one dude say he'll be here for a while, and then fast forward a couple hours and he appears to be on death's door.Hands on a Hard Body, isn't a contest for body-builders (though they may do well, if their mind is strong), but for everyday, hard-working people who want to win their hand at a brand new truck and some well-deserved respect along the way. If you're ever given the chance to enter one, research it a little bit because this movie definitely shows the viewer these contests aren't as easy as they appear.

Don't get me wrong, sword fights are always good, and I liked these ones, but they were unexpected. For those of you who are reading this and haven't read the book, it starts out with the Pharoan returning to Marseilles, with its captain dead and young first mate Edmond Dantes in charge. Danglars, the ship's purser (whatever that is) feels he has taken to much power and disobeyed orders. He mentions seeing the dying captain give Dantes some stuff to deliver on Elba, he meets Napoleon who gives him a letter to give to a guy in Paris. he speaks with Morrel, who gives him the job of Captain, visits his dad, and then goes to his sweetheart, Mercedes, who happens to be hanging out with her infatuated cousin, Fernand. Dantes and Fernand meet, Fernand goes away jealous, meets with Danglars in a bar and they plot to hurt Dantes. I liked the way they did the homecoming scene and the bar scene, but Danglars had way too little a part. I kinda liked how Fernand was the son of a count, and ended up being a count that way, but at the same time it took away from the other characters. Danglars, Villefort, Morrel, and Albert had too little parts. I mean, in the book all those guys, except Albert, had families which the Count either helped out or destroyed. They made the book a whole lot better. I mean they was like an entire Villefort side plot. Of course, audiences would have been confused and this movie would be three hours long. I liked what they with Luigi Vampa, Jacopo, and the smugglers. In the book, Jacopo saved Dantes life and had no connection to Luigi Vampa, but it was still good. I liked the movie until the part where he starts to extract his revenge. Then we started going a bit fast. It was like BAM he's high society, BAM he kills Danglars, BAM he puts Villefort in jail, BAM he steals Mercedes and gets in duel to the death with Fernand and Albert. That's something else, everyone seemed to forget that Mercedes was married, they were all like Edmond\/Zatarra just go and take the woman. which leads to whole Albert is really Edmond's kid thing. While the first thing I noticed was that he looked more like Edmond than Fernand, that was a dumb unnecessary part of the plot, that really they could have done with out. So yeah, good for the most of it, bad for ending.

That's what Kingpin delivers Lots of gags and quirky, dumb characters. Impressively enough, however, the Farrelly brothers make slapstick feel fresh in this film with tons of obscene, crude and even plain old disgusting humor. This not a film for those who find no humor in stupid, for those who do, Kingpin is a very enjoyable film.Woody Harrelson stars as Roy Munson, the 1979 Iowa amateur bowling champion whose life goes south when he gets cheated by Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) and it costs him his bowling hand. 17 years later he meets Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid) in a bowling alley and sees an opportunity to turn his life around. After convincing Ishmael to leave his Amish community, the two set forth for Reno's $1 million bowling tournament, teaming up with Claudia (Vanessa Angel) along the way.This is a cross-country (Pennsylvania to Reno) comedy adventure where each scene has a bunch of obvious gags, but they're clever (not overused) and usually short and sweet instead of drawn out. That, and the Farrelly brothers also supply some unspoken humor like Roy and Ernies' hair flying in several directions throughout the film. So there ends up being a lot to laugh about in this film, which helps a lot with the sort of aimless plot.Harrelson and Quaid are great in the film, though Billy Murray is the actor who really takes this film to the next level. The film's climax is all about utilizing his talents as a comedian and he helps make an okay scene (the climax to an aimless plot) way more tolerable to get through. The rest of the cast is pretty bad with the exception of Lin Shaye as Harrelson's landlady, a scene which deserves no spoilers. Angel is pretty terrible (other than her looks). She lets her British accent slip out a lot and I didn't know she was from the UK before I watched this film.This is a great movie in you're in the mood for some really creative silliness.

However, my cousin saw it and told me it was pretty good. Now that I have seen Elizabeth The Virgin Queen twice, I thoroughly enjoyed it.I was never much of a Cate Blanchett fan, in fact I find her to be very overrated, but her performance in this is absolutely mesmerizing. Throughout the film, she has four men in her life. Her lover (Fiennes). Her defender (Rush). Her adviser (Eccleston). And her guardian (Attenborough).Each plays their part well and ultimately changes her character from start to finish as a naive, innocent princess to a ruthless and determined leader. She not only has the appearance of Queen Elizabeth, but also delivers her lines with emotion and intelligence, gradually showing these changes. How she did not get the Oscar for this is beyond my understanding. Then again, she was an unknown in 1998 versus Paltrow (who won that year). Nevertheless, I will always remember this movie as her best work.The accomplishments of the costume designs make up, and art direction doesn't just make the time period of the 1500s look realistic, but it also adds to the creativity of the film as well as an unforgettable time in Europe. I also enjoyed Remi Adefarasin's sweeping cinematography and David Hirschfelder's haunting yet beautiful score.Shekhar Kapur's direction is breathtaking. One of the most amazing scenes in the film is in the beginning where three so-called heretics are burned. Rather than focusing it blatantly on the victims or on the shocked crowd, it shows the whole scene through an aerial view with slow 360 degree twirls. It may sound like it would make you dizzy but the camera is steady and captures the whole thing marvelously.The only thing I have against this movie is that some of the plots and conspiracies get confusing and hard to follow. Some of the character motives I felt were not broadened enough nor had enough time to be built up. Other than that, I really liked this prequel. 9\/10I'm disappointed that this only got on Oscar in 1998, since this is one of two movies that were nominated for Picture I liked that year.

It brought the crazy and amazing action and fight sequences from Chan's into the western world of film-making. It makes this movie something fresh and unique, or at least for its time it was. I remember first seeing this movie in the mid-'90's, just before the time it was released as a rental movie. My brother was working in a video-store and had to take a few new video's home with him in order to decide whether or not the video-store should buy this movie for rental purposes. In those days this movie was really something fun and spectacular to watch and shortly afterward Jackie Chan also became a real big and popular movie-star. Way more popular and appreciated as he is now days.What really makes this movie is its action. It's never anything too big, also since the movie is made obviously with a fairly low budget but it's very entertaining and amazing at the same time. Amazing, since obviously no harnesses or cables were used for the fight sequences and stunts. It also resulted in lots of broken bones and other injuries during the production but the end result for the movie is really something great and spectacular looking and is brought very entertainingly by Jackie Chan and director Stanley Tong, who both directed the action sequences together. You should see this movie just purely for its entertaining action, since everything else about the movie is actually quite bad to be honest. It might very well be the Jackie Chan movie with the very best action in it. The movie is a very entertaining one to watch that gets better as it progresses. It's as if the in the first halve tried to be too serious with its approach but in the second halve the gloves are off and the movie becomes truly ridiculously over-the-top and fun at the same time. The best example of this is perhaps the finale sequence in which Chan and his happy friends get the main bad guy with an hovercraft. It's a totally pointless and completely ridicules and also short, rushed done sequence but because of that it at the same time works out very hilarious. I'm still looking for a movie with a better use of the hovercraft than this one!It's hard to really judge the acting in the movie, since all of the actors were dubbed, even the American actors. This gives the movie an even more ridicules feeling and also makes the acting seem as something completely horrible and over-the-top.The movie its story often makes lots of crazy jumps and it perhaps even feel as two totally different scripts that were blend in with each other, with as a result that not everything always makes a whole lot of sense and continuity and character treatments are messy. It perhaps almost seems as if the story was mainly purely there to let the movie feature as many and crazy stunts and fight sequences as possible.The movie is most of the time looking and definitely feeling as a B-movie but in a good way.

We meet a few kids just out of school who decide to join the military. We meet Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), who is trying to win over his girlfriend Carmen (Denise Richards) who also joins the military. We also meet his best friend Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris). Once in military training the friends seem to have no idea what they're up against. Johnny is sent along with his troops to fight the wide-scale war against the giant alien insects on the planet Klendathu, bent on conquering and destroying the human race. Hell bent on winning the war against these disgusting bugs, all three friends continue to fight. But as mangled bodies fly, and the bugs seem to get smarter, the humans have to start finding new ways to defeat their foes. And that may mean finding the leading Brain of this insect race, something beyond what anyone could imagine.Starship Troopers is a modern classic. It's action packed, gung-ho, gruesome, flashy, and definitely one of the most exciting action movies of the 1990s. There are so many awesome things in this movie that it's hard for me, and many other fans of this cult classic, to name them all. The special effects on the bugs are really well done, and the same goes to all the rest of the action. All of the different bugs looked very cool, and were constantly a menacing enemy. However I don't exactly understand how this race of giant alien insects could ever take over the human race. Sure if there were colonies of these bugs, like the ones on Klendathu, that got to Earth they could surely dominate us. But how are the bugs technically a big threat when they're on their own planet? How are they ever going to get all the way to Earth to destroy the humans without any technology? Maybe I'm just thinking way too far into it. This is an action\/sci-fi movie after all. And there were far more things I enjoyed about this b-movie rather than disliked.Now let's talk about the acting and the story, you know...the secondary parts of the movie. Casper Van Dien gives a good lead performance, actually it's probably his best performance if you count some of the crappy movies he did after this. Cough* Shark Attack *Cough. Denise Richards and Dina Meyer are both good as the two girls in a love triangle with Johnny Rico. There's almost always a little sappy romance thrown in b-movies, and some actress has to show her boobs. This is a Paul Verhoeven film after all, let's not forget that. In my opinion the best three performances here come from Neil Patrick Harris, Jake Busey, and Michael Ironside. Jake Busey kicks butt and takes names, Michael Ironside gives a particularly strong performance. And Neil Patrick Harris, well, Neil Patrick Harris is just awesome in all his movies and shows. People are starting to notice him even more nowadays by casting him in the Harold and Kumar series. For an action movie the performances were pretty good in Starship Troopers.The alien insects were awesome, the action was cool, the performances were dead on, and the basic story just worked. Starship Troopers is a really good action movie that has it's share of shooting, blood, gore, brain-eating, and severed body parts that only make it more memorable. One thing I also forgot to mention is all the hilarious propaganda used in the story. Propaganda encouraging people, even little kids, to join the army and die a painful death in order to protect the human race. This shows that a movie doesn't have to take itself so seriously all the time, it just has to be fun. That's exactly what Starship Troopers is. I give it a 4.5 out of 5.

Laughton manages to combine comedy (he's at times very funny, particularly in his exchanges with his nurse, played by Elsa Lanchester) with great drama and he does it seamlessly; everything about this movie flows absolutely perfectly. His client is Leonard Vole (played by Tyrone Powers.) Powers also seemed to me to capture the essence of his character - sleazy looking enough to make you wonder if he's guilty, but also angst ridden enough to make you doubt that he's guilty. Of the main actors, I wasn't especially taken by Marlene Dietrich as Vole's wife Christine. I haven't seen a lot of Dietrich's work, but from what I have seen I have to confess that she's never really turned my crank; she's no different here. Something about her performance (here and in other bits of her work that I've seen) just comes across as artificial. I can't explain it any better than that. Having said that, one performance that to me was sub-par (and her performance here probably suffers mostly in comparison with Laughton and Powers) can't detract from an excellent courtroom drama that keeps you guessing right up to the very end. The last twenty minutes or so especially are full of so many twists and turns that your head is spinning by the time it's over. I also appreciated the look at the inside of a British courtroom and its procedures, since most of the courtroom dramas I've seen are American. (As an aside, it was interesting to see Ian Wolfe as Robarts' valet Carter. Wolfe had a very long career in movies and television, never from what I can remember as a star, but as a supporting actor or guest star in everything from great movies such as this to TV shows like Star Trek or WKRP in Cincinnati. What was most interesting about him was that from the time this movie was made in 1957 to his later work in TV he doesn't seem to change. He's immediately recognizable.)

As for this movie, it's a truly excellent piece of work. 9\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"19 July 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Charles Laughton (surely one of the finest actors who has ever lived) put on an absolutely superb performance in this movie as the aging and well known defense attorney Wilfrid Robarts, who is hired to defend a man accused of murdering an elderly widow he had befriended in order to gain her estate. Laughton manages to combine comedy (he's at times very funny, particularly in his exchanges with his nurse, played by Elsa Lanchester) with great drama and he does it seamlessly; everything about this movie flows absolutely perfectly. His client is Leonard Vole (played by Tyrone Powers.) Powers also seemed to me to capture the essence of his character - sleazy looking enough to make you wonder if he's guilty, but also angst ridden enough to make you doubt that he's guilty. Of the main actors, I wasn't especially taken by Marlene Dietrich as Vole's wife Christine. I haven't seen a lot of Dietrich's work, but from what I have seen I have to confess that she's never really turned my crank; she's no different here. Something about her performance (here and in other bits of her work that I've seen) just comes across as artificial. I can't explain it any better than that. Having said that, one performance that to me was sub-par (and her performance here probably suffers mostly in comparison with Laughton and Powers) can't detract from an excellent courtroom drama that keeps you guessing right up to the very end. The last twenty minutes or so especially are full of so many twists and turns that your head is spinning by the time it's over. I also appreciated the look at the inside of a British courtroom and its procedures, since most of the courtroom dramas I've seen are American. (As an aside, it was interesting to see Ian Wolfe as Robarts' valet Carter.

But this version in that not yet tacky RKO jungle set still gives one a feeling of horror down to the marrow of your bones as modern man of 1933 faces the primeval forces of nature that have survived out in the Pacific.Certainly there are some absurdities here. The RKO jungle set which was originally used for The Most Dangerous Game and then for King Kong was not a cliché yet to be seen a hundred or so films during the life of that studio. Still fans of the classic films can't possibly miss those same sets and stock footage. No wonder the Tarzan series eventually came to this studio.Of course the South Sea island natives don't bear any resemblance to folks of African descent. But a lot of black people were grateful for the paycheck as extras to be natives here during the Depression. But for 1933 the special effects were a marvel, the creation of those ancient Jurassic beasts and the 50 foot gorilla that was King Kong still make you gasp. Most of all the sincere playing of the three leads all of whom got their career roles from this film. Stalwart Bruce Cabot, helpless heroine Fay Wray, and brash producer Robert Armstrong do make you believe in their performances. Even Fay Wray who mostly just screamed and looked helpless got more out of that than most actresses do with a few pages of dialog.I marvel also at the expressions that Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack's camera recorded on the miniature that served as King Kong. Movies were only six years away from when they learned to talk, so I think it helped that so many who must have worked on King Kong had experience in silent film. Look at the range of emotions they capture from the beast, watching him is like watching a performance from some of the best of the silent screen stars when facial expressions and much gesticulation had to compensate for lack of dialog. Especially that death scene in the end, like seeing Pagliacci.I must have first seen King Kong as a lad on WOR channel 9 when that stationed filled its broadcast time with a library of RKO classics. It was probably before I was in kindergarten, it fascinated me then.And it still fascinates me now.

Hogan is quite charming as Nick Dundee, the Australian Croc wrangler. Overall, I'm not sure there is any great acting on his part - you get the feel he is just great at simply being himself in this movie. I think this is proved out by the fact that his movie career never really took off outside of the Dundee franchise.Hogan and co-start Linda Kozlowski seem to have a good chemistry going between them - but turns out this wasn't really due to good acting on their part either. They became a real life couple soon after, wherein he divorced his wife of almost 30 years and married Linda within the year.But there is a definite charm to the movie. It of course looks very dated now and not sure how much it will stand the test of time as being a truly classic movie. But there is fun to be had in watching this. As a side note; I was in my 20's when this film came out and was told I could pass for Linda's twin!
