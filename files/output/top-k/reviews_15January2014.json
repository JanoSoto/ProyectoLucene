Actually, I know every year what picture is going to win the Oscar for best picture. Well, I read the reviews along time ago about City Of Angels and decided not to watch it. However, nothing was on TV the other night that interested me, and City Of Angels was on Starzs, so I decided to watch a little. I ended up watching the whole Movie. Then watched it again when it came back on. This picture was way under rated. Meg Ryan was brilliant. Nicolas Cage was the perfect person to play Seth. I don't think it was Nicolas''s best picture, but he was cool. I think they could have did the story line a little better, but the music made this movie even better. A class singers! It is a tear jerker, chick flick, but well worth for any guy to watch. The part that really summed up this whole movie was when Nicolas Cage was asked by his counter part Angel If you knew this would happened, would you have done it. Nicolas quoted, I give up eternity just to have touched her, held her, for just one day. Meg Ryan's acting made that very believe able. This could have won an Oscar if they changed the story line a little in the middle of the movie; However, kept the beginning and the end. Beautiful Movie, Excellent love story, Great cast, Wonderful music. I recommend watching it. It hits your heart and reminds me why I married my wife, she is an Angel.

Believe it or not, I mean that as a compliment. There's a lot of death and decay in this movie, a lot of rotten, messy decomposition. What is unsettling is that this atmosphere of rot and decay fills long silences in which nothing seems to be happening, we wait and wait for it to lead somewhere. Unfortunately, it finally does. For me, the long silences are scarier than a chainsaw.I've begun to realize the best of the horror genre seems to subsist on atmosphere when it comes up short on having a story to tell. Atmosphere can breed many things, many emotions, many fears. That's especially true when your movie persists on little more than a pudgy maniac wielding a chainsaw. The very best thing about this movie is that it never seems to feel like someone made a movie. Shot on a low budget My memories of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre seem to have been filled with buzzing saw noises and sudden bursts of violence that well up about of nearly dead quiet. What had slipped my mind, in the years since I first saw the film was that, for much of the time, there seems to be almost no sound at all. Those moments, to be quite honest, are far more potent than a woman hanging from a meat hook. This is a gross, desolate, grisly and unsettling little film in which the horror seems to come from nowhere.The story you know Five kids in a van are driving across the ass-end of Texas looking for their grandfather's old house. They pick up a hitchhiker who seems two tacos short of a combination plate. When he cuts one of their number on the leg, they dump in on the road. The obvious question, why don't they turn around?

The original French title of this film was La Pianiste which literally means The Pianist, as does Jelinek's title Die Klavierspielerin. This title was not, however, used in English, doubtless to avoid confusion with Roman Polanski's film of that name. The main character is Erika Kohut, a professional pianist and a piano professor at a Vienna music conservatory. Outwardly Erika is a reserved, repressed and puritanical individual. Although she is already in her forties she still lives at home with her elderly, domineering mother; the two even share the same bed. We never see Erika's g father but learn that he is incarcerated in a psychiatric asylum. There is, however, a hidden side to her personality, first revealed when we see her acting as a Peeping Tom, spying on courting couples at a drive-in cinema. More of this hidden side is revealed when Erika begins a sexual relationship with a good-looking young pupil, Walter Klemmer. Although Walter is physically attracted to his teacher, he is repelled by her sadomasochistic tendencies, which leads to a curious love-hate relationship growing up between them. Erika's speciality as a pianist is Schumann and Schubert; Schubert's music plays a particularly important part in the film. This struck me as very appropriate, as his music has always struck me, like that of Mozart, as being full of emotion but hiding it behind a veil of reserve, in contrast to the much more openly emotional and Romantic music of slightly later composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner. I felt, however, that the film rather pandered to the Hollywood myth of Schubert as a shy, ugly little man who poured into his music all the emotions he could not express in life; in reality he seems to have been a successful womaniser, even though he was far from handsome. Isabelle Huppert is often compelling, and Annie Girardot is also good as Erika's witch-like mother, but this is not a film I cared for. In what is supposedly a character study far too much is left unexplained, such as the incident in which Erika deliberately injures one of her female students by putting broken glass in her coat pocket. In the violent sexual encounters between Erika and Walter it is never made clear whether he is abusing her or merely pandering to her masochistic tendencies. Haneke (who acted as scriptwriter as well as director) might think that this distinction does not matter, but I felt that it was very relevant to an understanding of Erika's character. The Piano Teacher seems to have been intended as a dark, disturbing psychological study, but I found that it did not do much to explain Erika's behaviour except in terms of that old get-out sexual repression; there are doubtless many people who are sexually repressed, but most of them do not behave in the same way as Erika, who appears to be verging on the criminally insane. The Piano Teacher may be dark and disturbing, but it disturbs us to no good purpose and hides little of substance beneath its darkness. Having been greatly impressed by Haneke's more recent The White Ribbon, I was very disappointed by this film. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 January 2014","score":"","review":" Although  The Piano Teacher is a French film with dialogue in French, it is set in Austria, based on a novel by an Austrian writer (Elfriede Jelinek) and directed by an Austrian-born director, Michael Haneke.

They find that they must work as a team to try and figure out how to get out of the maze. Of course, it isn't as straight forward as it first seems as there are thousands of rooms and when the team discover that some rooms are booby trapped, the task of getting out proves to be far more difficult than they ever could have imagined.The 7 protagonists are Leaven (mathematical whizz kid), Quentin (a police officer and self appointed leader), Worth (the man responsible for designing the outside of the cube, but has no knowledge of the inside of the cube) Kazan (a man who is mentally handicapped and also suffering from severe autism - he can work out astronomical sums in his head and is a very similar character to Raymond Babbitt who Dustin Hoffman portrayed in 'Rain Man') Holloway (a doctor) Rennes (a prison escapee) and Alderson (gets killed off in the first 2 minutes - no background info).The main strengths in this film arise from the characters themselves - right from the start there is an immediate sense of paranoia. None of the characters trust each other and you're never quite sure whether all of the characters are genuine or whether certain characters are 'traps' - this is what hooks you in. The very fact that you are never sure is what makes the film interesting and it ultimately makes the characters interesting as well. Although, there are no particularly 'big name' stars in here I felt that all the actors gave believable performances (particular praise should go to Miller in the role of the mentally handicapped\/autistic character of Kazan). It's not easy to pull off this type of role convincingly, but I felt that Miller was right on the money and gave a truly brilliant performance. It's quite clear after watching Cube where Wan & Whannell got some of their influence when making the first Saw film - the booby traps, working out puzzles, strangers being trapped in a room together. Both films share similar themes and both of these films are intelligent and exciting.Whilst this film has many strengths and is both intelligent and engaging, there was one major problem; Why were these particular protagonists left in the Cube together?. It's a question that the protagonists ask each other at the start which we never get an answer to. I got subtle hints that some characters were maybe put in there due to areas of expertise (prison escape and mathematical skills) and other characters were placed in there as punishment (such as Quentin with his treatment of his wife and neglecting his kids). But by who and why? We're never given an explanation and that came as a big disappointment as I felt that there was no closure at the end of the film.Despite this gripe, this was a very impressive film. The acting was great, the direction was solid and all of the characters were interesting. The script (for the most part) was intelligent and the film is tense and engaging.

Of course, it isn't as straight forward as it first seems as there are thousands of rooms and when the team discover that some rooms are booby trapped, the task of getting out proves to be far more difficult than they ever could have imagined.The 7 protagonists are Leaven (mathematical whizz kid), Quentin (a police officer and self appointed leader), Worth (the man responsible for designing the outside of the cube, but has no knowledge of the inside of the cube) Kazan (a man who is mentally handicapped and also suffering from severe autism - he can work out astronomical sums in his head and is a very similar character to Raymond Babbitt who Dustin Hoffman portrayed in 'Rain Man') Holloway (a doctor) Rennes (a prison escapee) and Alderson (gets killed off in the first 2 minutes - no background info).The main strengths in this film arise from the characters themselves - right from the start there is an immediate sense of paranoia. None of the characters trust each other and you're never quite sure whether all of the characters are genuine or whether certain characters are 'traps' - this is what hooks you in. The very fact that you are never sure is what makes the film interesting and it ultimately makes the characters interesting as well. Although, there are no particularly 'big name' stars in here I felt that all the actors gave believable performances (particular praise should go to Miller in the role of the mentally handicapped\/autistic character of Kazan). It's not easy to pull off this type of role convincingly, but I felt that Miller was right on the money and gave a truly brilliant performance. It's quite clear after watching Cube where Wan & Whannell got some of their influence when making the first Saw film - the booby traps, working out puzzles, strangers being trapped in a room together. Both films share similar themes and both of these films are intelligent and exciting.Whilst this film has many strengths and is both intelligent and engaging, there was one major problem; Why were these particular protagonists left in the Cube together?. It's a question that the protagonists ask each other at the start which we never get an answer to. I got subtle hints that some characters were maybe put in there due to areas of expertise (prison escape and mathematical skills) and other characters were placed in there as punishment (such as Quentin with his treatment of his wife and neglecting his kids). But by who and why? We're never given an explanation and that came as a big disappointment as I felt that there was no closure at the end of the film.Despite this gripe, this was a very impressive film. The acting was great, the direction was solid and all of the characters were interesting. The script (for the most part) was intelligent and the film is tense and engaging. It's a solid film that is definitely worth watching.

In the '90s I had seen the remake without knowing of the original or even the novel, and I liked it, pretty much loved it; the fact that the good guy wins was something I could live with. But, then I heard of 'Spoorloos' and had to see it. And they feel like different films in some respects. The setting of this original, in picturesque France (at many times while the Tour de France is going on in the background via car radios and such) is perfect, where the setting of the remake is mostly simply sufficient. Of course, the dark ending is a better choice in itself, BUT the fact that Rex finally succumbs to Raymond's proposition can only mean that he has gone completely crazy. Even if the build-up unveils his haphazard, romantic character quite clearly at several moments, his final choice still is a bridge too far for me (which would be a problem in the remake too, of course). The romance becomes a nihilistic affair.In spite of that big point of critique, this original has still so much to offer that I can not stay mad at its ending. The acting is great (even if I didn't know what to think of Johanna ter Steege's contribution at times - great, and wholly in spirit with those peculiar '80s? or awkwardly forced? I can't decide), the story takes many interesting turns, the cinematography is wonderful, etc., etc..So, still a big 8 out of 10. I'm not going to try the remake again for a while, though...

It is a kind of the movie that needs to be re watched time and again to be understood completely.

After every viewing it discloses something new, some references that were previously unnoticed and are a delight for the the book readers. Like the references to Smaug at the start, the undying lands Valor etc. The list goes on and on.It fairs even better as a stand alone film. If Tolkien was alive, Jackson's vision of middle earth and its characters certainly would have made him proud.

I got it on video and remember re-watching it a number of times and still being struck by the power of the story and performances.However, I've just watched it for the first time in over 10 years on DVD and have to say that it doesn't seem quite as strong a film as I used to imagine. My old impression was that it avoided the clichés of the weaker 'ghetto' movies particularly, those pieces of dialogue that are so clumsily shoehorned in to emphasise the social point being made, they make you wince. Maybe it's unfair to suggest this film can be rather glib or clichéd at times but there are some awkward moments, largely due to wooden acting from the young actors playing Grace and Boogie. I thought that Kerr-Bell was great when I first saw it but I wasn't quite so impressed this last time.It is a gripping and harrowing drama, though, and the leads are fantastic. Morrison's part could have been an exercise in scenery-chewing if not handled right, but it's a very assured performance and he brings such conviction to the role that his character is truly believable. Frightening but compelling, Jake is a horrendous, damaged and utterly selfish person but you feel his charisma and he can turn on the charm when he wants to. Owen's Beth starts the film displaying a weary playfulness as she tries to stay strong for her children while her disgust with Jake's selfish and violent behaviour is reaching the limits of tolerance. When it all spirals out of control, Owen brings a strength and dignity to the role that make Beth such a memorable heroine. Cliff Curtis as slimy Uncle Bully is pretty good, too.

The film is really two parallel character studies--one of a con man, the other of a psychopath. Oskar Schindler, who swindles the Third Reich, and Amon Goeth, who represents its pure evil, are men created by the opportunities of war.In telling their stories, Steven Spielberg found a way to approach the Holocaust, which is a subject too vast and tragic to be encompassed in any reasonable way by fiction. In the ruins of the saddest story of the century, he found, not a happy ending, but at least one affirming that resistance to evil is possible and can succeed. In the face of the Nazi charnel houses, it is a statement that has to be made, or we sink into despair.The film's ending brings me to tears. At the end of the war, Schindler's Jews are in a strange land--stranded, but alive. A member of the liberating Russian forces asks them, Isn't a town over there? and they walk off toward the horizon. The next shot fades from black and white into color. At first we think it may be a continuation of the previous action, until we see that the men and women on the crest of the hill are dressed differently now. And then it strikes us, with the force of a blow Those are Schindler's Jews. We are looking at the actual survivors and their children as they visit Oskar Schindler's grave. The movie began with a list of Jews being confined to the ghetto. It ends with a list of some who were saved. The list is an absolute good. The list is life.What is most amazing about this film is how completely Spielberg serves his story. The movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen. Individual scenes are masterpieces of art direction, cinematography, special effects, crowd control.

We all have secrets we don't want anyone to know about. Its personal information that is only given out to the most trusted of people - mainly close family and friends. But there's a difference when that secret crosses the line on ethics and morals. When it comes to this, people lie, and lying is never a good thing. The act of lying will always catch up somewhere and somehow. Everyone has a conscious, it's the device that let's the person know what they're doing wrong. And if the individual cannot justify to themselves why the secret they're keeping is for the right reason, their conscious will eat them alive. Almost like a self-destruct button. Some can repress this feeling while many others crack under pressure.This reflects on the story of Danny Ciello (Treat Williams), a New York cop who joined the force to make a difference and be a good person for society. However, it's not until he's is asked by a commission of investigators to spy on the system that he works at for possible corruption. Originally, Ciello is skeptical about the matter because he doesn't want to stab his fellow cops in the back, but he is convinced otherwise. And to his dismay, the longer he stayed in the business, the scarier the information became. Thus leading to an investigation brought onto himself.This kind of plot is very serious in nature because of how it focuses on morals and how people with even the kindest of hearts can fall. This is also the kind of drama that audiences should have the patience to sit through. The running time is almost three hours long because it carefully follows the path of the human struggle between knowing what is the right and wrong thing to do when it comes to telling the truth. The length may annoy some but the story should be powerful enough to keep people focused. And the writing not only covers the story of one man, but several people involved with the lies and how they deal with the stress they induce on themselves. Family life is also included although by the finale the closure isn't as strong as the rest. That also may upset some.The cast is very large in this movie. Treat Williams as the main character gives a memorable performance as the troubled cop. His reactions to many situations closely resemble to how anyone would react if they were in his shoes. It's a very human performance. Even a very young Lance Henriksen has a number of his own scenes. There's also a character named Gus Levy played by Jerry Obach, he would later voice Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast (1991) ten years later. Cool. Although the rating is R, it's more for language and a few beatings nothing gruesome or over the top.The music composed by Paul Chihara is unique too. It's certainly one the most absent of scores I've ever heard but it also helps make the story feel more realistic. This is one of the few times where the music doesn't need to be present to give emotion because the actors themselves give a lot as it is already. There is also a main theme, which is carried out by a saxophone that is good. But the one thing I liked most about this movie was how audience should feel at the end credits. In a court trial, no matter if one walks away guilty or innocent, the past will always be there to haunt them. People will always remember the bad and never your good deeds. And from that day on, the individual must constantly fight to uphold the respect they lost. That's the human struggle and it can be so terrifying. It's a movie that should been seen and understood at least once.The acting led by Treat Williams is very good. Its running time may be lengthy but its story richly consists of powerful emotions and life lessons that demand to be seen just for that.

Its running time may be lengthy but its story richly consists of powerful emotions and life lessons that demand to be seen just for that.

We all have secrets we don't want anyone to know about. Its personal information that is only given out to the most trusted of people - mainly close family and friends. But there's a difference when that secret crosses the line on ethics and morals. When it comes to this, people lie, and lying is never a good thing. The act of lying will always catch up somewhere and somehow. Everyone has a conscious, it's the device that let's the person know what they're doing wrong. And if the individual cannot justify to themselves why the secret they're keeping is for the right reason, their conscious will eat them alive. Almost like a self-destruct button. Some can repress this feeling while many others crack under pressure.This reflects on the story of Danny Ciello (Treat Williams), a New York cop who joined the force to make a difference and be a good person for society. However, it's not until he's is asked by a commission of investigators to spy on the system that he works at for possible corruption. Originally, Ciello is skeptical about the matter because he doesn't want to stab his fellow cops in the back, but he is convinced otherwise. And to his dismay, the longer he stayed in the business, the scarier the information became. Thus leading to an investigation brought onto himself.This kind of plot is very serious in nature because of how it focuses on morals and how people with even the kindest of hearts can fall. This is also the kind of drama that audiences should have the patience to sit through. The running time is almost three hours long because it carefully follows the path of the human struggle between knowing what is the right and wrong thing to do when it comes to telling the truth. The length may annoy some but the story should be powerful enough to keep people focused. And the writing not only covers the story of one man, but several people involved with the lies and how they deal with the stress they induce on themselves. Family life is also included although by the finale the closure isn't as strong as the rest. That also may upset some.The cast is very large in this movie. Treat Williams as the main character gives a memorable performance as the troubled cop. His reactions to many situations closely resemble to how anyone would react if they were in his shoes. It's a very human performance. Even a very young Lance Henriksen has a number of his own scenes. There's also a character named Gus Levy played by Jerry Obach, he would later voice Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast (1991) ten years later. Cool. Although the rating is R, it's more for language and a few beatings nothing gruesome or over the top.The music composed by Paul Chihara is unique too. It's certainly one the most absent of scores I've ever heard but it also helps make the story feel more realistic. This is one of the few times where the music doesn't need to be present to give emotion because the actors themselves give a lot as it is already. There is also a main theme, which is carried out by a saxophone that is good. But the one thing I liked most about this movie was how audience should feel at the end credits.
