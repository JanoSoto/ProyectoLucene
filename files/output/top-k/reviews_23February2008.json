I don't think they did. I'm told by my film making student brother that Spielberg and George Lucas made this with a certain amount of 'camp' in mind to pay homage to the action serials of the 1930's and 1940's which they pull off brilliantly. The budget on Raiders of The Lost Ark was eighteen million dollars, which was no paltry sum almost 30 years ago but it was far from being a big budget picture which went on to gross over 200 million dollars domestically. As brilliant as the film is for adventure I owe the success to ONE man and that IS Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford but more on that in a moment. I don't believe they knew they were making adventure genre history when they made this. First of all it wasn't Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark...he wasn't the focal point of the film. It was about the snakes and boulders and exotic locations, and wise cracks, and romance and just everything about it oozes 1940 classic cinema and people loved it. It is very unique and as a kid it blew me away and kept me riveted. I ALWAYS wanted to be Indiana Jones...ALWAYS. Watching it again years later I admit it didn't quite capture me in the same way but you can't dispute it's brilliance and effect on cinematic history.Harrison Ford was probably one of the biggest stars in the world. Coming out of Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back it only made sense for Lucas and Spielberg to bring him on this project and he created one of the world's most recognizable and kick ass heroes that he will forever be known for. Ford is hilarious, and smart, and brilliant, and fast and an action hero like none other. His Indiana Jones is probably one of my favorite film characters of all time. He made this film and took an adventure film and made it a whole new genre...the Indiana Jones film. That sly smile and almost clumsy but always suave way makes him amazing. One thing that always rubbed me wrong about the Indiana Jones films was I am never a fan of his women and Karen Allen is really no exception. Her performance is okay but she just doesn't mesh well with Ford and she has to. Her sarcastic, feisty character just annoys more than anything. You don't believe a romance between them and you don't really want her saved. Paul Freeman is devilish and wicked as the villain of the film trying everything he can to kill Jones and make off with the ark for Hitler himself. His end in the film is one of the most memorable and gruesome in my mind. The brilliant and versatile supporting cast all play to one end and that is to lift up the character of Dr. Indiana Jones and that is perfect because Ford could carry this film or any other all the way through. John Rhys-Davies (an amazing character actor and does terrific as the sidekick), and Denholm Elliott, who I always loved as Jones' faithful friend in all three films.Spielberg is the master of directing...he IS directing and Raiders of the Lost Ark is an example of what he can do with a story and a great character. I mean this film created historical cinematic moments that will be remembered for ever. Indiana Jones, his whip, the boulder chasing him, switching the statue for the bag of sand, snakes...he hates snakes...everything about this film is classic. As an adult you might find it a little campy, almost a mocking tone to it but I don't think that's the intention. I think it was simply meant to represent a different time and genre and it succeeds in a big way. A film that everyone MUST MUST MUST see even if it isn't a HUGE 10\/10 for me...I do give it all it's honor for being what it is. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 February 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Did anyone know when they released Raiders of the Lost Ark that they were making history?

The war in pretty much incidental. It is just there because a movie about soldiers without some mention of war would be incomplete it is was soldiers are meant for. It is what they are prepared and trained for. Then when the time comes and war starts, the soldiers go to work for better or worse.This film doesn't glorify war nor does it really vilify it. War is horrible, no question about it. Many good people die, though many end up living. Many bad people die, though many end up living. Many friendships are broken due to loss, though many are formed through camaraderie. As I said before, the film is about the soldiers and upon viewing this film you can see what soldiers have to do as a part of their job. Thus, it is no mistake that the ever perfectionist director Stanley Kubrick chose Vietnam as his film's war-zone. It was an enormously complex era in the US military with many people for the war and many against. It was also a time when military training was different then it is now and the Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is an embodiment of that past. He cannot be vilified since he does what he was trained to do and does it out of necessity. Same with all the other soldiers, thus it is not the soldiers who should be blamed. It's the upper brass who deserve blame and Kubrick leaves them out of the film probably since he wasn't trying to point fingers at anyone or anything. Even with films like 'A Clockwark Orange' it is apparent that Kubrick would rather present the problem from many sides and then let his own audience engage in the analysis. He was director who engaged his audience and he did it very well.What he was trying to say was an anti-war message, but only in part. The bulk of the matter at hand is that you give credit where credit is due and credit is due when work has been done. And who does the work, the real tough and dirty work in a war? The soldiers, and they go through hell doing it. Some don't make it even out of basic training let alone war.

Hats off to the director\/writer for achieving the necessary balance between fantasy and realism (i.e., taking you to a surreal place whilst not destroying the human perspective).But the downside... I feel that the director failed to cultivate some of the excellent philosophies which were barely touched upon. This could have been accomplished with more dialogue. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of *talking* in the movie, but it's mostly anecdotal (people wistfully reminiscing about the past). There wasn't enough analysis and barely any *dialogue* (people communicating with each other).Without ruining anything, I'll give you one example. The premise is, of course, if you had to pick one memory to relive forever, which would you choose? One character simply refuses to pick. This is brilliant. As soon as he takes his position, which he does in the first 10 minutes of the film, it woke me up and made me wonder why he would choose this unconventional act of defiance.But much to my disappointment, this central theme is abandoned. The character is hardly seen again. He does deliver an interesting monologue towards the end which is encapsulated in a single powerful statement he says (I won't tell you what it is). But I couldn't help feeling as if the director didn't really follow through with his philosophy.Perhaps that was the intent of the director to present us only with fragments so that we may ponder the philosophy ourselves. But that approach somewhat betrays the nature of art. Art, I believe, should do its best to communicate a complete idea, and *then* open up the floor for discussion. Anything less is a mere Rorshach test. Or whatever you call those inkblot thingees that psychologists use to probe your mind.As you can probably guess, I'm not a big fan of the Minimalist movement.Another gripe... Some of the interesting philosophical points were shoved aside to make room for the romantic sub-plot, which I found to be a bit forced and unbelievable. I would have preferred to see the director stick to the heavier issues. If this is truly a film about deep spirituality, why dedicate so much time to a teenage girl's crush on a guy?So my overall criticism is that there wasn't enough substance presented. I admit there IS the possibility that the dialogue\/philosophy I craved was lost in translation. It is possible that the English subtitles didn't convey the philosophy inherent in the original Japanese. That's been known to happen.But still, I think this film could have truly benefited by a good old fashioned Shakespearian soliloquy, like Hamlet Act III Sc 1, to help clarify the director's message.Well, here I've wasted my whole review babbling about philosophy, and I haven't touched upon the technical merits of this film. Let me just wrap up by reiterating that THIS IS A GOOD FILM despite my criticism. I love the way the director achieved a surreal feeling without using gimmicky, schlocky clichés like pearly gates and angels and pixie dust. Everything about the production is firmly rooted in reality despite the very unrealistic nature, and that achieves a very bizarre and clever paradox. Also there's no music at all. It's an original, I'll definitely give it that! Give it a whirl. I'll probably watch it a 2nd time myself.

She's driving to see her boyfriend (John Gavin) and run away with him. She stops overnight at the Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his cranky unseen mother...I don't deny that this movie is masterfully done by Alfred Hitchcock--the direction here is incredible. The justly famous shower scene and the murder of Arbogast are still shocking. The music score by Bernard Herrmann fits the film perfectly too. It's all well-done...but I'm not crazy (sorry) about it. Maybe it's because of my first time seeing it. I saw it in third grade on late night TV. The shower scene was completely cut out as was the explanation at the end! I was totally lost. So I thought it was a stupid, pointless movie. It's neither of course but first impressions are hard to ignore.This is one of Hitchcock's true horror films. It was made in black and white on a low budget with a crew taken from Hitchcock's TV show. Also most of the cast took a cut in pay just to work with him. No one thought this would work but it's now considered a classic. I like it a lot but I find some of the acting stiff (Vera Miles and John Gavin especially) and some boring sequences. Let's face it--we all know Norman is his mother so that sort of lessens the movie. Leigh is good in her role and Perkins is just incredible in his. He rightfully plays Bates as a shy awkward little boy--but you see the madness lurking inside him. A truly great performance that came far too soon for Perkins and (sadly) destroyed his career. It's worth seeing of course but I consider Rope or North by Northwest as being much better films. Ignore the stupid R rating this still carries--it would get a PG-13 today.

I saw the third first and then watched the first, because I really enjoyed the third. Either way I didn't enjoy the first as much as I enjoyed the third. The first is the same concept, Kid gets on plane, kid gets premonition, kid freaks out, kid gets in a fight which gets them thrown off the plane, idiot guy who thinks its all stupid and so on. Final destination is quite slow paced as well. It has to explain the premonition and the clues and why this is all happening and stuff, which I think even if I hadn't seen the third, I would have understood without all the talking. The deaths were no where near as gruesome as I expected either. They seemed quite simple, but that shouldn't be thought too much about, I mean this was the first film, they were exploring what they could do. Some scenes are very well done though. One scene that stands out for me is a scene when Carter's car is on the tracks and a train is coming right for it. That scene is incredibly tense, and I honestly was almost standing up screaming at the T.V for him to get out of the car. Another thing about this film that is good, is that it's unpredictable. I had no idea when some deaths were going to occur, which made it a lot more creepy. This film played on my mind a lot more than the third, because in this one things happen for no reason, such as water leaking out of the toilet, there was no reason for that to happen, but in the third it's more in stages, such as temperature turned up in room caused the fan to come on which caused the palm tree to fall over which caused the CD rack to fall and so on. I do think that most people would love this film, because even though it is slow the acting is good, it's tense, very unpredictable and a lot scarier than the third. I must say that I love the third film, and was slightly disappointed when I watched th first, but I still love the final destination series. It's definitely worth the watch, especially if you have seen the others, because for one you will understand the others a lot more.

However, she's deathly afraid to fly and refuses to go. Unfortunately, shortly after he arrives, he meets and falls in love with another woman. When Ryan finds out, she forces herself to board a plane and goes to Paris--with the intention of getting Hutton back. Along the way, she meets up with a fast-talking crook, Kevin Kline, and her plans don't go exactly as she expected.It's hard to love the movie FRENCH KISS, though it is a diverting little romantic-comedy. The reason is that although the movie does a great job of setting the right romantic mood, the characters are so flawed that the whole package just doesn't make sense. Now if you can turn off your brain and not think about the plot and character holes, you'll no doubt enjoy the film much more.So what is it, exactly, that I didn't like? Well, it was really very tough to like the characters. To begin with, Kline was a habitually lying thief. Then, Ryan was so neurotic and so needy that you wondered what man would want her. After all, the man who was engaged to her dumps her and yet she goes to Paris to beg him to return! What a wiener!! As for Hutton, he was a total slug....period. And for his new girlfriend, she was no better.Despite all this, there is lots of lovely music, nice scenery and Kevin Kline did an amazing job playing a French man, though I do wonder why they just didn't have the supporting actor, Jean Reno, play the part. After all, he is French and is quite the leading man in France. But no matter. This is pleasant and undemanding fare--nothing more and nothing less.

But what I sometimes get annoyed at (and Man in the Iron Mask had the exact same problem) is that everyone is oohing and awwing at Leo's hotness when they don't realize the philosophy behind it. The real message of this movie is that if we knew what would happen tomorrow, there would be no point in living. We just have to take things as they come because there is no predicting what tomorrow will hold. So basically, caution is life's curse. Another philosophical message of this movie which is also political is that we have no control over the lives we're born into. We just have to make the best of them. I love this movie and I wish others would appreciate it the same way that I do.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"23 February 2008","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Had I gone into the film cold, I would have thought it came from Hitchcock, employing elements from that director's bag of cinematic tricks. You've got the spiral staircase motif initially seen way back in 1929's Blackmail and later given more profound treatment in 1958's Vertigo. There's also the amusement park background that provided suspense in the latter part of Strangers On A Train. But the thing that really appealed to me was the insertion of a key Hitchcockian element suggested by the movie's title. The 'third man' upon reflection seems to be one of the all time great maguffins of cinema history. In all actuality, there never really was a 'third man', unless one considers Harry Lime to be that character. For that though, he would have had to be at his own 'death' as the unknown individual who helped two other men remove a hit and run victim from the middle of a road.Which upon reflection, makes the core premise of the story very confusing. Not that Harry Lime wouldn't have wanted to fake his own death, but why didn't anyone who attended his funeral realize that it wasn't Harry in the coffin? The real victim wasn't in a very good position to hide his identity, so how did the appearance of Harry Lime's burial come to be accepted as fact? And why was that body so easily identifiable upon exhumation as the medical orderly Joseph Harbin who worked for Harry in the illicit penicillin trade? If you really think about these issues, most of the story seems to unravel regarding the main plot.Yet the story works on an entirely different level once you get beyond that particular point. Harry Lime winds up alive halfway through the picture, and spends the rest of his time trying to stay a step ahead of his friend Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who's intent on solving the mystery behind Harry's 'death'. What makes the film so intriguing is the deft camera work and the battered post-war setting of Vienna, Austria. The picture simply wouldn't work in color, it's the stark black and white cinematography that contributes to the harrowing cat and mouse game between Harry, Martins and the authorities.You really have to study Orson Welles' performance in the picture to see just what a great actor he was. He doesn't have a lot of screen time here, but everything he does is memorable, right from that first haunting appearance under the street lamp. His conversation with Martins on the ferris wheel is perfectly nuanced and laced with palpable threat; it's just a perfect scene. You have to go well beyond the subtlety of his outward demeanor to realize what a true low life his character actually is.

The effects were nothing to write home about, but they weren't horrible. At least this was before CG was on the open market, so they stuck with practical effects (which, in my opinion, are underrated). The acting was par for the course, but I feel Diane Ladd did a pretty good mad scientist with Tiptree. Mainly Raphael Sbarge was a good washed-up drunk with Doc Smith. Some things made the movie a little tedious (the romantic plot between Thrush and Doc, Clint Howard's character, etc.) but I found this an overall enjoyable cheesy gore-ride of fun weirdness.Watch if you are used to horrifically cheesy movies.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 February 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Well, what can I say?
