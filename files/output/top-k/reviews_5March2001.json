It is at once a black comedy, a horror movie with a unique setting, and a biting sendup of the art and business of moviemaking.  And the fact is that it wears each of these hats quite well, although not necessarily at the same time.The movie asks us to imagine  What if Max Schreck, the mysterious guy who gave what is still considered one of the best vampire performances ever, did so well because, well, he really was a vampire?  The skulking creature, we are to imagine, was finagled into performing in Nosferatu for legendary cinema pioneer F.W. Murnau.  The story then follows as the crew makes the movie dealing with all sorts of difficulties, not the least of which is the star's habit of snacking on cameramen.Among the film's many virtues is its portrayal of filmmaking in what was really its dawn as a form of art and commerce.  People like me, who have trouble with silent movies may gain an additional appreciation for the work and craft that went in to them, and realize that while they may seem hokey and stylized to us now, they had a beauty and substance that was all their own, and still is.John Malkovich turns in a great performance as the visionary Murnau (who, while tortured, must be a genius because he always gets it in one take). It is a characteristic Malkovich role, a rationalist given to bouts of fury, and it is as much fun to see him discourse pretentiously on the science and art of the moving image as it is to see him pitch a fit (Albon, a NATIVE has wandered into my FRAME!).The core of this movie, however, and deservedly so, is Willem Dafoe's unforgettable portrayal of Schreck.  This is not your slick-talking Anne-Rice undead-Vogue kinda vampire.  Schreck is the next thing up from a rat, squatting in filth and clicking his claws, and Dafoe is able to inspire laughter as well as fear, and even pathos.  He makes us imagine what a rotten existence it must be, to have eternal life alone in a rotting ruin and a withered body.  He and Malkovich have some great scenes together, including a sick, hilarious moment when Schreck and Murnau try to hammer out who on the crew may or may not be snacked upon (the cinematographer is necessary, it seems, but the script girl is negotiable).The movie functions best as a sendup of moviemaking, as the harried Murnau must deal with temperamental actors, unfriendly locals, blood-sucking undead, and other hazards of the movie trade.  At one point, Murnau must leave to calm the investors, a scene I really wish had been included. Some of the best moments are those of the age-old creature of the night attempting to take direction and find his motivation.  Everyone is afraid of Schreck, but admire the dedication that keeps him in character all the time (he's a Method actor, explains Murnau, he studied with Stanislavsky). The movie makes its point rather neatly, that filmmakers, and by extension filmmaking itself, have a way of sucking the life and blood out of you. Anyone who has ever had to shoot a movie on location will attest to this.If I have a complaint about the movie, it is only that after its extreme cleverness, it settles for a somewhat straightforward horror-style denouement.  Myself, I would have thought the vampire would end up moving to Berlin and getting an agent, a swimming pool, and a meeting with Ovitz. Still, the movie clearly makes its point an auteur driven by a mania for artistic perfection can be more of a monster than something that just lives in a cave and drinks blood from your neck.

Anyone disliking this movie because it doesn't break originality barriers is missing the point. This movie doesn't even try to be big or clever. It's just tries to be a traditional comedy movie. Those who didn't know about the original Mr Bean series probably won't find this film at all interesting. But Rowan Atkinson, possibly one of the best British comedians plays a very appealing and clever, if somewhat shy character. I used to watch the old Bean series back when I was 12, now I'm 18, when I saw this movie advertised I thought `Oh god, I've grown out of this rubbish.' Well, I sat down when this premiered, and I was really surprised. I thought some of the scenes were hilarious. Like for example, where he believes the middle finger signal is a greeting.

With the kind of high art that exists in European film, this film feels superfluous. What is its use? Is it an exploration of the crime genre? An homage? A parody? If it is any of those, it is just barely. It seemed more to me like a standard heist film with a couple of peculiarities. One of those peculiarities, the musical score, I would rate as excellent. There are a lot of neat little things to hear on the soundtrack, like the tiny bells we hear at one point when Bob flips his coin. Once in a while the editing or cinematography or direction would turn up something interesting. I like the neat downward wipe from the old woman who plops down on her chair to Bob and Anne in Bob's apartment. Some of the camera angles were great. I liked the scene with Bob in his triangular kitchen.What Bob le Flambeur lacks, though, is any characters with whom to identify. None of them are well developed. The film actually has a pretty good first act. When I first met the characters, I liked them. But they never went anywhere. Bob, who is, of course, the main character, is given a somewhat built-up past, but his present character and his motivations were, to me, often vague. Whatever character I saw in him I must have, as I later (during the film) realized, inferred from other films that are either very similar or directly referencing this film. Polo should have been more well developed. He had no real history, and his actions seemed to do nothing in the way of his development, but rather were only useful for the advancement of the plot. Likewise Anne. She provided the best hook, since the actress who plays her is very beautiful, but her character is little more than a plot device. The little character that she had was squandered. Her situation seemed interesting, but it never went anywhere. All the other characters were more or less unmemorable. The detective was somewhat interesting, but I never got enough information to feel anything about him.Two other films were constantly swimming in my mind as I grew more and more bored during this film Stanley Kubrick's The Killing and P.T. Anderson's Hard Eight. The Killing is one of Kubrick's least interesting films for precisely the same reasons that I dislike Bob le Flambeur it is stuck in the genre of the heist flick, and comes nowhere near passing the boundaries that its genre sets up for it. The heist flick is actually more of a sub-genre, and the more sub you get, the fewer variations there are. I was sure all through the film that The Killing was made before Bob le Flambeur, but it actually came out a year later. Either it takes a lot from Bob le Flambeur or I am right heist flicks have no ability for variation. The jury is still out on P.T. Anderson. All three of his films, Hard Eight, Boogie Night, and Magnolia seemed great when I first saw them, but they feel weaker every time I think about them. My opinion on the quality of each of his films changes often, and my opinion on which one is most valuable changes, too. Hard Eight may be his best film. I did not realize, though I should have assumed, that its plot was stolen from somewhere else. And that somewhere else happens to be Bob le Flambeur. It doesn't steal everything, though. In fact, I think the argument can be made that what is taken from Bob le Flambeur is actually improved in Hard Eight. Hard Eight contains a lot of the same elements of Bob le Flambeur's first act a gangster whose age has demoted him to mere gambler has a young protégé. A young woman who is or is about to become a prostitute comes into their life, beginning to flirt with the older of the two, but ultimately given to the younger by the mentor. Also, there is a hot-shot young hood who tries to sell the older man out. This plot line occurs at the beginning of Bob le Flambeur and does not develop past the point where it effects the plot.

Think why we don't have a female Jim Carrey.Lesser actors like, say, Jeanne Tripplehorn have a more appealing instrument, so we the audience accepts more effect with less talent.

SPOILER ALERT!!!! *** *** EVERYBODY LOCK YOUR DOORS!!!!! ***When it comes to movies, I seem to be an atypical guy. Most guys I know cringe at the thought of seeing a romantic comedy, chick flicks they call them, yet I embrace them.Movies are just stories acted out and put on film. The way I see it, if the plot is solid, and the actors give good performances, I'll get sucked in no matter whether it's a rip roarin' adventure, a political thriller, a slapstick comedy, a scary slasher film, or a chick flick. So, I went into The Mexican looking to be entertained. I wasn't.The plot follows Brad Pitt on a job from the mob to steal a legendary antique gun, known as The Mexican from... well... Mexico! This is supposedly Pitt's last job, a fact that Julia Roberts (as Pitt's girlfriend) doesn't care to accept. She drives off in a huff to Las Vegas, where she is kidnapped by James Gandolfini, to be used as insurance that Pitt will indeed complete the task at hand.Okay... the good things. The three principle leads... Roberts, Pitt, and Gandolfini, all play their individual roles well. When Roberts and Gandolfini are in the same scenes, they exude a magnetism that is fun to watch. (Especially when it is revealed that James is homosexual!) Pitt plays a likeable, bumbling criminal, and you really do root for him to complete his task.The scenery is wonderful, and offers intriguing locals such as a barely lit tunnel through a hill, and various small Mexican towns with very narrow streets.The little mini-movies that show the legend of the gun are interesting, and are filmed to give them an artificially aged looked.The legend itself was nicely wrapped up in the end, and gave a satisfying feeling of closure.Now, the bad things...The movie is marketed as a romantic comedy between Roberts and Pitt. Yet, there are few scenes with both of them together, and when they do play off each other, they bicker and yell and fuss and whine. I don't go to a movie to see that.

I know nothing about criminals, but it seems to me that if you are sent to kidnap somebody, you should NOT get emotionally involved with them.

I'm all for a twist or surprise ending, but when characters go from being bad to good, to not who you thought they were, to bad to good again, it'll make your head spin.And one thing that made me want to scream at the screen (except I was in a theater with my wife, and that would've been embarrassing...) was the scene where Roberts is in a Mexican hotel room, and a criminal (or maybe he was a good guy, I don't recall) rushes in, and ransacks the room looking for the gun. He pulls open dresser drawers, flings clothes out of suitcases, overturns trash cans, and then splits. The camera then shows us that Roberts was hiding (with gun strapped to her thigh) IN BETWEEN THE TWO MATTRESSES on the bed!!!!! Okay, I know Julia is slim, but FOR GOD'S SAKE, wouldn't the criminal see that the mattresses weren't laying flat???? Plus, if you are going to ransack a room, and you are looking for something very important, wouldn't you grab the mattresses and toss them to the side???? Under the mattress is one of the most common hiding places in the world! Whether it's extra cash, porno, or your stash, EVERYBODY hides stuff under the mattress. That this criminal was unaware of this, completely frustrated me.So, in closing, I think that Pitt and Roberts would make a good romantic team, if only they'd (a) spend more than 10% of the movie together, (b) they'd respectfully interact with one another... no more whining!!!, and (c) if it didn't have an madcap adventure caper to back it up.Thank you. ^) ","genre":null},{"date":"5 March 2001","score":"","review":"  *** SPOILER ALERT!!!!

There are some real beauties on display, even if only for a few frames here and there, but for what must have been budget constraints nothing gets pushed around all that hard. Save for Eleanor, a beautiful tricked out 67 Mustang (meant to be a Shelby GT, not even close).

I have to be honest and admit that I was hoping this film would be at least as good as it's 1991 predecessor The Silence of the Lambs (which is one of my favourites), however, it falls a long way short.I had already read Thomas Harris' novel, and can understand why Jodie Foster didn't like the screenplay!  In my opinion key characters (Mason's sister) and key scenes (Mason with the young children) were omitted from the film. Aside from this, I actually found the film quite boring! Especially the first hour or so...Julianne Moore's lack of screen presence relegated Clarice Starling to little more than a minor character.  None of her admirable traits that Jodie Foster so brilliantly portrayed were present; I find this especially disappointing when you consider Ridley Scott's usual calibre of female leads (Ripley; Thelma & Louise; GI Jane).  Hopkins seemed to be holding something back a lot of the time, as if he wasn't quite comfortable with reprising his infamous role.  The only character who really made any sort of impact was Mason Verger.  Gary Oldman once again proving how good he is at playing the bad guy!In terms of direction, there were a couple of scenes which easily stood out from the rest.  The opening credits were excellent, & I loved the brief scene in which we followed Lecter & Starling to Paul Krendler's house after the very, very disappointing 'pig' scene.  The drive scene reminded me of one of the better music videos shown on MTV!But I think my biggest disappointment with Hannibal has to be the ending. Whoever made the decision to replace the novel's brilliant ending should be shot!!  I felt that the new ending was weak, and above all too safe.  The filmmakers should have had the courage to depict Harris' closure.  As it stands, the ending merely emphasises the poor quality of what could have been another Oscar winning film.

That's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie, but it seems like Park betrayed his fans to make a successful family film.Strangely enough, some moments--some KEY moments--seem destined to fly over kids' heads.  For example, when the revelation is made about Rocky's flying ability, what has been obvious to most viewers for some time is finally made know to the rest.  But the explanation consists of a brief glimpse at a poster and a semi-scientific quip about thrust.  So if we're going to get a vague explanation for such an obvious secret, why make it a secret at all?  If this is meant to build suspense, it should not have been so predictable.  (It works in that it makes kids feel smart when they can say they figured it out before they were told, but that just demonstrates how adults are ignored in this movie.)Overall though, the movie has enough humor and just plain fun to make it enjoyable.  I just hope that this does not mark the end of Nick Park's adult-friendly fare.  He has too much satirical humor inside him to limit himself to the 12 and under crowd.

Focus on one town and more specifically one family...really good (I'd like to refer you to the TNT movie Freedom Song as a film that more successfully deals with racism by looking at one town deeply rather than the whole country shallowly).  Some really good acting from Norton and Furlong, also D'Angelo. Also succeeds in being, if nothing else, shocking.  The EVENTS of the film, in a synopsis, are genuinely moving, and I think a really good film could have been made out of such a premise.Unfortunately, the quality of a movie is not just based on subject matter.The flaws are far more numerous and deadly. The script was really dull, only one good line, and lots of really hollow scenes.  The exposition towards the beginning is artless--police reports and news footage to give us character backgrounds?  That may not sound so terrible, but it really stood out to me as insultingly trite. Also takes too long at the beginning to get started.  We spend over an hour wondering what it was that finally converted Norton and the answer is underwhelming.  I was trying to decide if it would be sudden epiphany or gradual coming to understand.  The answer?  It's neither.  The black guy he works with in the prison cracks some jokes, Norton finds himself laughing, and bang, all his racism gone.  Right.  Ditto Furlong's character.  The movie takes less than 24 hours (not counting flashbacks), and in that time Furlong goes from being a Hitler-in-training to the most understanding fellow around.  How?

Many of the characters, as other people note, are one-dimensional, most unfortunately the main secondary character, Furlong's teacher who talks Norton through his conversion.  This fault ties in with a much bigger one. It seems like everyone in the town is concerned primarily with racism.

I'm a BIG BIG fan of Boogie Nights and checked this movie out because I was so impressed with PTA's directing in that movie.However, Sydney\/Hard Eight really failed to live up to my expectations. Firstly, I really liked the obvious Scorsese\/Tarantino references and steals in Boogie Nights e.g. the long opening steadycam shot. It felt in Boogie Nights like PTA had soaked up and understood his influences and was using them in an original way. However, this movie felt to me like  PTA was too heavily influenced by Tarantino and hadn't found a style of  his own yet. For example, Samuel L. Jackson's speech in the hotel room with Sydney is laughable! The dialogue is clearly trying to imitate Tarantino's fast, witty, colloquial style but falls a long, long way short. Certain camera shots are also highly reminiscent of Pulp Fiction (e.g. in the casino bars), as are Samuel L. Jackson's clothes and Sydney's dark suit amongst a long list I could give if I had time.In addition to Tarantino, the film is also overly indebted to Scorsese (who was obviously a heavy influence on Tarantino too). Sydney's character is a cheap and simplistic copy of Eddie in The Colour of Money, as in fact is the whole premise of the film. Scorsese's Casino springs to mind too.There's nothing wrong with wearing your influences on your sleeve - as Quentin T does to great effect. It's just that I don't think PTA has got them under control here. It sometimes feels like he puts stuff in because he thinks it would fit the QT-influenced style rather than because it really works in the film. For example, the scene in the motel room (I'm trying to avoid spoiling it here) with John and Clementine which requires Sydney's help is completely pointless. Those of you who  have seen it, ask yourselves whether your understanding of the film would be any less if that whole scene had been cut. My answer is no. It was a great idea and I was sure there were going to be repurcussions but there weren't. The whole episode just fizzled out and was ultimately a waste of time. The ending of the film wouldn't necessarily have been any different if PTA had chopped that whole thirty minutes out.However, I did find the film really interesting as it enabled me to see  how PTA's style has developed.

Maybe he realized he wasn't likely to surpass himself. You wonder if he's even a professional writer. He could be a...weatherman, for all we know. Surely somebody somewhere knows what this fellow is doing now, but I kind of want it to remain a mystery. Not that I can improve upon the outpouring of commentary seen already, but I'll mention the movie's suggestion (an assertion, really, though understated) that, had we but world enough and time, we all should inevitably become saints, simply because to follow any other path in life would be boring and pointless. I think it's in the simplicity and certitude of this message that Groundhog Day differs from almost every other movie, even those movies called uplifting. In Hollywood plots, after all, Good most always triumphs over Evil. But this story seems to imply that the contest between Good and Evil is an illusion there is no real choice, we can choose to do good now or do good later, but choose it we inevitably must. What a revolutionary statement about life! One isn't very often tempted to use the word Tolstoyan to describe creative works of any age, let alone movies from Hollywood in the late 20th Century. Yet there it is a story that could be said to stand on its head much of Western civilization's ethical and theological teaching, all presented via perfectly timed gags, a beautiful girl, and Bill Murray.
