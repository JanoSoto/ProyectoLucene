The movie has themes such as family value, loyalty, friendship and courage, central in it. The movie inspired many other later formulaic genre movies and was truly a bar-raising movie, back in the early '50's.It's a western, also with action in it but the movie above all is a family movie. It's a movie for everyone to watch, even those who aren't really too fond of the western genre. The story is touching and powerful, with universal themes in it. The movie works out as good the way it does, due to the fine story itself, it's directing from George Stevens and the fine performances from the cast.In its core the story itself is quite simple. It's never made complicated and is about real people and real situations instead. Though the movie is of course melodramatic at times, it doesn't really ever feel forced. It's just because of the style of film-making of the '50's and the musical score, that some sequences might have an overly present melodramatic feel now by todays standards. The movie is about good versus evil. A couple of friendly and non-violent settlers are being bullied around by a cattle-driver, who wants their land. When Shane sees this injustice he takes matters into his own hand and decide to stand up against Ryker's men. It all sounds incredibly formulaic by now but back in 1953 it all was quite new and refreshing. Basically every western genre cliché that we know by now are features in this movie, some for the very first time.The story, simple as it is, is told really great. It makes the movie really a warm and powerful one to watch. It also leaves room for some typical genre action, such as for instance a good old fashioned saloon fight.The movie is beautifully shot with some atmospheric landscapes. No wonder that the movie looks visually so good, director George Stevens used to be a cinematographer during the '20's and early '30's. His work for the Laurel & Hardy movies in the '20's is his most notable and best known work. The movie also has some great editing, that took over a year to complete and some good camera-work, when it comes down to its positions and close-up work.The main character Shane is perfectly portrayed by Alan Ladd, who has a kind though still tough looking appearance. Jack Palance was also truly great as the ruthless gunfighter, hired by the Ryker's. He's scary and tough looking character. A real good villain that you love to hate but he only is in the movie shortly though, toward the ending of it. Ladd and Palance would later star again together in Once a Thief (1965), that is a fairly enjoyable movie to watch.A timeless classic.

This is Bale's best performance, and most likely the one he'll be remembered for; I'm positive that long after the mega-hype for Batman Begins has died down, people will still be quoting the charming sociopath Patrick Bateman in their daily conversations.We follow Mr. Bateman (successful, rich stockbroker at day, narcissistic, cold-blooded psychopath at night) through his repetitive, meaningless life - meeting friends at expensive restaurants, cheating on his fiancée, comparing business cards, unsuccessfully trying to get reservations at Dorcia's, watching the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, quoting Ted Bundy for laughs, having a slightly better haircut than Markus Halberstram - as his mask of sanity slips further and further down his chiseled face. No matter how good he looks, no matter how rich and pumped he gets, no matter how many girls he bones, he just cannot find pleasure in his life. There is only one thing left to do to get that adrenaline rush chop your friends up with axes, chainsaws, and power drills! The movie is very violent, although not in the pornographically gratuitous way that the Saw- or Hostel-type films are violent we never really see anyone take an axe to the head and the actual acts of violence are left to our imagination. It is also not a movie to show to your grandmother (no matter how much of a sadist she might be) since it features some graphic sex scenes (nothing above soft-core level, though). Neither sex nor violence is the movie's main focus, however this is a pitch-black comedy which is revoltingly, side-splittingly funny if you get its type of humour. The comedy stems mostly from the absurdity of the uber-shallow characters and their stuffed egos. Almost every conversation is absolutely hilarious and you'll find yourself quoting the film for the rest of your life. It truly sticks with you.The acting is superb with Bale outdoing everyone even as the supporting cast delivers solid performances left and right. The supporting actors definitely know how to make the dialogue comical and I'd love to see more of Justin Theroux (Timothy Bryce) and Matt Ross (Luis Carruthers). Jared Leto is spectacular as always, providing one of the film's most memorable scenes (and most hilarious quotes) in a small but important supporting role. An underused Willem Dafoe also makes a very eerie guest appearance as the scariest police detective of all time.The direction is also marvelous. Mary Harron successfully melds exhilarating segments of music with high tension, comedy, and scenes which are a little of both. The final result is nothing short of a masterpiece. I still can't find a flaw with it.I haven't read the novel by Bret Easton Ellis (yeah, yeah, I know, I suck...) and cannot compare, but if it's anywhere near as good as this film I really have to seek it out. The film, on its own, is in my opinion one of the best ever made, and one of the most sadly overlooked. Trust me, you'll never listen to Phil Collins or Huey Lewis and the News the same way again. Simply put? American Psycho rocks, period. It's a playful, but mysterious little movie. You'll love it. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 January 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Christian Bale proves why he's the best actor of his generation, and one of the greatest in film history, as he dominates every single scene of this blood-splattered, sadistically hilarious, strongly and bluntly satirical, well polished and freakishly enjoyable work of comic art from one-hit-wonder Mary Harron. This is Bale's best performance, and most likely the one he'll be remembered for; I'm positive that long after the mega-hype for Batman Begins has died down, people will still be quoting the charming sociopath Patrick Bateman in their daily conversations.We follow Mr. Bateman (successful, rich stockbroker at day, narcissistic, cold-blooded psychopath at night) through his repetitive, meaningless life - meeting friends at expensive restaurants, cheating on his fiancée, comparing business cards, unsuccessfully trying to get reservations at Dorcia's, watching the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, quoting Ted Bundy for laughs, having a slightly better haircut than Markus Halberstram - as his mask of sanity slips further and further down his chiseled face. No matter how good he looks, no matter how rich and pumped he gets, no matter how many girls he bones, he just cannot find pleasure in his life. There is only one thing left to do to get that adrenaline rush chop your friends up with axes, chainsaws, and power drills! The movie is very violent, although not in the pornographically gratuitous way that the Saw- or Hostel-type films are violent we never really see anyone take an axe to the head and the actual acts of violence are left to our imagination. It is also not a movie to show to your grandmother (no matter how much of a sadist she might be) since it features some graphic sex scenes (nothing above soft-core level, though). Neither sex nor violence is the movie's main focus, however this is a pitch-black comedy which is revoltingly, side-splittingly funny if you get its type of humour. The comedy stems mostly from the absurdity of the uber-shallow characters and their stuffed egos. Almost every conversation is absolutely hilarious and you'll find yourself quoting the film for the rest of your life. It truly sticks with you.The acting is superb with Bale outdoing everyone even as the supporting cast delivers solid performances left and right. The supporting actors definitely know how to make the dialogue comical and I'd love to see more of Justin Theroux (Timothy Bryce) and Matt Ross (Luis Carruthers). Jared Leto is spectacular as always, providing one of the film's most memorable scenes (and most hilarious quotes) in a small but important supporting role.

Every scene is exciting and class, Vinnie Jones is partciullary good in lock stock and his scenes are ace. It also has a quality soundtrack to go along with that - stone roses, ocean colour scene, James brown etc. It is a great watch. I dwelled on whether to give it a ten out of ten but I decided a nine is more than fair.
