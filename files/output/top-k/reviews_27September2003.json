Kevin Costner delivers a fine performance as escaped convict Butch Haynes. The film primarily focuses on the relationship between Haynes and an innocent 8 year old boy named Phillip whom he kidnaps and befriends (well played by TJ Lowther). Haynes has killed two people thus far and gives the impression of a being a loose cannon, but Eastwood evokes sympathy for the character as the audience learns about Haynes troubled childhood (raised without a father by a prostitute mother - killed a man by the age of 8) and observe his genuine care and concern for the boy. Their relationship is reminiscent of Allan Ladd and the young boy in SHANE. As he slowly feeds us more information about Hayne's history, and lets the audience wrestle with its ambivalent feelings towards Costner's character, Eastwood keeps the film moving with lots of close brushes with the law, car chases and shoot'em ups.Where the film doesn't work quite is when Eastwood himself is in front of the camera,  playing a minor role - Chief Red Garnett - a Texas Ranger who's in charge of Haynes' capture.  The primary function of his character, and Laura Dern's (who plays Sally Gerber - a criminologist the Governor forces upon the Chief) in the script is to supply further information about Haynes' past. Unfortunately, Eastwood tries to flesh out the relationship between these characters through antagonistic chauvinist attitudes towards Gerber and creating a power struggle between the two which (big surprise!) over the course of the film, gradually leads to a mutual respect between them! Granted Eastwood and Dern have marquee value - especially Eastwood, are fine in their roles, and, of course,  chauvinism was alive and well in 1960's Texas, but I mostly found these minor subplots annoying and unnecessary. It's the scenes and issues focusing on Costner's character that are the life blood of this picture. This criticism aside, Eastwood does a solid job directing, weaving action, suspense and thought provoking human drama into a well knit weave and Costner delivers one of the best acting performances of his career.7 1\/2 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 September 2003","score":"59 out of 69 people found the following review useful","review":"  Some aspects of this film work better than others, but overall A PERFECT WORLD is a highly watchable film.

Made after the Oklahoma City bombing and before the 9\/11 attacks on NYC and Washington D.C. you get a feeling watching the movie of how the world has changed for all of us since the Cold War ended back in 1991. Of all the movies about the USSR and to a lesser extent Communist China none of them had a Russian or Chinese leader, even in fiction, as ruthless and suicidal as the real persons who were behind and participated in those two attacks in real life.Michael Farady, Jeff Bridges, who one morning driving home sees a young boy badly hurt on the street and puts the boy in his car driving to the hospital where the doctors save the boy's life. It turns out that the boy's parents live across the street from Michael on Arlington Road. Michael being the good neighbor that he is goes out the way to be friendly with the boy's parents and they Oliver and Cheyrl Lang, Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, treat Michael like a member of the family, after all he saved their son's Bradley, Manson Gamble, life. Michael also has a young son of his own Grant, Spencer Clark, and is living on and off with his girlfriend Hope, Brooke Wolf, as well as teaches at a local university about contemporary American History. What fascinates Michael most are terrorists and what makes them tick and Michaels especially interested in the home grown type. It turns out that Michael's wife Leah, laura Poe, was an FBI agent who was killed in a Ruby Ridge like shoot-out with white separatists a few years back and that's was kindle his strange interest in them. Without going into any more details about the plot the movie starts to increase in it's level of paranoia as it moves to it's shocking nail biting final. Michael who in the beginning of the film was both cool and logical, as well as personable and friendly, is driven to the the verge of having a complete and total nervous and physical collapse. A lot of people who commented on Arlington Road said that the story is illogical and contrived and most of all the story is totally unbelievable and I would in some ways agree with them. I for one don't think that Arlington Road was any more contrived then many other movies that are said to be based on a true story, which Arlington Road wasn't, and you hardly hear that many people complain about them. Arlington Road is far more believable a story as fiction if you compared it to 9\/11 or Oklahoma City which were sadly true. The scariest and most spine tingling scene in the movie, for me at least, had nothing to do with the scenes what most people who saw the film were shocked and terrified of. It had to do with what FBI agent Caver, Robert Gossett, said to Michael just before the movies heart-dropping and totally unexpected ending The Only One Unauthorized To Be Here Is YOU!

Perhaps a bit, but not near as much as most of the other monster movies I've seen.

It stands alone, though it really should have been a based on and not an adaptational work.Amy is a seven-year-old gorilla from the Verunga Region of the Congo, taken captive and sold to a university for study. Dr. Peter Elliot (portrayed so very well by Dylan Walsh) is the primatologist who has full charge of Amy and her development. In a lonely impulse of delight, he has taught his ward to speak through the use of sign language and technology, but Amy is having problems.She is experiencing nightmares, based on her past as a very young gorilla, and a deep longing to return to the jungle.In his love of Amy, Dr. Elliot endeavors to return her to the place of her birth, with the assistance of philanthropist Herkimer Homolka (one of Tim Curry's best roles in my opinion, as a serious actor and not a character actor, he is quite believable) and the well-equipped Dr. Karen Ross (wonderfully portrayed by Laura Linney), an ex CIA agent who is now an executive with Travel-Com; a corporation in desperate need of a flawless diamond from the Congo to power its next Cash-Cow.(SUB-PLOT) Travel-Com's megalomaniacal CEO\/CFO has sent his son and another team to the Congo to search for the diamond so desperately needed by the corporation. But when the expedition fails and Travel-Com loses contact, the psycho insists that Dr. Ross take over the Amy expedition in an attempt to discover what happened with the first team, and his son.
