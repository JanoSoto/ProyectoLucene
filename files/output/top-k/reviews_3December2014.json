For unknown reasons, Gone With The Wind is my second favourite movie. Right behind these two is The Godfather, the mafia epic that perhaps tops more best of lists than Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind today. As my third favourite film, I do not mind The Godfather ranking number 1 on lists and don't mind when it is raved as being the greatest of all time. It is not the best in my eyes, but I can see why it would be the best in others. Anyway, my reaction to seeing The Godfather is just like anybody else's that feel mesmerized by this mammoth piece of work.The Godfather launched the careers of director Francis Ford Coppola, author Mario Puzo, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and relaunched the career of Marlon Brando. Because of early classics like On The Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire, Marlon Brando earned the rep as the greatest and most influential actor in film history. With a string of less successful movies right before The Godfather, Brando's greatest rival, Sir Laurence Olivier (the greatest stage actor of the 20 century), was the original choice to play protagonist, Vito Chorleone. With Olivier still a huge movie star, Brando's performance in this epic put him back on the map and gave him an Academy Award win for best actor. Others actors, as mentioned above were also nominated for other categories, but all lost. I'm glad they lost, it was such a close call that it would have been a polar-opposing house of opinions. The Godfather tells the story of the Chorleone family the most powerful and ruthless mafia clan in America. Don Vito Chorleone (Brando) helps out whomever he feels and makes people an offer they can't refuse. When drug dealer, Sollozzo approaches Vito asking for political protection, Vito, against drugs, declines. So Sollozzo and his current entourage of mob families attempt to kill Vito, which would make his son, Santino (Caan), the new Don as he wants to join Sollozzo. Instead, Vito survives and a deadly web of mob violence explodes. Vito's youngest son Michael (Pacino), is a war veteran who wants nothing to do with the family business, but as the violence rises and the family drastically weakens, Michael is the only one that can bring the family to their original status, by being more clever and deadlier than his father could ever be.The first half or so, to me, is more of a thriller than drama. Lots of suspense is created after Vito makes the rejection does not stop until after Michael kills Sollozzo and crooked cop, McCluskey. The second half is a drama as we see the family struggling with their downfall and soon rise. The story get more complex as the movie goes on, which may result in a confusion of who's who. That is why this movie needs your full, undivided attention and full concentration. It took me a few watches to completely understand. I love movies that require multiple viewings. The acting is the best ensemble ever put to film. Brando passes the torch to Al Pacino, as this was Brando's last monumental film and Pacino's first. I don't recall any other movie with such good acting by every single actor.

However, it feels like a very good two-part TNG story and, since TNG is one of my favourite series, it's not a major problem for me. That said, I don't think that it has the same appeal to fans and non-fans alike as the best films in the series such as The Wrath of Khan, First Contact and The Voyage Home. Jonathan Frakes does an excellent job in directing the film and he should have been retained for Nemesis. The fact that he shaves his beard, however, disproves my theory that his powers come from his facial hair in much the same way as Samson's came from his locks.Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham makes for a very compelling villain as Ru'afo. Donna Murphy is absolutely enchanting as Anij, Picard's third and final serious love interest, and she has great chemistry with Patrick Stewart. Anthony Zerbe is very good as Admiral Dougherty, who hearkens back to the TOS tradition of admirals and other senior people being antagonists! Given their significant screen time, I was surprised that Daniel Hugh Kelly, Gregg Henry and Michael Welch's names aren't mentioned in the opening credits. The then 11-year-old Welch, who has gone on to have a good film and TV career, is very natural as Artim, whose relationship with Data is very sweet. He's a very good young actor who was excellent as Jack O'Neill's clone in Stargate SG-1's Fragile Balance, one of my favourite episodes of that series. DS9 actors Armin Shimerman and Max Grodénchik were to have cameos - the former as Quark and the latter as a Trill ensign - but both scenes were cut. Had Quark's scene been included, he would have been the only DS9 regular character besides Worf to appear in a Star Trek film.Michael Piller's final contribution to Star Trek before his untimely death in 2005, it has a strong storyline with some great social commentary regarding the forced relocation of people and the ways in which imperialism and colonialism have led to larger cultures destroying smaller ones. Picard is one of my favourite television characters as he is a man of honour and integrity who can always be relied upon to do the right thing. He knows when to take a stand and always places morality above rules and regulations. Stewart is wonderful as ever as Picard. The crew's behaviour succeeds in shaming Dougherty but it is too late as he is murdered by Ru'afo in a rather gruesome scene - particularly by Star Trek standards - which recalls the death of Zerbe's character Milton Krest in Licence to Kill. Their efforts to shame the Federation Council into changing their decision, however, are more successful. The actions of the Federation in this film highlight the problem with Spock's maxim, The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Or the one. it only works if it is the few who are doing the deciding. Otherwise, it can be used to justify anything from a tiny tax increase to genocide.Overall, I think that this is a very good, sorely underrated film and the strongest of the odd numbered films.

So I watched it and it actually ended up being a movie I enjoyed.Okay so our hero is a degenerate, violent, raping High Schooler who basically spends most hours of the evening with his friends causing havok by beating up homeless people, home invasions, rape, causing car crashes and beating up other gangs. When he's not doing that he's drinking milk, listening to Beethoven and tends to his pet snake. After a while he goes to prison after both raping a woman one night, then the next murdering another and he tries to get out of prison as quickly as possible via means of an experimental treatment that makes any prisoner have all acts of violence, sex or whatever else he may have been in for, get changed so even the thought of it makes them physically sick. Oh well, it's a good thing the people whom he caused misery to in the first hour don't hold grudges... Oh wait.Okay so there is a reason why this was controversial even by today's standards. Not only are we following one of the worst human beings on the planet (who by the way again - is only in high school) as a leading character, but it is done at such an angle where you are meant to sympathize with him. In my personal opinion... I actually did sympathize with the character...

I am one of the few that actually liked both movies. The ending of 2001- A Space Odyssey left some wondering W.T.F.. I understood the ending, but it took me to viewings, but I got it. The movie 2010-The Year We Made Contact, although dated, I believe more people could relate too.In 2010, A team of Russian and American scientists are teamed up in space. During this period a war is brewing between the Soviets\/Americans in Central America. Once Dr. Floyd, Roy Schneider, is briefed on the mission by Victor Milson, a N.S.A. Official. Dr. Floyd tells his family he is going on the mission. This doesn't sit well with his wife, but his son is very curious. Once on board The Leonov we see the team which is mostly Russian; and three Americans. They are Dr. Floyd, (Schneider), Dr. Curnow(John Lithgow); and Dr. Chandra( Bob Balaban). The mission is to find out why The Discovery Failed, explore the giant monolith; and the mystery of Dave Bowman. The team wakes up Floyd first, briefs him, and gives him the cold shoulder at first. Once the rest of the American team are awake they begin to work together; but the Russians lose one of their own when Tayna Kirberk(Helen Mirren) sends out one of the crew in a pod. She made the mistake of sending him close to explore the giant monolith.When Floyd, Chandra, and Curnow , board The Discovery they find out why the mission failed. Chandra turns to Floyd and says he is to blame; because he signed off on the mission papers. It isn't all is fault, but the government had conflicting reports; and a cover up is exposed. The mission was flawed from the beginning. It seems Poole and Bowman trained separately from the rest of the crew. If anything was to happen to the crew HAL was ordered to carry out the mission regardless; but got two different reports. HAL malfunctioned, became paranoid, killed the hibernating crew, along with Poole out in space. Bowman way able to disconnect him before he was the next target.When the war escalates, the crew aboard The Leonov must separate. When Floyd was back on The Discovery, he makes contact with Bowman. Bowman warns him they must leave because something wonderful will happen. He goes aboard The Leonov and tells Kirberk. They devise a plan to get home by using both the Discovery and Leonov. The Discovery will be destroyed, but before the destruction HAL sends a message on board The Leonov. In the meantime Jupiter is being swallowed by millions of these monoliths. The message is reveled on board, The Leonov leaves just in time; and a new sun is formed.In conclusion, I am more of a fan of 2010 than 2001.

He plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who makes a living taping private conversations for money. He is a legend among his colleagues in the field of surveillance probably because they aren't privy to his work. He lives alone, keeps to himself, has no friends, builds his own surveillance equipment and values his privacy. His private work station is located in the back of a cold, empty warehouse behind an ugly chain-linked fence.He doesn't exactly look approachable with his thick mustache, horn-rimmed glasses and ridiculous plastic rain coat. Perhaps, that's the point. His colleagues admire him for his skill but he spaces himself away perhaps because if he ever let anyone into his life, they might realize how bad he is at his job. As the movie opens he discovers that his landlady has let herself into his apartment in order to leave him a birthday present. His unlisted phone number, he discovers, is in the hands of two other people. Later, one of his fellow surveillance experts is able to plant a microphone on him with relative ease and then he ends up having some of his tapes stolen by the one woman that he would least expect to have any interest in them.Perhaps the best reason that Harry is so emotionally withdrawn is that sometime ago, one of his surveillance assignments led to the brutal murder of a woman and her child. For this reason, he keeps an emotional distance from those around him and from his work. He does his job, he turns over this findings to his clients and makes his money. Yet, in his latest job he fears that it may be happening all over again. He has recorded a young couple Anne and Mike (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest) walking around a busy plaza having a conversation during a jazz festival. Stationing three microphones around, one on a sniper scope, one a parabolic mike propped in a window and one on an assistant, he is able to capture their conversation from all sides. They don't seem to be talking about much at first but as he listens back over their conversation he begins to suspect that the man who hired him will kill these two when he gets the tapes.Harry's conscience gnaws at him. He convinces himself that he is just doing his job, yet the job came by his own hand and by his own hand came two deaths. He tries to reason out his guilt in the confessional. After confessing to meager things like taking more than one newspaper from the box, he gets down to what's really bothering him. I've been involved in some work that I think will be used to hurt these two young people., he tells the priest, It's happened to me before. People were hurt because of my work, and I'm afraid it could happen again and I'm . . . I was in no way responsible. I'm not responsible. For these and all my sins of my past life, I am heartily sorry. We suspect that he only needs the priest there to have someone to listen, the confessional is really a means to convince himself.He plays the recording of the couple back again and again and again, trying to dial down the music so he can better understand what is being said. Eventually, he gets a time and place where they will meet although they never say why. Again and again Harry refuses to give the tapes over to the client, the head of a large company, having to grapple instead with the client's unflinching assistant (Harrison Ford). After a convention he allows his one of his chief colleagues, a blow-hard named Moran (Alan Garfield) and some others into his private work station, Harry has invited them but couldn't look more uncomfortable. He spends the night with a prostitute who tagged along. She seduces him more with words than with sex, comparing the nature of her profession with his It's only a trick, a job. You're not supposed to think anything about it. Just supposed to do it. We are as surprised as Harry when he wakes up and finds that she has stolen his tapes.He is sure that she has given the client the tapes and decides to go to the hotel where the couple were going to meet and possibly do something about it. What, exactly, he could do is not very clear. He gets the hotel room next door to the one mentioned in the tapes and positions himself in the bathroom next to the toilet so he can hear what is going on, he hears Anne scream and then everything goes silent.

He plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who makes a living taping private conversations for money. He is a legend among his colleagues in the field of surveillance probably because they aren't privy to his work. He lives alone, keeps to himself, has no friends, builds his own surveillance equipment and values his privacy. His private work station is located in the back of a cold, empty warehouse behind an ugly chain-linked fence.He doesn't exactly look approachable with his thick mustache, horn-rimmed glasses and ridiculous plastic rain coat. Perhaps, that's the point. His colleagues admire him for his skill but he spaces himself away perhaps because if he ever let anyone into his life, they might realize how bad he is at his job. As the movie opens he discovers that his landlady has let herself into his apartment in order to leave him a birthday present. His unlisted phone number, he discovers, is in the hands of two other people. Later, one of his fellow surveillance experts is able to plant a microphone on him with relative ease and then he ends up having some of his tapes stolen by the one woman that he would least expect to have any interest in them.Perhaps the best reason that Harry is so emotionally withdrawn is that sometime ago, one of his surveillance assignments led to the brutal murder of a woman and her child. For this reason, he keeps an emotional distance from those around him and from his work. He does his job, he turns over this findings to his clients and makes his money. Yet, in his latest job he fears that it may be happening all over again. He has recorded a young couple Anne and Mike (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest) walking around a busy plaza having a conversation during a jazz festival. Stationing three microphones around, one on a sniper scope, one a parabolic mike propped in a window and one on an assistant, he is able to capture their conversation from all sides. They don't seem to be talking about much at first but as he listens back over their conversation he begins to suspect that the man who hired him will kill these two when he gets the tapes.Harry's conscience gnaws at him. He convinces himself that he is just doing his job, yet the job came by his own hand and by his own hand came two deaths. He tries to reason out his guilt in the confessional. After confessing to meager things like taking more than one newspaper from the box, he gets down to what's really bothering him. I've been involved in some work that I think will be used to hurt these two young people., he tells the priest, It's happened to me before. People were hurt because of my work, and I'm afraid it could happen again and I'm . . . I was in no way responsible. I'm not responsible. For these and all my sins of my past life, I am heartily sorry. We suspect that he only needs the priest there to have someone to listen, the confessional is really a means to convince himself.He plays the recording of the couple back again and again and again, trying to dial down the music so he can better understand what is being said. Eventually, he gets a time and place where they will meet although they never say why. Again and again Harry refuses to give the tapes over to the client, the head of a large company, having to grapple instead with the client's unflinching assistant (Harrison Ford). After a convention he allows his one of his chief colleagues, a blow-hard named Moran (Alan Garfield) and some others into his private work station, Harry has invited them but couldn't look more uncomfortable. He spends the night with a prostitute who tagged along. She seduces him more with words than with sex, comparing the nature of her profession with his It's only a trick, a job. You're not supposed to think anything about it. Just supposed to do it. We are as surprised as Harry when he wakes up and finds that she has stolen his tapes.He is sure that she has given the client the tapes and decides to go to the hotel where the couple were going to meet and possibly do something about it. What, exactly, he could do is not very clear. He gets the hotel room next door to the one mentioned in the tapes and positions himself in the bathroom next to the toilet so he can hear what is going on, he hears Anne scream and then everything goes silent.

It's my second favourite Star Trek film after The Wrath of Khan, which is likewise a sequel to one of its respective series' best episodes.Patrick Stewart is even better than usual as the atypically vulnerable Captain Picard. Like Khan in the aforementioned film, he becomes obsessed with destroying his foe and, in both films, comparison is drawn with Captain Ahab of Moby Dick. Unlike Ahab and Khan, however, he is brought back from the brink before his obsession can lead to his death. The interesting thing is that this is not done by Riker or Beverly or one of the other main characters but by Lily Sloane, brilliantly played by Alfre Woodard. She is the best new female character in any film in the series since Saavik in The Wrath of Khan. I think that she can say the things that she does because she is an outsider who is not privy to the so-called evolved sensibility of the 24th Century, which is deconstructed well in the film in a manner more typical of DS9 than TNG.The rest of the TNG cast is as good as ever, particularly Brent Spiner. Marina Sirtis has fairly little screen time but, as the drunk Deanna, gets the funniest scene in the film and one of the funniest in the character's 15 year history. James Cromwell is a great addition to the cast as Zefram Cochrane, who is not the legendary, selfless figure that the Enterprise crew believed him to be. He is a good man but a flawed one. He feels very much like a real person. I love that the film takes this approach as in reality many historical figures, even those who were alive within living memory, are mythologised and become paragons of virtue even though they were deeply flawed. That is not to say that they were bad people. They were just normal.The Borg were used brilliantly. In the entire franchise, I think that they were only better used in Best of Both Worlds. Jonathan Frakes does an excellent job as director. One little thing that I really liked about this film was that it did a very good job of explaining the backstory for the benefit of people who weren't familiar with it. I've been watching Star Trek since 1995 so I didn't need the backstory filled in for me when I first saw it, let alone now, but a problem that I had with Generations was that it didn't explain who Lursa and B'Etor were. B'Etor's name isn't even mentioned in the film.

Mostly I give 7 stars, but I have some issues with The Rescuers Down Under.As a child I have seen loads of movies but this one particularly disturbed me. I would not recommend it as a movie for children, because the plot ITSELF is NOT what I recommend for a children's movie. There is a mean maniac who hunts and traps (rare) animals and sell them for money. When this guy finds out that a young boy witnessed his crimes he decides to kidnap him and keep him away from his family. Not enough, the boy gets trapped and imprisoned in a cage. Thats good material for Silence of the Lambs II, isn't it? Whats the lesson here? Be aware of psychopathic kidnappers?After all the boy manages to escape with the help of two mice and the bad guy drowns accidently at the end, before he tried to feed the boy off to crocodiles btw. There is no mercy for him, he just drowns. There is no good moral, the only lesson you get is that there are bad humans out there and Australia is not very safe to be. There are scenes that are supposed to be funny, but fail, for example when a huge (compared to the mice) syringe gets rammed into a bird character who is screaming in vain. That's not what you expect to see in a children's movie. If your kids don't like doctors they may be frightened, but most certainly not entertained. EDIT I just watched the scene in English Dr. Mouse is kind of funny, but in German it's just brutal and disturbing.The bottom line is this If you are lucky, your kidnapper will have an accident, if not, you may never see your family again. No wonder this is not a very popular Disney flick. The animation is top notch, as well as the score, but I give it a 4 out of 10, because of the stupid plot without a valid moral lesson to be learned. If you think the boy will get back to his mother. WRONG It's not in the movie. Four stars, which is a fair rating, still 2 out of 5.
