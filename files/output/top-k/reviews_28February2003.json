[{"date":"28 February 2003","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore is a prime example of a movie about which you cannot answer the question what is it about? without boring someone to tears. This is because it's not what, but whom it's about that is important.Rushmore is about Max Fischer, an impossibly ambitious high school student attending one of the best schools in the country, according to his friend, steel tycoon herman blume. Max is involved in the greatest possible amount of extracurricular activities and athletics he can be in and still survive, let alone maintain decent grades. He does fall in love, but love is just yet another driving ambition for Max. Ultimately he comes to terms with his own limitations without succumbing to mediocrity. Max is my hero in the truest sense of the word. You may not laugh at Rushmore, even though you'll find it in the comedy section. You especially won't laugh if you watch it alone. although you'll probably acknowledge that it's a comedy you may not be able to pick out one individual joke. I can't explain why I still love it so much, so this is meant as a warning if you expect madcap laugh-out-loud funny, you may be sorely disappointed. I myself do laugh at Rushmore because I share that kind of sense of humor with the writers. It's not for everyone though. I judge people's personalities on whether or not they enjoy Rushmore. If they don't, no big deal, but it's a girl I wouldn't marry her.I intentionally didn't start by saying that Rushmore is my favorite film, because it often discredits a reviewer immediately. If you find that you enjoy it you may also find, as i did, that it is entertaining after numerous viewings, or in my case, viewing ad nauseum. I watch it at least once a week, and have for, i'd say, six months. although i've been watching it fairly regularly for three years this makes me crazy. i know.A friend of mine watched the film for the first time not long ago. She told me that when she looked at Max, she saw me. I wouldn't intentionally pattern my life after a movie, but apparently it can happen. See Rushmore whomever you are. If you hate it, you'll enjoy hating it. I know, because I've sat many people through it, and the discussions afterwards were at least worth their time. More likely though, if you bothered to read this entire review which was more about myself than the movie, you'll love it. You'll love it, is not how I want to end this review so I'll lie in the next paragraph in case someone only reads the last line.Rushmore features extended scenes of full frontal female nudity. There is a talking apple pie, and the word schwing is said more times than in any other movie.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"28 February 2003","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  If you loved Rushmore you'll love Tenenbaums and vice-versa. Very, very funny (you will REALLY laugh watching these films), though not jokey at all. As in Rushmore, you are propelled forward by the characters and their inner and outer conflicts, laughing all the way and also empathizing with the characters and hoping for their successes...Tenenbaums is even more surreal and eccentric than Rushmore. Similar flavor and setting, a kind of dreamlike zen journey for meaning for various characters against a backdrop of the disillusioned\/dysfunctional educated middle class, with themes of lost and found relationships\/selves\/trueloves. Plenty to think about, but don't get me wrong, meanwhile these films are just so funny. Surreal, and yet more real than most films you see currently, at times they really strike a chord. The characters are just so interesting, for one thing.  The humor is unlike any other films being made currently, the Anderson\/Wilson writing is definitely unique and after you see it you just want more. The characters in Tenenbaums are kind of like caricatures, almost like a cartoon, so how come we identify with them so easily... many shots are even shot in longshot increasing this cartoon effect, and the effect too of this kind of being a parable, and the characters maybe representing everyman, and as you are watching you can't help but see yourself and others you know in the roles....it's a great effect. I got the feeling sometimes that these longshot views were kind of like a birdseye view of everyone (maybe Mordicai's).  Anyway, very funny, totally entertaining, and touching, too. Many beautiful scenes. Visually unique. Super soundtrack, too. Not to mention the brilliant cast. You can see these films many times and not get tired of them. That's rare. I just look forward to seeing more films by Anderson and Wilson.
