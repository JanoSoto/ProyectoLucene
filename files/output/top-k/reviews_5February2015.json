[{"date":"5 February 2015","score":"","review":" Disturbing Behaviour is a thriller that was overlooked upon its release in July, 1998. The movie has a popular cast and an intriguing storyline. This movie is similar to thrillers like The Faculty and Urban Legend. All three of these movies were released in 1998. I personally like The Faculty and Urban Legend better than Disturbing Behaviour. The movie is 1 hour and 24 minutes but the movie should have been more detailed about the plot. Most thrillers are 90 to 120 minutes. If this movie was longer the impact of the movie and box office success of the movie would have been massively increased. I think that The Faculty is more stylish than this movie and Urban Legend is more intense. Urban Legend has more clever plot twists and is similar to Scream in regards to its plot. I liked how the filmmakers took this movie and put their own spin on it. There isn't one moment of the movie I dislike. I feel the movie could have had added depth. Numerous scenes were deleted from the movie that flesh out the characters and they clarify any unanswered questions you may have after watching the theatrical version. Those scenes also add vital information to the plot that isn't in the version that was released. Overall Disturbing Behaviour is an entertaining addition to the eerie teen thrillers that were widely released in cinemas during the 1990's. The movie has an original style and some twists can't be foreseen in the movie. Not all the characters are predictable and every actor has fun with their role. I believe they chose the best actors in the business at the time to act in this movie. Every actor seems like their character, they don't seem like they're acting. I couldn't imagine any other actor playing their roles, if other actors did this movie wouldn't have turned out as well as it did.
