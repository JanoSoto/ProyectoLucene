[{"date":"20 May 2001","score":"25 out of 39 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shrek (Michael Myers)  is an ogre who lives in a swamp by himself.  He wants to be by himself because he is very insecure about his looks and the way he's perceived.  Meanwhile, in the kingdom of Farquaad, many of the fairy tale characters that we all know and love including the three little pigs, the big bad wolf, fairies, the three bears and snow white are being banished. On the roster to be banished is one talking donkey by the name of....well, Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Donkey becomes a sweet and hilarious thorn in the side of Shrek.  While eating, Shrek is horrified when his swamp is disturbed by the banished fairytale creatures, at the hands of  Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Shrek learns that in order to get his swamp back, he has to talk to Lord Farquaad.   Meanwhile, Farquaad keeps one treasured fairytale item, the magic mirror from Snow White, for himself. He uses it to find himself a princess. The dialogue between he and the mirror is hilarious because it switches to an episode of the dating game with the mirror giving him three choices Cinderella, Snow She lives with seven men, but she's not easy White  and Princess Fiona. The knights in full armor coach the prince to choose princess number three, the lovely Princess Fiona ( Cameron Diaz). Fiona is locked in a tower that is protected by a female dragon. When Shrek finally reaches the kingdom o' Farquaad, he is thrown in a WWF wrestling parody that is hilarious. Recognizing his strength, Lord Farquaad makes a deal with the ogre get me the girl and I will give you the swamp back. Shrek accepts the deal and begins his journey with Donkey in tow.Shrek is a very clever film on many levels. It's a fairytale in every sense of the word. Listen to the way the lines are written, the way the characters speak, the way the story flows. The guys at Dream Works did a good job with this in that you could close your eyes and the dialogue flows as though you're having a story read to you. What makes this movie clever is the fact that it's a fairytale that spoofs fairytales. For example, in most fairytales, the prince is a tall, dark, handsome, kind and dashing man that isn't complete until he finds his one true love to give his heart to.  Yet Lord Farquaad is very short, sort of pale, not attractive, very evil, and lacking in the dashing department. Even his name is awkward in that he calls himself a lord when he is just a prince. In most fairytales, the princess is a beautiful, fragile, dainty and submissive young lady. That isn't the case with our Princess Fiona. She's an up front talkative young lady that kicks butt in a hilarious Matrix parody. The fairytale characters, unlike their particular stories, are at a dead end. Their stories can't end because they have no where to go.Shrek is a pure stroke of genius. It's campy for the kids and sarcastic and hilarious for the adults. It has a voice ( which a lot of movies forget to include in the recipe these days ) in that it preaches the age-old adage that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  From a technical aspect, the movie pushes the technological envelope. While watching the film and watching Shrek and the other characters move and frown, I was quickly thrown back to the time I saw Disney's Dinosaurs. You will notice a lot of the same computer animation (deep canvas) used in this movie. As for the voice-over work, the best of the best were assembled.  At first, I didn't like Mike Myers' voice or Scottish accent at all. It didn't it fit the look of the ogre that was created or the ogre we know from past fairytales. Then I realized that's what the guys at Dream Works were trying to do. They wanted an ogre that no one knew someone you would have to get to know. Once you get to know him, Shrek is very  likable.  His story is one that has the power to create sequels and spinoffs. The movie has been in the making for a long time.  It was reported that Chris Farley was originally intended to voice the  ogre. Never the less it is truly a great movie.

If they repulse you, then the whole thing will come off as not funny but extremely obnoxious.  In TPB, Wesley and Princess Buttercup were _very_ charming.  This film features some truly endearing characters, especially the flawed but loveable hero Shrek.  Yes he's antisocial, but there's a sweetness and warmth to him, no doubt thanks to the great animation team and Mike Meyers (who, however, put a wee too much Fat Bastard into the performance).  Cameron Diaz's Princess Fiona shows a lot of depth, as she is remarkably at the same time spunky yet passive, as she shows a surprisingly take-no-crap attitude for someone who's waiting to be rescued by a handsome prince.  She also shows surprising vulnerability in a scene that would spoil the film if further discussed.Then there's the donkey, who in his sidekick role is notably non-annoying and actually quite entertaining, and is played on the mark by Eddie Murphy. The amusing Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)rounds out the cast of characters.But the question is, is it funny?  Yes, very much so.  Ignore the flatulence jokes after the first few times, this movie has a sense of visual wit paralleled by the verbal gymnastics of The Princess Bride.  All of the fairy tale references (and the none-too-subtle digs at Disney) were completely spot on, especially memorable moments like the torture of the Gingerbread man, or any of the 100 mile an hour references in the fairy tale character trade-in during the beginning.  However, the cream of the crop by far has to be one particular fight sequence involving the princess- Eat your heart out, Carrie-Ann Moss.Simply put, this film is the most purely entertaining film I've seen in some time.  Pay no attention to some of the surprisingly negative user comments here; if you do, you're probably missing out on one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year.

Despite all the time and money that was spent on Shrek, it fell far short of the accomplishment it could have been.In its technical aspects Shrek excelled.  The animation is fluid and precise.  Shrek's human characters are animated well enough to make Toy Story look primitive.  The donkey is particularly impressive. Rarely has an animated creature been so emotionally expressive with it's entire body.  The movie obviously had good storyboarding.  Each scene portrays the subjects with skill and style.  Shrek's fairytale world is a visual delight.  From the impressive sunsets to the lively forest, and from the dazzling stained glass windows of Farquaad's fortress to the swirling lava and foreboding decay of the dragon's castle, Shrek's colorful environment is fascinating to watch.In contrast, the script is largely a disappointment.  To be sure, Shrek does have its funny moments.  There is a notably amusing and well deserved mockery of Disneyland as Shrek and his donkey companion enter Farquaad's town.  However, the majority of the jokes fail miserably. Shrek has a decidedly unamusing preoccupation with fart jokes.  Much of the humor of the movie seems to rest on the curious assumption that potty talk and other crudeness are inherently funny.All four of the main characters display startling inconsistency. Shrek is ferociously fearless in tackling a pitchfork-wielding mob, a fire-breathing dragon and small army of armor-clad knights.  However, in the midst of this he also quickly gives in to Farquaad's requests and is easily intimidated by an angry Princess Fiona.  The Princess wavers between a helpless damsel being carried around by Shrek, and karate trained superwoman who can single-handedly defeat a band of thieves. The dragon repeatedly switches between trying to kill the main characters and being friendly to them with little or no explanation.  The donkey shows, perhaps, the most consistency with his unceasing, mindless chatter.  Eddie Murphy, as the donkey, does an excellent job of being as annoying as possible.  Mike Meyers brings a measure of balance to the Shrek character despite Meyers's well done, but out of place, Scottish accent.At several points the dialog breaks down into pure tackiness. The relationship tension between Shrek and Fiona, spawned from a hackneyed misunderstanding, is fit only for a bad soap opera.  Much of the dialog has a childish feel despite the PG-13 rating that was earned by the occasional use of obscenities.  The discussions among the characters become, at times, blatantly preachy. The banal presentation of such moral lessons as don't judge by appearances is reminiscent of didactic Saturday morning cartoons.The plot is plain and predictable, but suffers the most from its tendency to gloss over poorly explained points.  Add to the triteness of the plot top 40 tunes to accompany it, WWF style combat, and a Matrix reference and Shrek can be seen for what it really is just another conglomeration of pop-culture entertainment ideas.  While pretending to be a new and different perspective on fairy tales, Shrek has nothing to offer but overdone, worn-out themes.

They also never really explained the full Scorpion story very well in the very beginning.I wasn't expecting to think very deeply about this movie since it's just pure, silly entertainment at its most mindless.  Mummy Returns still retains its old fashioned action film appeal and I still enjoyed it enormously.  I even liked the campy one liners that I might have found annoying in another movie. Brendan Fraser helped a great deal in making The Mummy Returns a fun experience.  The special effects are great and the movie still scares.  I was surprised to see so many young kids in the audience with a PG-13 rating.I'd recommend it but I hope it won't be the best of this summer.  I'm betting on either Shrek or AI for that honor.

Shrek is a fun summer animated comedy aimed at real kids. Are you looking for a rated G fairy tale? Go rent the Fox and the Hound. I repeat - Shrek is a fun summer animated comedy aimed at real kids. Shrek is without a doubt the funniest animated movie to come around since Toy Story. If you didn't like Toy Story, you probably won't like Shrek. If you can't stand the preachy tone of Disney (as I can't) but you still want a funny movie for the entire family - GO SEE SHREK! The smash mouth tune to open the film was dumb and I was worried that the entire movie would be ever so hip. Not so. It's a good funny movie the rest of the way.By the way, one review that commented on the dated Macerana tune - you obviously haven't been to a wedding reception lately. Trust me - the Macerana is alive and doing well and the film-makers knew exactly where to place it.
