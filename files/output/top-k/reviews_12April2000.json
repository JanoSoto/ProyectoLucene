The cover looked soooo shocking and neat that I couldn't put it down.  I really enjoyed looking at it in amazement.  When I read the back cover, the story enthralled me to death.  I desperately wanted to rent it. The story was soooo different than any other scary film that I just had to see it.  I was too much of a chicken to rent it until I was in 8th grade. I had convinced my friends about the story and they wanted to rent it too. Finally we did.  I was scared to death from the very beginning!  When the blood came down on Carrie, I wanted to press eject.  I was that terrified. In amazement, I'd knew I'd never forget that  amazing story and it completely scared me.  There was a time when I saw a few minutes of it but still I was too scared.  Finally in 1999, I somehow heard that there would be a sequel.  I don't remember where, but I heard about it.  I had always been wondering and dreaming that there would be one and what it would be like.  Now I wanted to learn everything there was about it from that moment. I knew it was coming out and closer and closer, websites kept putting Carrie, Say You're Sorry as the title.  I agreed that that would have been an awful title, drawing virtually nobody.  I saw She's All That with a friend of mine and I had hoped that I would see a preview, but there was none.  After the movie, we stood around in the lobby waiting to see if we felt like talking to this kid we knew from school.  Not knowing whether we wanted to or not, I was looking at the posters for Coming Attractions.  On it, I saw a plain poster with a evil-looking girl.  When I almost turned my head, I saw a familiar pattern.  The title said The Rage Carrie 2 and I almost filpped out!  I said I wanted to see that right away and that I couldn't believe that there would be a sequel! From that point on, I knew what to look up on webpages.  I kept typing in Carrie 2 and nothing would come up.  Finally, I saw the official website but was not all that impressed.  It didn't have all that much.  After I had seen when the date it would be released, I waited and waited.  I NEVER once saw a preview!!!  I wish they put more and more trailers on tv and in the movies shown at theaters!!!  I bet if it was, there would be lots more people and more money being made!  Finally I was busy on March 12, and on March 13, I saw it.  It was about 745 or so and at the very very popular theater I saw it at, there weren't many in there!  We sat next to an older couple!  There weren't many teens in there either!  I was a little (actually a whole lot) bored during the movie.  It built up great, but I guess I wasn't in the mood to watch a movie.  The ending scared me, but it wasn't as shocking as Carrie.  My friend didn't care for it all that much, and neither did I. BUT later that week and ever since it was released on video, I HAD to see it again!  Something stuck with me and I needed to see it once more! Although I hated the gore, suicide, and dog part (you'll see if you see it) I just had this major urge to see it once more!  Finally I did.  It was gross, but great!  If only they took out those parts, I would love it even more!  I bought the video!  I was not all that disappointed, but great when compared to the first.BOTTOM LINE  SEE IT, RENT IT, BUY IT, VOTE AND GIVE IT A 10!  I HOPE THERE IS A FINAL THIRD SEQUEL!  THERE NEEDS TO BE!

Get it at Amazon.)This is the kind of film you can say is 'the best ever' and not look like an idiot, a comedy worthy of Voltaire or Cervantes, and a thriller to rival the best Hollywood ever produced. I'm willing to bet this movie will be remembered long after most of the movies of the Twentieth Century have faded to oblivion.Kubrick's satirical masterpiece was made not long after, and keyed by, the publication of such serious, but absurd academic tomes as Herman Kahn's 'On Thermonuclear War' in which the author assured us that nuclear war was not only survivable, but even winnable, and at any rate we could recuperate. Consequently he became one of the focal points of Kubrick's satire, embodied as Dr. Strangelove, the scientist with the arm-jerk Nazi salute and Nazi mentality, played chillingly by Peter Sellers, who also played U.S. president Merkin Muffley and British Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake. Kubrick and Terry Southern, who wrote the rapier-sharp screen play, proved profoundly prescient when it was discovered some years later that nuclear war really was not winnable because it would usher in a 'nuclear winter' that would becloud the entire planet for months or years to come, bringing starvation and death to billions. By making Dr Strangelove a Nazi, Kubrick was looking back, imagining, as we all were in those days, what horrors would have befallen the world had the Nazis gotten the bomb instead of the U.S. Start World War II five years later and we'd probably have Hiroshima in Chicago. Making Dr. Strangelove a Nazi also allowed Kubrick to allude to how the Nazi scientists were incorporated into the Soviet Union's bomb-building arsenal after WW II.Part of the effectiveness of the movie is how it is dramatically presented. As the Strategic Air Command planes are flying toward the Soviet Union to drop their bombs, the tension is wonderfully emphasized and prolonged by the long, almost languid conversation between a very relaxed Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) philosophizing over his cigar on the importance of his precious vital fluids, and a frantic Capt Mandrake politely suggesting that what is going on is madness. This is followed by the out-of-change-for-the-phone soda machine scene with Corporal 'Bat' Guano (Keenan Wynn) who is more worried about the possibility of petty theft than the possibility of nuclear war.Although this film would never have existed without the comedic genius of Terry Southern, major credit for its success must go to the actors, not only to Peter Sellars, who was magnificent, but to Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott who seemed to feed off of one another in a 'let's see you top this' flamboyant comedic style. Scott was later to win an academy award for his portrayal of Gen. Patton (Patton 1970)), but his work there owed a lot to what he did here as General 'Buck' Turgidson. By the way, all these 'meaningful' names and most of the hilarious dialogue are the work of Terry Southern, who also penned such sixties classics as Easy Rider (1969), Candy (1968), and The Loved One (1965), the latter from Evelyn Waugh's satirical novel about the funeral industry. Some memorable highlightsSlim Pickets proving his intimate love for the bomb by riding down on it, like a cowboy breaking a bronco.Russian Ambassador Sadesky (the name is, yes, an allusion to the Marque de Sade) explains why the Russians built the 'doomsday machine,' which would blow up the whole world 'We couldn't keep up with (the expense) of the arms race, the space race, the peace race...' (Another prophetic observation, by the way.) We feared a 'doomsday gap' (a take-off on the then current buzz phrase, 'missile gap').The scene at the hotel with Turgidson's girl friend\/secretary in her bikini answering the phone and covering for him as though she is a producer's secretary warding off somebody he doesn't want to talk to. The audience knows the call's about impeding nuclear war, but she must pretend Turgidson is properly indisposed. Peter Sellars as President Merkin Muffley talking to the Russian premier (Khrushchev) as an enormously patient, kindly father with a drunken son. Incidentally, Muffley's appearance was patterned after Adlai Stevenson, the democratic candidate for president who twice lost to Eisenhower in the fifties. Also note that a merkin is a toupee for the mound of Venus.Gen. Ripper telling Mandrake how women sensed his power and wanted his vital fluids; and how a significant part of the commie conspiracy was to fluoridate our water and poison us (actually a real concern at the time by some fringe groups).Second only to Pickens's bronco ride as a symbol of the movie is Dr. Strangelove's spastic salute to Hitler...Finally I have to say that one of the reasons this movie is still vital even though the Soviet Union has disbanded, is that the concern was real. During the Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties, Kennedy and Khrushchev came perilously close to nuclear warfare.

I'm willing to bet this movie will be remembered long after most of the movies of the Twentieth Century have faded to oblivion.Kubrick's satirical masterpiece was made not long after, and keyed by, the publication of such serious, but absurd academic tomes as Herman Kahn's 'On Thermonuclear War' in which the author assured us that nuclear war was not only survivable, but even winnable, and at any rate we could recuperate. Consequently he became one of the focal points of Kubrick's satire, embodied as Dr. Strangelove, the scientist with the arm-jerk Nazi salute and Nazi mentality, played chillingly by Peter Sellers, who also played U.S. president Merkin Muffley and British Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake. Kubrick and Terry Southern, who wrote the rapier-sharp screen play, proved profoundly prescient when it was discovered some years later that nuclear war really was not winnable because it would usher in a 'nuclear winter' that would becloud the entire planet for months or years to come, bringing starvation and death to billions. By making Dr Strangelove a Nazi, Kubrick was looking back, imagining, as we all were in those days, what horrors would have befallen the world had the Nazis gotten the bomb instead of the U.S. Start World War II five years later and we'd probably have Hiroshima in Chicago. Making Dr. Strangelove a Nazi also allowed Kubrick to allude to how the Nazi scientists were incorporated into the Soviet Union's bomb-building arsenal after WW II.Part of the effectiveness of the movie is how it is dramatically presented. As the Strategic Air Command planes are flying toward the Soviet Union to drop their bombs, the tension is wonderfully emphasized and prolonged by the long, almost languid conversation between a very relaxed Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) philosophizing over his cigar on the importance of his precious vital fluids, and a frantic Capt Mandrake politely suggesting that what is going on is madness. This is followed by the out-of-change-for-the-phone soda machine scene with Corporal 'Bat' Guano (Keenan Wynn) who is more worried about the possibility of petty theft than the possibility of nuclear war.Although this film would never have existed without the comedic genius of Terry Southern, major credit for its success must go to the actors, not only to Peter Sellars, who was magnificent, but to Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott who seemed to feed off of one another in a 'let's see you top this' flamboyant comedic style. Scott was later to win an academy award for his portrayal of Gen. Patton (Patton 1970)), but his work there owed a lot to what he did here as General 'Buck' Turgidson. By the way, all these 'meaningful' names and most of the hilarious dialogue are the work of Terry Southern, who also penned such sixties classics as Easy Rider (1969), Candy (1968), and The Loved One (1965), the latter from Evelyn Waugh's satirical novel about the funeral industry. Some memorable highlightsSlim Pickets proving his intimate love for the bomb by riding down on it, like a cowboy breaking a bronco.Russian Ambassador Sadesky (the name is, yes, an allusion to the Marque de Sade) explains why the Russians built the 'doomsday machine,' which would blow up the whole world 'We couldn't keep up with (the expense) of the arms race, the space race, the peace race...' (Another prophetic observation, by the way.) We feared a 'doomsday gap' (a take-off on the then current buzz phrase, 'missile gap').The scene at the hotel with Turgidson's girl friend\/secretary in her bikini answering the phone and covering for him as though she is a producer's secretary warding off somebody he doesn't want to talk to. The audience knows the call's about impeding nuclear war, but she must pretend Turgidson is properly indisposed. Peter Sellars as President Merkin Muffley talking to the Russian premier (Khrushchev) as an enormously patient, kindly father with a drunken son. Incidentally, Muffley's appearance was patterned after Adlai Stevenson, the democratic candidate for president who twice lost to Eisenhower in the fifties. Also note that a merkin is a toupee for the mound of Venus.Gen. Ripper telling Mandrake how women sensed his power and wanted his vital fluids; and how a significant part of the commie conspiracy was to fluoridate our water and poison us (actually a real concern at the time by some fringe groups).Second only to Pickens's bronco ride as a symbol of the movie is Dr. Strangelove's spastic salute to Hitler...Finally I have to say that one of the reasons this movie is still vital even though the Soviet Union has disbanded, is that the concern was real. During the Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties, Kennedy and Khrushchev came perilously close to nuclear warfare. Kubrick, Terry Southern and cast are to be commended for showing us the incredible folly of the age of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction).

Just like his acting, his directorship is astonishing.Though hilarious, the movie is definitely not original. When did best friends fall in love before? In My Best Friend's Wedding, when Julia Roberts found out she had been forever in love with Dermot Mulroney. In Keeping the Faith it is Ed Norton and Ben Stiller who fall in love with Jenna Elfman. But the movie has an irresistible charm of its own. Actually the movie is so enjoyable that one forgets about everything else.While the script is a bit of a let-down, yet cleverly written, the performances are pure gold. Jenna Elfman is remarkable as workoholic business woman, Anna Banana Reilly. She shines and she's full of energy. Ben Stiller is great as modern rabbi  Jacob Schram, who is terrorized by the women in his congregation. His scene with the aerobics-obsessed woman is his funniest, followed very closely by the scene when he tries to get past a security guard. Best of all is Edward Norton, who is playing his character so low-key, that he is downright endearing. This man was capable of playing a cold-blooded killer with a fake split personality in Primal Fear, a desperate man who gets a real split personality in Fight Club, and a Neo-Nazi in American History X. Now he turns towards comedy. And he is magnificent. There are some really good jokes (Edward referring to his drunkness and to the bottle in his hand) I am not drunk. I'm Irish and this is like milk to me. Now this is original. I've never heard it before.I'm not a fan of romantic comedies where the guy tries to get the girl. But this a comedy when the girl is already impressed by the guy and jumps completely and mindlessly (they did not think at the consequences) at the opportunity. Keeping the Faith is phenomenal movie that is bound to please everyone. 8\/10.

In Das Boot (or, you guessed it, 'The Boat'), Wolfgang Peterson adapts Bucheim's journalistic novel about a U-boat in late 1941 who are tasked to go into the North Atlantic and take on the enemy, primarily British convoys and other boats of the like. It's a grim, relentless, sometimes depressing but often invigorating story.One might also be thwarted, as I was for some years, about the idea of 'Huh, the Germans as the heroes of this story, get outta here.' But it's more complex than that, or rather it's not as simple as 'They're Nazis' in that way. Actually most of these officers and naval-men on this U-Boat, run by Jurgen Prochnow's character, have no real firm affiliation, and when they meet other officers when they pull for a brief stop in Spain, they don't even 'Sieg Heil' the other officers. Why this works for an international audience, why it didn't just stay a German-based sort of entity with minimal interest for outsiders who might still have grudges, is that Peterson and company a) don't have any real interest in the politics of anything, it's ALL about the sub and what the missions are, and b) the depth given to the characters (certainly in the director's cut, if not the even longer version) makes these people stand out as people first and foremost.Are they all super complex? Maybe not. Some come close to being clichés and stereotypes, though other times, wisely, before s*** hits the fan, there are some scenes given to showing the men just talking like men, about sex stuff, goofing on each other in that Tough sort of manner. Probably my favorite supporting character, aside from the Correspondent Lt. Werner, the sort of audience surrogate (rather, the guy who other people can explain stuff to so we know), is Johann. He has not a ton of scenes, but he has enough to have a clear, interesting arc where he works in the engine room, and during the big centerpiece of the film where the U-Boat is under attack from the Convoy and they're losing ground, he abandons his post and loses his mind for a few minutes. He apologizes, but can he really redeem himself? Certainly among this cast he has one of the most expressive faces and eyes.This was a fascinating watch for me in a number of ways - the fact that the filmmakers were able to hold attention for long stretches where, frankly, not a lot is happening action-wise, and we're made to just sit with these people and see what happens when they don't have enemies to attach or problems to solve, was one thing. And Pruchnow is a good actor who, frankly, is most effective in scenes involving eye contact (he has good, steely-blue type of leading man eyes), and when there's danger and he has to raise his voice. Otherwise, he has to be the Rock for these men, and does a good job. Other performances range from very good to just decent, but no one is bad at all here.But most of all, what made this raise from being a very good cinematic experience to a great one, was the ending. I wouldn't dare reveal what happens even with a 'Spoiler' warning, but suffice to say it's one of those moments where I practically had to laugh in astonishment. For a film this unrelentingly harrowing and bleak, the ending throws the kind of twist that is far from something unbelievable or out of this world. On the contrary, it's so logical and spot-on as a dramatic moment that it made everything else coming before it matter more - or at least have an ironic light to it.

And Pruchnow is a good actor who, frankly, is most effective in scenes involving eye contact (he has good, steely-blue type of leading man eyes), and when there's danger and he has to raise his voice. Otherwise, he has to be the Rock for these men, and does a good job. Other performances range from very good to just decent, but no one is bad at all here.But most of all, what made this raise from being a very good cinematic experience to a great one, was the ending. I wouldn't dare reveal what happens even with a 'Spoiler' warning, but suffice to say it's one of those moments where I practically had to laugh in astonishment. For a film this unrelentingly harrowing and bleak, the ending throws the kind of twist that is far from something unbelievable or out of this world. On the contrary, it's so logical and spot-on as a dramatic moment that it made everything else coming before it matter more - or at least have an ironic light to it. Das Boot is one of those very long guy movies that goes past how we usually view war films; the action happens and is any-number-of-ways-to-say-intense, but the time spent with the characters, observing them, seeing how long they're in this environment before things start to happen, gives the experience the texture of a long novel.

Some saw the movie as kids and may have forgotten it. Others put it up quite high on a pedestal against its other big contender, The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan's film that broke box office records (more than the 89 Batman by far), and garnered the first major Oscar win for a comic-book movie adaptation. This is not unwarranted, but sometimes it helps to go back and watch the original phenomenon and realize just how impressive something really is. And without getting into a you-know-what measuring contest over the two films featuring the unbeatable match-up of hero (Batman) and villain (The Joker) I'll just say this for me, Batman is almost everything I could want in a movie adapted from this source material- or just a movie, period.It's cinematically satisfying in terms of direction, music and production design. It astounds with a look that hearkens not only to Gothic architecture and the urban dark corners of a city like New York of the period (or of any period in the mid-late 20th century), but to a hyper-realistic attitude. It is, in its own way, quite surreal and at other times abstracted completely from our world to be identifiable - and also, it should be noted, to other movies as well. Seeing it on a big screen, or just in the clearest picture imaginable, you see how epic the design is, but how detail works into everything. You can get caught up in that winding road in the deep dark woods the Batmobile drives through just as you can a dark alley or AXIS chemicals. To call it moody is kind of missing the point it's moody by nature, by its own sense of cinematic calling back to previous monolithic examples of style (Metropolis is one example, but Vertigo's climax in the church is recalled at the climax in the chapel in this film).And if Burton and his crew rise to a challenge they set form themselves to make the film look and feel and sound unique, he also casts his film with a wonderful cavalcade of stars and character actors (Hingle, Gaugh, Billy Dee, Palance especially). Nicholson gives one of those performances like Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood you simply have to see it to believe it, and his scenery chewing as the Joker is sublime and totally tasteless in its twisted comedy (you'll laugh often, and then wonder if you should have, which is a great way of saying you went over the line and liked it), but even he has some moments (if only early on) where he doesn't go too far over the top. But also highly noteworthy- even underrated- is Keaton as Bruce Wayne, and to a degree Batman. It's slightly quirky, but perfectly modulated for a secret closet case who is, as he says, complex. It may even be one of Keaton's very best performances, as he's mysterious, oddly charming, and gives an evenly matched turn to Nicholson's given scene-chewing. And (to compare TDK just once), his Batman's voice is perfectly brooding.The film's script, too, is absorbing and intricate, giving a great deal of layers to sink in to as tragedy, comedy, and thriller mix together (hence the great popcorn movie title). If there are some minor gripes to have with the total faithfulness to the source with its mythology, and it does tool around with it (Ever dance with the devil on a pale moon light?), it somehow compensates, if just barely, by being of a whole piece feeling complete. Does it work better in the comics the explanation of Bruce's parent's murder? Yes. But for the film's exploration of its characters' psychologies, however much it does go into them, it works just fine (and, watching it again, contrary to what some have argued, Batman doesn't *exactly* kill anyone in the movie, not exactly at least).Little gripes aside, it's such a terrific combination of means of cinematic art performance, design, direction, cinematography, dialog, even props (gotta love the Batmobile and Joker's six-foot-long gun), all to create something extraordinary. If you give Batman a chance, and meet it at least halfway, its rewards are ten-fold. If a closed-off fan-boy, just... still give it a shot. After all, if you gotta go, go with a smile!

In addition, Christian Bale was absolutely mesmerizing in the title role. So although it was nothing like I expected, I thought that the movie was very well-done in other respects. 7\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"12 April 2000","score":"8 out of 21 people found the following review useful","review":"  Plainly put, this movie was horrible.  The attempt to satirize the greed of the 80's was neither original or well done.  What's lacking in this movie? Basically everything, but here's a quick outlinePlot- Obviously the directors found no need for a plot to be included in this movie.Acting- Bale will win an award for this one, I do agree.  But saying it will be an Oscar is absurd.  The only award he's going to win for this is a Razzie (Worst job of acting for the Year). Also, the movie as whole (assuming no other movie can equal it this year) should do at the Razzie's what American Beauty and Matrix combined did at the Oscar's.  The casting and acting for the other characters was horrible, but then again they weren't given much to work with.Comedy- The only thing they semi-succeeded with was comedy in the movie, but not for the reasons they hoped.  While we were supposed to laugh at the depraved nature of the greedy man of the 80's, I instead found myself and the other 300 in the theater that didn't leave half way through (which about 100 did) laughing at how stupid the things he did were (beyond psychotic) and how useless many of the sex scenes, dialogue, etc. were.Ending- Like plot, the directors found having an ending unnecessary.  I stayed in the theater (prescreen for University students) because I figured it would have a decent ending that might make me think and make the movie bearable.  Wishful thinking.In summary, don't waste your money or your time on this movie in the regular or dollar theaters.  Once it gets past those in a month, don't rent it either.  Don't even watch it for free on HBO... your time has to be worth more than that.  Watch the cartoon network or dumbo or something.  The only time this movie might be worth watching is once the producers of Mystery Science Theater 3000 get their hands on it and make fun of it (see the worst 100 movies on IMDb for examples of how MST3K can make bad movies bearable). However, this movie is so grotesque at points, they probably can't show it on cable.  It's the Devil's Advocate with more useless sex and absolutely no plot.

Coming as it did so soon after his masterpiece Sunset Boulevard where he managed to puncture egos in the movie industry, he outdid himself in cynicism and savage wit with this assault on the yellow press which almost tops its illustrious predecessor in quality but easily surpasses it in hard hitting cynicism.The story of a ruthlessly ambitious newspaper reporter who deliberately postpones the rescue of a trapped miner so as to revive his flagging career, the film undoubtedly exaggerates not only the greed of the reporter and of local traders but also ghoulishness of the public.However as with all good satire there was more than a grain of truth in points made and with a scriptwriter of Wilder's calibre it has many hard-hitting lines the miner's calculating wife when admitting to Douglas not only that she's not the religious type but also that her appearance is what matters most to her I don't go to church; kneeling bags my nylons.Above all Wilder's trump card was undoubtedly the casting of Douglas. As Cary Grant was flawless in portraying the suave debonair gent, so Douglas was peerless in portraying the ambitious amoral heel, particularly in his late 40's to mid-50's classics and he gave arguably his best performance here. The matching of Wilder and Douglas was truly a Marriage made in Hell.One of my all time favourites.But don't watch it when you're feeling depressed. It will destroy any faith you have in basic human decency!
