It is a mystery where the process of deduction comes not initially from physical proof but from decoding and analyzing a dream. This dream is at the heart of the movie, a redefining political thriller responding in a moody and sensory way to the Cold War paranoia of its time. Its problem is that it also responds with pat plot tunes such as the needless romantic interest in the form of a rather wasted Janet Leigh.At the film's roots is a premise suggesting the brainwashing effects of political ideology The soldiers have Pavlovian responses for opinions and they struggle against the dissonance they sense that they have with them. Indeed, the pivotal character is an assassin, an unwitting assassin, who blindly executes his deed at the sight of a playing card, an inanimate face to whom he endows all command of his conscious mind. The focus of the story is not political conflict but the deepest cognitive turmoil of those involved in political conflict. That is what is scary about politics, that it controls our points of view and our feelings. And if the only truth we can sense in our buried feelings, what proof do we have that anything is wrong? There is a bombastic right-wing political figure much in the tradition of Joe McCarthy, and yet is he the driving force behind all of his actions? No; it is his wife. His wife looks like any other affluent American family woman of the 1950s and '60s, but there is something about her, an effect she has on those closest to her, her husband and her son, where whether they like it or not, they find themselves doing her bidding. And even still, their relationship goes so much deeper than that.Sinatra was an extraordinary actor. When he, Major Marco, is having the same reoccurring nightmare, we don't just see a sleeping man jerking around and scrunching his eyebrows saying, N-no, no&#x85; He gives us a candid-feeling rendering of a guy dozing off, eyes open, shut, open, and the words he says in his sleep have less to do with the dream but how his subconscious would feel about it.There is such gravitas in this deeply paranoid story that to have any characters extraneous as that of Janet Leigh's, and to have her played by a name actress, a very talented one, is to diffuse the resonance of the subtext. When the dejected Captain Marco, played so persuasively by Frank Sinatra, happens upon her on a train, she approaches him in spite of all his apparent reluctance to be social, and trades contact information. It could be read as an exchange of signals of some sort, that there is something about her identity buried beneath the unassuming surface of a charmed-at-first-sight encounter. Is she working for the Communists? Considering the nature of the story's diabolical Communist plot, there is truly nowhere to run or hide from their operatives and their influence. Alas, however, this is never followed through, and she is reduced to not only a romantic foil for the leading man but a piece of scenery.Nevertheless, The Manchurian Candidate is a haunting and unique film. There are moments in the earlier half of the film that feel like black comedy, mostly owing to the nature of such passive men, who've been hypnotized into believing they are at a tea party, committing ruthlessly violent acts by the orders of who they see as caricatured old ladies, as if to have just been told to fetch more napkins. And yet this dark humor germinates into horrific tragedy. As a matter of fact, the film ends on one of the saddest notes of any film of its kind. Just as it pointedly unites right-wing politicians with their perceived left-wing enemies, the movie unites tone in a way only Frankenheimer seemed to be doing at the time. The film broods, chuckles and creates an equal parallel third of tension, as in what was the first karate fight in an American film, or the climactic scene which, at the same time it seems baffling, it also feels inevitable.

Is that because, as an actress, she had very little ability? Or was it that her iconic status as a sex symbol has obscured what other talents she might have had? The fact that she was time and again cast as a mere object of infatuation in productions that were in all other respects technical masterpieces has certainly confused the issue.As star vehicles go, they don't come much plusher than The Seven Year Itch. This is the first really classic comedy to be penned by Billy Wilder (although admittedly most of it is from the George Axelrod play), and in my opinion it is actually slightly funnier even than Some Like It Hot, even if it lacks that picture's madcap pacing. It's particularly neat the way so many jokes are seemingly inconsequential things that are funny only in the context of the whole thing - for example Ewell and Monroe going to see The Creature from the Black Lagoon, when it has already been referenced in one of Ewell's daydreams as a description of his own lecherous self. Ewell's almost constant commentary on his own life functions a lot like the voice-over narrative used in earlier Wilder pictures like Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard, and make the whole thing smooth and simple to follow.Wilder's direction is on top form too. This was his first picture in the 'scope aspect ratio, and he makes the most of it. One of his favourite tricks was squeezing in little details in the frame for audiences to pick up on. More screen space means more room for detail, and a particular recurring one here is Ricky's paddle, which hoves into view at every awkward moment like Ewell's guilty conscience. A particularly innovative use of the widescreen format is as a signifier that a daydream sequence is about to begin. Whereas in the olden days (and still a fair bit in the newen days) we made do with the corniness of a slow dolly in, Wilder prefaces the Miss Morris seduction flashback by having the right-hand half of the screen empty next to Tom Ewell, with a dim glow like a spotlight about to be stepped into. Incidentally this is more akin to how it is done on the stage, where you can't of course cut to another scene, but you can shift an audience's attention horizontally.And supporting Miss Monroe is a superb, if not immediately obvious cast. Apparently among the original choices for the male lead was Gary Cooper(!) However Tom Ewell, despite not being a familiar face on the screen, originated the role on stage and it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the part. He really gets this slightly skewed, subtle kind of humour, and much of the impact of the jokes is in his timing, his deadpan delivery, and his general demeanour. Honourable mentions also go to Robert Strauss, far more effective here than in the role he was Oscar-nominated for in Stalag 17, and Victor Moore, who appears for all of ten seconds, but is memorable because, well he's Victor Moore.And what about Marilyn herself? Is she simply the icing on the cake, a blonde bimbo sitting prettily while all the real work goes on around her? The answer is simple - if Monroe couldn't act, why would people like Wilder have wasted their time on her? After all, there were actresses like Jane Russell who occupied similar sexual territory to Monroe but never got further than being ogled at in trashy B-movies. Monroe often acted the dumb blonde because she was required to, but it's something she put considerable thought, personality and even a believable humanity into. Yes, Monroe is the pretty girl in the middle of The Seven Year Itch, but without a strong centre even the finest picture would have collapsed like a house of cards.

And above all, passion.Such is the makeup of Shakespeare in Love, an incredible film written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard and directed by John Madden. This film follows the story of William Shakespeare, a lowly playwright struggling to buy a share in the Chamberlain's Men. Will Shakespeare, as played by the perfectly-cast Joseph Fiennes, is portrayed in a refreshing new way. History's greatest dramatist and most famous playwright is brought to a surprisingly human level, allowing a connection with his audience that most have never felt. The Bard himself, William Shakespeare, poor and with a bad case of writer's block? William Shakespeare, underestimated and relatively undesired as a writer? Incomprehensible. Yet such is Will's lot in life, at least until his patron, Phillip Henslowe, begs him to write a play to help Henslowe out of debt. Will has talked of a play called Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter, and Henslowe demands he finish it. Yet Will has not even begun it, and cannot until he finds his muse, his Aphrodite, his inspiration.Joseph Fiennes plays the Bard with such aplomb, such passion, such humanity, that he is instantly understandable to even the most Shakespeare-wary audience member. And to die-hard Shakespeare fans such as myself, to see the Bard in action makes it all the more real. The plays, the wit, the writing itself. Fiennes depicts a Shakespeare that no one ever thought of - poor, uninspired - and yet never for one moment do we doubt his zeal for words, for love, and his ability to weave his passion and love right into his words.Gwyneth Paltrow. Simply saying the name leaves me speechless. Her role as Viola de Lessops, and within the movie, as both Romeo and Juliet, is simply astounding. She won the 1999 Oscar for Best Actress, and there was never any doubt that she would. From her first close-up, her radiant beauty is breathtaking, and her fervor for poetry transfers from her character to her audience. Lady Viola is first seen attending one of Shakespeare's plays, whom she of course reveres. Being a wealthy and beautiful young lady, she immediately attracts the attention of the priggish Lord Wessex (Colin Firth, in a hilarious role as the inept villain), who needs her father's money to pay off his debts. Wessex's attempt at poetry consists of saying it was her eyes that made him decide to marry her - no, it was her lips. Yet, as Viola so aptly says, All the men at court are without poetry. If they see me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love, above all. Not the art form, postures of love. But love that overthrows life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart with nothing to be done come ruin or rapture! Love as there has never been in a play. (Paltrow's delivery of said line is reason enough to see this movie! AMAZING!!!) Enter Will Shakespeare! A chance meeting at her father's mansion has the two immediately in love (although Viola already loved the persona of Shakespeare, through his plays), and thus a passionate affair ensues. Will is inspired by Viola's beauty and ability to take his words and bring them to life; thus, he begins his play, Romeo and Juliet. The play mirrors the lovers' circumstances &#x96; star-crossed lovers forced apart by their society after only a short, passionate time together. Viola longs to be an actor, but as women were barred from the stage, she must act under the disguise of Thomas Kent. She is cast as Romeo in Will's play, and goes through rehearsals until she is discovered as a woman, and the play is closed. At the last minute, Shakespeare is offered a new theater, and the play reopens, however as Viola was playing Romeo, Will must take over the role. Then, after the play has already begun, the boy playing Juliet experiences the voice change of puberty, and Viola must take the stage as Juliet to Will's Romeo. Their passion and love for one another and for beauty and poetry allow them to play their roles as we the modern audience have never seen before. Yet, Viola has already married Wessex, as Queen Elizabeth (the incredible Judi Dench) has commanded of her. So their performance, while it wins a wager Will had made that a play could truly capture the essence of love, mirrors their own lives, and is their farewell to each other. As even a Queen cannot break a lawful marriage, Viola and Shakespeare part, never to see each other again, and Shakespeare immortalizes Viola in his next play, Twelfth Night.I promise that you have never seen such a beautiful period film, nor one with more passion, nor one with more beautiful words or performances. The costumes, makeup, sets, all are superb and very accurate to Elizabethan England. Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes are completely perfectly cast, and Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth is undeniably astounding. Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, Ben Affleck (who manages to be decent AND funny in his small role as Ned Alleyn! Seriously!), Imelda Staunton and Rupert Everett simply excel at their parts, whether they bring comic relief, tension or mere dry humor to the script. See. This. Film. NOW! It is astounding, and it boasts breathtaking beauty in its sets, locations, actors, costumes, script and performances. It doesn't get any better than Shakespeare in Love.

Wessex's attempt at poetry consists of saying it was her eyes that made him decide to marry her - no, it was her lips. Yet, as Viola so aptly says, All the men at court are without poetry. If they see me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love, above all. Not the art form, postures of love. But love that overthrows life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart with nothing to be done come ruin or rapture! Love as there has never been in a play. (Paltrow's delivery of said line is reason enough to see this movie! AMAZING!!!) Enter Will Shakespeare! A chance meeting at her father's mansion has the two immediately in love (although Viola already loved the persona of Shakespeare, through his plays), and thus a passionate affair ensues. Will is inspired by Viola's beauty and ability to take his words and bring them to life; thus, he begins his play, Romeo and Juliet. The play mirrors the lovers' circumstances &#x96; star-crossed lovers forced apart by their society after only a short, passionate time together. Viola longs to be an actor, but as women were barred from the stage, she must act under the disguise of Thomas Kent. She is cast as Romeo in Will's play, and goes through rehearsals until she is discovered as a woman, and the play is closed. At the last minute, Shakespeare is offered a new theater, and the play reopens, however as Viola was playing Romeo, Will must take over the role. Then, after the play has already begun, the boy playing Juliet experiences the voice change of puberty, and Viola must take the stage as Juliet to Will's Romeo. Their passion and love for one another and for beauty and poetry allow them to play their roles as we the modern audience have never seen before. Yet, Viola has already married Wessex, as Queen Elizabeth (the incredible Judi Dench) has commanded of her. So their performance, while it wins a wager Will had made that a play could truly capture the essence of love, mirrors their own lives, and is their farewell to each other. As even a Queen cannot break a lawful marriage, Viola and Shakespeare part, never to see each other again, and Shakespeare immortalizes Viola in his next play, Twelfth Night.I promise that you have never seen such a beautiful period film, nor one with more passion, nor one with more beautiful words or performances. The costumes, makeup, sets, all are superb and very accurate to Elizabethan England. Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes are completely perfectly cast, and Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth is undeniably astounding. Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, Ben Affleck (who manages to be decent AND funny in his small role as Ned Alleyn! Seriously!), Imelda Staunton and Rupert Everett simply excel at their parts, whether they bring comic relief, tension or mere dry humor to the script. See. This. Film. NOW! It is astounding, and it boasts breathtaking beauty in its sets, locations, actors, costumes, script and performances. It doesn't get any better than Shakespeare in Love. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"15 May 2010","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Love. Inspiration. Wit. Beauty. Poetry. Adventure. Tragedy. And above all, passion.Such is the makeup of Shakespeare in Love, an incredible film written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard and directed by John Madden. This film follows the story of William Shakespeare, a lowly playwright struggling to buy a share in the Chamberlain's Men. Will Shakespeare, as played by the perfectly-cast Joseph Fiennes, is portrayed in a refreshing new way. History's greatest dramatist and most famous playwright is brought to a surprisingly human level, allowing a connection with his audience that most have never felt. The Bard himself, William Shakespeare, poor and with a bad case of writer's block? William Shakespeare, underestimated and relatively undesired as a writer? Incomprehensible. Yet such is Will's lot in life, at least until his patron, Phillip Henslowe, begs him to write a play to help Henslowe out of debt. Will has talked of a play called Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter, and Henslowe demands he finish it. Yet Will has not even begun it, and cannot until he finds his muse, his Aphrodite, his inspiration.Joseph Fiennes plays the Bard with such aplomb, such passion, such humanity, that he is instantly understandable to even the most Shakespeare-wary audience member. And to die-hard Shakespeare fans such as myself, to see the Bard in action makes it all the more real. The plays, the wit, the writing itself. Fiennes depicts a Shakespeare that no one ever thought of - poor, uninspired - and yet never for one moment do we doubt his zeal for words, for love, and his ability to weave his passion and love right into his words.Gwyneth Paltrow. Simply saying the name leaves me speechless. Her role as Viola de Lessops, and within the movie, as both Romeo and Juliet, is simply astounding. She won the 1999 Oscar for Best Actress, and there was never any doubt that she would. From her first close-up, her radiant beauty is breathtaking, and her fervor for poetry transfers from her character to her audience.

Needless to say, the sun never set on that romance.Maybe the clip they should show more often as representative of this film is Montgomery Clift blowing Taps for Frank Sinatra, tears streaming down his face over a wasted loss of life, that of a best friend to boot. When Fatso Judson (Ernest Borgnine) first emerged from the alley fight, I couldn't believe he got the upper hand on Prewitt (Clift); that was a great tease. I have to say, I identify with Clift's character, he didn't give in to 'The Treatment' and stayed the course over his own ideals. There were times I thought he would crack, but Monty didn't let me down. Knowing his personal history though, I did a sit up and take notice when Sinatra goads him to go into town after hours - You got any prejudices against girls? I wonder what he thought about that line.The surprise of the picture for me was Donna Reed. Not the role model Mom from The Donna Reed Show here.

So much so that I found myself in tears at times just by the look of longing, and the sorrow knowing how futile it all is, between Ben (Nic Cage) and Sera (Elisabeth Shue). There's one such scene where they're at a food court. They seem to be in some good spirits, and Ben pulls out a little present (adorably, if just for a moment, 'magically' from behind her ear) and it's a pair of earing's. He puts them on her ear lobes and whispers something to her that is quite touching. The look between the two of them only lasts for about ten to fifteen seconds (which, in movie time, may seem long), but it speaks so much as to their twisted condition of a relationship, and how much affection Sera does feel for Ben despite everything she has to put up with with him. Still could be worse, but it certainly won't get better, not by a long shot.I get moved in a film, such as Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas, when the characters have genuine feelings to one another, and, perhaps, there isn't the usual feeling that things will work out in the end. This isn't, for recent example, Crazy Heart. There's no telling really how Leaving Las Vegas will end, only that it will be in tragedy, for one or both of these souls. One is an ex-screenwriter ('ex' being at the start of the film, due to Ben's incessant drinking) who ventures to Las Vegas because he just needs to drink himself to death. Period. He's cashed his last checks, sold his car and burned his belongings. And yet Ben- via Cage's genuinely fearless performance- is not completely a down-and-out case personality wise. He can have his charms, he can be with it and hip... and other times the worst drunk you'd never want to meet at a bar or a casino.The other, Sera, is a prostitute, plain and simple, who works for a Russian fellow who treats her like s*** and, in the end, tells her to leave for good when it looks as if his own goose will be cooked by mobsters. She has little place to turn to, aside from her own turns at tricks, but she finds a connection somehow with this guy Ben. He's a genuine article, no BS, just a guy wanting to drink and to have someone to drink with (not sex, really, though the passion waxes and wanes). Figgis follows these two on this path that is inexorable. And at the same time he never asks us to really care about these people in the kind of artificial or forced way that we might get in a more Hollywood movie. Often a screenwriter will be asked when writing something What's the obstacles your character(s) will face in the story? In the case of Leaving Las Vegas, it's Is there anything left in the downward spiral? The film is a gorgeous, haunting feat of tragedy, as deep and involving as any film imaginable in the 90's (maybe not quite Schindler's List, but it's up there). The music by Figgis himself is a great jazzy mixture of tunes, sometimes with an upbeat tempo and other times the saddest music in the world (take that Guy Madden!) And the cinematography is to die for, so to speak, as he takes his 16mm stock and gets all of the moments that matter in such dark motel rooms and shiny Las Vegas nights. Hell, there's even a scene near the end, when Sera finally comes back to Ben after kicking him out, and in part it's the cinematography that makes one (or rather, me), sob like a baby. This film's got soul.As for the acting, it's almost untouchable when looking at not only that year of 1995, but the decade. Nicolas Cage has many bright spots in his career, but rarely did he give something as all-around well rounded as this in terms of playing the field emotionally. He can be funny, crazy, dour, tragic, even cute, and sometimes just the most happy-sad creature to walk the planet. You want to see why Nic Cage matters after years of trudging through Hollywood, come back to this as a reminder of what an intense guy this is. And Shue also hits it out of the park as the damaged but endearing Sera, who is earnest, kind, smart, but also knows that she, in a way like Ben, can't stop what she's started. When the two of them click on screen, you can't turn away. Last Tango in Paris comes to mind as a comparison, and even then it's not quite as passionate and moving.

Still could be worse, but it certainly won't get better, not by a long shot.I get moved in a film, such as Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas, when the characters have genuine feelings to one another, and, perhaps, there isn't the usual feeling that things will work out in the end. This isn't, for recent example, Crazy Heart. There's no telling really how Leaving Las Vegas will end, only that it will be in tragedy, for one or both of these souls. One is an ex-screenwriter ('ex' being at the start of the film, due to Ben's incessant drinking) who ventures to Las Vegas because he just needs to drink himself to death. Period. He's cashed his last checks, sold his car and burned his belongings. And yet Ben- via Cage's genuinely fearless performance- is not completely a down-and-out case personality wise. He can have his charms, he can be with it and hip... and other times the worst drunk you'd never want to meet at a bar or a casino.The other, Sera, is a prostitute, plain and simple, who works for a Russian fellow who treats her like s*** and, in the end, tells her to leave for good when it looks as if his own goose will be cooked by mobsters. She has little place to turn to, aside from her own turns at tricks, but she finds a connection somehow with this guy Ben. He's a genuine article, no BS, just a guy wanting to drink and to have someone to drink with (not sex, really, though the passion waxes and wanes). Figgis follows these two on this path that is inexorable. And at the same time he never asks us to really care about these people in the kind of artificial or forced way that we might get in a more Hollywood movie. Often a screenwriter will be asked when writing something What's the obstacles your character(s) will face in the story? In the case of Leaving Las Vegas, it's Is there anything left in the downward spiral? The film is a gorgeous, haunting feat of tragedy, as deep and involving as any film imaginable in the 90's (maybe not quite Schindler's List, but it's up there). The music by Figgis himself is a great jazzy mixture of tunes, sometimes with an upbeat tempo and other times the saddest music in the world (take that Guy Madden!) And the cinematography is to die for, so to speak, as he takes his 16mm stock and gets all of the moments that matter in such dark motel rooms and shiny Las Vegas nights. Hell, there's even a scene near the end, when Sera finally comes back to Ben after kicking him out, and in part it's the cinematography that makes one (or rather, me), sob like a baby. This film's got soul.As for the acting, it's almost untouchable when looking at not only that year of 1995, but the decade. Nicolas Cage has many bright spots in his career, but rarely did he give something as all-around well rounded as this in terms of playing the field emotionally. He can be funny, crazy, dour, tragic, even cute, and sometimes just the most happy-sad creature to walk the planet. You want to see why Nic Cage matters after years of trudging through Hollywood, come back to this as a reminder of what an intense guy this is. And Shue also hits it out of the park as the damaged but endearing Sera, who is earnest, kind, smart, but also knows that she, in a way like Ben, can't stop what she's started.

So much so that I found myself in tears at times just by the look of longing, and the sorrow knowing how futile it all is, between Ben (Nic Cage) and Sera (Elisabeth Shue). There's one such scene where they're at a food court. They seem to be in some good spirits, and Ben pulls out a little present (adorably, if just for a moment, 'magically' from behind her ear) and it's a pair of earing's. He puts them on her ear lobes and whispers something to her that is quite touching.

They showed movie clips from Over The Hedge, Up, and, of course, Chariots Of Fire. I would have never bothered watching this if it wasn't for everyone claiming that they had watched it and it made feel like the odd one out. The clip showed the part where Eric Liddell confesses to his sister that God made him to run. That scene was memorable and was so intriguing even if it was only one or two minutes long. My local library, luckily, kept a copy aside for me and I couldn't wait to watch this MASTERPIECE. I was ready to face anything but somewhere I knew that this movie wasn't meant for me. First of all, it was made thirty or so years ago and films that long ago don't appeal to me as much as the new ones. Second of all, I was prepared to be bored out of my mind by listening to all that British accents being portrayed and the boring plot. Third of all, I had no history of what the story was about and that, surprisingly, made the film feel more intriguing. The competition between Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams is very fun to watch and since I hardly know anything about them, you won't know who is going to win. At times you are rooting for Eric Liddell and his fast legs but the majority of the time, my attention was focused on Harold Abrahams because he is more likable and way more determined that Eric Liddell. The beginning creates a sense of nostalgia as you see either Eric Or Harold, maybe one of their friends, half-narrating the story which you will watch. The story starts as a bunch of runners are running on the beach dressed in plain white-clothes. That was a perfect background for the credits to be portrayed in. Even though the film is more than thirty years old, it felt like something made in the nineties and that's a bad thing. The date which it is set in doesn't even feel like it is the right time. It looks too futuristic for the date it was set in. Ben Cross is lovable as Harold Abrahams and he is fantastic in this picture. I guarantee you no one can play Harold better than him. I was very surprised that the film won four Oscars but none went to anyone, except a nomination for Ian Holme. Ben Cross should have truly won an Oscar or, at least, a nomination for his notable performance. Ian Charleson was fine not to win an Oscar but if it wasn't for his death, I am pretty sure he would be having an Oscar held in his hand right round. I can't say if he portrayed Eric Liddell beautifully since I don't even know how he was but if he was something like this in the film, I am sure he would've been proud of him. Ian Holme came to be quite a surprise for his performance of Sam Mussabini, the coach of Harold Abrahams, and he is hardly recognizable. He was the coach that everyone wishes they had. The award for Costume Design was earned well because the costumes filled in a lot of its time.The story, told in flashback, of two young British sprinters competing for fame in the 1924 Olympics. Eric, a devout Scottish missionary runs because he knows it must please God. Harold, the son of a newly rich Jew runs to prove his place in Cambridge society. In a warmup 100 meter race, Eric defeats Harold, who hires a pro trainer to prepare him. Eric, whose qualifying heat is scheduled for a Sunday, refuses to run despite pressure from the Olympic committee. A compromise is reached when a nobleman allows Eric to compete in his 400 meter slot. Eric and Harold win their respective races and go on to achieve fame as missionary and businessman\/athletic advocate, respectively.The moments where the film, literally, speed up or are filled with adrenaline are the best moments you will find in the film. The college race is memorable and contains a vague sense of nostalgia. The race is a race worth shouting for in approval, matter of fact every race in his film deserves your respect and more importantly, your valuable time. The Olympic races were tense and exhilarating, just the way I like it, and, surprisingly, I jumped out of my couch a lot of the time, to clap or shout  You can do it Harold! Yes, Harold! Good!. The music is ear catching and body moving. The film also contains, I think, some native British songs like He is an Englishman and many more. The music is great to hear but the title of the song is very hard to remember. The music is most of the time Christian themed. I highly recommend this film to anyone and I can't seem to understand why people do not like this movie. It contains of the best stories that are centered around the Olympics.

This was the first of the series not only to have the hockey mask but also to feature a hulking Jason (rather than the average guy he was in number 2...well, sort of average....). Also, since Ralph from the previous films is dead, they had some random bum lying in the middle of the road as the Doomsayer. He's hilarious not only because his scene starts off innocently enough, but also because he doesn't have any other scenes and because (for some unexplained reason) he carries around a disembodied eye. I really wish this guy would've been in one of the sequels, but I guess he just didn't have the same impact on viewers that crazy Ralph did. Also, like number 2, this attempts to ape the final scare from the first film. But the results are, to put it lightly, moronic. Besides the nutty homeless guy, the only character I really like in this one is Shelly. He's the token nerd who's significant for two reasons. One, he's hilarious. His incessant and gruesome practical jokes (possibly ripped from Pete Walker's proto-slasher The Flesh and Blood Show) annoy his friends so much that I'm surprised they still talk to him. Two, his character is the one who brings along the hockey mask that Jason goes on to wear in all the sequels! So this is indeed a very important character. The others annoy me to no end. Dana Kimmell as Chris is one of the worst heroines in Friday history. Every word out of her mouth sounds so snotty that I'd swear she can't even help it. Her boyfriend, played by Paul Kratka, is as dumb as a bag of rocks. I'm willing to forgive him only because he has the coolest, most eye-popping death scene in the movie.

Whilst i can only whine about how the top films on IMDb are voted by morons, i'd rather spend the time explaining why this film is a masterpiece.John Carpenter is a director who doesn't care for the norms. He's dabbled in horror and sci fi mostly as well as some action movies among others. But what he does in this movie is once again to blur the distinction of films. Not only does they live have action sequences and buff guys fighting but it also contains a clear and intricate message.Typical of John Carpenter, the film can appeal to one audience and yet cater for something outside that audience. That is the sign of a brilliant film maker.It seems most people fault it on being a cheesy 80s action movie with bad hair, ripped pecks, gratuitous violence and snappy one liners. Yet i don't see that as a bad thing. All it shows was the respective era of 80s film making and those benchmarks. They are all still very enjoyable elements which have been lost in recent movie making in attempt for even lower form of humour and brass action.What sets they live apart is the message that it tries to bring even though the package it tries to deliver it apparently doesn't fit.Well as i have said this movie would be good enough for anyone in the 80s or those who remember that era. But this film asked some deep stuff in a rather amusing way and some people wrongly believes that takes away from the message.To deconstruct this film i would say to use characters as buff as Roddy Piper in a way makes for a herculean average Joe. A character with a simple enough story but with the zeal and personality to get himself through any situation. He finds himself in the middle of very bad situation and yes the scale is played small in that regard. But that's the beauty of it, as a an average Joe the small scale of it makes him more effective than rather blowing up a mother ship.They live wasn't a big budget film nor an art-house movie and yet it feels more effective then either. Yes its a B-movie but its the best of that niche. While its played outlandishly somewhat it does it out of regards to that era of film making and previously alien invasion scare movies.The fact that this film has permeated even video games is testament to its appeal or the fact that over 20 years later its is still being referenced. Even the most cheesy 80s elements have become a hallmark for the film such as the infamous overlong fight scene. You could even say the overlong gag owes it self to this film. Even the underlying political and social message was sheer brilliance. Before the stark and dark tones of the matrix and dark city there was this film telling us that the world was not all that it seemed and the solution was as simple as joining forces and taking arms. That feels far more empowering then the superhero esqe matrix or dark city.So they live is a film above excellence. Even now the film is incredibly relevant and fun in its own right.

For one thing, we never really follow any one character enough to consider them the protagonist. You'd think Tommy Jarvis would be it, but he's barely in the movie! The good news is that there are two awesome scenes of him totally owning some poor guys with his crazy martial arts, but these scenes (along with just about any other from the film!) also demonstrate everything that's wrong with the film it's too silly and over-the-top, to the point that it becomes annoying (mainly during any scene featuring Ma and Junior, arguably the worst characters in Friday history). While it's supposed to be sort of a whodunit, it never really works because we're given no real suspects or good red herrings. In my opinion they should have based the film around the idea that everyone thinks Jarvis is doing it (which would've made for a better angle with more conflict), or better suggested that Jason had come back to life. This might have made the ending more surprising. Of course, might also have helped if the killer hadn't just been some random dude with a lame motive (or rather a poorly developed motive). While the original Friday the 13th doesn't exactly work as a whodunit either, it compensates by having an interesting actor and character for the killer. As it stands, anyone could have been the killer and it wouldn't have made a difference.This film seems to have a significantly higher body count than the previous entries, but kind of screws it up by not showing anything. They didn't show much in number 2 either, but that film was also significantly more suspenseful (and had much better developed and more likable characters). While the lack of gore is the MPAA's fault, the lack of suspense is still the director's screw up. After all, both Friday the 13th Part II and My Bloody Valentine are great movies even with the gore cut out, but this is merely serviceable.All that said, there were some pretty funny moments that made it worth watching. My favorite is probably Vic's reaction to Joey asking if he can help him chop wood (which is infinitely harsher than one would expect!) And I also liked the Reggie character, mainly because he was Dudley on Diff'rent Strokes (you know, the kid that got molested by the bicycle man?) And Corey Feldman at the start doesn't hurt either, even if all he does is stand in front of the camera with a dumbfounded look on his face.Anyway, it has its moments, but you might as well just skip ahead to number 6.

Then again, there is a large element of knockabout farce involved. At the same time, it makes some quite serious points about racism, albeit it does so in a way which was reasonable at the time but which, seen from a modern viewpoint, almost reinforces a racism viewpoint (the Japanese residents of Haleakaloa, for instance, are very stereotyped). And you might also think of it as a travelogue, because it makes full use of the beautiful Hawaiian locations. It's also worth observing that, viewed from 2010, it is pretty sexist, too - all a woman needs to bring her into line is a good spanking followed by a good kissing, and all that! But for all that, it is a good natured film, and it has a warm heart. Wayne delivers the character we have seen in so many westerns, Lee Marvin and Caesar Romero overact dreadfully (but, to be fair, they are required to), Jack Warden is the conscience of the film, and the sinfully underused Elizabeth Allen (she had a successful TV career, but this was her highest profile film) is its heart. I also very much liked Jacqueline Malouf as Lelani, in a performance of maturity beyond her years, bridging the gap between the inconsequentialities of a child on the brink of adolescence and the dignity of a princess born.I simply enjoy this film very much, and I treasure it for the moment which Amelia shows that she has worked everything out, and welcomes Lelani as her sister. one of my all time favourite movie moments.

And you might also think of it as a travelogue, because it makes full use of the beautiful Hawaiian locations. It's also worth observing that, viewed from 2010, it is pretty sexist, too - all a woman needs to bring her into line is a good spanking followed by a good kissing, and all that! But for all that, it is a good natured film, and it has a warm heart. Wayne delivers the character we have seen in so many westerns, Lee Marvin and Caesar Romero overact dreadfully (but, to be fair, they are required to), Jack Warden is the conscience of the film, and the sinfully underused Elizabeth Allen (she had a successful TV career, but this was her highest profile film) is its heart. I also very much liked Jacqueline Malouf as Lelani, in a performance of maturity beyond her years, bridging the gap between the inconsequentialities of a child on the brink of adolescence and the dignity of a princess born.I simply enjoy this film very much, and I treasure it for the moment which Amelia shows that she has worked everything out, and welcomes Lelani as her sister. one of my all time favourite movie moments.

I mean The Matrix American Beauty  Run Lola Run Toy Story 2 AND Fight Club! Out of all those films I mentioned Fight Club deserved the Oscar for Best Screenplay, Directing and Picture over them by a landslide!!This has to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It really forced me to think of the point of life and whether like them I need some crutch( for them it was Fight Club) to make me feel alive. I really think that Fight Club deserved the honour of an Oscar way more than American Beauty, and just because of that it obstructs my ability to enjoy American Beauty.The whole storyline is very original and entertaining at the same time. It kept me glued to my seat, waiting to see how Jack(played by the amazing Edward Norton), if you will, would handle the whole situation. I love the fact that they put little flashes of Brad Pitt in scenes for like a split second before Jack is aware Tyler. This film was created by a very meticulous director and it really shows that he paid attention to every little detail. The ending was such a shock, for a moment I was thinking I don't know how this movie could get any better, and then they put in that HUGE twist;also because of that twist the movie is even more enjoyable the second time around, and the third time and the fourth time.Another thing I liked was that Jared Leto played Angel Face, I thought it was pretty funny since I remember him in  My So-Called Life and now that he is the band 30 seconds to Mars. I just thought that was pretty cool, especially cause I didn't recognize him at all.Anyways, Fight Club is a great film, definitely the best of '99. You won't regret watching it.

Not only was this film brilliantly made with a perfect cast, but overall i was moved me in a way I have never been moved before. First of all, Kevin Spacey was amazing! Funny, passionate, engaging, and a perfect fit for the part. Well deserved Oscar. And I must say the rest of the cast was near perfect as well. But more importantly, the film overall was a masterpiece. Aside from the suspenseful story line, which certainly keeps you guessing and engaged throughout the film, the overall message the movie was trying to deliver was more about soul searching and reexamining what you live for. I know that may sound cliché, but the way this movie delivers this message is artistic, comedic, deep, and in the end, has you truly appreciating life in a new light. The line at the end of the movie sums up its message more perfectly than i could have ever put into words I guess I could be pretty p***** off about what happened to me, but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst. And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it. And then it flows through me like rain. And I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life. You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure.

Sure, this is not exactly a great movie, but it still has moments of brilliance recalling his masterpieces like The Killer and A Better Tomorrow. In many ways this is a perfect distillation of the major Woo themes for American audiences brotherhood, duality, heroic bloodshed, the man of action who must choose between his job and his love, lots and lots of doves, etc. A Woo primer, if you will. Admittedly guys like Nicolas Cage and John Travolta don't flow as naturally into the Woo-niverse (see what I did there?) as the great Chow Yun-Fat does, but it sure is fun to see them constantly one-upping each other in the OTT game.

This is superbly written and acted, and ten times more down-to-Earth and involving than the Godfather. If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen Goodfellas.....see it.The first thing we see on screen are the words 'The following is based on a true story' or something like that. In the twenty first century, those words are the hottest marketing gig going. Goodfellas was before those days. Next we meet Henry Hill, who became a gangster at grade school age, and went on to become hot stuff. He helped pull off the famous Lufthansa heist, but did he and his buddies get away with it? Goodfellas is able to cover about three and a half decades in two hours, without felling too slow or too fast. The story, is direct and detailed, and allows the viewer to become 'one of the boys'. Goodfellas feels like a party almost, with an occasional ballroom brawl here and there.I'm assuming because of its Oscar snub, that the film wasn't very popular when it was released, but of course brilliance doesn't come right away. It took years for the world to recognize just how groundbreaking Citizen Kane was. No movie is perfect, but Goodfellas is pretty close.
