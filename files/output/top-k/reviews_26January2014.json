The concept of The Breakfast Club is exactly that. Five teenagers from all walks of society are forced to stay in a room together, and through this they bond and we learn so much about them. And it's also funny, nostalgic and a movie that only John Hughes could have pulled off well.The five characters are high school stereotypes, and I think there's one of them that each of us relate to. There's the jock, the rebel, the psycho, the prom-queen and the geek, and they all think they're so different from each other. At first, they argue and fight during their detention. Eventually, though, they realise that they're not so different, and actually have a shared hatred &#x96; the authority which is keeping them in detention. We see them rebel together, get high and reveal their darkest secrets. It manages to be charming and funny while never reaching cliché. Where Hughes is a master is character development, and he shows us how the characters are bonding and developing without being too preachy.The script and direction is very well managed, with John Hughes tapping into the teenage mentality perfectly. What's odd is how timeless the film is, with little having changed in school character-types over almost 30 years. The acting is also great, with Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall giving especially strong performances. The film's focus on teenagers also gives a message about the problems of adults, and the one major adult character in the film, played by Paul Gleason, is also one of my favourites. He is written really well as the antagonistic vice- principal, and Hughes succeeds well in allowing the teens to usurp him, but not too easily.The one main flaw that the film has is in its single setting. It works for the majority, but there are definitely times where it lags and feels trapped by the confines that it has set itself. There is not much action in some parts, and the dialogue doesn't always carry it through. That said, it's funny and enjoyable, and an important piece of film for any adolescent to see. There's something for all of us to learn in the adventures of The Breakfast Club.

It's a fun action-Western from director Walter Hill, a filmmaker often at his best when portraying tough male milieus. With story credit going to Fred Rexer and the colourful John Milius, it deliberately makes its way towards an exciting confrontation when bullets fly and countless squibs go off. This will mean that some viewers will be turned off, but others will enjoy the visceral quality of this material. Certainly one of the movie's prime assets is a kick ass cast of cool actors, not just Nolte and Boothe.The two leads play former childhood friends now on opposite sides of the law, a familiar enough premise. Jack Benteen (Nolte) is a Texas Ranger and Cash Bailey (Boothe) is a big time drug dealer, and Jack wants to give Cash every chance to surrender peaceably. While this is going on, they fight over the affections of a saloon singer, Sarita (the very sexy Maria Conchita Alonso) and a team of mercenaries led by Major Paul Hackett (Michael Ironside) has their own plans that involve a bank robbery.You know you'll have a good time when you see that Hackett's comrades are played by (among others) Clancy Brown and William Forsythe. Rip Torn makes the most of his screen time as Jack's colleague Sheriff Hank Pearson. Other familiar faces in the cast include Larry B. Scott, John Dennis Johnston, Luis Contreras, Gary Carlos Cervantes, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, Marco Rodriguez, Mickey Jones, and a briefly seen Lin Shaye. Forsythe in particular tears up the scenery. The sun baked cinematography (by Matthew F. Leonetti), Texas and California locales, and soaring Jerry Goldsmith music are all credits to the movie.The audience should be able to enjoy the twisty plot, the interplay between the two main characters, and the big finish. All in all, this proves to be a solid outing for Hill and his cast & crew.Seven out of 10.

The first part is greatly conceived two main characters make a great team - Mr. Miyagi is a calm and dignified man specialized in martial arts, with positive and compelling life philosophy. Not only does he teach Daniel-san karate, but he also teaches him the most important values in life. He is a magnificent teacher and a wonderful friend. Daniel-san is a very simple young man with a friendly personality and strong mind, willing to fight and do good things. This first part is really a nicely done movie, with very good actors and very positive thoughts. Without Mr. Miyagi, the film probably wouldn't be the same, but it is also Daniel who brings the energy in the movie while Mr. Miyagi teaches him to find balance in life. The second part, in my opinion, was not as good as the first one, the third was good, but again, not as good as the first one, while the fourth part (The next karate kid) is definitely the worst, because that chemistry that was there with Daniel is not present any more, and in most of the movie there is not much action or energy as in the first part. Although we cannot say that the remake is bad (since Jackie Chan is a nice actor after all), it does not have the same peaceful energy and chemistry as in this movie. Mr. Miyagi and Daniel-san are a combination that is not easy to repeat. I highly recommend this movie, if you like good,positive action and master-student-relationship movies.
