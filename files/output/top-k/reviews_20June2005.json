La Femme Nikita is one of the most important films of the nineties, an outstanding thriller that revolutionized French cinema.Anne Parillaud stars as Nikita, a young punk who kills three cops while trying to get drugs. She is sentenced to life in prison, but instead of going to jail, she finds that her death has been faked. She is given a new identity, and trained by the government as an elite assassin. After three years of training, she is allowed back on the streets, free to enjoy life, with one condition - whenever the government needs her, she be there. The consequence of not responding to a call is death.The cast is terrific. Parillaud is very good. Jean-Hugues Anglade is very amiable as Nikita's loving husband, Marco. Tcheky Karyo is great, playing Bob, Nikita's mentor and often unintentional tormentor. Jean Reno - who would later become famous for starring in director Luc Besson's Leon - steals the show for his brief appearance as inhumane cleaner Victor.Luc Besson's direction is without flaw. While he clearly has a sense of artistry, he knows exactly how to capture scenes on film. His script is also intelligent. It begins as a violent action film and becomes a suspenseful thriller, tinged with romance.Then there's Eric Serra's score. I myself have been a fan of Serra's work ever since hearing his work on GoldenEye, and I would say Nikita may be his best score. It is perfect, sometimes booming, sometimes exciting, sometimes hip and sometimes sad.Nikita - which oddly received an extended French title, La Femme Nikita, for its international release - is one of the best thrillers made. Luc Besson knows how to make movies, and it shows here. The film's American remake, Point of No Return, couldn't begin to compete with this film, and although the popular TV series inspired by this film may have been great, it still can't compare to the original. A true, top-notch thriller.

Basically this is the story of a young deer named Bambi, hailed as the Prince of the Forest, seeing his life through all four seasons going from doe to adolescent, essentially The Circle of Life, before The Lion King. So Bambiis born in the spring in the thicket with his mother and all forest animals onlooking, and in the summer he learns to walk and talk with the help of his friend Thumper the rabbit and a skunk he call Flower, and he sees the meadow where he meets Faline the young female deer. In the autumn Bambi and mother experience a rainfall, then the winter sets in for a snowfall where Bambi and Thumper skate on the pond, and then tragedy occurs when you hear his mother shot by Man. Years later, Bambi, Thumper and Flower have grown up, and Friend Owl warns them that they could become twitterpated, i.e. fall in love without warning, and that is exactly what happens, Bambi is reunited with also grown up Faline. There is a rivalry between Bambi and other male buck Ronno, but in a rutting match Bambi defeats him and he and Faline become a couple, and they continue their flirting and dancing in the woods. Danger sets in however when Man causes a forest fire, Bambi and his father help Faline escape attack dogs, and then they flee the fire over waterfall and onto a small island. The film ends with springtime once again, all the animals of the wood gather at the thicket, and Faline reveals her own two does, with Bambi and his father proudly looking from above. Everyone remembers the mother being killed off screen, it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, it is the iconic scene of the film, but besides this my most memorable scene was the nice song Little April Shower. The characters that don't need to talk too much are cute, the music is magnificent to take through all moods of the picture, and the animation for the animals and wood landscapes is outstanding quality, a must see animation. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for Love Is a Song, Best Music for Frank Churchill and Edward H. Plumb, and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe Special Award for Walt Disney.

I can't help being sympathetic with Mr. Drayton (Spencer Tracy) because he had to make a very important decision &#150; sentiment versus reason. Mr. Drayton was right in saying that his wife (Katharine Hepburn) was a romantic person who was completely carried away with her daughter's happiness whereas he himself had to worry about all sorts of practical problems. In face of difficult situations like this, he could only follow his heart in the end. Despite seeing the film nearly 40 years after it was released, I am still undecided about the issues raised by the film. Not all of them are about race though. For one, why should the decision be rushed? Why couldn't the proposed marriage be postponed? Even if the future son-in-law were a white young man, the parents had every right to have reservations until they knew the future daughter(son)-in-law well enough.Back to the theme of the movie What if Dr. Prentice (Sidney Poitier) was not so prominent in his career but was just an ordinary black man with a modest job? Paradoxically, after all these years, we still don't see many mainstream Hollywood movies with a blossoming romance between a black person and a white person. Instead, a black actor is often teamed with a Chinese character. Jackie Chan's and Jet Li's movies are good examples.A few months ago, I saw Father of the Bride also starring Spencer Tracy. While that movie left me feeling happy for parents seeing their daughter (Elizabeth Taylor) happily married, this movie made me feel quite heavy. The speech Mr. Drayton (Spencer Tracy) gave in the last 5 minutes of the movie did not solve the issues brought up, it only marked the beginning of the many challenges the young couple had to face. Moreover, this was to be the last movie Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn made and what a superb performance they pulled off. Hepburn was there all along watching and supporting her love on and off the screen. For those who admire Spencer Tracy and would like another movie of a completely different genre to lighten up after seeing this great but serious film, I recommend Father of the Bride.

This new version was a Box Office disappointment. The film plays better on Video than it did in Theaters but it is a must see in Widescreen, especially Gary B. Kibbe's terrific cinematography.

This new version was a Box Office disappointment. The film plays better on Video than it did in Theaters but it is a must see in Widescreen, especially Gary B. Kibbe's terrific cinematography. Carpenter cut several scenes before the film's release. Scenes like 9 infants getting up together in the same time (Which is a Babies Puppet F\/X from K.N.B EFX Group), 8 Children Attacked and Probably Killing Three Other Children. There is good visual effects by Industrial, Light and Magic. Carpenter Co-Composed the film's music.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.351) transfer and an terrific-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD Features are the Original Theatrical Trailer, Bonus Trailer from Other Films and Production Notes. It would have better if the DVD has an audio commentary by Carpenter and Deleted Scenes. We might have these features on a Future DVD but highly doubtful from this Underrated film. One of the few underrated film by John Carpenter. Panavision. (****\/*****).

I remember being excited about finally seeing a big screen Batman movie with Robin finally making his debut. I can't believe it's now been 10 years since this movie was released in theaters. I firmly believe there are two camps of Batman fans. On one side, you have the Dark Knight fans, who love Batman as a gritty figure who fights crime totally alone. Then there's the camp on the other side, Dynamic Duo fans who like both Batman and Robin. This is the camp that I am in and I am downright proud of it. I am also going to speak against the negative reviews and give this movie a positive one. Starting with why I love this movie. 1 This movie has the Riddler and Two Face, which rounds out the most popular villains in Batman's rogues gallery. 2 I am a Jim Carrey fan, and I look at the Riddler as a character who could be funny like Frank Gorshin or dead serious like the Riddler on Batman The Animated Series, so I could enjoy the Prince of Puzzles either way. Plus, seeing Carrey using his natural comic talent was pure entertainment. 3 Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian. She is beautiful and her love triangle with Batman and his alter ego, Bruce Wayne was real interesting 4 Batman himself I only liked Val Kilmer's Batman scenes when he's in the suit. Bruce Wayne is a whole different story. If he did anything better than Michael Keaton, it was only with the raspy Batman voice he used. He was able to project that voice better than Keaton did. 5 One scene in Gotham City, in the daytime was actually shot in New York. But that was it. 6 The biggest reason I love this movie. One word ROBIN!!! I grew up not only with the 1960's live TV show, but also the animated cartoons of Batman by Filmation and the SuperFriends. Batman and Robin were always a team and I'd waited many many years for a big budget movie with them in it. Then I had to wait from 1989 to 1995 to see Robin debut. That's the only thing I'll give Joel Schumacher credit for, is that unlike Tim Burton, he was willing to bring the Teen Wonder to the big screen. Chris O Donnell does a superb job as Dick Grayson initially being an angry youth after the deaths of his family and Batman having no desire to make him his partner. The Robin costume was an extreme compliment to Batman's black batsuit while Robin's red and green are very dark in color. At the same time, Dick's costume from the animated series is what his family's circus uniforms were. And yes, I got a kick out of Holy Rusted Metal Batman. While I love this movie, it is not without flaws that keep me from enjoying this movie 100%. 1 The biggest flaw was the casting of Batman himself. To me, Michael Keaton was sorely missed and I guess he decided to bail since his buddy Tim Burton was not directing this one. I can't help but wonder what Joel Schumacher was thinking when he cast Val Kilmer. Kilmer does not remind me of Batman by any means. I just could not accept him as Bruce Wayne. Bruce is NOT a blonde. If Kilmer had to be the lead, I would have made him color his hair dark. So I just could not accept a blonde Bruce Wayne who looked like he was in his 20's as our hero. 2 I was surprised and disappointed that Two Face was portrayed as being funny like the Joker. I did enjoy Tommy Lee Jones's performance, but I felt this wasn't Two Face's personality and I really wished there had been some continuity between all four films other than the same Alfred and Commissioner Gordon being in the films. 3 Dick Grayson wearing earrings and nipples on the Batsuit, plus watching them suit up in anatomically correct outfits? What the hell is that crap?! Schumacher should have been B----slapped for doing that!! 4 The Batmobile looked a little weird for me. 5 Once again, not only is Batman upstaged by the villains, but once again, everybody learns that Bruce Wayne is Batman and once again, most of the major villains die at the end. 6 While I didn't miss Tim Burton all that much, Michael Keaton and composer Danny Elfman were sorely missed. Eliot Goldenthal did a fairly good job with the film score, but I preferred Elfman's music and I would have loved to have seen what he could have done for music regarding Robin, Riddler, and Two Face. 7 What's with Dick Grayson having a brother? In the comics, he was an only child like Bruce was.Overall,I'd have to say that this is my favorite of the four Batman movies of this era, but even this one can't beat Batman Begins with Christian Bale.

","genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"20 June 2005","score":"14 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" This screen adaptation of the John Steinbeck classic novel is a harsh, fantastic film that took the wind out of me with its frank and brutal depiction of desperation and longing. Movies about the Depression that were actually made at the time of the Depression by people who knew of what they spoke by necessity feel so much more authentic than later movies that treat the Depression as a historical event. The men in this film are quite literally living day to day, and the comparison of men to dogs that serves as a running motif throughout the film feels like more than just a poetic device. Like dogs, these men were faced with the scary prospect of some day being of no more use, and there was no system in place to take care of them when that day came.

I am a DIE HARD Batman fan. Yes. I am a fan of both Batman and Robin. Yes. I am a fan of the old TV series and the Filmation cartoons. Yes. I am a fan of the SuperFriends. Am I a fan of this fourth Batman movie? HELL NO!!! Now there are some small parts of the movie that I love and it won't take long to get them out of the way. 1 The title. I always wanted to see a big screen movie called Batman and Robin, BUT I'd have rather it have been the title of the third Batfilm instead of a dorky title like Batman Forever. 2 The sky surfing scene and the music with it. 3 The conflict between Bruce and Dick, both in and out of costume 4 Chris O Donnell as Robin. He was the only great actor in that movie. And lest I forget, Robin's motorcycle, the Redbird. AND THAT IS IT!!!!Like I said in Batman Returns, the four Batman movies have a common link, where Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher did good on their first movies, but got too carried away with their visions in the second films. Now while I felt Tim Burton got too carried away with Batman Returns, his craziness is actually sane compared to how carried away Schumacher got with Batman and Robin. Burton's overboard ways are actually forgivable.1 Once again, Gotham City did NOT look like Gotham City. The problem now was a neon fluorescent look that went way overboard. And their attempt to copy Batman The Animated Series and make it a retro city in its own time period fell flat on its face.2 Batman himself. Once again, just like his predecessor Val Kilmer, Batman was poorly miscast. However, while I could handle Kilmer's Batman scenes and not his Bruce Wayne scenes, the complete opposite happens here with George Clooney. I can't accept him in the Batman scenes, but I can believe his Bruce Wayne scenes since he looked more like Bruce than Val Kilmer did. But still, he was miscast. Schumacher said in an interview that it was time for Bruce to stop mourning over his parents' deaths and focus on teaching Dick and Barbara and care for the ailing Alfred. BS!!!! Batman is a grim figure and always will be. 3 Although Robin was the best thing in this movie, even the Teen Wonder has a problem that keeps the movie from being enjoyable. The costume! Why did they mess with costume?! For all intents and purposes, his costume and mask represent Nightwing. The only thing making him Robin is the cape. 4 Like Two Face before him, Mr. Freeze was funny! Arnold Schwartzeneggar portrayed him in a funny manner. I prefer the animated version of Freeze who is dead to emotions. 5 Poison Ivy. While I like Uma Thurman, I felt Uma went overboard with her campy portrayal of the plant lady and like the Riddler before her, her costumes got stranger and stranger as the movie progressed. 6 Batgirl Now that was a Bat Abomination!!! As far as I'm concerned, Batgirl should have been Barbara Gordon, not Barabara Wilson, Alfred's niece. And I would have preferred a redhead in the role. Alicia Silverstone was miscast. I actually prefer Dina Meyer's Batgirl scenes in the short lived Birds of Prey series. 7 Bane Totally useless. Doesn't talk and does not have the intelligence he has in the comics. He says limited words (BOMB!)and he acts like the Incredible Hulk!! This was proof that there were too many characters in this movie. 8 Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon. I never could believe that this guy was Gordon. He looked more like Chief O Hara from the TV series when he was wearing a police uniform! What was up with that?!! 9 This movie had the absolute worst Batmobile in history. It was a one seater like the Kenner toys and it had no roof. It looked more like a racer than a car. The final battle Batsuits and vehicles were a sick, filthy joke!!! 10 No musical score album for this movie. The Eliot Goldenthal music was mostly recycled from Batman Forever. Danny Elfman was sorely missed. 11 When Batman and Robin leap around, they look more like they're flying like Superman. Was that really necessary?! I think not!!!Batman and Robin could have been a great movie, but Joel Schumacher really messed it up once and for all, sending the Batman franchise into a Diabetic Coma for a number of years until now. Batman Begins really kicks the living crap out of this movie. Batman and Robin has got to be one of the worst SuperHero movies ever alongside Superman IV.

With so many good things generally said about this film, I thought I'd better give it a go despite already having seen the remake. The good things about it are generally true &#150; it is quite engaging, Rowlands is pretty good and it is a bit tense. However I couldn't help but feel that the strengths were more than cancelled out by the weaknesses, not making it a bad film but making it only an OK one. The plot is gripping enough and has been redone several times since this film but somehow it doesn't always ring true &#150; and this criticism can be carried across to the lead character. Would she really greet each mobster with spits of punk etc and always be pulling a gun, perhaps in fear she would but here she looks like she is in control. In terms of her character, she is harsh to the kid but yet never shows the growing affection that we assume must be the reason she cannot bring herself to do the wrong thing and hand over the kid. She shows it right at the end but it is too late to be convincing by then.This is not to take away from her performance, because it is strong, but it is not convincing as a person. Cassavetes has crafted a tough female but has done so to the point where she seems a few steps off being the Terminator. Adames may well be trying his best but he is annoying and his character was totally absent &#150; again not helped by the fact his material doesn't sound anything like a real person; contrast him with Portman in Leon and you'll see what a negative impact he had on the film. The mobsters are all Italian goons of the classic stereotype and they add nothing to the film in the way of actual menace. Cassavetes has done the job as director though and the film is quite tense while also capturing the city of New York of the time very well in regards atmosphere and grit.Overall this is an OK film with an OK plot that is OK if you can get passed how unconvincing it all is.

It wasn't bad. In fact, it was pretty near great.The story has been done before, albeit in slightly different form, so don't look for anything too special here.

While working as a janitor, his talent is discovered by a college professor (Stellan Skarsgard), and from there Will's life is changed forever. He meets his dream girl (Minnie Driver) and undergoes psychological therapy in an attempt to fix up his attitude. The only shrink who has any chance with Will, however, is another college professor Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams. Along with his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will embarks on a journey that will change his life forever.Damon and Affleck, at the time relatively new to film-making, grabbed an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for writing the tale of Good Will Hunting. Williams also received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the film was nominated for seven other awards including Best Picture. The cast is terrific here - even Affleck isn't horrible - but it's Damon and Williams whose performances really reach out and grab you.Someone who should have won an Oscar was director Gus Van Sant. His unique directing style gets moving performances from the entire cast and really brings to life Damon and Affleck's otherwise ordinary script. There's also a not-so-remarkable score by Danny Elfman.I find this film to be severely underrated. If you give it a small chance, it will really have an effect on you.

There's also a not-so-remarkable score by Danny Elfman.I find this film to be severely underrated. If you give it a small chance, it will really have an effect on you. Good Will Hunting is one of the best films of the year, a shlock flick turned into a touching wonder. This movie really deserves much more credit than it gets.

Part of this was, no doubt, the fact that the star of the Highlander films, Christopher Lambert, was united with the star of the Highlander series, Adrian Paul.The story involves immortal Duncan MacLeod (Paul) investigating the disappearance of his friend, mentor, and kinsman, Connor MacLeod (Lambert). Along the way he meets up with his ex-wife, Kate (Lisa Barbuscia). When Connor is finally discovered, the two must unite to battle an immortal no one can destroy alone - yet in the end, there can be only one.First of all, let me say that this film will make much more sense and be more enjoyable for Highlander fans. Had I not been a fan, I think I would've completely ignored the film.The cast isn't exactly extraordinary. Adrian Paul is great; it's nice to see Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes) and Methos (Peter Wingfield) turn up as well, although in dastardly short performances. Bruce Payne as Kell is pitiful, making Kell the most dull, uninteresting villain in the Highlander universe; Barbuscia is fine in an unbelievable role. Christopher Lambert's performance is good, but the way the character is depicted - suicidal, old, feeble, insanely depressed - is horrible.Douglas Aarniokoski's direction is fine, with a very nice score by Nick Glennie-Smith and Stephen Graziano. It's great to have Bonny Portmore back as well.The film has two major problems. First of all, the movie plays out much more like one of the episodes of the Highlander TV series than a motion picture. Second, the film is a major disappointment. The potential for this film was enormous, and yet it wastes almost all of it. It is a very dark, gloomy picture.In closing, Highlander Endgame is hardly enjoyable, and nowhere near as good as it could be. As far as the Highlander films go, the rule still applies in the end, there can be only one.

I don't know how else to introduce the picture other than to say that it is believed to be the goriest film ever made, and that it is considered by many to be the best zombie (and even horror in general) film ever made.The film revolves around Lionel (Timothy Balme), a kind-hearted and loyal young man forced to take care of his wicked old mother (Elizabeth Moody). When Lionel meets Paquita (Diana Penalver), a girl working at a local shop (who has been foretold that Lionel is her destined love), a romance blooms - angering Lionel's mum, who proceeds to follow the couple on a trip to the zoo. The story goes from sunny romance to pitch-black horror in an instant when Lionel and Paquita stumble across a bizarre creature in the zoo the rare Sumatran rat monkey, a vicious little beast with taste for flesh. In the film's first bloody scene - enough to get the film an R rating already - Lionel's mum is bitten by the rat monkey.Naturally, being the very loving son he is, Lionel takes his sick mother home and gives her his undivided attention. That night Lionel is visited by Paquita, and for a while Lionel forgets about his mum or anything else.From then on Lionel's life becomes a living hell. First, his mother dies. Then, she is resurrected as a zombie and begins losing clumps of skin and an ear. This doesn't seem good, especially when a respected couple arrive for dinner. Soon, friends of the family are bitten, or just nibbled on by Lionel's mum - and so they find themselves brainless, undead creatures as well. Then some of the kind local citizens - including a priest who kicks ass for the Lord - are zombied. Finally, most of the town has become zombies. Things aren't looking good for Lionel, who's trying to keep the whole thing under wraps - pretty much literally.How much gore could a horror film have if a horror film could have gore? I don't know, but I'd say Braindead is about the limit. People whose stomachs aren't made of rock should steer clear of this film, or any of Jackson's earlier pieces for that matter. Luckily, I was prepared for the gory festivities after watching Bad Taste, but even then I was surprised when - three minutes into the film - a man finds both his arms and, ultimately, his head cut off in an unflinching scene which gives you no time to blink. If there ever has been a more gory, disgusting, sick film that Braindead (or Dead Alive, whichever you prefer), I've yet to see it.For example, in one scene, Paquita and Lionel hear Paquita's dog bark and attack Lionel's mum. Rushing upstairs, they find Lionel's mum looking sick. Lionel goes to her and removes one of the dog's legs from her throat. (In case you haven't noticed, this is one of the most disturbing scenes in the film) Your mother ate my dog! Paquita screams. There's still some left, Lionel replies. We pull back and find the room splattered in blood, with hairy remains on the bed.Ugh.Braindead is rated highly most everywhere I've seen it reviewed, hailed by horror fans as a masterpiece. It is constantly competing with films like Evil Dead II, Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead for superiority in the Best Zombie Movie Ever category. I'd say it comes pretty close too. The film's nightmarish, unflinching atmosphere is something entirely unique to Peter Jackson. The acting is terrific - you feel exactly what you're supposed to feel when you're supposed to feel it. The score, by Peter Dasent, is also very fine, and gives the film a mischievous, comedic mood.Braindead is Peter Jackson's pre-Rings masterpiece, and one of the greatest horror films ever made.

I initially loved this movie when it first came out and saw it twice in theaters. However, I don't particularly like it as much as I did when it was released. Why? I'll explain all that shortly. First, here's what I do love and still love about Batman Returns. 1 Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman\/Bruce Wayne. He did an excellent job. 2 Catwoman Michelle Pheiffer was superb in the role and she not only stole the movie, I felt she was the best thing about Batman Returns altogether. Selina Kyle, the costume, and the attitude and her relationship with Batman both in and out of costume. 3 The Penguin's mutated look and nothing more. Nuff said. 4 Wayne Manor and the Batcave. The only two sets I really liked. 5 Michael Gough as Alfred. 6 As I said before, Batman and Catwoman's relationship as foes and in regular clothes, we see Bruce pursue Selina, unlike the first film where Vicki pursued Bruce. Plus, the reference to Vicki from the last movie gave it a nice touch of continuity.Okay, here's why I don't give Batman returns the high praise given by many. The four Batfilms of the 80's and 90's share a common link when it came to the directors. To me, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher both did good on their first films, but got too carried away with their own visions in their second go around, only Schumacher was worse about it.But yes. I feel that Tim Burton got too carried away with his vision in Batman Returns.1 Gotham City did NOT look like Gotham City. I absolutely refuse to believe that set for downtown Gotham was actually Gotham Square. The Zoo where the Penguin's hideout looked like something of a hybrid of the Nightmare Before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands. 2 The Penguin. While I like Danny DiVito as an actor and the mutant bird man look, the Penguin's storyline was totally disgusting to me. The Penguin was portrayed as an ugly character who was a product of circumstances he could not control (his deformity at birth) I hated his storyline. After watching the Penguin on Batman The Animated Series, I kept thinking, gee, why couldn't they have done that in Batman Returns? I liked it better when the Penguin is highly intelligent and considers himself a member of Gotham's elite. 3 The Red Triangle Circus Gang. What a sick filthy joke! I really hate these guys with a fierce bloody passion. They made the Penguin look even worse. I would have preferred real underworld thugs in comparison. Tim Burton got too carried away with this part. 4 Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. I liked the concept of the evil businessman, but Shreck's look just did not fit into the Batman universe for me. I'd have rather seen somebody like Rupert Thorne over Shreck any day. 5 I know that Dark Knight fans prefer Batman Returns over the Schumacher films, but I am one of those fans who like the Dynamic Duo, so I am a Robin fan and the fact that he was excluded from this film is one reason I don't care for it as much, even though he had been given a much better costume in the comics. But then again, there was talk about Robin being a street guy played by Marlon Wayans. So I guess I am grateful that Robin wasn't included just for the sake of not messing up a popular character.Overall, I still enjoy watching Batman Returns and I love Danny Elfman's musical score on the soundtrack, but the film got way too Tim Burton-ish for me. Batman and Catwoman really made this movie, even though Batman is once again upstaged by the villains. But to be honest, I like Batman Forever over this installment. Batman Returns to me, is mediocre at best.

Batman Returns to me, is mediocre at best. ","genre":"Action"},{"date":"20 June 2005","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw this movie on opening night and would start my junior year in college that fall. I initially loved this movie when it first came out and saw it twice in theaters. However, I don't particularly like it as much as I did when it was released. Why? I'll explain all that shortly. First, here's what I do love and still love about Batman Returns. 1 Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman\/Bruce Wayne. He did an excellent job. 2 Catwoman Michelle Pheiffer was superb in the role and she not only stole the movie, I felt she was the best thing about Batman Returns altogether. Selina Kyle, the costume, and the attitude and her relationship with Batman both in and out of costume. 3 The Penguin's mutated look and nothing more. Nuff said. 4 Wayne Manor and the Batcave. The only two sets I really liked. 5 Michael Gough as Alfred. 6 As I said before, Batman and Catwoman's relationship as foes and in regular clothes, we see Bruce pursue Selina, unlike the first film where Vicki pursued Bruce. Plus, the reference to Vicki from the last movie gave it a nice touch of continuity.Okay, here's why I don't give Batman returns the high praise given by many. The four Batfilms of the 80's and 90's share a common link when it came to the directors. To me, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher both did good on their first films, but got too carried away with their own visions in their second go around, only Schumacher was worse about it.But yes. I feel that Tim Burton got too carried away with his vision in Batman Returns.1 Gotham City did NOT look like Gotham City. I absolutely refuse to believe that set for downtown Gotham was actually Gotham Square. The Zoo where the Penguin's hideout looked like something of a hybrid of the Nightmare Before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands. 2 The Penguin. While I like Danny DiVito as an actor and the mutant bird man look, the Penguin's storyline was totally disgusting to me. The Penguin was portrayed as an ugly character who was a product of circumstances he could not control (his deformity at birth) I hated his storyline. After watching the Penguin on Batman The Animated Series, I kept thinking, gee, why couldn't they have done that in Batman Returns? I liked it better when the Penguin is highly intelligent and considers himself a member of Gotham's elite. 3 The Red Triangle Circus Gang. What a sick filthy joke! I really hate these guys with a fierce bloody passion. They made the Penguin look even worse. I would have preferred real underworld thugs in comparison. Tim Burton got too carried away with this part. 4 Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. I liked the concept of the evil businessman, but Shreck's look just did not fit into the Batman universe for me. I'd have rather seen somebody like Rupert Thorne over Shreck any day. 5 I know that Dark Knight fans prefer Batman Returns over the Schumacher films, but I am one of those fans who like the Dynamic Duo, so I am a Robin fan and the fact that he was excluded from this film is one reason I don't care for it as much, even though he had been given a much better costume in the comics. But then again, there was talk about Robin being a street guy played by Marlon Wayans. So I guess I am grateful that Robin wasn't included just for the sake of not messing up a popular character.Overall, I still enjoy watching Batman Returns and I love Danny Elfman's musical score on the soundtrack, but the film got way too Tim Burton-ish for me. Batman and Catwoman really made this movie, even though Batman is once again upstaged by the villains. But to be honest, I like Batman Forever over this installment.

It's got direction by Howard Hawks, characters, and people who actually talk to each other in intelligent dialogue and have to think, all set in a beautiful Western locale. John Wayne ably plays a man who has faces several challenges, in this fine screenplay by Leigh Brackett (of The Big Sleep and Rio Bravo fame). The challenges have to do with helping his hard-drinking friend, the Sheriff played by Robert Mitchum, combating a gang of badmen headed by powerful Edward Asner, and the fact that he's been shot in the back by mistake and that the pain causes him to be unable to move at inconvenient times. The production has a fine title sung by the great Ed Ames, titles by noted western artist Olaf Weighorst (who also appears as a gunsmith),; and its technical production is truly outstanding in every department Other actors contributing to this near-masterpiece of entertaining film-making include Arthur Hunnicutt, R.G. Armstrong, Christopher George and Charlene Holt in her best screen role ever. Outstanding contributions were made by Nellie Manley and Wally Westmore on hair and makeup, Edith Head on costumes and many others. Altogether a very-satisfying, adult and physically beautiful color western; writer Brackett was asked by Wayne to include the saloon scene from Rio Bravo in a rewritten version, and it works just as well here; the major change is James Caan as Alan Trehearne, plus the change of cast to Mitchum, Hunnicxuut and Holt, who are all very good indeed.
