[{"date":"3 October 2007","score":"","review":" What an odd fellow Andy Kaufman was! Watching the biopic Man on the Moon is something of an effort within itself. It's a film that seems to want to unravel the mystery that was Andy Kaufman, and yet at the end seems content to leave him an eternal mystery. And maybe that's for the best.Andy Kaufman wasn't very well known outside the US. To UK audiences, he's best known as the eccentric mechanic Latka from the sitcom Taxi. MOTM charts Kaufman's rise to fame, his offbeat antics outside the series, disagreements with co-workers and executives, all leading up to his eventual death from lung cancer in 1984.Of all the people who could have portrayed Andy Kaufman, Jim Carrey really was the man most eminently qualified. Not only do they look alike, they share the same birthday, and Carrey's acting style is perfectly suited and in sync with Kaufman's.To watch Carrey is to experience slowly growing astonishment. He so completely disappears into the man that he is Andy Kaufman. He doesn't just mimic the man. He is the man!MOTM was a film that Carrey notoriously campaigned to be a part of. He wanted it so badly he simply stopped calling himself Jim Carrey for the entirety of the film's production. On and off set, he was only known as Andy Kaufman.Although a box office flop at the time, MOTM is a real gem of a film. Not only because it contains one of Jim Carrey's finest performances to date, but I like it's imaginative construction.Directed by Milos Forman, he starts the film off with a cracker of an opening scene. A Black & White Jim Carrey in front of a black background welcomes you to his movie, speaking in a higher register. He admits he edited out the bad parts himself until there was nothing left. He wants you to go home. And proves his point by rolling the end credits (in order of appearance) to the accompaniment of a cheesily uplifting melody on a tatty record player. The picture goes black. Carrey peers around the frame. And is surprised to see you're still here. Then he speaks in his normal voice, and shows you the real movie.Its one of the most inventive, wonderful openings you'll ever see. But the scene impresses on more than one level because it gives us a fascinating insight into Andy Kaufman's mind. He was prepared to toy around with an audience's perceptions and expectations. He was a man who asked for a fair bit of patience from an audience. And just when it looks like his act is dying a horrible death, he instantly drops the act, and rewards you for your patience by launching into his real routine. That was the genius of Andy Kaufman.That one scene encapsulates the driving force behind Kaufman, and the film itself understands that too, helped in no small part by the astonishing performance by Jim Carrey.Nothing else in the film quite matches that scene's genius, but I really enjoyed MOTM, far more than I thought I was going to. Kaufman's routines were bizarre to say the least. And yet I still found them oddly funny. On the DVD special features, Milos Forman admitted he saw Kaufman doing stand-up. He had no idea what he was watching, but he laughed anyway. Quite often too. And I had similar feelings during MOTM.Kaufman would often begin speaking in a funny voice, confounding an audience with what appeared to be his sheer lack of talent. And then just as suddenly launch into an uncanny impersonation of Elvis Presley. He was the master of deception.Jim Carrey's performance is the one people ultimately talk about. And rightfully so. But there's a nice line of supporting characters too. One of the oddest touches to Man on the Moon is the inclusion of Danny DeVito. Now you may think that's an odd thing to say. Because DeVito played Louie in Taxi alongside Kaufman. But instead he plays Kaufman's long suffering manager, George Shapiro. That means he can't appear on the recreations of Taxi along with the other cast members (who all make cameo appearances). But oddly enough it works, and DeVito acts as the perfect sounding board for Kaufman's frustrations.Special mention should also go to the very underrated Paul Giamatti as Kaufman's friend and co-conspirator Bob Zmuda. He was the one man who seemed to understand Kaufman's style, and occupied the same head-space. They're friendship is touching and intriguing too.One of the most bizarre aspects to Kaufman was his alter-ego, Tony Clifton, an obnoxious lounge singer. I could never really understand why Kaufman immersed himself in such a thoroughly detestable person, but again Carrey plays this character just as expertly. Its a larger than life bit of acting, but Carrey lets out all the stops and makes Tony Clifton a completely different person. Which is as it should be.Jim Carrey himself seems a lot like Andy Kaufman in real life. Two outrageous comedians you either learn to love or hate. It may be that key which makes Carrey so perfectly suited to this role.When Kaufman learnt he was dying of lung cancer, despite the fact he didn't smoke, everyone thought it was another of his put-ons. Even I thought that. The film pulled off several narrative somersaults beforehand that really left my head spinning, so I was expecting the same thing here. Even during his funeral, you're half expecting him to sit up in his coffin and yell fooled ya.Andy Kaufman remains as much a mystery in death as he did in life. I don't think the film was trying to get to the heart of the man. If it did, he wouldn't be so fascinating. Its a film that wants to leave you confounded. Just as Andy Kaufman himself did to many an audience. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 October 2007","score":"","review":" What an odd fellow Andy Kaufman was!

He's a good fighter, maybe even a great fighter, but he's never gone professional and is starting to get old. Then one way on a whim, the champion of the world (Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers) calls him out to a fight. With some training and the help of a montage and a plain-jane girlfriend (Adrian, played by Talia Shire), maybe Rocky just might win. This is his story.Rocky's an undeniable classic. Heck, he's got six movies out now and maybe someday a seventh (though I would really doubt that). Anything I say wouldn't matter because it's been said by everyone else over the past thirty-one years. So, instead, I'll just say what I feel like.I really enjoyed Talia Shire's performance. Being the shy, simple girlfriend was a nice departure for her from The Godfather. Sure, maybe it seems like a useless role, but she's quite crucial to the plot when you see how she supports Rocky and also causes a wedge between Rocky and his best friend Paulie (Adrian's brother). So she was cool, and I liked how she became more attractive as the film went on and her esteem went up.Apollo Creed is a great villain. He's not necessarily a bad guy -- he may, in fact, be very nice. But he is an obstacle to glory and must be overcome, whether he deserves to be or not. Someone someday would do it -- why not Rocky? It was also nice to see Michael Dorn (best known as Star Trek's Worf) as one of his bodyguards.What else? The meat-packing scenes were cool, and an interesting training method. The iconic stairs scene was okay, but not as powerful as homages let on. Lloyd Kaufman shows up as a drunk, which is awkward but fun. And we have the classic song Gonna Fly Now that tells us hey, Rocky's really getting pumped. Like super-pumped. You better not make him angry.If you haven't seen Rocky, see it. I went over 26 years without seeing a Rocky film just because I never had a good reason to see one.

But as one who has seen a good deal of Shakespeare but never, before now, this one, I was disappointed. This is supposed to be his greatest play? I can't believe that - from this movie anyway. I was frequently bored, irritated with Hamlet's sometimes cryptic behaviour, and felt it was too long. First time I've ever been bored by a Shakespeare play or felt it was too long! I was frankly astonished. But I can see Shakespeare's genius is there so I presume the problem is what's left out has damaged what's left.Shakespeare's plays are never just one plot theme. There are subplots and variety. Before now he has never disappointed me in any way. Hamlet is so long and an enormous amount of it must have been deleted to make this version. The result is certainly focused, so far as I can tell from not knowing what's missing, on the various murders past and to come and Hamlet's bizarre behaviour and dithering etc. I discovered he was furious with his mother but it's not clear to me whether his mother married the new king willingly, or was coerced, or it was purely political or a sensible move for her protection. Instead of flying off the handle, Hamlet needs to discover her motives and whether she could have refused the marriage. Presumably the complete play fills in these details but this version doesn't that I can see. So I was frequently mystified by Hamlet's bad temper with his mother and worse, with his girl friend whom he treated so disgracefully I was simply furious. Am I meant to feel any kind of sympathy for this guy when he insults a young and seemingly innocent, indeed quite naive (if the acting was portraying the text properly) young woman persistently in lewd language that although it seems normal in those days, clearly was blaming her for faults she didn't possess. One must assume Hamlet was an ignorant, ill-bred and rather stupid youth who saw women as sex objects, no more!I think the best part is undoubtedly the ghost's appearance and Hamlet's reactions. The Yorick scene disappointed me a bit. After seeing David Bowie's classic and superb Hamlet song in his amazing Serious Moonlight Concert, I really did expect something better from the play. Was that part cut too? This version drags in the middle - I was simply fed up with Hamlet ranting about insulting people and killing his girlfriend's father. Doubtless I'm meant to be angry with him for dithering about but I needed some more of the text to show me this is not a boring play.I suppose I'll have to read the play. I don't much want to watch the Branagh version - I've been disappointed in all his Shakespeare movies and him in them with the possible exception of Benedick which suits him so I can't believe his Hamlet will impress me, so I'd rather avoid it. I loathe Mel Gibson and won't ever again watch him in anything after the one time I quickly regretted as he pranced about being heroically pathetic and wallowing in being tortured - urk. Torture happens. Wallowing in depicting it is sick.There are actors who've done Hamlet that I'd like a lot to see but they aren't on film that I know of. I'll be watching the BBC version in due course - I missed it first time around on TV.All that said, I think Olivier looked the part and what he had of text to act he acts well. He's too old though. Surely Hamlet is meant to be a very young man who hasn't yet found the strength to know how to carry through revenge, who hasn't learned how to talk to or respect women nor to understand they are constrained by being chattels of men in those days (clearly Shakespeare in this play is indicating how women suffer and Hamlet's a bigoted fool). This version needed to keep up the tension but too often nothing much happens and ranting and raving can be a real turn off. Where were Rosencrantz and Gildenstein? Not that I know yet what they do in the play but surely it would help to have them and some others to galvanise this movie.

I don't much want to watch the Branagh version - I've been disappointed in all his Shakespeare movies and him in them with the possible exception of Benedick which suits him so I can't believe his Hamlet will impress me, so I'd rather avoid it. I loathe Mel Gibson and won't ever again watch him in anything after the one time I quickly regretted as he pranced about being heroically pathetic and wallowing in being tortured - urk. Torture happens. Wallowing in depicting it is sick.There are actors who've done Hamlet that I'd like a lot to see but they aren't on film that I know of. I'll be watching the BBC version in due course - I missed it first time around on TV.All that said, I think Olivier looked the part and what he had of text to act he acts well. He's too old though. Surely Hamlet is meant to be a very young man who hasn't yet found the strength to know how to carry through revenge, who hasn't learned how to talk to or respect women nor to understand they are constrained by being chattels of men in those days (clearly Shakespeare in this play is indicating how women suffer and Hamlet's a bigoted fool). This version needed to keep up the tension but too often nothing much happens and ranting and raving can be a real turn off. Where were Rosencrantz and Gildenstein? Not that I know yet what they do in the play but surely it would help to have them and some others to galvanise this movie.

Yojimbo is about good vs. evil... no no no.See, no matter how I try to describe Yojimbo, the one-line cannot begin to summarize the film. Here, let me try this Yojimbo begins with Sanjuro the Samurai, travelling all by his lonesome, looking to a short wooden stick for a sense of direction. Following the stick's advice, he falls almost directly into a village-wide feud between two rival 'families'. Both families want their counterpart dead; consequently, both families want their hands on the newly arrived Sanjuro. For each of them, he symbolizes definite victory. Sanjuro sees this as an opportunity; not an opportunity to kill, but to make a lot of money. The two families begin to auction for him, and he, of course, plays hard to get. In one of the film's funniest scenes, we watch as the two families meet in the center of town; instead of charging at one another, though, they creep towards the rival army, jabbing, threatening, both far too cowardly to actually attack. Sanjuro sees this too.. he knows at that point that he has them in the palm of his hand.Ah. Even now, after those two paragraphs, I haven't even reached the point of double-triple-quadruple crosses, violence, mercy, action and inaction, captivity, torture, sex, pride -- and lack thereof -- or even retribution. I kid you not, this film has all of them, and more. It is, in it's own beautiful way, a comedy, just as Mifune is, in his own unprecedented way, a comic actor. His performance, full of mischief, mock modesty, and method, is unmatched, even in the most prevailing days of characters like Jack Sparrow.I heard one man call this film a classic samurai action pic, but that is, in the worse way, a terrible generalization. A synonym for 'classic' is 'archetypal', and this film certainly has no archetypes. To say 'samurai action pic' is to give the idea that it is based around heart-pounding sword fights, which it certain is not; that label ignores the film's politics, dark humor, and anti-heroism. I have never seen a movie, and probably never will, quite like Yojimbo, and that includes the Clint Eastwood remake. If you don't like subtitles, or black-and-white cinematography, or physical gags, or scenes that take their time, this is certainly not the film for you. But for me, it was a wonderful 110 minutes well-spent. I feel as if I am rambling now, and perhaps I am.

They are oppressed. They are not to leave the house (in certain countries) without someone with them. They are to keep themselves covered in public. They will get stoned to death if they cheat on their husbands. Yet many husbands have more than 1 wife or lover. But that's FAIR!! RIGHT? These are the facts, you cannot deny them.

Put an anti-Semite message in a film and you are guaranteed two things 1 - great reviews by Liberal critics; 2 - awards will come your way. Make a film about anti-Christian bias and you won't find anyone who will even put up a dime to help finance the film. Ask Robert Duvall or Mel Gibson or anyone else who has tried. As long as the subject matter is politically correct, man, you can't lose! The fact of intolerance toward any group or religion is wrong hasn't hit the film world yet. Even back in '47. It's only gotten worse.I say all of this because this film simply isn't that good. It didn't deserve the award. You have to be completely naive to think it won on its merit. I guess it's okay to be preachy if your content comes from the Left. If it comes from the Right, it's called heavy-handed but in this film it's called thought--provoking. This film is a wonderful example of the double standards that have dominated the Academy Awards for decades. One of the main characters is so bland and so forgettable I almost puked when I saw her performance in this film. It's one of my favorite women, too Dorothy McGuire. But, hey, I have to be honest, and she stunk in here. A good share of that, however, was the ridiculous character she was made to play. She minded of Olive Oyl's fickleness with Popeye and Bluto! What idiot wrote this screenplay?McGuire's role is notable because for most of the film, it is more about a romance than a cultural statement. A lot of this is simple melodrama between McGuire and fiancé Gregory Peck.....and it's boring and extremely dated. That includes several segments about Peck and his mom, which has nothing to do with anything here. I guess anyone who takes care of his mom will look even better in the eyes of the writers. Well, duh.It's also very appropriate one of the biggest left wing extremists of all time - John Garfield - was involved in this. No surprise there!It's a good message, but very poorly presented.

But is worth watching for that kiss.The story is a watered down version of a famous novel. Set in the American army just before the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour, it shows the harsh reality of the bombing (in a finale that is in sharp contrast to the easygoing flamboyance of the rest of the movie). It was one of the first films to show the harshness of military life, including bullying (though this was one of the many aspects watered down for the censors at the time). It has award-winning or famous performances from many stars that are still household names. A vast amount of talent was poured into it. Some subtleties (such as Deborah Kerr playing against her standard, pure-as-the-driven-snow roles) will be lost on modern audiences if they miss the contrasts. But who has not heard of the title?Two love stories form subplots to the main story, which is one of a harsh and unfair commander (together with a brute also in charge of the stockade) and an unfairly victimised young bugler. There is a passionate and illicit love affair between a First Sergeant and the Commander's wife. Then there is an equally furtive liaison between the young bugler (in between beatings) and a 'hostess'. Using Hawaii as a backdrop, there is great contrast between the idyllic setting on one hand, and the vicious treatment of junior soldiers (not to mention the horrific bombing scenes) on the other. And some nice bugle playing.The merits of the film could be eulogised at greater length, but in the interests of balance and to reflect the concerns of modern audiences, two other aspects might be mentioned. At least they were things that stuck out quite horribly to me, so I am going to mention them.The first is the overwhelming portrait of drunkenness and brawling (according to reports, the first was common among some of the stars, not just the characters). There are many justifications, including the sufferings they were going through and the general tolerance of alcohol in American society. But what I found disconcerting (and still find disconcerting in many modern films featuring American soldiers, both fiction and documentary) is the toleration. If viewed through the lens of a society that doesn't embrace drunkenness (for instance Brasil, which is about the same size as America), it portrays a simplistic picture of American G.I.s as drunken louts. The datedness of the scenarios, although probably effective at the time, makes such obnoxious behaviour stand out all the more.The second thing that made me feel uncomfortable (though not to the same extent as the thoroughly awful modern film, Pearl Harbour) is the pervasive jingoism. America, it seems, can confront its own weakness in films about Vietnam (when the war was so obviously lost), but in 1953, as now, America was 'all perfect' and Japan was 'all evil'. It would be refreshing to see a film that embraced not only the inhumanity of Japanese attacking forces but acknowledged some of the background - the Washington-imposed oil-blockade of Japan that gave that small nation state the bleak choice of capitulation or war.From Here to Eternity is a great film.

CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, like the previous films, successfully thrills their audiences with exciting sequences that, also, manages to stay plausible and never too unbelievably silly. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER may not have succeeded to become a total thrill-ride, but in the end it delivers its political message well. It's a slightly long, but thrilling and exciting Clancy adaptation. Once again, Ford returns as Jack Ryan, who is appointed acting CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence, when CIA Deputy James Greer (James Earl Jones) is ill with cancer. His first mission To investigate the death of one of the President's closest friends, who has connections with drug cartels. Ryan, once again, fights for what he believes is the truth, unknown to him that the National Security Adviser (Harris Yulin) has already dispatched mercenary elite troops, led by field operator John Clark (Willem Dafoe), on a covert operation in Columbia. But even if you don't get involved with the story or haven't read any of Tom Clancy's bestselling techno-thrillers (like myself), you must admit how exciting, edgy and believable this film is. Once more, it's also well-written on the screen and don't get wasted. When the film doesn't stun you with its action sequences devised by director Phillip Noyce and his crew of cinematographers and stunt directors, it involves you in the political situations made real and plausible by the adapted script by Donald Stewart, John Millius and Steven Zallian. Honestly, the sequences that involves Ryan arguing with the President of the United States are just as good to watch as the films more exciting sequences (The memorable ambush sequence and the RAMBO-esquire finale are the first to come to mind).Even if the film isn't exactly the total keeps you on the edge of your seat action thriller, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER delivers its political message as well as thrilling excitement all in the same show.
