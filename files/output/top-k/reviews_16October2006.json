I was completely moved and left breathless after I saw this movie when it first hit theaters. Tom Cruise gives his best performance and Philip Seymour Hoffman brings subtlety and honesty to a character that would have been headed for cheese ville if put in the hands of a lesser actor. I don't want to give anything away, just see it! See it like there is no tomorrow. Kevin Smith can make fun of this movie all he wants to, but let's be honest, Jersey Girl can suck my b---s.
