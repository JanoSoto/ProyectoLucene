[{"date":"20 February 2012","score":"","review":" BASEketball is a great, hilarious movie. It's a Great to watch with your friends for a decent laugh. You shouldn't go into it with High expectations. Some of the jokes I do feel where pointless and had no reason to be in the movie. But Trey Parker and Matt Stone (Creators of South Park) do a good job of moving the story along smoothly and in the end bring you a decent story. It is a little vulgar and the language is mild. I guess you have to be in the right mood to appreciate some of the jokes that they throw at you. A mood where you can just accept anything and just laugh at it.
