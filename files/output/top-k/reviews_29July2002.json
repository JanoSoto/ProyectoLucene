I think he is a comedic genius, and he is truly one of my favorite comedians.  I have been extremely pleased with most all the characters he has portrayed in films, including all of the goofs in the Austin Powers series (Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard).  Much like Eddie Murphy creating completely different and unique characters in Coming to America (which you can barely tell are all him), Mike has the same talent in that regard.Because I liked `AP Int'l Man of Mystery' and `AP The Spy Who Shagged Me' so much, I was looking forward with great anticipation to this, the third installment; `AP in Goldmember', and was curious to see what this new incarnation of Myers, Goldmember, would be like.Sadly, I was quite disappointed.The beginning sequence of the film is very funny, I will give you that. The cameos were unexpected, and were carefully chosen, which made the whole idea that much funnier.  There were a few industry jokes that I thought were funny, but people from Iowa probably wouldn't have understood them (kind of a benefit of living in the entertainment capital of the world, I guess). And there were definitely moments that made me laugh out loud.  There's no doubt that Austin still cracks me up, sometimes even without saying a word.However, that said, I was disappointed with the fact that SO much of this film was rehashed and put back together to represent new comedy.  Many of the same old gags were used, but tweaked slightly, perhaps in an attempt to not seem quite so unoriginal <TINY JOKE SPOILERS AHEAD> (i.e. the whole `Johnson' gag, the ramblings between Dr. Evil and Scott, etc.) Goldmember as a character was really nothing fabulous; he didn't seem to have the distinct idiosyncrasies that would make him stand out, like Myers's other characters.  His attempted Dutch accent didn't seem that convincing (although the clog-style roller skates were amusing), and his skin-eating tendencies just flat out grossed me out (much like several other aspects of this film, but I should have expected that). Caine's character was dull, and it was a little bizarre to see Fred Savage all grown up (those mole jokes really got old quickly).  I would have liked to have seen Beyonce Knowles's character showcased more, as she seemed to breathe a good portion of what newness this film had into it.  I did kind of miss Mustafa, and had been expecting to see him show up, just to get killed again, a-la Kenny from South Park, but no such luck.  There were so many other predictable jokes and scenarios (I saw the `Mr. Roboto' joke comin' a mile away) in the film, I figured it would have fit right in.O.K., and maybe I'm just getting nitpicky, but I have to say it.  The shocking blue contact lenses on both Dr. Evil and Mini-Me were distracting as hell.  Did anyone else ever notice in The Spy Who Shagged Me, Dr. Evil's eyes went from blue to brown and back again?  Did they think we wouldn't notice?  At least they kept it consistent this time. and they decided to slap a pair on Vern as well so they'd be perfectly matched.  I can see why, but again, I found them to be extremely distracting and almost freakish to behold.  (BTW, Vern is much cuter as mini-Austin, IMO.)All in all, `Austin Powers in Goldmember' was mildly entertaining, despite the recycled gags and ultra gross visual humor it churned out.  For me, it left something to be desired, but for the third movie in a series, it held its own, and will undoubtedly continue to rake in the profits based on the name alone.  When it's all said and done, I may have left the theater feeling disappointed, and muttering to my friend, `That was really lame,' but sheepishly, I admit, if a 4th one comes out, I'm sure I'll go see it.

It has a couple of small problems. Gary Cooper is wrong for Robert Jordan, the American fighting with the resistance during the Spanish Civil War. The character wasn't all that deep in the novel, but Cooper, well, he doesn't do much of anything. He's much more passionless than the original character, I think. I've liked Cooper in a couple of films, but have found him weak in a couple others. The other thing I really don't like is the final scene. The novel's final moments were amazing, but Cooper's voiceover is almost laughable. I admit that this scene must have been very difficult to write for a film. One of the biggest improvements that the film makes is the character of Maria. She was damn annoying in the novel, and I was kind of hoping that she wouldn't make it out alive. That's pretty strong, but, man, she deserved it in the novel. Ingrid Bergman plays Maria in the film, and she brings a large quantity of realism and humanity into a character in which there was none before. The best characters of the novel are completely intact, and are played by a host of unrecognizable character actors (apparently most were Russian). The only one I know (and I know him well) is the venerable character actor Akim Tamiroff, who delivers one of his best performances as Pablo, the morally ambiguous rebel leader. He was one of the best characters in the novel, and Tamiroff is perfect in the role. Greek actress Katina Paxinou delivers an Oscar-winning role as the best character of the novel, Pilar. Also standing out above the others are Vladimir Sokoloff as the gypsy and Joseph Calleia as El Sordo (on second look, since that name sounded familiar, I see he was in both Gilda and Touch of Evil, where he played one of the most important characters; I didn't recognize him here). I think the film might work better for those who've read the novel. A lot of the tragic momentum that is found outside of the dialogue in the novel cannot hope to be transferred to film.

He is most definitely one of the most distinguished and talented actors of our generation and a role model for all aspiring actors! Now, on with the review. I first saw this movie during a vacation to the beach with my friend and his family. I had seen several other Poitier efforts such as In the Heat of the Night and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,and I stumbled upon this thriller while watching television on one of the nights that it rained. I stopped at TBS and I'm certainly glad that I did! This movie is one of best Poitier movies I've ever viewed! This film incorporates comedy into a genre the usually takes itself a little too seriously. The movie has an overall seriousness about it, but there are a few cheeky moments between Poitier and Berenger. Some of these comedic moments include a scene where Berenger and Poitier are in an ice tunnel during a snow storm. Berenger is laying on top of Poitier to keep him from freezing to death. Poitier asks something like  What are you queer or something?! and Berenger says something like What's the matter? Haven't you ever heard about us mountain boys? Another funny moment comes when Poitier is trying to scale a wall even though he is exhausted. Berenger is at the top trying to convince him to go back. The look on Poitier's face is more than enough to inspire a chuckle.   The performances, the direction, and the cinematography are all well done in this film. The beautiful mountain landscapes inspire sort of a wistful feeling that can often be distracting. I'll also give a thumbs up to the sound effects department of this film. The sound of the rope snapping when Berenger was plummeting from the cable extending across the gorge was enough to make me wince with agony. This movie was executed well and my only complaint was that the villain's identity was revealed earlier than I thought it should have been. All in all I think it was a solid effort that I think anyone who is a fan of suspense films will enjoy. Your best bet as far as renting this movie is to go to a hole-in-the-wall movie rental store that never throws any movie away because, as other reviews have said, it is very hard to find. You may get lucky once in a blue moon and catch it on TBS or TNT, but the edited for TV versions are never as good as the uncut versions. If none of the mom and pop movie rental outlets still carry it, go to blockbuster and demand that they order this movie for you! This movie is a definite must-see for any fan of the suspense genre!

We don't have the same originality that the first one brought or the usually funny jokes. Now while the ideas were good and it seemed strong, it just didn't give.The beginning is classic and it seemed like this was going to be great. I mean, we have Tom Cruise playing Austin Powers, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, John Travolta as Goldmember, and Danny Devito as Mini Me in the Austin Powers movie! Just great and brilliant. But then the actual movie starts, Felicity is not here for no explained reason and Austin is single. Leading him to Foxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyonce and is way too stereotypical. Fat Bastard is also back and tries too hard with his disgusting jokes that fall flat.Dr. Evil is still pretty funny, but again just loosing his touch. We have a brilliant idea of Michael Caine as Austin's dad, but it's a hit and miss with Caine's dull performance. Goldmember, also played by Myers, is just too disgusting and tries too hard to impress the audience as another funny villain.

From the opening (which was clever), to the unveiling of the secret at the end, this movie brings down the house with its unique brand of comedy.  The audience was laughing throughout!!! (I almost squirted my soda out of my nose at the Preperation H joke!)Mike Myers takes on quadruple duty in this one, playing Austin, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, and Fat Bastard (whose presence in this movie wasn't THAT important).  To my knowledge, only Eddie Murphy has played more roles in a comedy portraying the entire Klump family.  Anyway, Myers is AMAZING to say the least.  He does a fantastic job playing the good guys, the bad guys, and even the fat guys.Beyonce Knowls did an Ok job as Foxy Cleopatra, but her chareacter didn't get as much screen time as I thought she would.  Oh well, she still had her moments.Verne Troyer returns as Mini-me in this film, and Mini-me is still well... Mini-me.  Intresting to note that Troyer does all of his own stunts.  I would never do half the things he did in this movie, and I'm 6'1!!!Of course, all of the other henchmen for Dr. Evil returns as well. Unfortunatly for Robert Wagner (Number 2) and Mindy Sterling (Frau Farbissina) they get less exposure than in previous installments. (I think that would be a good thing for Sterling.  All that yelling...)Seth Green also returns as Scott Evil.  I like Scott because he says what's on my mind whenever I hear a bad Dr. Evil joke. (Remember Operation Wang Chung from the second movie?  Classic).As for celebrities, watch for cameos from Brittney Spears, Quincy Jones, Tom Cruise, Danny Devito, Steven Speilburg, John Travolta, and the Osbournes among others.  Man, last time I saw so many stars, I was looking through a telescope!!!Also funny in this movie is the recuring jokes, one of which is in this review.  All in all, Goldmember is the best Austin Powers movie yet.  I'm only imagining what they will do for the sequel (although with all the sudden twists in the movie, it will be hard to figure out what the heck they will do next).Oh and one more thing, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO FELICITY SHAGWELL?!?!?!

Jackie Brown is an absolutely stellar film for five main reasons, the first of which is the casting for the film. The stars assembled for this movie are the some of the most unlikely collection of names, with many of them playing roles that differ greatly from most of the roles they have played in the past. This movie proved that Pam Grier still has what it takes as a successful actress, and Samuel L. Jackson was an outstanding foil for her character. Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, and Bridget Fonda are very strong secondary roles, but the most suprisingly uncharacteristic role is that of Robert De Niro, who's character is almost nothing like any of the previous characters he has played in his illustrious career. It was certainly a huge departure for him, and he played it very well. Secondly, this movie has very good cinematography, which is something Tarantino has made a habit of maintaining in all of his feature films. The angle preferences give the movie a very good edge and serve to help the storyline well. Third, this movie has unexpected twists, similar to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs in the sense that you don't see them coming, but when they happen, you see exactly why they happen and how they work. None of Tarantino's movies are predictable and they often push the envelope in terms of what you expect to see, and that's an edge that he will always have in his career. Fourth, the plot is intelligently simple, yet deceptively complicated. On the surface, the story is all about money, drugs, and guns, and what makes it complicated is the twisted nature of the consequences that come from each of the characters' involvement. Some of the characters in this movie never even meet each other, yet what they do and whatever actions they take directly affect the actions of the others, another trait that exists in Tarantino's previous films. Finally, the soundtrack is outstanding. The use of classic soul songs like Bobby Womack's Across 110th Street, Natural High by Bloodstone, and Street Life, by The Crusaders featuring Randy Crawford really serve to give this movie an identity that is distinctly different from Tarantino's other pictures. This movie has great emotion and a unique level of suspense as a result of the music, without the use of dramatic scores and orchestrations, which really is a trait that Tarantino uses in all of his movies to give them their own identities. The bottom line is that Quentin Tarantino is a master of film directorial prowess, and Jackie Brown is simply another masterpiece to add to his collection.

Aliens come to earth, threaten to destroy it, yada yada yada, MIB has to figure out what's going on before the earth is destroyed, yada yada yada, big guns, alien explodes at the end, just in the nick of time, after being hit by the big guns. Which of the movies am I describing? Both of them. Far from being fresh, this sequel is exactly the same as the original.As for the humor... there was humor? Simply put, this movie had its moments. Unfortunately, they were few and far between, and, in any case, significantly less interesting than the continual clashing of personalities in the first movie. This was due to the simple fact that in MIB II, Agents Jay and Kay acted identically.As for the plot, throughout the film, the characters were supposed to be hunting down clues to the location of the light. Instead of getting the feeling that I was watching the characters unlock a mystery, I get the feeling that I'm watching a bratty teenager and his crotchety uncle following a scavenger hunt to... who cares. The film never conveys a sense of importance to the audience about what they are looking for, or why this thing is so important. Not only that, but this wafer thin plot is crumpled into an 88 minute timeframe, leaving, well, a mess.Maybe the problem is that everybody involved was so determined to make a good movie, that every idea from the past five years ended up getting forced into one movie. Or, everybody involved in the movie was so determined to get a big fat payday, that they didn't care about how crappy their movie turned out. There. That one sounds more reasonable.I gave this movie a 3 out of 10. Not the worst movie ever, but definitely not worth my time.

Take an overly talented cast (John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi) and make a movie as bad as possible. I do not blame anyone for this movie. Not the writers, not the director, not even Nicholas Cage. Somehow, this movie managed to suck and I don't know how. Outside of Magnolia and Cradle Will Rock, this is one of the most talented ensembles I've ever seen. Take almost anyone of these men (or even Nick Cage in some movies) and you've got a Being John Malcovich or High Fidelity or Pulp Fiction or Ghost World worthy performance. Put them together, and you get Con Air. Not that there aren't funny moments. Steve Buscemi is especially hilarious as a Hannibal Lecter-esque sociopath. But the battle scenes and climactic chase scene all seem rather forced. Mind you, I didn't watch this expecting Citizen Kane. I watched this expecting cheese along the lines of Plan 9 or Chopping Mall. What I get instead are lazy performances from a talented cast who needed a paycheck. As for Nicholas Cage (I had to get to it sooner or later), his character has NO FLAWS. He should have a freaking halo around his head the entire time. Even during a fight scene he is NEVER to blame for anything. If his long-haired hick of a character had any flaws he might be interesting. But, as the previews showed, even when he's in a life-or-death situation, he's more worried about his daughter's stuffed rabbit then anything else. I give it a four just because I can't completely hate a movie with the combined forces of Malkovich, Cusack, Buscemi, and Rhames. Heck, it even had Dave Chapelle being not funny, which is really hard to imagine for anyone who's seen his stand-up special, Killing Them Softly.

I feared I would hyperventilate from laughter during the first 15 minutes of the film, which I won't spoil for you here but was well worth the price of admission on its own!  Here's the setupAustin must rescue his kidnapped absentee father played by the perfectly cast Michael Caine from the clutches of Dr. Evil, who has recruited across time a 70s mastermind criminal by the name of Goldmember to assist him in achieving world domination.  Fans of the Bond movies will recognize this obvious salute to Ian Fleming's infamous and dangerous Goldfinger. However, Myers' auric mastermind received his moniker after an unfortunate smelting accident.  I'll just let your imagination complete this picture for you...The ever-talented Mike Myers adds Goldmember to his line-up of characters in this newest Austin Powers feature.  Laden with freckles and spouting unintelligible English with a Dutch accent, he plots to take over the world alongside Dr. Evil.  Along with this villainous duo and Austin himself, we are treated to a reprise of Myers' hideously revolting Fat Bastard.Also reprising their roles, are our favorite characters Mini-Me, Number Two, Scott Evil, and Frau Farbissina.  There are many wonderful surprises and plot twists that I will not spoil for you here, but you are truly in for a treat!Austin's love interest this time around, is a Pam Grier tongue-in-cheek knockoff by the name of Foxxy Cleopatra and played with surprising spunk by Destiny Child's Beyoncé Knowles.  Looking like she just stepped off a runway modeling 70s chic couture, Ms. Knowles kicks ass along side Austin as she travels back into the future with him by way of a tricked out fur-lined and very purple pimpmobile.There are cameos galore that I also don't want to spoil for you here.  This film is a laugh riot with plenty of gags and twists to keep you interested in the storyline.  If you are a fan of the other Powers flicks, then you will most certainly be pleased by this latest addition.

So let me guess, it raises questions about self and ego while hilariously lampooning the egos of stars and obsession with immortality.No, not really. It's a laboured effort that tries too desperately hard to be weird, and exists only to give critics and armchair philosophers an excuse to feel smug about themselves or laugh at the film industry in-jokes. If you want existentialism, stick to Ingmar Bergman or even David Cronenberg.But wait, it has moments. Charlie Sheen playing himself is actually quite funny. The cast generally are good, but unlikable, which means you don't care what happens to them or the story. Don't let it kid you. There's no intellectualism and no satire here.

Good to see them grown up and hear what it was like as they look back.

Chalk full of puns and reliably funny spoofs of classic films, Austin Powers in Goldmember, whose title is already a spoof off of the James Bond classic Goldfinger, will bring out the best of laughs in a night of movie going.  Although some critics towted Goldmember's jokes as overdone and the new character's unnecessary, apart from some choppy bridges in the script which seem to be there to move the script in some direction, the jokes seemed genuine and effortless. A lot of what was found hysterical and whitty in the first Austin Powers and in its sequel were matched and fleshed out even further in the latest. Verne Troyer as mini-me and Seth Green as Dr. Evil's son, Scott Evil, were explored more deeply and as a result the father-son bond which has been explored this summer was brought out here as well. New characters Floxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyonce Knowles, was a great addition, as she easily wins as Austin's most supportive female counterpart (shying away from the ditsy Barbie doll image scultped by Felicity Shagwell in The Spy Who Shagged Me).  Michael Caine as Niegl Powers is as enjoyable as it can be to see Caine as a swingin' superficial father, and Austin as his new character Goldmember is cheeky but more enjoyable to watch than Fat Bastard. Overall Mike Myer's latest sequel to Austin Powers is as enjoyable as one could expect.  Although this movie appears to have more of its script centered on making spoofs of classic dramas and films to bring it some depth, the swingin' attitude and laughs are still enough to make this a film to see in the theater.
