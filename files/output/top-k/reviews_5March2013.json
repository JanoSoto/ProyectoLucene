It combines live action and animation in a blend that made it match up to the fit of Disney's Mary Poppins which till date is Disney's most Oscar nominated film and it went home with 5 wins. Like Mary Poppins live action and animation combination that came out grand, so did this, although unlike Mary Poppins, where the animation and the characters hardly interact, in this movie they seem to be always around each other.This interaction was so well done that you have to give kudos to the animators and animation directors.The movie plot is about a cartoon star Roger Rabbit whose wife was caught on camera by a P.I. Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) playing pattycake with another man. That man soon ends up dead and Roger is being accused for the murder. Now Roger has no hope but to run to the toon hating P.I. Eddie who took the pictures in the first place, now both are stuck together as they try to figure out why someone will be trying to frame Roger Rabbit.The screenplay is written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (who also worked together on Dr' Seuss screenplay adaptation of How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)) and is based on Gary K. Wolf's 1981 novel named Who Censored Roger Rabbit? Both book and movie depict a world in which cartoon characters interact directly with human beings.Who Framed Roger Rabbit won 4 Oscars and it was a critical acclaim, many enjoyed the comic and the fun story the movie carries and at the time of its production it was one of the most expensive animations ever made. Its production cost was 70 million dollars and it was a box office success making over 320 million in its time of release.In conclusion, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a classic animation from the 80s that all should get the chance to see even if it is just once. Talks are going about that Disney is in talks with Amblin (Steven Spielberg) and even director Robert Zemeckis to make a sequel to this fine film, although Bob Hoskins has retired from acting, I feel that the writers can still come up with something we all want to see.www.lagsreviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"5 March 2013","score":"","review":" Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a wonderful fantasy comedy directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future (1985), Mars Needs Moms (2011), Real Steel (2011) and Flight (2012))and done by Spielberg's Amblin Studios and Disney's Touchstone pictures.

X-Men finally hits the big screen and to be honest, I was doubtful that this film would do it's justice, I was wrong! This film is actually quite decent to watch! I'm a huge fan of Marvel Comics so I'll try to go into as much detail as I can! When a movie is based on a comic book, you know that it's going to be unrealistic and unappealing to the general audience, However, this film tries it's best to stay faithful to the original X-Men comic book series and tires it's best to create a source of entertainment to the general audience and it succeed. However, not only will comic book fans (such as myself) will enjoy this film, the general audience will also enjoy this piece of entertainment. Instead of having Angel, Beast and Iceman, The team in this case is Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops and Marvel Girl (Jean Grey). The plot is about Marie\/Rogue running away after what happened to her boyfriend. It turns out she has the mutant ability to drain someone's life force for a period of time (that is if she comes in physical contact with someone. She also uses other's abilities whenever she touches another mutant.) She then meets Wolverine and are later attacked by Sabretooth, they are saved by Cyclops and Storm. They take them to the X mansion that is run by Charles Xavier, he leads a group of mutants who are trying to seek peace with the humans, educate the young mutants and stop Magneto from starting war with humanity. It turns out Magneto tested out a machine on a prisoner they captured passing out a mutant registration act. The machine he uses artificially induces mutation and he plans on using it to turn the entire world into mutants, but they need Rogue who is a stronger power source for the machine to work properly. Rogue gets fooled to believing it was her fault after an accident with her and Wolverine and runs away. Magneto's fellow mutant Mystique, Toad and Sabretooth captures Rogue. Now it is up to Wolverine and the rest of the X-Men to not only save Rogue and destroy Magneto's mutant machine, but to save the world in the process. That is the best story line for an X-Men film if you ask me. Very complex is true to the original source material in most cases. The cast was also superb. Not only did the cast look like the characters from the X-Men comics, but they were just spot on in their roles! Examples being Hugh Jackman as a intimidating and strong-willed Wolverine and Patrick Stewart being the wise character that everyone enjoys! Also, the special effects were spellbinding and hold your attention throughout the entire movie especially back in the year 2000. Granted, Spider-Man was made in 2002 but the effects in that film were not the best if I'm honest. This film on the other hand just masters it and they don't look cheap. Take Mystique transforming for example. However, the were flaws with this film like the costumes were not designed like in the comic books but I can probably understand why to add reality. Moreover, to me Marie\/Rogue was like the damsel in distress in this movie and she was actually a kick ass character in the X-Men comic book series, I really don't know why they decided to go for this route, maybe it's to show that Rogue can be an innocent character. But even so, I wish she can avoid being the damsel in distress because she's actually my favourite female mutant in the X-Men.Also, I don't know if I'm the only one who realizes this but to me, Wolverine seems to be the main focus of the film. In the original X-Men comic book series, Wolverine didn't join the X-Men until Giant-Sized X- Men #1 was published in 1975 and even in that comic Wolverine wasn't really the main focus, he was just another mutant kind who joined this team. I don't know why they decided to make Wolverine the main focus of this picture but considering that most people like the X-Men just because Wolverine join the team, they decided to make him the big hit.

His lines weren't the best in my opinion, but I did still find the character to be a threat to Batman. With that said however, there are times where your patience with this character draws really thin. Uma Thurman was a fairly good choice for Poison Ivy, though I thought the character was rather boring and that she was not needed in the picture. Then I get to Bane, or lack there of. In this movie, other than his strength and threatening appearance, he was by far the most useless. All he did was say his own name and make various idiotic sounds. What it comes down to is that this movie had way too many characters in it and it becomes unbalanced and a complete mess.

RATING 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Fantasy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"5 March 2013","score":"","review":" After The Nightmare Before Christmas, both Henry Selick and Tim Burton began work on another stop motion animated film, a film based on an acclaimed children's novel by British author Roald Dahl. James and The Giant Peach brings in a lot of the same elements as Nightmare, but also brings in many trademarks of it's own. This film brews live action scenes into the pot and is overall more brightly colored and sunny than Nightmare, whose scenes were mostly dark and night like. In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach is one of those films that constantly gets overlooked. While Nightmate gets a lot of recognition and fanatics, this film has a small cult following and when it comes to ranking the world's best stop motion classics, this one usually ranks low on the list or doesn't rank at all. It's a pity, because I think this is one of Selick and Burton's best accomplishments. As Roald Dahl hated the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from 1971, I think he would have been quite proud of this picture, for it's one of those films that truly represents the mood, the look, and the imagination of the original novel. This film has some of Hollywood's finest either playing live action characters or stop motion characters. We have Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley playing James' dreadful aunts, who are just as hilarious and silly looking as they are intimidating. Lumley's Aunt Spiker character can't go one scene without having her mouth hang wide open or giving off a evil smile, revealing her crooked, filthy teeth. Then there is Pete Postlewaite as the Magic Man who gives James a bag of crocodile tongues. He can have his creepy moments as well, but he overall plays the character as a mysterious figure. He's like the tinkerer from Willy Wonka. You just want to know more about him, but you can't because he's gone before you can wink. Playing James is Paul Terry, who's not known that much nowadays, but has appeared on CBBC's Microsoap series. He's a triumphant young man and his little singing number towards the beginning of the film really highlights his hopes and ambitions and desire to leave his nasty aunts.Playing the stop motion characters are a wide array of actors, actors like Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, even David Thewlis of Harry Potter fame. I think my favorite has got to be Dreyfuss' Centipede character, for he plays him as a slick, snarky, defiant Han Solo like character...with a cigar of course. My favorite scene out of the entire film is the scene depicting James and Centipede's adventure on a pirate ship under the sea. Many Nightmare Before Christmas fans know that this is the scene where the Jack Skellington puppet makes a cameo as the ship's deceased captain, and I think Selick and Burton did a fantastic job making him still retain his trademarks, but also look very different than the way him did in Nightmare.If I had to some up this film in one word, it's look. This film has a look unlike any other film. I said The Nightmare Before Christmas was like a mix between Rankin Bass' Rudolph and the works of Edward Gory, but I think this film combines the looks of Dr. Seuss with Nancy Ekholm Burkert, who illustrated Dahl's original book. Like in Nightmare, many things are rugged, crooked and crude, even the gleaming, sky scraping buildings of New York City. I also think the peach has quite an appeal to it. In several scenes, I just want to reach my hand into the screen and take a huge bite out of it. There is even a song about eating the peach present in the film, and Randy Newman must be praised for his excellent songwriting. James and the Giant Peach is a film that deserves a little more than what it gets. Sure, it's not my all time favorite, but I still hold it very close and love it, love it, love it, love it to pieces. If you want a film that combines stylized live action with fantastic stop motion sequences and odd, yet thrilling wizardry, this is your pot of tea. ","genre":null},{"date":"5 March 2013","score":"","review":" After The Nightmare Before Christmas, both Henry Selick and Tim Burton began work on another stop motion animated film, a film based on an acclaimed children's novel by British author Roald Dahl. James and The Giant Peach brings in a lot of the same elements as Nightmare, but also brings in many trademarks of it's own. This film brews live action scenes into the pot and is overall more brightly colored and sunny than Nightmare, whose scenes were mostly dark and night like. In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach is one of those films that constantly gets overlooked. While Nightmate gets a lot of recognition and fanatics, this film has a small cult following and when it comes to ranking the world's best stop motion classics, this one usually ranks low on the list or doesn't rank at all. It's a pity, because I think this is one of Selick and Burton's best accomplishments. As Roald Dahl hated the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from 1971, I think he would have been quite proud of this picture, for it's one of those films that truly represents the mood, the look, and the imagination of the original novel. This film has some of Hollywood's finest either playing live action characters or stop motion characters. We have Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley playing James' dreadful aunts, who are just as hilarious and silly looking as they are intimidating. Lumley's Aunt Spiker character can't go one scene without having her mouth hang wide open or giving off a evil smile, revealing her crooked, filthy teeth. Then there is Pete Postlewaite as the Magic Man who gives James a bag of crocodile tongues. He can have his creepy moments as well, but he overall plays the character as a mysterious figure. He's like the tinkerer from Willy Wonka. You just want to know more about him, but you can't because he's gone before you can wink. Playing James is Paul Terry, who's not known that much nowadays, but has appeared on CBBC's Microsoap series. He's a triumphant young man and his little singing number towards the beginning of the film really highlights his hopes and ambitions and desire to leave his nasty aunts.Playing the stop motion characters are a wide array of actors, actors like Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, even David Thewlis of Harry Potter fame. I think my favorite has got to be Dreyfuss' Centipede character, for he plays him as a slick, snarky, defiant Han Solo like character...with a cigar of course. My favorite scene out of the entire film is the scene depicting James and Centipede's adventure on a pirate ship under the sea.

This film gives the viewer just as large of a role in the film as it does with the characters. I can't think of many films that do that, so this film is truly one of a kind. If you don't have an imagination and like to have every detail of a film spoonfed to you, this film is not the one for you. This is a horror film that actually requires the viewer to think, and not all viewers like to do that, so that's one of the main reasons many seem to dislike it.This film doesn't need cheap gore, brutal death scenes, tasteless nudity, or even overly loud jump scares. It relies solely on suspense and atmosphere. Every moment of the film captures the viewer's interest and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what is going to happen next. The amount of tension this film builds is horrifying. There is a brooding atmosphere that permeates the entire film. The second you see the characters, you can sense that something bad is going to happen and you dread it.

To even further appreciate this masterpiece one must read Alan Le May's novel by the same name on which this movie is based. If you do, you will appreciate certain details which John Ford made sure to recreate on the screen, and most importantly you will get a better understanding of the time line. It is truly amazing how Ford managed to fit so many years into two hours without losing too much. John Ford use of scenery and character development was unsurpassed. It just has everything. The movie opens with a door framing shot on the Edwards homestead. The shot shows the loneliness and isolation of Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returning home from the civil war. Over dinner, we learn that he'd always been a loner since his brother was married to the woman he loved, and the cause he fought for in the Civil War lost, but he refused to surrender. While out on patrol, the Edwards homestead was attack by Native Americans. The scene with Ethan Edward coming home to see the death and the burn ruins of the home is sheer brilliance and was the last straw he had with the Comanche tribe. He notice that his niece Debbie was capture by them, and force to be a wife to its leader, Scar. He wasn't going to allow that. He goes to rescue the girl, spending years searching for her, his motivation becomes increasingly questionable and dark. John Wayne as Ethan Edwards was the subtle darkest character he ever played. He had a serious hated for Indians, which the book made clear and the movie less so. If you pay very close attention when Debbie (Natalie Wood) is hiding out by the Tombstone, you can just make out the writing. It shows why Ethan is borderline racist. A lot of people might point that that the movie might be a bit racist due to Ethan's hatred of anything Native American. This is not a racist movie. In fact, Ford examines the extremity of racism by the whites against the Native Americans during this period. In fact, there was a lot of interracial hatred in Texas and the West. Still, nearly all of the violence and hatred in the film is by the whites. The film questions the racist attitude they had at the time towards the American natives, epitomized by Wayne's character, but still Ford had attempted to justify mass murder for revenge in the film. Hence the dry run at the Academy Awards. John Ford's purpose in making The Searchers wasn't to make a statement about the horrible treatment and oppression of Native Americans. It was to tell a good story. The Searchers, is in fact one of the biggest complex, multi-layered films to come out of the Hollywood studio system. The photography and film subtext is legendary. The Searchers was filmed in VistaVision, and movies made in VistaVision look so much better today when restored than other forms of film-making at the time. Watch it on Blu-ray which has breathtaking cinematography of Monument Valley in its best. The setting in Monument Valley was made for westerns. The ending of The Searchers is great, without a doubt. Arguably one of the greatest scenes in the history of movies. Ford says everything without words. This scene is simply perfect show and tell. There are so many analysis of what happen to Ethan Edward in the final minutes that raise questions. When Duke John Wayne holds his arm, it was tribute to his hero, Harry Carey, who was a star of silent western films. Harry Carey often did what Duke did in the last scene of The Searchers. Still there are a bit of silly, such in the case in the letters being read by Vera Miles in the cabin on the large wooden bench. Those parts dragged a little. I thought the fight scene at the end was a little hokey. The editing isn't that great and some of the props were obviously 70 years ahead of their time. The movie didn't get the critical acclaim when it came out. It wasn't until the 1970s that The Searchers came to serious critical acclaim, too late for Ford but not Wayne.

At one point you think David is insane to go through all that trouble to find the person who abandoned him in the woods, but in the end you continue to root for him since he is following his desire and Monica was all he had known. In the end, David finds Monica and you couldn't be any happier. I have never in my life felt so triumphant, yet so depressed at the same time during a movie scene. My emotions were fluttering everywhere and I wounded up crying hysterically. David character development renounces that if one believes, then one is - and that is the theme to the movie. Such a great great film - I can go ages about this but in one exquisite word I'd say A.I derives in EXCELLENCE!

Jack then gets a second chance to be the father he should have been... MY THOUGHTS This movie is a very heartwarming film to watch with family and especially during the holiday season (which is when it takes place). Its very entertaining and an all around good flick. If you nitpick however, you find the film to have various plot holes and to have a very strange premise. With that said however, it is still a very good watch.PROS\/CONS There is a lot of comedy in this film and it does make you laugh.

In terms of genre descriptions, it is hard to pigeonhole MJY...like Disney's 'Dumbo' (1941) it is a bittersweet story of a persecuted and exploited performing animal...and like Disney's 'Song of the South' (1946) it successfully integrates animated images with footage of living performers. But I also think that the classic 1946 Cocteau version of 'Beauty and the Beast' is also an antecedent.There is a tendency among modern viewers to judge special effects from the basis of how closely they approximate the way actual film of impossible happenings would appear. Yet we do not commonly judge paintings and sculpture by a standard of photorealism. With BATB and MJY, the special effects should instead be judged by how they convey mood, personality, theme, and how they tell the story.Not only are the stop-motion-animation techniques in MJY a quantum leap from the 1933 classic King Kong, they exceed most of what Harryhausen would achieve in later projects. I make this extraordinary statement because although the Harryhausen's Technicolor mythological films are indeed spectacular, none of his later beasts conveys a personality as believable and sympathetic as that of Mighty Joe Young.In 'Citizen Kane,' RKO deconstructed the agonized materialistic persona of pre-war America. In 'Mighty Joe Young,' RKO breathed heart and soul into a puppet, reconstructing the shattered fragments of the post-war America into a form of innocence and empathy.Besides being an effective fairy tale, MJY is an incisive social satire, with the nightclub scenes being effectively a tableau of the seven deadly sins of man, with an emphasis on greed.Robert Armstrong has a couple goofy moments where comedy relief is attempted, and the sequence with him riding the mule keeps me from giving this film a '10,' but this is a small flaw, and 1949 audiences probably thought it was funny.Terri Moore has a strange face, but she is compelling and believable, and her earnestness makes us believe in Joe even more. I don't want to spoil the ending, but after seeing this film, I felt as though I, and every other viewer, had been given a very special Valentine.

This film would be a horror classic as well if it wasn't so misunderstood. This film mixes horror, science fiction, and fantasy all in one film. It is pervaded with a dreamlike atmosphere to the point in which it doesn't even feel as if you're watching a film when you see it. It feels as if you're right in the middle of a bizarre nightmare you can't wake up from, similar to Suspiria. The music contributes to this dreamlike atmosphere in a way I have never heard a score contribute to the atmosphere before. Ennio Morricone did a terrific job at composing the score. Listening to this score alone, you can see it's really no wonder he's considered a legendary composer. The camera-work also achieved the effect of contributing the dreamlike atmosphere.I believe the reason so many people dislike it is because it is so different in tone to the first film. People watch the film expecting it to be exactly the same as the first and it isn't whatsoever. It is a very unique film experience that feels nothing like the first film. While the first film was a straight horror\/drama grounded in reality for the most part, this film goes it's own route and is highly fantastical. If it was simply called The Heretic, I think people would like it a lot more. Because it's a sequel, people can't seem to get the first film out of their mind and constantly compare it.The film gives a reason for Regan's possession. It gives the idea that she had the gift of healing as the reason she was possessed. Satan wanted to destroy this gift because it was used for goodness, so he sent a demon to possess Regan. I believe that was a genius and creative idea. There is a touching scene in which Regan causes an autistic girl who is mute speak for the first time in front of her mother. It always gives me goosebumps no matter how many times I see the film. The story which is very well written cleverly links the past with the future. While it gives fresh ideas and builds on the story of Regan's life and the aftermath of her possession, it also delves further into the past by showing Father Merrin's prior experience with exorcism before he met Regan. It is also brilliantly acted. Linda Blair is terrific and it's good to see her play Regan yet again. It was also nice to see Kitty Winn for the second time. Louise Fletcher, James Earl Jones, Richard Burton, Paul Henreid, and Ned Beatty are also among the all star cast and give unforgettable performances.Overall, I think the amount of hatred this film receives is absolutely unfair. It deserves none of it. It is one of the most underrated, misunderstood films of all time. Sometimes I even enjoy it more than the first film.

Now, knowing that it was based on real life and real characters, i got to appreciate much more the effort put into making the movie. The intent to inject genuineness and real life characters and mannerisms(the accent and excessive use of the word yeah) was now so clear in my head although i have to admit got annoyed at more than one point while watching the film.

With the help of the greatest writer in the English language ever, William Shakespeare, Gus Van Sant draws two great characterizations in the characters realized by River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves.You couldn't find two more opposite types in the world. River is a street kid through and through. Even the circumstances of his birth are a tragedy that I won't reveal. His mother leaves him as a youngster and he can't get over it and go on. He was raised by an older brother in the sparsely populated 'potato state' as he calls Idaho and the and the family dynamic was strained. He's a gay kid in an area where that could be deadly so he takes off for the fleshpots of Seattle and Portland where his youth and beauty will bring him some cash. He has no skills or education to support himself any other way. Sad, but the only hope this kid has of a decent life is to get taken up by some older sugar daddy who might just treat him to an education of some kind. That is if he can decide to just get over a bad home life and lack of a normal family. I've known gay kids who came from as lousy a background as River Phoenix and who never could get over it. River has developed an interesting defense mechanism and a psychologist would have field day with him if he got him on the coach. When the stress gets too much for him he just has a seizure like an epileptic, but in fact all he does is fall asleep. It's called narcilepsy, but he's vulnerable in that state as the film shows as well. River just tunes out the world. Keanu comes from a different world, his father is the Mayor of Portland, but he's dying and hopes to have his son take over the family political dynasty. But Tom Troupe is bitterly disappointed in his 'effeminate' son who like Prince Hal likes to hang out with lowlifes and street trash. Keanu's Falstaff is William Richert, a gay older man of a Falstaffian bloated belly who likes the young stuff and in his world probably treats them well. Gus Van Sant was quite imaginative in seeing the gay subtext that could be drawn from Prince Hal and Falstaff. Indeed Keanu says that Richert is closer to him than his real father. But he also says that he's planning to work a change in him when he comes into his own. And he says it in dialog taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV Parts one and two.The most touching scene is with River and Keanu out in the country at a fire where River basically confesses his love for him. It's love to be sure, but River also sees in Keanu a figure who has confidence and self assurance and those are the qualities that draws him to Reeves. What Phoenix misreads is that self confidence is really a safety net that he knows he has and at the appropriate time uses. Although he's gay for pay as he states, he still allows River to have sex with him. I suspect that Gus Van Sant from his own background knows full well that gay for pay is not always 100% absolute.Reeves goes on to his destiny for which if you know your Shakespeare know what that is. Phoenix's destiny is less clear, more than likely an oblivion that a lot of those kids go to. As a fantasy I'd like to think that as Reeves denies himself, closets himself as he moves on in life, that an older River comes back to remind him of his roots.We all know of the tragedy of River Phoenix who died way too young just like a lot of street kids do ironically. There is a second tragedy in the My Own Private Idaho. Rodney Harvey who played one of River and Keanu's street peers also died way too young in similar circumstances to Phoenix. Not only does Van Sant give us an excellent two person character study, but his other character with less dialog than the leads also are fully formed characters which is the mark that many including me say indicates a great film. My Own Private Idaho is a troubling picture, but a realistic one of the underside of gay life that we cannot ignore.
