The Matrix series must have taken a lot of thought. Clearly The Wachowski brothers were thinking about a lot. Because The Matrix is a unique sci-fi film.I myself am not a fan of Mr. Reeves. I am still thinking about him from Bill and Ted and how he tries to be serious. He tries to hide that voice. But here I liked him. The Matrix makes computer hackers look pretty pathetic. Well, they are pretty pathetic. Like the ones in Die hard 4. Except these computer hackers aren't nerds. Hugo Weaving is awesome as the villain of the trilogy. What am I saying? Weaving is awesome anyways. As V from V for Vendetta or Agent Smith from The Matrix, Weaving is great.The Matrix is probably the first films to ever show us such awesome special effects. It's a shame what happened to the Wachowski's once the trilogy ended. At least two out of three of the films were good. The other one... well, it wasn't art but it was pretty entertaining. The Matrix is a sci-fi extravaganza that you will never forget. I hope so at least. It's one film never to miss. I wouldn't say it's in my top 20 but it's awesome. The Matrix should never be forgotten. If you do for some reason forget it, then you must have Alzheimer's. That wasn't very nice. I was kidding. But be sure never to forget The Matrix.

The cut scenes jump rapidly, the camera work plays like an unfunny friend telling jokes and the acting, save for Dracula and Van Helsing, is horrible. Keanu Reeves is laughable in his role as Hutter, even given the need for an innocent and naive character, while the rest of the characters are lackluster and corny at best.There are a few saving graces, to be sure. Gary Oldman is stellar as Dracula. Also, the love scene with Keanu and the 3 wives of Dracula is very erotic (especially if your preference is women... or BDSM.) Lastly, Tom Waits makes a pretty good Renfield - even if he, too, is a bit melodramatic in the role. How 90's.Enjoy, it is a respectable addition to the vampire canon, if not its best example.
