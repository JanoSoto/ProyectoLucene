[{"date":"2 May 2009","score":"","review":" Nosferatu is one of those rare non-comedy silent films that actually improves with time. This flickering keepsake of a long-dead past, shot in oddly-tinted black-and-white with mouths that move but which we can not hear, casts an almost sepulchral aura of peaking into a grave. We come to this film expecting fear, but what Nosferatu delivers is dread.The first of many films based on Bram Stoker's Dracula (though its failure to do so officially nearly led to its being throttled in its crib by Stoker's widow), Nosferatu is the story of Hutter, an ambitious realtor who gets more than he bargained for when he sells a house overlooking his own home to Count Orlok (Max Schreck). Orlok, you see, is really Nosferatu, a vampyre (that's the way it's spelled in the titles), and Nosferatu has taken an unholy interest in Hutter's wife, Ellen (Greta Schröder).As Orlok famously observes Is that your wife? What a lovely throat.It's a famous line, but deceptive, too. There's not much humor in Nosferatu, even of the dark kind. Schreck is so full of dark menace and rat-like ugliness that it defies belief he can move around the streets of a large German town without being noticed. But Schreck is also one of the most convincing monsters ever put on screen, no thanks to CGI or even much makeup beyond some putty around the ears and kohl around the eyes. He's more zombie than vampire, his eyes seemingly dead as he makes his grand entrance into Hutter's bedroom, memorably backlit as Hutter cowers helplessly under the sheets. Just try and get that image out of your head once you've seen it!Director F.W. Murnau launches the horror film genre in fine style, with special effects that still cast a spell long after technology has moved on. Maybe it helps we don't expect in 1922 to see tricks involving double exposure and stop-motion photography seamlessly integrated into a storyline.Murnau ditches some elements of the Dracula story, reducing the character of Van Helsing into a barely-there character Bulwar, a Paracelsian, which connotes some mysticism Nosferatu never quite delves into. There's also Knock, Hutter's boss, who has the Renfield role, driven crazy either from proximity to Nosferatu (though the two never meet) or just from wearing his pants up to his armpits.The performance of Alexander Granach as Knock, and Gustav von Wangenheim as Hutter, are very broad by today's standards. It's a 90-minute movie, but one that could have stood another 20 minutes of cuts. In addition to the padding involving Bulwar, we have some strange logic gaps, like when the crewmen of a ship open one of the boxes they have been charged to transport by Nosferatu, discover nothing inside it but dirt and rats, and then take on the rest of the cargo anyway. Surely that was not what the manifest said the boxes contained. So why transport it at all?But of course Nosferatu is really not meant to work on that level. It's a film about the inexplicable, like how Knock cries Blut ist Leben! and Ellen wanting Nosferatu's rat claws around her young body, melting in desire when she sees the ugly count staring at her from the window opposite her bedroom. This works in Dracula because Bela Lugosi had charm, but Max Schreck?What seems to draw morbid Ellen is the lure of the grave, the most powerful common element in Nosferatu, more so now than ever as the actual making of the film passes from living memory.
