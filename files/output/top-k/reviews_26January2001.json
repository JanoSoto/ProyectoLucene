Too bad the movie's plot is a bit contrived and the acting, including Dean's, seems very strained at times - as if the actors were going to start laughing out loud at the hackneyed lines in the script.One would have hoped that with this movie's reputation and solid cast, it might have held up better over the last forty-odd years.  The movie tries to explore just why our protagonist is going through a tough time in his life. Every other teenage angst movie made since came up with the correct answer - that's what happens to teenagers.  The premise of the movie is that Dean's behaviour is unusual for a teenager of that generation despite the fact that every other teenage character in the movie is going through the same thing, even though their mothers don't pick-up and move when their kids get in trouble.The best you can say about this film is all of the cast takes it seriously. For a 60's baby like me (okay, late 1950's), seeing Ed Platt as anything else than The Chief and Jim Backus as anyone other than Mr. Howell is a treat in itself.  In one famous and outrageous scene, the emasculated Backus, playing Dean's father, is dressed in a frilly apron and preparing dinner while he talks to his son about problems he really doesn't understand.  You try doing that with a straight face.  Rounding out the cast are Sal Mineo and a very young Natalie Wood.Watch this strictly for historical purposes, not to be entertained.  Dean only made three movies, so even though I haven't seen either of them, they've got to give his considerable talents a better chance at expression than this exploitation flick did.

Pretty bold statements, I know, but there is truth behind them. I finished watching the film knowing only what I knew going in; It's about stealing cars. There's not much more to it than that. No real sub-plots to speak of, and the few that surfaced were weak, and died after a couple of scenes. Actors were just empty shells, with no real motivation. Cars were given names to signify that they were just as important, if not MORE IMPORTANT as the actors piloting them. Welcome to mainstream Hollywood cinema everyone.I'm not a big fan of Nick Cage, and stick to my guns that the only decent film he's done is Bringing Out The Dead. Similarly, Angelina Jolie isn't on the top of my list either, yet if there was a performer that was grossly underused in any film ever, it's Ms. Jolie here. Time her screen appearances. What did you get? Fifteen minutes? And in that time we figure out she is a crack mechanic, loves stealing cars, at one time dated the title character, at one time stole cars with the title character, gets turned on by stealing cars, still loves the title character, and actually never stopped loving him. A lot learned in a little bit of time. Jolie is present as a piece of meat. Nothing else. Maybe they should have talked to her Oscar, and found out that she CAN act. It could have helped the movie. They might as well have put a blonde wig on a Chevy Nova, and `creatively' named it `Angelina' like they did with all the rest of the cars featured. Would have had the same effect.But alas. The movie stereotypes itself in order to please the common male. Cars, cars, cars, a strong woman who is eventually broken down by an even stronger man, and more cars. Predictable storyline, wandering plot, and actors that could have been replaced with cardboard cut-outs without us being the wiser. Seeing this movie in the same night as Hollow Man really made me loose my faith in Hollywood. Too commercialized, too stereotypical, and therefore too predictable.

This is not revisionist history, there is no attempt to keep things historically correct.  Suspend disbelief. 2.) Masters can become as light as a feather, strike with the force of a wrecking ball, paralyze with a touch.  They just can.  Get over it. =) 3.)

","genre":"Action, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"26 January 2001","score":"","review":"  I've been a long time fan of the wuxia film genre, so when I first saw the Internet trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I was ecstatic. Finally -- Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh together, a (relatively) big budget and no English dubbing.  Expectations were high... ... and were met.  I was prepared to be the jaded viewer who had seen it all.  Hyperkinetic fight scenes?  Been there.  Amazing wirework?  Done that. My preparations were for naught.  I was stunned at how far technology and the masterful direction of Ang Lee took this film.  Peerless special effects, action, acting and story came together in a film that I will never forget.  Only a screen full of superlatives could do this film justice, and I ain't got the space.If you've never seen a Chinese 'kung-fu' movie before, see this.  But keep the following things in mind before going (and before reading some of the earlier, negative reviews)1.) Wuxia is fantasy, not reality.  This is not revisionist history, there is no attempt to keep things historically correct.  Suspend disbelief. 2.) Masters can become as light as a feather, strike with the force of a wrecking ball, paralyze with a touch.  They just can.  Get over it. =) 3.) Every Chinese film I've seen (and I've seen a LOT) has a different sense of sentimentality from that of Western films.  Some consider it to be too saccharine or perceive it to be insincere.  This is a sticking point - if you don't like it, you don't like it. 4.) This is a story about love.  Sure, it has staggering fight sequences, but the core of the film revolves around love and what it does - negative or positive - to those who are caught by it.Experience this film.  You MAY not like it, but it's worth taking the risk. If you're lucky enough to be part of the 90% of us who appreciate Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, you will be very, VERY happy you went out of your way.

They are called Old Time Sake movies.  That is... a movie that reminds us of what it was like to be a kid again.  Movies that encompass that realm range from comedies like Fasttimes At Ridegemont High, Breakfast Club, Secret Admirer, to action films like First Blood, Raiders and Commando to other comedies like Stripes, Back to The Future and Ghostbusters.  Better Off Dead fell into that category because it was a film that we used to watch a great deal when we were fifteen years old.  John Cusack was iconoclastic in our adolescent books because he was in Sixteen Candles, The Sure Thing and a few other films that we admired when we were young.  We admired and laughed at Better Off Dead because it was funny.  I can still remember seeing the commercials for Better Off Dead when I was thirteen.  The one scene that they always showed in the trailer was when the black city worker says  Now that's a shame, white folks be throwing away a perfectly good white boy, or something to that effect, as Cusack was being whisked away in the back of a garbage truck.  I mean, make no mistake about it.  This was a funny movie when you are a teenager.  But now that I am an adult, this film is not only funny, it is probably the smartest teen\/funny\/reality film I have ever seen.  From what I know, Savage Steve Holland only had a shelf life of two films in Hollywood and that is because even though his two films probably did alright, no one could truly understand the true genius behind his work and his vision.Better Off Dead is about a guy ( Lane Myer )that has been dating a pretty girl named Beth for six months, which in highschool is like the Silver Anniversary of dating.  On the day of ski tryouts she dumps him for Roy Stalin, the captain of ski team and the only guy who has skiied the K-12.  He also plays guitar, sings and is a pretty good looking guy.  After she dumps Lane, he tries first to commit suicide, then get her back.  To make matters worse, he has a mother that improvises when she cooks so that his meals look more like jello, whether they are bacon or steak or toast and jam.  His father dislikes him at the moment because he has purchased a car that sits dormant on the front lawn.  His father is also reading teen psychology books and is trying desperately to communicate with him using the latest colloquial terms.  His dad of course screws them up by saying things like  Right Off instead of Right On.  His little brother never says a word but buys books on how to pick up trashy women and how to build a rocket using household items.  This works for him, Lane can't even seem to get his homework done.  Lane also has a friend named Charles DeMar, played by Booger, from Revenge of The Nerds.  He can't take anything seriously and his life revolves around drugs.  At one point, while at the top of the K-12, he remarks, This mountain is pure snow!  Do you have any idea what the street value is of this mountain?  There is a paper boy that wants his two dollars for papers that have been owed to him and to make matters even worse, everyone wants to date Beth now that they have broke up.  Then there is his science class that loves homework more than any highschool class should be allowed to and his next door neighbour is a geek that has a foreign exchange student living there and he is constantly being challenged to a race by two Oriental motorists that always seem to find him at stop lights.  Also, Porky, from Porky's hates him because he has been in two accidents with him yet he is now his boss at his hamburger chain.  There are enough ideas in this film for ten movies.  There really are.  What is so unique about Better Off Dead is that it coyly makes fun of everything that we knew about when we were growing up.  There is not one situation in this film that you can take seriously but at the same time, every situation rings true in so many ways.  We may not have experienced all that Lane does growing up, but in a strange way, many of what the film says is true.  It just has a completely twisted way of looking at it.I don't think you can appreciate this film until you are much into your twenty's.

I watched this film for the first time in about five years just last weekend and I could see more this time.  I could appreciate what it was saying and how it went about saying it.  This film makes fun of every single institution that we held sacred as teens.  And it does so in such a smart way that I can honestly say that this is probably the best teen comedy I have ever seen.  John Hughes is a genius, but for different reasons.  Holland is a genius because he can take a Hughes film and turn it upside down and parody it to the point of insanity.  This is that film.Old Time Sake films are films that bring you back to a time when you were young and somewhat carefree.  These films are fifteen years old and they make us laugh because they are funny but also because they remind us of sleep-overs on a Friday night.

There is a paper boy that wants his two dollars for papers that have been owed to him and to make matters even worse, everyone wants to date Beth now that they have broke up.  Then there is his science class that loves homework more than any highschool class should be allowed to and his next door neighbour is a geek that has a foreign exchange student living there and he is constantly being challenged to a race by two Oriental motorists that always seem to find him at stop lights.  Also, Porky, from Porky's hates him because he has been in two accidents with him yet he is now his boss at his hamburger chain.  There are enough ideas in this film for ten movies.  There really are.  What is so unique about Better Off Dead is that it coyly makes fun of everything that we knew about when we were growing up.  There is not one situation in this film that you can take seriously but at the same time, every situation rings true in so many ways.  We may not have experienced all that Lane does growing up, but in a strange way, many of what the film says is true.  It just has a completely twisted way of looking at it.I don't think you can appreciate this film until you are much into your twenty's.  You can enjoy it and laugh at as a kid, but you will not fully appreciate it until you can understand it's brilliance.  I watched this film for the first time in about five years just last weekend and I could see more this time.  I could appreciate what it was saying and how it went about saying it.  This film makes fun of every single institution that we held sacred as teens.  And it does so in such a smart way that I can honestly say that this is probably the best teen comedy I have ever seen.  John Hughes is a genius, but for different reasons.  Holland is a genius because he can take a Hughes film and turn it upside down and parody it to the point of insanity.  This is that film.Old Time Sake films are films that bring you back to a time when you were young and somewhat carefree.  These films are fifteen years old and they make us laugh because they are funny but also because they remind us of sleep-overs on a Friday night.  When watching a film like this, only have chips and pop, never beer and peanuts, because that's what we did when we were kids.  Nostalgia can be found in abundance with films like this. What a trip!10 out of 10- if you have not seen this film in sometime, believe me, it will hit in ways you never knew existed.  You will laugh until it hurts.  I did!

For those people, either buy or rent the DVD version of the film.  In it you will find the director's comments and a featurette that just might explain a few things that would help you understand Tim's reasons for making the film the way he did. Yes, it is indeed a difficult film to watch, but then incest is a difficult subject to deal with.Personally, I think Tim has done an excellent job depicting the issue of incest in a more realistic light.  There is no easy way to do a film with this type of subject matter.  I can tell that he had done some research prior to doing this project.Incest can be, and frequently is, a silent monster that quietly devastates afflicted families.  Many times this type of abuse gets passed down from parent to child.  The cycle is difficult to break.  In the scene where Tom witnesses his father and sister involved in an incestuous act through the bathroom window, he goes into a state of shock.  Many people wonder why he didn't simply blow the whistle his dad at that time.  Also, many wonder why Jesse seems content to endure this abuse.  Unless you have experienced sexual abuse as child, you cannot completely get into the mind of the child being abused.  Blowing the whistle seems to be an obvious solution to the problem, but sexual abuse is not the only type of abuse present.  Other less noticeable forms of abuse (i.e. emotional abuse), plays a role in how the abused deals with the matter at hand.  Silence and complacency on the part of the abused is often the case.  Some victims are unable to vocalize what is going on and then continue to bear the pain of the abuse.I highly recommend this film.  It is not for everyone, nor is it appropriate for young children without parental guidance.  But this film truly hits home on what incest\/abuse is really about.  I wouldn't be surprised if most people have friends who have experienced or is going through an abusive situation, and these people aren't even aware of the pain and fear their friends are going through.  Don't compare this film to others with similar story lines or subject matter.  Look at the film itself and take it at face value.  To Tim Roth, well done!!

Contains spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Beach is a Danny Boyle film. In it's first week of release, enough people paid to see The Beach to cover over ¾  of Leonardo DiCaprio's paycheque for his first major role since 1997's Titanic, and it would be safe to say that the majority of those paying customers were disappointed. I believe this is a safe guess because I was one of those people. I have yet to read a positive review of the film and the best my friends could come up with was `It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be'. Sadly, I had to agree.The thing is, I wanted so badly to love this film. I had read the book and loved it, I had seen Boyle's previous work and loved it (Yes, I even loved A Life Less Ordinary), and I wanted nothing more than to prove to all the nay-sayers that The Beach would rise above the stench of the usual February release crowd and be remembered as one of the best films of the year. I went to see The Beach for a second time. The film may not appear on any year-end top ten lists to vindicate my faith, but on second viewing The Beach became a Danny Boyle film. Those who are familiar with 1994's Trainspotting will understand that this is a compliment of the highest regard. Adapted from Alex Garland's 1997 first novel of the same name, The Beach follows Richard (DiCaprio) an admittedly brash, young American back-packer who escapes to Thailand to find&#133; something. Richard is a fairly vague guy. In fact, all he gives us is his name `&#133;what else do you need to know?'. Is he looking for himself? For Love? What he does find is Daffy (a manic Robert Carlyle). He finds him on the floor of the neighboring hostel room, with his wrists slit &#150; the blood covering the walls and bed in such a fashion as to leave no doubt that the act was committed with purpose (and joy?). The previous evening, Daffy tells Richard about a beach &#150; a real paradise of mythical beauty. The following morning, Richard finds a map on his door. What is most immediately jarring to anyone who has read the book is the decision to make Richard an American instead of a Brit. This does change a couple of things for one, we miss the joy of Zeph and Sammy &#150; the two American tourists whom Richard unfortunately (or fortunately) invites to `paradise'.With Richard as an American, we Canadians are deprived of a well-needed slap in the face In the film, Sammy and Zeph are our stereotypical, arrogant American surf dudes. In the book, the surf act was just that `It's a protest against bigotry,' Zeph explained. `Europeans think all Americans are stupid, so we act stupid to confirm your prejudices. Then we reveal ourselves as  intelligent and by doing so, subvert the prejudice more effectively than an immediate barrage of intellect &#150; which only causes confusion and, ultimately, resentment.' (45) How pleasant it might have been to sit in a Canadian audience and listen as the trap is sprung. Still, the most important thing about Richard, Zeph and Sammy is intact. They are not the only things that lead to the end of paradise, but they are a symbol for all that shows us that paradise is not possible. They are Americans and they are a plague. In fact, the film is telling us that we all are, but for some it may be easier to keep the blame centered on our favourite target. The Beach is not an anti-American film. It is an anti-Consumerism film. And we are all targets.  We see this in many telling scenes, not the least of which involves Richard preparing to leave the island for food , taking orders from the entire multi-cultural beach community of what to bring back from civilization to their `paradise'. Here's what's brought into `paradise' Bleach, for an Australian girl who doesn't like her dark hair; rubber gloves, for the Eastern European cook who is tired of smelling like fish and requests soap (`something toxic, something industrial') to solve the problem; and batteries, for those on the island (including Richard) who won't accept a paradise without Nintendo. `Paradise' has its problems. `Paradise' will not survive, because once it is found, it is lost.As Richard's time on the beach passes, he finds something again. The only thing he ever finds - he finds twice. Daffy begins to appear to Richard in the latter part of the film. Daffy knows why he left the beach and he tells Richard. He doesn't tell us. But we soon understand. Perhaps the most common complaint I've heard about The Beach includes some comment on the studio system and how it destroys the independent genius of someone like Danny Boyle. Maybe it does. It's quite possible that 20th Century Fox wanted Leo, they wanted Leo to be an American, they wanted Leo's character to sleep with no fewer than two beautiful female characters and they wanted a `happy ending'. It's possible that Boyle consented. It's possible that he subverted the whole process. On the recommendation of a friend, I went to see The Beach for a second time and what I saw was brave. What I saw was Danny Boyle winking at me from behind the guise of Leonardo DiCaprio as Richard sits in an internet café, looking at a photo from `paradise' - I saw Boyle's version of Zeph and Sammy. He sprung the trap on us. Upon first viewing, the ending is a cop-out a flippantly stupid wrap-up that says `it's okay to fall to the absolute depths of self-imposed degridation, because we'll always have a few happy memories to cover the fall'. Richard's words tell us that he `still believes in paradise', but his eyes tell us something else. This is Boyle's triumph Richard's eyes tell us what they now know&#150; that there is no such thing.  `God knows we're lonely souls' begin the lyrics to the song that plays over the closing credits, and we know that Richard is now the loneliest of them all. Danny Boyle's The Beach follows last year's The Matrix and Fight Club, showing us what we don't want to see that there is no use looking for paradise because there is no paradise left  - it's left us &#150; we've repelled it. It is too late for Richard to save his beach because he believes it can be saved from Zeph and Sammy, he doesn't know that the reason it can't be saved is because he's already there &#150; the poison has already begun to spread. But he learns, and we learn as The Beach reminds us of what we all too often are `Cancers, parasites eating-up the whole ****ing world'.

Contains spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Beach is a Danny Boyle film. In it's first week of release, enough people paid to see The Beach to cover over ¾  of Leonardo DiCaprio's paycheque for his first major role since 1997's Titanic, and it would be safe to say that the majority of those paying customers were disappointed. I believe this is a safe guess because I was one of those people. I have yet to read a positive review of the film and the best my friends could come up with was `It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be'. Sadly, I had to agree.The thing is, I wanted so badly to love this film. I had read the book and loved it, I had seen Boyle's previous work and loved it (Yes, I even loved A Life Less Ordinary), and I wanted nothing more than to prove to all the nay-sayers that The Beach would rise above the stench of the usual February release crowd and be remembered as one of the best films of the year. I went to see The Beach for a second time. The film may not appear on any year-end top ten lists to vindicate my faith, but on second viewing The Beach became a Danny Boyle film. Those who are familiar with 1994's Trainspotting will understand that this is a compliment of the highest regard. Adapted from Alex Garland's 1997 first novel of the same name, The Beach follows Richard (DiCaprio) an admittedly brash, young American back-packer who escapes to Thailand to find&#133; something. Richard is a fairly vague guy. In fact, all he gives us is his name `&#133;what else do you need to know?'. Is he looking for himself? For Love? What he does find is Daffy (a manic Robert Carlyle). He finds him on the floor of the neighboring hostel room, with his wrists slit &#150; the blood covering the walls and bed in such a fashion as to leave no doubt that the act was committed with purpose (and joy?). The previous evening, Daffy tells Richard about a beach &#150; a real paradise of mythical beauty. The following morning, Richard finds a map on his door. What is most immediately jarring to anyone who has read the book is the decision to make Richard an American instead of a Brit. This does change a couple of things for one, we miss the joy of Zeph and Sammy &#150; the two American tourists whom Richard unfortunately (or fortunately) invites to `paradise'.With Richard as an American, we Canadians are deprived of a well-needed slap in the face In the film, Sammy and Zeph are our stereotypical, arrogant American surf dudes. In the book, the surf act was just that `It's a protest against bigotry,' Zeph explained. `Europeans think all Americans are stupid, so we act stupid to confirm your prejudices. Then we reveal ourselves as  intelligent and by doing so, subvert the prejudice more effectively than an immediate barrage of intellect &#150; which only causes confusion and, ultimately, resentment.' (45) How pleasant it might have been to sit in a Canadian audience and listen as the trap is sprung. Still, the most important thing about Richard, Zeph and Sammy is intact. They are not the only things that lead to the end of paradise, but they are a symbol for all that shows us that paradise is not possible. They are Americans and they are a plague. In fact, the film is telling us that we all are, but for some it may be easier to keep the blame centered on our favourite target. The Beach is not an anti-American film. It is an anti-Consumerism film. And we are all targets.  We see this in many telling scenes, not the least of which involves Richard preparing to leave the island for food , taking orders from the entire multi-cultural beach community of what to bring back from civilization to their `paradise'. Here's what's brought into `paradise' Bleach, for an Australian girl who doesn't like her dark hair; rubber gloves, for the Eastern European cook who is tired of smelling like fish and requests soap (`something toxic, something industrial') to solve the problem; and batteries, for those on the island (including Richard) who won't accept a paradise without Nintendo. `Paradise' has its problems. `Paradise' will not survive, because once it is found, it is lost.As Richard's time on the beach passes, he finds something again. The only thing he ever finds - he finds twice. Daffy begins to appear to Richard in the latter part of the film. Daffy knows why he left the beach and he tells Richard. He doesn't tell us. But we soon understand. Perhaps the most common complaint I've heard about The Beach includes some comment on the studio system and how it destroys the independent genius of someone like Danny Boyle. Maybe it does. It's quite possible that 20th Century Fox wanted Leo, they wanted Leo to be an American, they wanted Leo's character to sleep with no fewer than two beautiful female characters and they wanted a `happy ending'. It's possible that Boyle consented. It's possible that he subverted the whole process. On the recommendation of a friend, I went to see The Beach for a second time and what I saw was brave. What I saw was Danny Boyle winking at me from behind the guise of Leonardo DiCaprio as Richard sits in an internet café, looking at a photo from `paradise' - I saw Boyle's version of Zeph and Sammy. He sprung the trap on us. Upon first viewing, the ending is a cop-out a flippantly stupid wrap-up that says `it's okay to fall to the absolute depths of self-imposed degridation, because we'll always have a few happy memories to cover the fall'. Richard's words tell us that he `still believes in paradise', but his eyes tell us something else. This is Boyle's triumph Richard's eyes tell us what they now know&#150; that there is no such thing.  `God knows we're lonely souls' begin the lyrics to the song that plays over the closing credits, and we know that Richard is now the loneliest of them all.

I am sorry to say I left sorely disappointed.The acting is excellent for the most part. I thought Dafoe and Malkovich both nailed their characters sublimely, and the rest of the cast, though not given much to do, were just fine. It's creepy how much Eddie Izzard looks like his character Gustav von Wangenheim. The exception to the great acting was Cary Elwes, who was very nearly painful. Pick an accent and stick with it, dude, or just stand there and look pretty.I did enjoy *most* of the film. As others have said, the opening credits were too long (as were the closing credits, which I stay for at every film), but whatever. For the first hour or so it was a nice, creepy little pseudo-homage to Nosferatu (one of my favorite films). And the point, that Murnau was obsessed with making the film and Schreck was weird, was quite clear. Fine. Cool. Enjoyable.But then it had to end in a flaming ball of unbelievable schlock, and I mean unbelievable in its literal sense. Sure, any vampire movie has to have some suspension of disbelief, but this was just too much. Maybe it was the fact that they used the real names, that these were supposed to be real people, but I really couldn't suspend my disbelief that much.Still, even with the over-the-top ending, everything would have been okay, I could have let it go and still enjoyed the film if it hadn't resorted to the oldest, tiredest vampire cliche in film history. Unnecessary, trite and totally inappropriately historically inaccurate (even in the context of this film), that scene just killed it.I'm sad, because I really wanted to love this movie. But all things considered, I shouldn't have even bothered to see it.
