I really liked it. It was quite faithful to the book. `Dangerous liaisons' was interesting from beginning to end. I can't believe how incredible this movie was. I like John Malcovich's performance. He showed us his great acting skills. He was certainly well cast to play the main character Vicomte de Valmont. He really envelops himself into the role quite well. What about Glenn Close? I think she was amazing, I never thought she could act in films as interesting as this one. This movie is utterly stupendous. Have a look at the scenery in 18th century France where this movie takes place. It's great. I really enjoyed this movie every minute; Nevertheless I don't understand why some people said that this movie was too slow. I don't think it was slow. I think it was very fast instead, because the movie just lasted two hours. It wasn't definitely that long and slow. Glenn Close must have been the academy award winner for best actress in a leading role. Anyway, I think this movie was wonderful. The ending was thoroughly appropriate, Look at Glenn Close's face expressions when she's wiping her face and getting teary-eyed for having been ashamed in front of everybody because of what she did. She was certainly mean. This movie shows us that everybody gets what they deserve. She reminds me of Kathryn (Sarah Michell Gellar) in Cruel intentions. Cruel intentions was Ok; however `Dangerous liaisons' was much better. I really enjoyed this more than cruel intentions even though it's the same story.As for Michelle Pfieffer, What can I say? I think she was wonderful to portray Madame de Tourve. She's a revelation, What a tremendous actress!. Her academy award nomination for best actress in a supporting role was very well-deserved. I like the scene as she dies, but she dies realizing that Vicomte de Valmont loved her with his whole being.  All in all. It's worth watching and beautiful visually, the costumes are stunning. I'm glad this movie was over-rated. Glenn Close is one of the best actresses I have ever seen.

I have never read the trilogy, but certainly have some background familiarity with it.  I am as are a lot of people, a fan of great movies and cannot stand bad ones.  I for one cannot stomach most of the crap Hollywood throws our way.  Some examples would be Mummy Returns, Lara Croft, and Exit Wounds. The list is endless.  It's unbelievable what people will pay hard-earned money to see!  I wouldn't even watch a lot of movies for free, considering I have much better things to do with 2 hours.  I find many films can only be enjoyed by checking your brains at the door and forgetting about how much you paid for it.Having said that, let me get to the purpose of writing this letter.  I would like to address those who have said that this was a horrible film.  I am also amazed with the amount of vitriol and intensity with which these negative reviews are written.  They are quite amusing to read.  It's actually even pathetic, but I believe these people are insecure about the fact that they could be wrong about the movie, and that the people's overwhelmingly positive reception only alienates them. These people seem to be insecure about the fact that they could be wrong.Let me offer some evidence on why LOTR is a great movie.First, this movie has received 4 Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture, Director, Original Score, and Original Song.  Needless to say, these are the big prizes of the evening, and it is a confirmation of its quality just to be nominated.  Although the Golden Globes are by no means a mirror, it is certainly the leading indicator of which films are to be real players at the Academy Awards.  Second, a staggering amount of people, of every conceivable demographic have given a resounding affirmation that yes, this is one great movie.  A very large number of people even say it was the greatest movie of all time.  One need only look on the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) numbers to see for themselves.  Surprisingly, the groups that gave it the highest ratings were females of various age categories.  This, in what was supposed to be a movie that appealed mainly to males.  Finally, the vast majority of movie critics have given this movie not just good, but rave reviews.  So rarely, does a movie receive critical AND mainstream praise.Now, what does this all mean?   Well, for you self-righteous, idiotic, pseudo-sophisticates who wouldn't know a good movie if it hit you in the face, it means that maybe the movie does not suck as bad as you think it does, and that maybe you simply have not the intellectual capacity to appreciate the qualities of such a truly amazing cinematic achievement.Even if the film didn't meet your ridiculously high standards, the feeling I get is that some of you are criticizing the movie simply because you don't even WANT to enjoy it.  I went into this movie with the fullest intention of enjoying it as much as possible.  There was no way I was gonna pick apart the characterization, plot, CGI, and all the rest of God knows what.  But what we have here is a small minority of people who would rather not enjoy, but  pick apart  and even trash of what is a truly, truly great movie.  How sad.

You have Michelle, Ryan, Benny, and that girl in the woods who has lost it completely.The first and second TCM's are great but the third is the best.  STAY AWAY FROM PART 4!

Oh and the soundtrack has some of the best metal music.  Leatherface has his own song about him.  And people say Ghostface is all cool and scary.  Ghostface has nothing on Leatherface.  Check out this movie, you'll be impressed. ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"27 December 2001","score":"","review":"  Firstly let me say that this film is a true masterpiece. Yes, it is not perfect, but nothing ever is, but the small niggles, are just that, SMALL!I read the books when I was eight years old, and thought them great, and I saw the cartoon version (a personal favourite when I was small), but I did not think I could be as impressed as I was but this wonderful piece of film-making.Let's look at what is wrong with the film. Some of the CGI is a bit ropey, but only in incidental scenes, where the aformentioned CGI is not in the main shot, or you only catch a fleeting glimpse. The orcs where a bit too muscle men with face paint for my tastes. This was one thing I preferred in the cartoon; the orcs where more varied, some fat ones, some thin, some drinking, some bickering. Also the orc's voices sounded a bit too synthisyser-esque. Arwen rescuing Frodo, not in the book, and (I may be wrong about in the book, but in the cartoon) when Frodo rides to the ford on his own, it shows what a strong character he is, fighting for all he is worth against the power of the Ring Wraiths.Now to what makes the film.This movie is filmed as if it was real. I will try to explain what I mean by this. How many times in a hollywood film have you seen beautifully clean hair and skin? In this film there is dirt under the character's fingernails, grease in the hair, they look tired and cold and harassed. You empathise so much more with them, with the quest.The other main point that makes this film is the sheer scale of it. The landscape of New Zealand is the set, and so it does look huge and beautiful. The characters are put into scale with the environment, and it really does work. You believe that it is a world, not a set.Onto the story. I have read some of the negative reviews on this site, and it seems that the people just did not get the point of alot of the plot. The whole idea of the ring is that it is controling. It has an influence on the characters and plot. You could almost describe it as another member of the cast. This is why the film ends like it does, because the ring is trying to stop the fellowship.Some of the added pieces of CGI, with Galadriel and Bilbo changing in the precence of the ring, really add to the feeling of power from the ring. THe Balroc is, quite frankly, stunning, and the battle sequences, and fights are brilliant. They even manage to make the use of a bow and arrow at close quarters look fessible. And I also have to say that you need to sit somewhere in the theatre that allows the screen to fill your vision, as some of the sweeping shots can out-do any ride at Disneyland!The acting is excellent, with Sam and Frodo actually coming over as likable characters. One review I read said the Frodo is too whingeing, but, with Peter Jackson being as faithful as he can be to the books, the fact that you don't want to throttle Frodo and Sam after 20 seconds is remarkable. Gandalph is played beautifully, so that you can see the underlying power of the character. Sean Bean really does prove that he can act, and Orlando Bloom will be a very big star before long. The rest of the Fellowship just add to the experience. They ALL look like Tolkien drew them, and act as he wrote them; they are their characters.Even the dodgy throw-away lines, added for comedic effect, don't detract from the film but embelish it.To sum up, yes this film has faults, but the minute you let such little points take away from such a wonderfully engrousing experience you are selling yourself short. This film is here to be enjoyed, and savoured.Without doubt 10\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 December 2001","score":"","review":"  Firstly let me say that this film is a true masterpiece.

Well the people that told me this were right. I walked out of the cinema, slightly down, but content with what I saw. There is no doubting that Lantana is a depressing sort of film, yet it challenges, intrigues, mystifies, moves and makes the viewer think about what is important about life.Leon Zat  is a police detective who is cheating on his wife, Sonja, with Jane O'may. Jane who is separated from her husband Pete, lives next door to Paula and Nik, a happily married couple who become entwined in the events of Jane and Pete. Sonja who senses her husband alienation is seeing a psychiatrist Valerie Summers, who is married to academic, John Knox.  Their relationship is marred by the death of their daughter. The film opens with the dead body of a woman in the midst of lantana scrub and it is Leon's investigation of this event that connects everyone, including one of Valerie's patients, Patrick Phelan, a rather strange and nasty guy.The cast of Lantana is one of the strong points of this film. The main role of Leon, was played by veteran Australian actor, Anthony LaPaglia. I really felt pain in some instances for his character, yet in other circumstances there was no other feeling than `you deserve it Pal'. He really played the role of the cheating and guilty husband to perfection. While his co-star and onscreen wife, Kerry Armstrong was very strong as Sonja. She has recently won awards for her role in the Australian TV drama, Sea Change.Other characters worthy of a mention, include Rachel Blake as the woman on the side for Leon and the next door neighbour who is just a little too concerned about other people's affairs, while her husband is played by the goofy Glen Robbins, who is a really funny man. I also enjoyed the roles of Valerie and John. John was played by academy award winner Geoffery Rush, who is nothing short of brilliant in this movie. His portrayal of the grieving father is exceptional. While Barbara Hershey stars as Valerie, the psychiatrist who is need of counselling of her own, because of her daughter's death. The pair show how hard it is to be a normal couple after such a traumatic experience from the loss of a child. In addition, the role of Patrick Phelan, played by Aussie actor Peter Phelps, was extremely refreshing as you really do think that he is not such a great guy, from the situation he is in therapy with Valerie. This film also gives the audience a great look at the difficult situations one can be in from a relationship. You need to have a lot of trust, honesty and respect for each other, otherwise things will not work out, whether you are married or not. This film also gives a great perspective on the other side of an affair, the guilty side. No-one wins from an affair, because the hurt and betrayal causes  all sorts of problems, including the effects on family, work environment, friends and personal well-being. This film certainly allows you to experience what it is like to have an affair and how you can be hurt by one.  This film is the work of director Ray Lawrence, who has done one other film in his time named Bliss. I like the story that he had to work with and how he used the city of Sydney to great effect. I hope that we get to see more of Lawrence's work because the movie going public has waited a long time to see an Australian film of such high quality.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"27 December 2001","score":"","review":"  This is from the Tolkien fanatic's perspective.  I've read the trilogy at least a dozen times and know the story by heart.  However, unlike other die-hard Tolkien fans, I'm not going to complain about the movie version  cutting out several big scenes, eliminating characters, and basically taking every shortcut they can to keep the story moving.  They had to do it.  The movie is long as it is and there are too many characters.  Because of this, I'll say straight off that Fellowship is not going to be a super blockbuster.  The much simpler (and far inferior) Titanic is safe with its record.Cutting out some characters was essential.  Giving Arwen the added role of Glorfindel was absolutely necessary.  Did we really need another elf?  How could they possibly have gotten Liv Tyler to do the movie when her role in the first book would have been trivial.I also agree with most of the scene cuts.  Did we really have to see Tom Bombadil?  Do I mind that Farmer Maggot is reduced to a passing reference?  Does it really matter that Frodo leaves immediately rather than waiting around in the Shire for many weeks first?  These are all wisely chosen scene cuts to shorten the movie.  Even cutting out the Barrow Downs is OK, although it does seems funny when Strider suddenly throws weapons at the hobbits out of nowhere.And this is the main flaw of the movie.  Because there is so much story to tell, the movie seems choppy in places.  The editing is weak.  Plus, they've made an attempt to put the story in chronological order, meaning that they had to bring some scenes from later books into the already long Fellowship.  It doesn't quite fly.  I think they really needed four movies to perfectly render the three books.  Fellowship, for example, would have been far better off ending after the escape from the mines.Worse, they've botched a few important scenes.  We see Aragorn giving Frodo his tacit permission to leave the group before he sneaks out.  This has got to be incomprehensible to fan and novice alike.  Since we later have a scene with Aragorn restraining Legolas from giving chase to Frodo and Sam, the earlier added scene is unnecessary.  They should have just left it with Strider refusing the ring to contrast him with Boromir.Another big botch is at the Prancing Pony.  We never hear about the letter that Gandalf gave Butterball.  So how in the world do we understand why the hobbits eventually learn to trust Strider?OK, we've gotten the picky bits out of the way, on to the positive side.  The art direction is absolutely fabulous, quite possibly the best I've ever seen in a movie.

The film really challenges the viewer to think outside his or her assessments of what Christ was like.  It displays Christ (Willem Defoe, in the best performance of his career)as a flawed character who has impulses and is easily tempted like any other human being.  He truly doesn't want to be the messiah at all, he builds cross after cross for the Romans so that they may execute anyone and everyone who claims to be a messiah, desperately wanting God to hate him.  When Christ cures the blind man, he is not pleased that he succeeded at all because he realizes that he is a step closer to the cross himself.  As he's being crucified, his guardian angel comes to him and tells him he is not the messiah.  Unwilling from the start, he allows the angel to take him to a promising new life with a wife and children, his final surrender to temptation.  Defoe's layered, challenging performance succeeds in brining the complex character of Christ to life.  His eyes perfectly display his pain; his voice really shows Christ's frustration.  It's an absolutely splendid performance, for which he was unjustly denied a Best Actor Oscar or even a nomination.  It's easy to see why the church did not approve of such a premise, but the close minded manner in which they responded to the film was really unbelievable.  They wanted to pay Universal studios for the negative and burn it before there was even a chance to see it.  Most of the protesters hadn't seen the film at all.  Some churches even went as far as to make up scenes that were in the movie to discourage people form seeing it.  Although it seems to me that these kind of extreme Christians tend to forget their own beliefs.  Christ was all God AND all Man, so inevitably, his more human preferences win out over his unavoidable destiny, which I suppose didn't fit every church's criteria of how the story of Christ should be told.  Some people I know who have stereotyped those involved in the film as being satanists or atheists, absurd considering Martin Scorses in Roman Catholic.  I myself am an Atheist, I lost my faith the Church about two years ago, and I can safely say that this film did a lot more for Christ and my view on him the all the years of preachy brain washing ever did.

The film really challenges the viewer to think outside his or her assessments of what Christ was like.  It displays Christ (Willem Defoe, in the best performance of his career)as a flawed character who has impulses and is easily tempted like any other human being.  He truly doesn't want to be the messiah at all, he builds cross after cross for the Romans so that they may execute anyone and everyone who claims to be a messiah, desperately wanting God to hate him.  When Christ cures the blind man, he is not pleased that he succeeded at all because he realizes that he is a step closer to the cross himself.  As he's being crucified, his guardian angel comes to him and tells him he is not the messiah.  Unwilling from the start, he allows the angel to take him to a promising new life with a wife and children, his final surrender to temptation.  Defoe's layered, challenging performance succeeds in brining the complex character of Christ to life.  His eyes perfectly display his pain; his voice really shows Christ's frustration.  It's an absolutely splendid performance, for which he was unjustly denied a Best Actor Oscar or even a nomination.  It's easy to see why the church did not approve of such a premise, but the close minded manner in which they responded to the film was really unbelievable.  They wanted to pay Universal studios for the negative and burn it before there was even a chance to see it.  Most of the protesters hadn't seen the film at all.  Some churches even went as far as to make up scenes that were in the movie to discourage people form seeing it.  Although it seems to me that these kind of extreme Christians tend to forget their own beliefs.  Christ was all God AND all Man, so inevitably, his more human preferences win out over his unavoidable destiny, which I suppose didn't fit every church's criteria of how the story of Christ should be told.  Some people I know who have stereotyped those involved in the film as being satanists or atheists, absurd considering Martin Scorses in Roman Catholic.  I myself am an Atheist, I lost my faith the Church about two years ago, and I can safely say that this film did a lot more for Christ and my view on him the all the years of preachy brain washing ever did.  This film makes Christ a character who is much easier to relate to (something that can't be said for such films as the wretched TV movie Jesus).  Overall, this film is and entertaining and challenging new look at the life of the man who died for our sins.

And what makes this a good bad movie is that I have never seen such a clearly terrible movie take it self so seriously and honestly believe it has some deeper message about happiness and life. All this movie can be is an excuse to look at pretty people, and boy, are they pretty. It opens with some well shot sequences. Cruise's pretty boy Richie Rich character, David Aames, drives his silver porshe out into eerily deserted New York City streets. We soon find out it's a dream, which tries to clue the audience in that we're never quite sure what is real and what is fantasy. And when we are watching his real life, it is such a fantasy for your average Joe audience member to see how the other half live (a tv that collapses into the ground! A real Monet painting! More than one apartment in the same building!) In the first act, as we are introduced to the main characters, I truly did enjoy the boisterous performances from the cast. Cameron Diaz is radiant. Jason Lee is very believable as the slightly jealous but understanding best friend. Even Penelope Cruz, whose nasal semi-english speak is taxing to the ear, fits very well into the dreamer, life-loving dancer role. No one could have played David Aames like Tom Cruise. That is, the David before the accident. Diaz's stalker sex buddy just can not take not being loved anymore and crashes her car with David in it. As a result, David's pretty face is disfigured and scarred. When this is handed to Tom Cruise he seems to only know how to run with it in the straight line cliche of Angry Guy. When he goes to a club and orders a Bud and tequila shot, the bartender doesn't look David in the face. David's angry response is, look at my face, Bitch. Is it too much for Cruise to tone it down a level? A little more subtlety from his performance is not a lot to ask for. He is either cocky rich boy or angry disfigured man and no in between. Once he becomes disfiguered the film turns into the bad good movie filled with laughably bad dialogue and uncomfortably awkward scenes. Hearing Cruz's character, Sophia, blurt out, We'll be together in another life, when we are cats, caused not only me, but the whole audience to chuckle in that, What the...??..?? way. And any film that uses the all too obvious character that wears a mask (as David does at some points) is just using a cliche crutch. Watching David be analyzed by Kurt Russell's psychiatrist character is like watching a bad bad play written by a bad bad writer. Shrouded in darkness, wearing his mask, David is prodded with such in depth questions as, What is happiness to you? And I don't think we ever really find out what is happiness to his character.

THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is, thankfully, not one of those movies. I would say that it is not about the special effects or the battle scenes (which, by the way, are incredibly realistic).

This movie is totally about the friendship and comradery between the hobbits and the rest of the fellowship.

You see it when Frodo is reunited with Bilbo at the land of the Elves. And you see it at the very end of the movie, when Merry and Pippin distract the orcs and SPOILER ALERT!! get captured themselves so Frodo can escape to the other side of the river. Okay, on to the actors. I've been hearing a lot of mixed reviews of Elijah Wood and his portrayal of Frodo Baggins. I might give a biased review because I have a HUGE crush on Elijah. But I have to say that he did an AMAZING job in this movie. He really gave a stellar performance. I think he's one of the finest actors in his age group. Him and Hayden Christensen are both amazing in what they do. Here, Elijah really brought the innocence and goodness of Frodo to life. The friendship and love between him and Sam Gamgee (played with a heartbreaking tenderness by Sean Astin) is really drawn into the light. I think the best shots of the movie are when the camera is drawn into Frodo's innocent face, full of skeptiscism and worry. Everyone keeps on talking about the eyes. To me, Elijahs' eyes are a wonderful acting tool. They are so big and blue that you can almost see into his mind. Okay, I'm getting off track LOL. I'm going to talk about someone else now. I LOVED Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey. And some reviewer was wrong. They DO mention the Grey in the Prancing Pony. He really did become Gandalf in this movie. He brings out the kindness and intensity that his character should have. Billy Boyd was wonderful as the comical Pippin, and Dominic Monahagn was great as the sort of straight man Merry. But there are some points where you can see the vulnerability that Pippin and Merry both show. Right after the little accident in the Mines of Moria (when Gandalf...you know, has that fall), you see Merry crying and holding a sobbing Pippin. Someone said that you never see them serious in the whole movie. That's a pretty damn good example RIGHT THERE. Liv Tyler was an extremely good surprise. She was very good as the elven princess, I didn't think she had the acting ability.  Cate Blanchett was pretty freakin scary as Galadriel, but still, she did an amazing job. Orlando Bloom as Legolas was a great performance. I loved it when he took one of his own arrows, stabbed an orc with it, and then proceeded to take out the arrow from the orc's eye and then shoot down another orc with THE SAME ARROW. I thought that was really great!However, on to the revisions and cuts. The only time you see Glorfindel in the first book was when he takes Frodo to Rivendell after he's injured. Peter Jackson did a surprising choice when he made Arwen do it, but then again, she doesn't really have a good role in the first book, and this expands the romantic angle a little bit. I loved it at the beginning when Frodo pushes Sam into Rose's arms when he gets too shy to ask her for a dance. The rest of the journey is really a growth period for them, too. The ending when Sam almost drowns trying to reach Frodo's boat is nothing short of heartbreaking. I cried, I have to admit.All in all, a fantastic movie. I've seen it twice, and the first thought I had when the footage of Sam and Frodo trudging to Mordor faded was, When can I find the time to see this movie again?

The ending when Sam almost drowns trying to reach Frodo's boat is nothing short of heartbreaking. I cried, I have to admit.All in all, a fantastic movie. I've seen it twice, and the first thought I had when the footage of Sam and Frodo trudging to Mordor faded was, When can I find the time to see this movie again? ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"27 December 2001","score":"","review":"  Most action movies I have seen (And I've seen some doozies) will brush aside plot and emotion in favor of stupid blow-em-up scenes that have no relevance to the actual storyline. Case in point-one of the most confusing, unemotional, and HORRIBLE movies of all time, THE AVENGERS, starring Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman. But this is not a review about that. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is, thankfully, not one of those movies. I would say that it is not about the special effects or the battle scenes (which, by the way, are incredibly realistic). It is all about, in the end, friendship and sticking by the ones you care about. I walked into this movie not ever reading the novels, however I do have a lot of knowledge about the plot. I saw HARRY POTTER and thought it was really great. But that was a movie for kids. Skip the hamburgers, I wanted some steak!! I knew that this was going to be very different from HARRY POTTER because it was directed at an older audience. I was right, in a very very good way. This movie is totally about the friendship and comradery between the hobbits and the rest of the fellowship. You see it when Frodo wakes up in Rivendell and Sam is right there and Gandalf tells Frodo that Sam hasn't left his side for more than a minute or two. You see it when Frodo is reunited with Bilbo at the land of the Elves. And you see it at the very end of the movie, when Merry and Pippin distract the orcs and SPOILER ALERT!! get captured themselves so Frodo can escape to the other side of the river. Okay, on to the actors. I've been hearing a lot of mixed reviews of Elijah Wood and his portrayal of Frodo Baggins. I might give a biased review because I have a HUGE crush on Elijah. But I have to say that he did an AMAZING job in this movie. He really gave a stellar performance. I think he's one of the finest actors in his age group. Him and Hayden Christensen are both amazing in what they do. Here, Elijah really brought the innocence and goodness of Frodo to life. The friendship and love between him and Sam Gamgee (played with a heartbreaking tenderness by Sean Astin) is really drawn into the light. I think the best shots of the movie are when the camera is drawn into Frodo's innocent face, full of skeptiscism and worry. Everyone keeps on talking about the eyes. To me, Elijahs' eyes are a wonderful acting tool. They are so big and blue that you can almost see into his mind. Okay, I'm getting off track LOL. I'm going to talk about someone else now. I LOVED Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey. And some reviewer was wrong. They DO mention the Grey in the Prancing Pony. He really did become Gandalf in this movie. He brings out the kindness and intensity that his character should have. Billy Boyd was wonderful as the comical Pippin, and Dominic Monahagn was great as the sort of straight man Merry. But there are some points where you can see the vulnerability that Pippin and Merry both show. Right after the little accident in the Mines of Moria (when Gandalf...you know, has that fall), you see Merry crying and holding a sobbing Pippin. Someone said that you never see them serious in the whole movie. That's a pretty damn good example RIGHT THERE. Liv Tyler was an extremely good surprise. She was very good as the elven princess, I didn't think she had the acting ability.  Cate Blanchett was pretty freakin scary as Galadriel, but still, she did an amazing job. Orlando Bloom as Legolas was a great performance. I loved it when he took one of his own arrows, stabbed an orc with it, and then proceeded to take out the arrow from the orc's eye and then shoot down another orc with THE SAME ARROW. I thought that was really great!However, on to the revisions and cuts. The only time you see Glorfindel in the first book was when he takes Frodo to Rivendell after he's injured. Peter Jackson did a surprising choice when he made Arwen do it, but then again, she doesn't really have a good role in the first book, and this expands the romantic angle a little bit.
