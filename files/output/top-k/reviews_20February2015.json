This tradition appears to be an invention of the scriptwriters; the death penalty was abolished in Britain more than thirty years before the film was made, and I have never come across any reference to its existence before that.The film tells the story of a love affair between Leticia Musgrove, the widow of an executed murderer, and Hank Grotowski, a prison officer at the local jail. What Leticia does not realise is that Hank actually participated in her husband Lawrence's execution. Other plot lines include Leticia's attempt to bring up her son Tyrell after his father's death and Hank's complicated relationships with his son Sonny and with his own father Buck. Much of the tension in the Grotowski family arises from the fact that Sonny is himself a prison guard at the same jail and that Hank regards him as too soft to do the job. Leticia is black and Hank white, so this adds a certain racial tension to their relationship, especially as Buck is a confirmed racist and Hank seems to have inherited some of his father's attitudes. I won't set out any more of the plot, although I can say that it involves some very dark twists; Lawrence's execution is certainly not the last death. At times it almost seems too dark, as though tragedy were being piled upon tragedy.(I said that Leticia is black, but she is of course played by the mixed- race Halle Berry. Hollywood, however, has always treated mixed-race actors as black for casting purposes, hence the casting of the Scottish- Nigerian Carmen Ejogo as Coretta King in the recent Selma. I doubt if in reality Berry would have had a son who looked like Tyrell).Whether Berry deserved her Best Actress Academy Award is something I am not sure of- personally I would incline more towards Judi Dench for her role in Iris- although this is probably the best of all Berry's performances which I have seen. The one really outstanding performance, however, comes from Billy Bob Thornton as the violently conflicted Hank. The late Heath Ledger is also very good as Sonny, desperately trying to live up to his father's unrealistic expectations of him.Roger Ebert said of Monster's Ball that The movie has the complexity of great fiction and considered it the best film of 2001. Not everyone agreed with Ebert- the film was not nominated for Best Picture- but in one way he was right; I can certainly imagine a great novel being written around this story. That does not, however, necessarily mean that it is a great film. In a novel the author would have more space to do justice to all the many themes and characters which here are rather swept under the carpet. He would have had room to examine in more detail the relationship between Lawrence and Leticia, the crime for which he was sentenced and the American justice system which sentenced him. He could have paid more attention to the obviously troubled history of the Grotowski family- we learn, for instance, that Buck's wife committed suicide without learning why- and to the toxic father-son relationships between Buck and Hank and between Hank and Sonny. Sonny in particular seems a tragic, haunted figure, so it seemed a pity to me that he died early on and that his death was treated mostly as a prelude to the main event, the affair between Hank and Leticia. Trying to deal with all these matters in the scope of a normal two-hour film results in a claustrophobic, over-intense piece of hothouse film- making. Despite its shortcomings as a piece of story-telling, however, the film nevertheless gives scope for some good acting. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 February 2015","score":"","review":" The title refers to a supposed tradition in England of holding a party for a condemned murderer, the monster's ball, the night before his execution.

While I was previously familiar with the three plays on which those films were based, that wasn't the case with Much Ado About Nothing so I don't know what cuts, if any, Branagh made to the text. The play is enormous fun, extraordinarily witty and occasionally laugh out funny. However, it also features darker moments and a fascinating exploration of the nature of honour, particularly as regards Hero being publicly and, more importantly, unjustly shamed due to the machinations of Don John. As with Henry V, Kenneth Branagh excels as both an actor and a director. He is brilliant as Benedick, playing the role with an irresistible level of enthusiasm and charm. He directs the film with great style and flair and it looks absolutely beautiful as he used the gorgeous scenery of Sicily and Tuscany to its full potential. Branagh's then wife Emma Thompson is very bit his equal as Beatrice and their merry war is the best part of the film. The most important thing in a comedy based largely on wit and verbal jousting is the delivery of the lines. Branagh and Thompson deliver them as naturally as if they just entered their heads that very second. Overall, the film has a very strong supporting cast such as Richard Briers, BRIAN BLESSED, Robert Sean Leonard, Kate Beckinsale (who is wonderfully natural as Hero) and Denzel Washington (who I wouldn't have imagined as being much of a Shakespearean actor but he does very, very well as Don Pedro). It also features strong performances from actors in smaller roles such as Emma Thompson's mother Phyllida Law, Imelda Staunton, Richard Clifford and Jimmy Yuill. However, Branagh's usually superlative eye for casting let him down badly in the case of Keanu Reeves and Michael Keaton. As with Branagh and Thompson, Reeves' performance is effortlessly funny but, in his case, it wasn't meant to be. He delivers most of his lines in a monotone and just shouts the rest and not in a good, Shakespearean way. It was a bit embarrassing really. To be honest, I have never liked Reeves in any film that didn't have the words Bill & Ted in the title. Keaton is certainly better than Reeves, which admittedly isn't hard, but he was still way, way too over the top as Dogberry. His performance seemed to belong in a different film. I also don't see why either he or Branagh thought that it was a good idea for him to play the role in a bad Irish accent, which this Irishman found very irritating. I didn't smile once when Dogberry was on the screen - which I found hard to watch - while I laughed or at least grinned throughout the rest of the comedy scenes. However, it is quite funny to note that, since Christian Bale appeared in Henry V, both of Branagh's first two Shakespearean films featured Batman!Overall, this is a brilliant film which, like Henry V, demonstrates Branagh's mastery of Shakespeare but, because of Reeves and Keaton's poor performances, I can't quite give it full marks.9.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 February 2015","score":"","review":" After Laurence Olivier's versions of Henry V, Hamlet and Richard III and Kenneth Branagh's version of Henry V, this is the fifth Shakespearean film that I've watched this year.

Branagh and Thompson deliver them as naturally as if they just entered their heads that very second. Overall, the film has a very strong supporting cast such as Richard Briers, BRIAN BLESSED, Robert Sean Leonard, Kate Beckinsale (who is wonderfully natural as Hero) and Denzel Washington (who I wouldn't have imagined as being much of a Shakespearean actor but he does very, very well as Don Pedro). It also features strong performances from actors in smaller roles such as Emma Thompson's mother Phyllida Law, Imelda Staunton, Richard Clifford and Jimmy Yuill. However, Branagh's usually superlative eye for casting let him down badly in the case of Keanu Reeves and Michael Keaton. As with Branagh and Thompson, Reeves' performance is effortlessly funny but, in his case, it wasn't meant to be. He delivers most of his lines in a monotone and just shouts the rest and not in a good, Shakespearean way. It was a bit embarrassing really. To be honest, I have never liked Reeves in any film that didn't have the words Bill & Ted in the title. Keaton is certainly better than Reeves, which admittedly isn't hard, but he was still way, way too over the top as Dogberry. His performance seemed to belong in a different film. I also don't see why either he or Branagh thought that it was a good idea for him to play the role in a bad Irish accent, which this Irishman found very irritating. I didn't smile once when Dogberry was on the screen - which I found hard to watch - while I laughed or at least grinned throughout the rest of the comedy scenes. However, it is quite funny to note that, since Christian Bale appeared in Henry V, both of Branagh's first two Shakespearean films featured Batman!Overall, this is a brilliant film which, like Henry V, demonstrates Branagh's mastery of Shakespeare but, because of Reeves and Keaton's poor performances, I can't quite give it full marks.9.5\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"20 February 2015","score":"","review":" After Laurence Olivier's versions of Henry V, Hamlet and Richard III and Kenneth Branagh's version of Henry V, this is the fifth Shakespearean film that I've watched this year. While I was previously familiar with the three plays on which those films were based, that wasn't the case with Much Ado About Nothing so I don't know what cuts, if any, Branagh made to the text. The play is enormous fun, extraordinarily witty and occasionally laugh out funny. However, it also features darker moments and a fascinating exploration of the nature of honour, particularly as regards Hero being publicly and, more importantly, unjustly shamed due to the machinations of Don John. As with Henry V, Kenneth Branagh excels as both an actor and a director. He is brilliant as Benedick, playing the role with an irresistible level of enthusiasm and charm. He directs the film with great style and flair and it looks absolutely beautiful as he used the gorgeous scenery of Sicily and Tuscany to its full potential. Branagh's then wife Emma Thompson is very bit his equal as Beatrice and their merry war is the best part of the film.

Mima's fans from her pop career aren't happy about this change either, and tensions turn violently quickly. But who is committing these vicious acts?Satoshi Kon makes us question what we perceive publicly may not be what happens privately. He uses this dichotomy to criticise how people are run into the ground by the entertainment industry, privately these people are trading their dignity for fame, but to those on the outside, such as Mima's stalker, it all seems glamorous or even self- indulgent. Kon, however, doesn't just ridicule people who run the industry, but asks what type of person wants to enter this industry, and what does it take to succeed in it? And he believes it can only be the mentally unstable.This belief frames the film; Kon chooses to give the film a psychotic tone and feel, as an audience we are disconnected from it all. Kon uses editing to blur the boundaries of reality; in the scene where Mima first reads her stalkers blog, Kon jumps back and forth between the two slowly warping her stalker into Mima herself.The script also obscures the reality of the characters, if you look at that blog it does not just detail Mima's movements but her exact thoughts and feelings.

On the trail of the diabolical El Indio, a most wanted fugitive, our hero crosses paths with Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Mortimer is also after El Indio. After some manly posturing in which The Man with No Name and Mortimer shoot each other's hats the two decide to team up to go after El Indio and his gang. El Indio is currently targeting the Bank of El Paso, supposedly an impenetrable institution in which there is a safe containing almost a million dollars. The pair of bounty hunters plan to infiltrate the gang before the robbery and, if all goes according to plan, take down El Indio with ease. Of course, when does anything ever go according to plan? There will inevitably be complications. And when there are complications in a Western that can only mean one thing. Shootouts. Lots and lots of shootouts.The movie has a simple but reasonably engaging story with a few interesting characters. But the movie really fails to spark to life. The pacing is laborious, there are way too many times in this movie where absolutely nothing of any importance is happening. And even the shootouts, where you would expect the movie to shine, get dragged out to the point interest starts to wane. Once again Clint Eastwood does a fine job playing the ever-stoic Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef brings a little much-needed personality to the role of Mortimer.

Not every joke was funny, but many of them were. The movie seems perfect for a Halloween film for families, and this movie ranks up there with another 80's classic, The Goonies.

Tom Hanks is a natural actor and gifted at comedy, at least he was in the 80's. He was very good as the man who tries to stay out of trouble. Bruce Dern was absolutely fantastic as the lieutenant who knows the gadgets, but fails to use them correctly. Corey Feldman was decent as the teenage neighbor. Carrie Fisher played the typical wife who persuades her husband to stay out of trouble. Overall, The 'Burbs was an excellent movie that pokes fun at the eccentricity of suburban life. It not only succeeds at being a simple- minded comedy, but it succeeds at being a suspenseful thriller. I liked the ending as it perfectly ended the movie.

He succeeds, but what he doesn't realize is that he's created a monster. Every horror fan has to see this movie at least once. It's a bit creaky at times! New horror fans might feel bored by it, but people who appreciate genuine horror should love it. It's loaded with eerie atmosphere, making sure you never feel fully comfortable. There is always a sense of dread and misery. The black and white adds to the atmosphere. It's tragic, beautiful, even romantic. There is also some potent cruelty as well. A little girl drowns (Ouch!) that scene is powerful in many ways. The Monster didn't try to murder her, he just wanted to play. That's one of the things that makes it so heartbreaking. That's just one of the many memorable scenes. Some of the acting is uneven, but it features two legendary performances. Boris Karloff gives one of the greatest performances in the history of horror. He manages to make the monster humane, vulnerable, even sympathetic at times. That's not an easy feat! Colin Clive is just as good! Arrogance, insanity, brilliance, madness, are just some words to describe his character. We get an in-depth look into the demented mind of Henry Frankenstein. Colin manages to convey all his emotions perfectly. He becomes a damaged and reluctant hero. He may not have murdered the people, but he may as well be one. He created the monster! It was a dynamic performance. Edward Van Sloan gives a fun performance as Henry's mentor. I've always enjoyed his work. Mae Clark is plastic in her role, but much better than Valerie Hobson was in Bride of Frankenstein. This movie may seem dated these days, but it was very daring for its time.

It's about a small American town in Nebraska where the children kill all the adults and start sacrificing each other to a mysterious god (did I mention it was based on a Stephen King book?). I used to love seeing the children attacking the adults (and no, I wasn't a hooligan, by the way). Now, I just wanted to send every last one of them up to bed and take away their portable DVD players (works every time with my daughter).It's certainly not the best adaptation of a Stephen King book, but it's certainly not the worst either.

In recent Hollywood films, children have often been portrayed as the bad guys for added nastiness. Although, for example, just my making a kid's eyes glow red or have them dressed in ghostly clothes, doesn't necessarily make them scary. These kids are the real deal (and continue to freak the hell out of me without any false claws of glowing eyes whatsoever). All they needed was to be ugly enough! One has an extremely bad haircut (even for the eighties) and speaks like South Park's Eric Cartman. The other is like a young, ginger Mick Jagger. Even I would have my doubts about denying these two television privileges! Children of the Corn has sort of stood up to the test of time. If nothing else it's interesting to see Linda Hamilton in a completely different role to her most known part as Terminator's cyborg-killing Sarah Conner. I found the second half of the film more engaging than the first. My advice if you haven't seen this before and are watching it again for the nostalgia factor, know what you're getting.

These kids are the real deal (and continue to freak the hell out of me without any false claws of glowing eyes whatsoever). All they needed was to be ugly enough! One has an extremely bad haircut (even for the eighties) and speaks like South Park's Eric Cartman. The other is like a young, ginger Mick Jagger. Even I would have my doubts about denying these two television privileges! Children of the Corn has sort of stood up to the test of time. If nothing else it's interesting to see Linda Hamilton in a completely different role to her most known part as Terminator's cyborg-killing Sarah Conner. I found the second half of the film more engaging than the first. My advice if you haven't seen this before and are watching it again for the nostalgia factor, know what you're getting. It's a bit cheesy in places, but still pretty good fun for a film that takes itself very seriously.

I loved it. Now I've gone and watched it again as an adult - and with children of my own - it's a completely different experience! It's about a small American town in Nebraska where the children kill all the adults and start sacrificing each other to a mysterious god (did I mention it was based on a Stephen King book?). I used to love seeing the children attacking the adults (and no, I wasn't a hooligan, by the way). Now, I just wanted to send every last one of them up to bed and take away their portable DVD players (works every time with my daughter).It's certainly not the best adaptation of a Stephen King book, but it's certainly not the worst either. I guess there's a good half the film spent following the young couple of accidentally stumble across the deserted town, as they wander round trying to work out what we - the viewers - already know.However, what does make it pretty freaky is the lead (evil) children themselves.

Of all the Ken Russell directed movies that I have seen this is definitely the kinkiest of them all. There are dream sequences in this horror movie that border on the depraved, so much so that you wonder how it got past the censors. Maybe they had all gone out for a cup of coffee!. Like most Ken Russell films it is visually imaginative & fascinating viewing. Amanda Donahue plays a very sexy kind of Countess Dracula & she is just great fun to watch. We see her in all manner of kinky costumes & nudity. After she picks up a boy hitch-hiker she takes him to her home, baths him & then dispatches him with a love-bite. Hugh Grant plays an R.A.F. pilot neighbour who knocks on her door & is invited in. During drinks he innocently asks her if she has any children. Only when there are no men around, she answers. I think you probably get the drift of all this by now. This is definitely a weirdo movie but nonetheless interesting viewing.
