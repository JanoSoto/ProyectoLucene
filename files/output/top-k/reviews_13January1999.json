Instead of the usual over-the-top death scene, the film finds a clever, non-contrived way to end by leaving these characters at a magical moment of mutual understanding. It is one of the most powerful endings I've ever seen in a film, and believe me, I've seen thousands. What I found most remarkable about it was how the film reveals--despite the sisters' major character differences--how similar they really are. Both abandon one part of their family to sacrifice for another part--they each merely take different parts, and that's why Lee's character is not as bad, selfish or one-dimensional as she first seems. Lee's problem was understanding love. Despite all her lovers, Lee (Streep) had to learn the real meaning of love from her spinster sister Bessie (Keaton).The film is full of irony. One such moment is when Lee, rather tactlessly, says to Bessie that she finally feels as though her life has begun. To which Bessie, who is surely about to die, can only sigh. The greatest irony, of course, is that Lee finds herself at the same juncture she was 20 years prior. Will she choose to sacrifice to care for her sister, just as her sister had chosen to do with her father and aunt? Bessie, in contrast, had come to find that she hadn't thrown it all away to care for sick relatives. What first seemed a sacrifice had become transformed, through her own experience, into another valid way of experiencing life. To Lee's perspective, the elders where millstones, hindrances, inconveniences robbed of their humanity--almost the antithesis of life. Yet, behind the eccentricities of Aunt Ruth (Verdon) and other-worldly silence of her chronically ill father Marvin (Cronyn), she had found, and reveled in, their uniquness, their humanness. Making Lee's two sons very different also added complexity and depth to the film. It's obvious that Hank (DiCaprio) is his mother's son, it's just that his mother doesn't realize it. Hank too is at a crucial moment of choice Will he abandon his selfishness, or will he abandon his familial and moral obligation to help Bessie? And what accounts for the polar opposite behavior of the younger son Charlie (Scardino)? The movie doesn't give an answer. Genetics, environment, relationships and all the other things that make us who we are are complex things. The scriptwriter is smart enough to realize that. Touches of humor keep this from becoming an oppressive Bergmanesque angst-fest, and its patient character development steers it out of obvious soapy (ie. Terms of Endearment) territory. Although the thing has a sort of TV-movie aesthetic in the staging and the scoring, the writing and acting are everything you'd want. Beautiful.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"13 January 1999","score":"","review":"  One of the best action thrillers of the year, with an all-star cast is director Tony Scott's paranoia flick, Enemy of the State.  Many other movies have tried to win over the audience with stories of paranoia and government corruption.  However, this movie is in a class all by itself for its vivid portrayal of how far the government will go to cover-up deceit and corruption. Before the audience even has a chance to read the opening credits, a heinous murder of an innocent elderly man takes place.  True to Hollywood thrillers, the left-over evidence, the man's car is driven into a lake to discard the evidence.  The elderly man (played by reknowned actor Jason Robards) is killed, not because of what he knows but because of what he should not know.  Nonetheless, a bird watcher doing some serious bird watching catches the entire footage of the murder on video.  While the bird watcher copies the tape for his pal; the feds, led by Thomas Brian Reynolds (Jon Voight, perfectly cast as a bad guy) are hot on his trail.  And I mean HOT!  The modern technology that is available on the streets, and to the government is so advanced that just when the audience gets used to seeing one gimmick, another gimmick is introduced.  The bird watcher, a young guy in his 20's, is chased by the feds all the way from his apartment into the city of Baltimore until he runs into his old Georgetown buddy, a prominent lawyer named Robert Clayton Dean (played by the always likeable Will Smith). Dean is in the lingerie store shopping for a present for his wife, a fellow lawyer named Carla (Regina King).  Unbeknownst to Dean, the bird watcher drops the original video footage into Dean's shopping bag, and the chilling begins.  The bird watcher continues running until he is hit and killed on the freeway by a truck.  And thus, the action begins.  With all of the modern technology available, the feds, led by Reynolds begin destroying the almost-perfect life around Dean in order to make him turn over the goods. His entire life begins to fall apart as he desperately tries to save his marriage, destroyed because of his former girlfriend\/business associate Rachel Banks (Lisa Bonet).  Not only that but his bosses, the Mafia, newspapers, and the feds take turns wreaking havoc on him for various reasons.  When asked by his law firm bosses about his extramarital affair with Rachel, he shoots back and asks one of them if they have ever cross-dressed.  When that boss goes to protest, he interrupts, and says,  Yeah, none of your (expletive) business. Yes, Robert Claton Dean is flawed, but he is human. The events taking place in this movie, and the amount of control that the government has over the American public is scary.  The government, at least in this movie, feels that they have the right to go snooping wherever they want to, however they want to, whenever they want to. On privacy, Voight's character says, Privacy's been dead for 30 years because we can't risk it.  The only privacy left is inside of your head. The real thrill of the movie is in the chase.  First, he has to find out why the government is after him.  Then he had to figure out who set him up, why and how can he get his life back, if at all possible.  Dean makes a very wise move by enlisting the help of Brill.  There are two Brills', one played by Gabriel Byrne, and the other played by two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman.  I won't tell you who the real Brill is because then that would give away too much of the movie.  Brill is an ex-military specialist\/agent who paranoia leads him to turn an old, abandoned warehouse into a state-of-the-art security fortress.  The ending was super clever, but almost up until the last minute, no one could guess what would happen.  Paranoia and the loss of privacy may be the main central themes in this movie, but the action and suspense far outweigh them.  This is definitely Will Smith's best role yet, and the movie made me a huge fan of the real Brill.  Enemy of the State is one of those rare movies that thrills, chills, and delivers the goods to the audience.  It was worth every penny, and I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes thrillers, and everyone else looking to see a good movie.  Don't be the last one to see this great movie!
