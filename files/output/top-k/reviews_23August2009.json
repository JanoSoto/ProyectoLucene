[{"date":"23 August 2009","score":"","review":" London is terrorized by a Jack the Ripper copycat calling himself The Avenger. In the opening scream, he claims a seventh victim. While the Ripper preferred prostitutes, the Avenger digs blondes. Each victim has been a fair-haired lass. Naturally, the sale of British peroxide plummets... Lead policeman on the case is Malcolm Keen (as Joe Chandler). He also likes blondes, especially golden-curled heroine, and Avenger-bait, June Tripp (as Daisy Bunting). Mr. Keen gets stiff competition from tall, dark, and handsome Ivor Novello (as Jonathan Drew), who arrives on the scene as The Lodger at the home of Marie Ault and Arthur Chesney (as Mr. and Mrs. Bunting). Suspicion begins to fall upon Mr. Novello, who also has a thing for blondes. Could he be The Avenger? The Lodger (subtitled A Story of the London Fog) helped put director Alfred Hitchcock on the map, in Great Britain. It showcases Mr. Hitchcock's great visual storytelling style. The most commented-on example is the shot of The Lodger walking in his upstairs room, as seen from the point-of-view of the downstairs Buntings. Hitchcock had a glass ceiling constructed, for Novello to walk across. The director explained this was a way to show footsteps visually. Other filmmakers would have added the Footsteps! to a title card or sound effects track. The director issued some minor complaints about changing to film's ending to suit Novello's star status, but it gave him one of his most enduring film themes, the wronged man. The Lodger was a very influential film, especially on its own director.******** The Lodger (2\/14\/27) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Ivor Novello, June Tripp, Malcolm Keen, Marie Ault ","genre":null},{"date":"23 August 2009","score":"","review":" London is terrorized by a Jack the Ripper copycat calling himself The Avenger.

It has just the right mix of action and dialogue and if the light dims a little during the scenes without the Burtons, certainly Michael Hordern keeps his brightly lit. Michael York and Natasha Pyne are inexplicably weak after their brilliant early moments. But maybe it just is that the two main performances are so captivating, we really only wish to see them. Some find fault with the acting of Elizabeth Taylor but I'll hear none of it. Her early scenes of wild madness are fantastic as are her slightly less confident scenes as she finds herself the object of the chase. The scene I remember most from my original 60s cinema viewing is that of the pair wrestling on the bed of feathers having fallen through the roof. Watching this again at a BFI South Bank, London screening in a packed audience I can surely see why. Pure electricity as the snarling\/alluring, struggling yet desiring 'shrew' begins to succumb to the power of the male above her. Great moments, great music, excellent sets and a tremendous if controversial final speech.
