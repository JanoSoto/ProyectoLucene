The whole plot line and the way it was directed made this movie what it is. I loved it. This movie has a lot of different twists and turns to it as well so you really have to pay attention to what is happening other wise you will get lost and have to watch it all over again, but believe me you wont regret it. This movie has a near perfect view on modern society and Tyler Durden is the voice of revolution. It sparked my interest in questioning the way the world is and looking at everything different.

Evidently, a scientist, Kris, is sent to a remote space station orbiting a distant planet to find out what's going on. One of the three or four crew has committed suicide.Kris finds the remaining scientists a diverse lot. They're hospitable enough, showing him around the spacious circular craft and telling him he can choose any room he likes. But Kris notices a few strange things. There seem to be others wandering around. A young child (or maybe a midget) appears briefly, a scientist sweeps the kid up in his arms and runs off with him. Kris catches wispy glimpses of a young girl from a distance. When he asks about these figures, the others tell him to mind his own business, except for the leader of the crew, Snaut, who answers with philosophical non-answers about what constitutes happiness and what man's fate is and other heady subjects.It gets headier. Kris falls asleep in his bed and a girl appears, Hari, with whom he once consorted but left, not loving her, until years later when he realized he did. But by then she had committed suicide.Now here she is again. Apparently alive if not exactly vibrant. Finally the other scientists spill the beans. They've bombarded the ocean below with heavy radiation, and the ocean seems to have responded by redintegrating figures from the crew's past -- a child, a young girl, and now Hari.The problem is that the guests are just that -- materialized figures drawn from memory. They're described as made not of atoms but neutrinos. Masses of jelly, one of the more cynical scientist calls them. And they're incomplete. They retain only flashbulb memories of their own past. And you can't get rid of them because, sooner or later, you must sleep and dream, and they return. Kris, for instance, sends one off into space in a rocket. No dice. Next time he nods out, Hari reappears.The headiness persists. Obviously, the movie is either profound -- deeply profound -- or just thrown together in a slapdash manner to make it seem provocative. The sound track sometimes comes up with an ominous hum, at other time an organ piece that sounds like Bach with a hangover. There are quotes from Cervantes and Tolstoy. Ultimately, Kris is faced with the choice of either staying aboard with his passionate but insubstantial neutrino wreaths or returning to reality on earth. He chooses the latter and the final scene was so unexpected, so much a non sequitur, that it left me wondering if my brain had turned into a jellied mass of neutrinos.It's all very melancholy. Kris never laughs, never even smiles, nor does Hari or anyone else, except for one or two puzzling cackles from a drunken man. I'm going to assume that instead of being meaningless it's chock full of ideas, though I may have caught less than half of them. It's long and it's slow but it's not simple minded. Cf., the Twilight Zone episode called The Lonely, in which an exiled convict is given a very humanoid female robot for company and simply falls in love with her. Kris's attitude towards his robot is far less ordinary. And then thee are questions about the frontiers of science. Should we really try to change something we know little about? We're currently exterminating previously unknown species of primates in the Amazon rain forest. Primates -- that's us. Well -- judge for yourself.

The movie is very, very well made, and very, very entertaining, and could have been as perfect an action story as Rocky was a people story. John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone) is a US Army Green Beret returning home from Vietnam after the horrors he had experienced, only to find that he is hated by the country and that his friends are dead. He finds a small town where he hopes to find something to eat, but the Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) denies him this privilege, as he believes that Rambo is a white trash drifter. When Rambo tries to come into town anyway, he is taken into custody, and Teasle tortures him. Rambo escapes, and goes into the mountain forests near the town, trying to merely get away from the police, but in the process starting a war of one man vs. an entire police force. This premise is an excellent one. We all like to see one man go up against an entire force (another example of this would be the James Bond films), and the way it is carried out here is even more fascinating. A police force is trying to capture Rambo, and yet he is a Green Beret, one of the toughest groups in the US military. The movie is filled with thrilling situations and action sequences. The action sequences are all real, with real stunts using both men and cars, real truck chases, real explosions. There's a scene with Rambo hanging onto a cliff face with a man in a helicopter shooting at him. Stunts like this are amazing, and they are enhanced by the wonderful score and beautiful locations. Sylvester Stallone is perfect as Rambo. He will not be messed with, knows how to survive, and takes action when he has to. But he is also reckless and at times vengeful. A lot of this comes from his suffering. After his horrible experiences in Vietnam, he is prone to violence, and distraught that his work is unappreciated by the country. At the end of the film, he finally breaks down, sick of all his misery. Stallone is backed up by Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna, who both give excellent performances. The climax, however, is a shame. It's not terrible by any means, and Rambo's speech at the end is powerful, but it's still very anti- climactic and undramatic. Things just happen, with no dramatic quality to them. It's a shame, but it's still a model action movie.

That made no sense to little old me, since I couldn't imagine why anyone would attempt to fight an alligator (I later found out that people DO in fact fight alligators, but I'm not going to try that).Anyway, the scenes that registered in my mind were the boy looks for his brother and gets scared when someone jumps out of the tree; the boy returns home and finds a different family there; the boy hides in the machine to board the alien ship; the boy says I promise and the voice says Don't know promise; the boy calls the voice a geek; the voice says You called me a geek!; the boy wakes up again in the forest. Overall, I found it as entertaining as a six-year-old would find it.I later learned that the movie's title was Flight of the Navigator. Now that I'm an adult, I've now seen it again. I found it to be one fun movie, the sort of thing that anyone would love to experience. Obviously I now recognize a young Sarah Jessica Parker. If the director's name rings a bell, it's because he also directed Grease. I picture Randal Kleiser telling everyone Respect the people playing the parents. Remember, the dad was in a band that performed with The Doors, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, and the mom worked with Alfred Hitchcock.* Anyway, a really enjoyable movie. You're sure to love it.*Cliff DeYoung was a member of the '60s group Clear Light, which performed with the aforementioned people. Veronica Cartwright played Rod Taylor's niece in The Birds.

Rewatching it recently, the film really is a good solid adaptation of one of Stephen King's lesser-known works.Like the novel, the film is short and punchy with a good pace. No part of it drags and the growing (or reducing in Billy Halleck's case, played perfectly by Robert John Burke best known for his Robocop role) of the gypsy's curses on the men involved in 'stepping around' the death of Tadzu Lempke's (Michael Constantine in a fine role) daughter. Tadzu is the chief of the gypsy troupe and is 106-years old ... a much younger but very experienced Constantine does a great job with this role and the make-up work for him was perfect as it was for Burke's character who goes from a huge man, nearer 400 pounds than not, to a literal shadow of himself late in the film.Each of the three men (the judge and the police chief along with Halleck) involved in the 'stepping around' of Halleck running down Tadzu's daughter has their own unique curse and each is done up proper in make-up that doesn't for a moment look fake or half-assed. The heavyweight version of the make-up for Burke is excellent and just as effective as the sagging skin left after the curse has nearly run its course.Lucinda Jenney plays Billy Halleck's wife, Heidi, and does so, in the beginning, with that sparkling peppiness she carries off so well. She is an underrated actress imho and gives a first-rate performance here going from a peppy and supportive wife trying to help her grotesquely huge husband to a deceitful adulteress who, along with her lover's help, tries to have her husband committed when he hits the road to try and find the gypsies to have the curse removed.Even with the good pacing of the first half of the movie, it really picks up steam once 'the white man from town' finds the gypsies and has a rather unpleasant encounter with the group. This results in his calling in a 'marker' he has with a mafia-connected client -- Richie The Hammer Ginelli, played with great delight by Joe Mantegna. Mantegna just makes you smile and even laugh out loud as he sinks his teeth into the role. He is perhaps the best 'mob actor' around imho. When Halleck calls The Hammer asking for help and saying he needs a doctor, Richie replies he'll have someone there by morning ... not exactly a doctor but close. You just have to laugh with the thought and his delivery of the line.That just starts the ball rolling and it really picks up speed as the movie shoots straight on target to its climax. It isn't disappointing either and stays faithful to the King book and ending. And, if I may say so, this is one of King's best endings.This is a film that you could watch with your junior high kids these days I imagine. It is suspenseful but not overly gruesome -- not a slasher film but some brief moments of gore (a large ball bearing shot thru the palm of a hand and a very unique pie that will have you skipping desert for a week are the two most gruesome parts and they would really only rank a one or two on a scale of ten when considering the most gruesome films around today).Oh and watch for Stephen King himself as the pharmacist in the first part of the film. Also this was filmed in Camden, Maine, and it shows ... the region just has a special look to it that is special and the Irving gas station is a dead giveaway for the northeast USA and southeast Canada for starters ) Give it a watch and a fair chance and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.He was a mook but he was MY mook. -- just one LOL line from The Hammer. )take care, cormac_zoso ","genre":null},{"date":"11 January 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" **SPOILERS AHEAD -- BEWARE -- SPOILERS ALERT** This film is much better than the 5.6 rating it has on this site.

Yet this movie is great for several reasons.To begin with, the film's set up is brilliant. Imagine a police officer forced to defend a police precinct against dozens of hoodlums with the help of a secretary, who has no training firing a gun; a mass murderer, who he cannot fully trust; and another convict. That in a nutshell is the set up for this picture. Moreover, Carpenter makes this film work, because he plays the plot for all its worth by exploring how these complex relationships between the police office, the mass murderer, the secretary, and the convict all play out as the precinct comes under heavy fire and glass windows break everywhere.The second reason is the characters. One sign of a great film is when you already care about the protagonists within the first 10 minutes and are willing to stick with them all through this film. Assault on Precinct 13 achieves that very effect first by introducing us to a likable cop Ethan Bishop (played with a subtle effectiveness by Austin Stoker). Then we witness two other great performances. The first is Laurie Zimmer's quiet, but brilliant, portrayal of the secretary at Precinct 13, Leigh, who can convey emotional states on screen without even speaking. Then comes a mass murderer Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston) who is first chained up in the cell of Precinct 13 and then unexpectedly strikes up a friendship with Ethan Bishop and establishes a fascinating chemistry with Leigh which hints at becoming a romance. Joston and Zimmer's interactions on screen are one of the highlights of this entire film. What they do not communicate with words, they convey with complex body language and glances pregnant with deep meaning. There is so much chemistry between these two characters, even though they also have the defend the Precinct against an assault by some very scary hoodlums, that they despair over never seeing each other again.A second reason why this movie is so entertaining is because John Carpenter has accomplished something very rare in the movies he has made the terrain in which the story unfolds into a character. The terrain is the forbidden, run-down, and striking empty Los Angeles suburb of Anderson, which frankly looks like a ghost town most of the time. Combined with this effect, Carpenter also creates an aura of mystery around the villains who launch their attack on the police precinct 13. True, we see the faces of a few hoodlums at the beginning and middle of the film. They could be the leaders of their gang, but we have no idea because they remain stone silent for the entire picture. Yet more often, I noticed how John Carpenter concealed the faces of the attackers. They were either film from a distance behind trees and in darkness. Or they were film at the point of being shot, with the result that they either concealed their faces in pain or fell from the windows before we got a good look at them. At one point, the gang even cleans up all the bodies with the result that we never get to study the faces of the dead. This aura of mystery that is built around the antagonists is deliberate. Human beings have always been afraid most of the unknown, largely because their imaginations are capable of conjuring up greater terrors than those which exist in reality. The Disney film Bambi (1942) recognized this human trait, which was why the identity of the hunters (including the one killing Bambi's mother) was kept secret. John Carpenter also wants to play on our imaginations so that we end up conjuring up in our own minds the terrors that plague Precinct 13 -- and he does a very good job at achieving this result.

To make matters worse she has had his child! omg!! now Chuck is seriously annoyed and you better bet your ass he's gonna KILL EVERYONE!!.So as you might expect this film plays out pretty much like the original and sees Chuck going back into the jungles of Nam to kick ass.

To add spice to this adventure old Chuck most endure the sight of his wife getting executed by the evil Vietnamese General not too soon after his initial rescue attempt. Holy wonton soup General! now you've REALLY done it! Chuck's gonna bite your nuts off whilst using polite profanity.Its probably the best of the trilogy for me because its just that bit grander yet still maintains those glorious 80's visuals and vibes that really set the stage for a retro offensive. Chuck is the epitome of the one man army, he parachutes into Nam with his own personal speed boat loaded with gear, treks through the jungle unaided and taking no malaria tablets, finds the enemy base, crashes it, saves his wife and child and then promptly gets caught. But fear not! Chuck escapes after some mild torture, gets his MASSIVE assault rifle, heads back to the enemy base, saves a whole tonne of other kids recently imprisoned and coolly dispatched all the bad guys in a super-duper array of slow motion bullet hits and explosions.Its a serious film but at the same time its also a cheesy action flick. I could mention many things such as the fact none of the kids get injured at all during the main escape despite bullets, shrapnel and debris raining down on them constantly, but I won't. Of course, as you may expect, this being a Chuck flick there must be some douche bag US officials trying to stop his mission for political reasons so he can come across all rebellious and righteous.

This time he's found out (conveniently by some creepy reverend who just happens to be in the US from Nam for what seems like five minutes) that his wife is still alive and well (sorta) back in Nam. Old Chuck thought she had died during the fall of Saigon. To make matters worse she has had his child! omg!! now Chuck is seriously annoyed and you better bet your ass he's gonna KILL EVERYONE!!.So as you might expect this film plays out pretty much like the original and sees Chuck going back into the jungles of Nam to kick ass. Of course, as you might expect, this being the third film its bigger, louder, a bit more impressive with stunts and explosions and ever so slightly more bloody...but not much, oh and Chuck still won't swear. To add spice to this adventure old Chuck most endure the sight of his wife getting executed by the evil Vietnamese General not too soon after his initial rescue attempt. Holy wonton soup General! now you've REALLY done it! Chuck's gonna bite your nuts off whilst using polite profanity.Its probably the best of the trilogy for me because its just that bit grander yet still maintains those glorious 80's visuals and vibes that really set the stage for a retro offensive. Chuck is the epitome of the one man army, he parachutes into Nam with his own personal speed boat loaded with gear, treks through the jungle unaided and taking no malaria tablets, finds the enemy base, crashes it, saves his wife and child and then promptly gets caught. But fear not! Chuck escapes after some mild torture, gets his MASSIVE assault rifle, heads back to the enemy base, saves a whole tonne of other kids recently imprisoned and coolly dispatched all the bad guys in a super-duper array of slow motion bullet hits and explosions.Its a serious film but at the same time its also a cheesy action flick. I could mention many things such as the fact none of the kids get injured at all during the main escape despite bullets, shrapnel and debris raining down on them constantly, but I won't. Of course, as you may expect, this being a Chuck flick there must be some douche bag US officials trying to stop his mission for political reasons so he can come across all rebellious and righteous.

The sequel tries to repeat the success but Irvin Kershner is unable to match Verhoeven's skills.The Detroit of the future is a cesspool of crime, delinquency, poverty and urban decay. The city is broke and OCP are planning to take over the government, the police are on strike because of wage and pension cuts and a new powerful drug known as Nuke is on the streets, controlled by a cult leader, Cain (Tom Noonan). Only Robocop (Paul Weller) is able to hold the peace, but a scientist at OCP, Dr. Faxx (Belinda Bauer) sees Robocop as being obsolete and wants him replaced by Robocop II, but sees the best candidates to be psychopaths.The filmmakers of Robocop 2 wanted to recapture the satirical and comic elements of the first film, even using the news reports and fake adverts but it felt like the heart or belief behind the ideals like Verhoeven had. It was more shoehorned into the film then actually trying to saying anything about society of the time. There are also attempts at satire when a PR team think how best to reprogram Robocop, making a overly cheery creation who is unable to do any crime fighting because of the conflicting directives. These plot points about the effects about designing by committee lasts five minutes and does not have any overall bearing on the plot. It could have been cut and they would no effect on the plot.A random scene that also felt like it wanted to be darkly comic but out of place and misjudged was when a little league team are robbing a shop, which is done for comic value. It was just a strange way to try and show how awful and crime infested this world.Kershner is best known for being the director of Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back and he brought a darker tone. The best elements of Robocop 2 is the darker parts of the film, showing the crime work with people stealing and killing each other and the constantly drug dealing and drug use. It does have A Clockwork Orange esque feeling to it as a society on the edge of collapse.One of the most controversial elements is the character Hob (Gabriel Damon), a 12-year-old boy who is a psychopathic killer. The idea of him was sound, that this is an amoral, poverty stricken world that even forces children and teenagers into criminality and violence with Hob being killer or a drug runner for Cain. But he becomes the leader of the gang, when it would been more believable if Hob was a member of a street gang or offer Robocop a challenge because he was a killer but a child so cannot do much about him. Another story problem is the willingness of some characters to go to psychopaths and death row inmates instead of more logically options likes special forces soldiers.The action was very well done and perfectly bloody and violence. There is some excellent use of slow motion animation and special effects it was detailed and Robocop was given a big challenge in the form of RoboCain, a crazed, powerful robot with weapons and a willingness to cause carnage. Noonan did make an excellent villain throughout the film.Robocop 2 is watchable with its violence and action, but it no way near matching the original film and needed a tidy, more thought-out screenplay.

Hardly the kind of thing you'd expect to see Judge Reinhold and Fred Savage in. This overlooked flick came out a few months before 'Big' but failed to do as well unsurprisingly.One high flying business man and neglectful father swaps places with his very small bullied son. From there on the little boy must try and hold his fathers job together while the dad must battle the daily grind of school. At the same time a couple of baddies are also after the precious object that causes all the commotion. Its easy to grasp, predictable and cheesy but its a fun little jaunt.It always bothered me that they went to the trouble of having both characters actually change shape, shrink n grow, to make you believe that each of them transformed into the other. Wouldn't it have been easier just for them to swaps minds? why did they have to virtually mutate into each others body shape?. You don't see that of course, its only implied by camera angles and the simple raising and lowering of the floor beneath them haha but it just seemed pointless to me.The other thing I could never work out was this department store in Chicago. Obviously its suppose to be a very prestigious store for wealthy buyers but would it really have such lavish office levels above the store?. I don't know maybe in the US this is how big stores work, maybe here in the UK too in say...Harrods, but it felt so odd. All these snivelling ass kissing suits following the big director around their plush offices, the whole entourage of hierarchy that seems to run the store like the third Reich putting the fear of God into the employees. It is of course so very 80's with the power suits, an all white pompous set of staff and stereotypical male chauvinistic behaviour (bit like 'Trading Places'), but I did like that angle, its so damn retro.This is one of those comedies that is suppose to be for kids but its actually quite grown up really, a perfect 80's comedy then. Many scenes contain Savage swearing, drinking and talking to adults as if he was one himself. That is the whole point sure but you know in this day and age it would be so watered down and childish, this is a touch edgy at times and its brilliant. Gotta be honest this is probably Savage's best major film too, he really does perform well as an adult I must say, Reinhold also kills it as a big child (he's perfectly cast with his looks), both have lots of cute little moments which will make you laugh.You can see the how the finale will unfold a mile off but its still good goofy fun as the two bad guys get their obvious comeuppance. Its not a 'Pink Panther' type of tomfoolery don't worry, its a very tolerable silliness that is somewhat believable, there are no real big stunts or action sequences in this. I loved the performances from everyone in this, quick nod to the trio of brown nosing office boy yes men who all came across as 'Waldorf and Statler-like' live action Muppets, Richard Kind being one. Totally underrated in this reviewers opinion and well worth the watch if you enjoy really dated 80's flicks, good Xmas time flick too.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 January 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Strange to think this little forgotten 80's comedy is actually an adaptation of a late 18th Century novel.

Over the past 20 years, starting in the 90's, video-games have become increasingly elaborate, cinematic and sophisticated in terms of storytelling, often delving into deep plots and rich character development that rivals the best in Hollywood filmmaking. Especially in recent years, with the release of games like Uncharted, Heavy Rain and many others, which feel more akin to interactive films than they do like old-school video-games.Yet, Hollywood has yet to figure out how to properly release a video-game adaptation. Starting with the abysmal 90's adaptation of Super Mario Bros., the studio system has displayed once major flaw over and over again that has plagued every video-game adaptation since Studios do not understand, nor do they make any effort to understand, video-games and gaming culture.Studios (and many modern producers, directors and writers) seem stuck in a very 80's mindset that games are merely mindless entertainment without stories, and\/or can somehow be made better by violently altering the source material's stories and characters. And thus so many video-game to film adaptations are released that bear little-to-no resemblance to their source material. Yes, almost every single video-game film has relied on making radical and unneeded changes to their source material, under the delusion that they need to change things to make it work. To date, there have been virtually no video-game movies that have actually resembled the original games.And Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil is definitely a major offender in this respect. Yes, it is a film that almost exclusively alters, disregards and even disrespects its source material, turning the original slow-moving and deliberate Romero-esque video game into a goofy, pseudo-James Cameron-inspired action extravaganza.But you know what? Looking past how much it disrespects the original Resident Evil game franchise... it's actually not too terrible a film. Oh, it's bad. Pretty darned bad. But it's also wildly entertaining, and is clearly full of the rampant eye-candy that Director Anderson relishes in. And in terms of sheer, unadulterated entertainment value... you could do much worse.We follow Alice (Milla Jovovich), an amnesiac woman who awakens in a seemingly deserted mansion. After encounter another survivor (Eric Mabius) and a group of commandos (including Michelle Rodriguez), she is whisked away into The Hive, a technologically advanced underground compound below the mansion, run by the Umbrella Corporation. Alice, Matt and the commandos are forced to investigate the complex, in order to figure out why it was sealed off, and survive when they realize researchers and scientists of The Hive have become ravenous, zombie-like creatures.The acting isn't too shabby. Jovovich is a lot of fun in the role, underwritten though it may be. Mabius does come off a tad boring, though. And Rodriguez, who I've actually quite admired in some films as a touch-yet-sexy chick, is pretty good in her role.The production is also pretty decent. If there's one thing writer\/director Anderson knows, it's how to make pretty pictures on screen. The production design is convincing enough, giving us sleek quasi-futuristic designs, and the production design does lend to some cool action sequences and even a couple of reasonably intense horror segments. I did find some of Anderson's choice in shots and compositions to be over-done at times, though.Unfortunately, the writing is pretty dreadful. Ignoring the fact that it essentially disregards the original video game (save for a few character names and passing references), it's way too fast, and the dialog is very wonky.But still, this is one of those movies where you care more about the images than the written words. As mentioned above, Anderson is a king at making pretty pictures, and here, asides from his more over- the-top visuals, he delivers on some great action beats and decent sequences of suspense. So I can't say the film is a total loss just because the script kinda sucked. Anderson seemed to have the mindset that he wanted to make a fun action-horror movie. And I think that's pretty much what this film is. It's criminally stupid at times. It's under-written. But there's enough guns, gore and even some exploit-o-riffic nudity in a few sequences, so I'd say audiences looking for a good time should get what they're pay for. I like it as dumb fun as a 25-year-old male, as do my college-aged friends and even my 50-something-year-old mom. So that should tell you that it's worth checking out once for sheer dumb- fun.I give it a 6 out of 10, just for entertainment value. However, if you are looking for a film that is very well-made or true to the video-game source material, you will be very disappointed.

Over the past 20 years, starting in the 90's, video-games have become increasingly elaborate, cinematic and sophisticated in terms of storytelling, often delving into deep plots and rich character development that rivals the best in Hollywood filmmaking. Especially in recent years, with the release of games like Uncharted, Heavy Rain and many others, which feel more akin to interactive films than they do like old-school video-games.Yet, Hollywood has yet to figure out how to properly release a video-game adaptation. Starting with the abysmal 90's adaptation of Super Mario Bros., the studio system has displayed once major flaw over and over again that has plagued every video-game adaptation since Studios do not understand, nor do they make any effort to understand, video-games and gaming culture.Studios (and many modern producers, directors and writers) seem stuck in a very 80's mindset that games are merely mindless entertainment without stories, and\/or can somehow be made better by violently altering the source material's stories and characters. And thus so many video-game to film adaptations are released that bear little-to-no resemblance to their source material. Yes, almost every single video-game film has relied on making radical and unneeded changes to their source material, under the delusion that they need to change things to make it work. To date, there have been virtually no video-game movies that have actually resembled the original games.And Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil is definitely a major offender in this respect. Yes, it is a film that almost exclusively alters, disregards and even disrespects its source material, turning the original slow-moving and deliberate Romero-esque video game into a goofy, pseudo-James Cameron-inspired action extravaganza.But you know what? Looking past how much it disrespects the original Resident Evil game franchise... it's actually not too terrible a film. Oh, it's bad. Pretty darned bad. But it's also wildly entertaining, and is clearly full of the rampant eye-candy that Director Anderson relishes in. And in terms of sheer, unadulterated entertainment value... you could do much worse.We follow Alice (Milla Jovovich), an amnesiac woman who awakens in a seemingly deserted mansion. After encounter another survivor (Eric Mabius) and a group of commandos (including Michelle Rodriguez), she is whisked away into The Hive, a technologically advanced underground compound below the mansion, run by the Umbrella Corporation. Alice, Matt and the commandos are forced to investigate the complex, in order to figure out why it was sealed off, and survive when they realize researchers and scientists of The Hive have become ravenous, zombie-like creatures.The acting isn't too shabby. Jovovich is a lot of fun in the role, underwritten though it may be. Mabius does come off a tad boring, though. And Rodriguez, who I've actually quite admired in some films as a touch-yet-sexy chick, is pretty good in her role.The production is also pretty decent. If there's one thing writer\/director Anderson knows, it's how to make pretty pictures on screen. The production design is convincing enough, giving us sleek quasi-futuristic designs, and the production design does lend to some cool action sequences and even a couple of reasonably intense horror segments. I did find some of Anderson's choice in shots and compositions to be over-done at times, though.Unfortunately, the writing is pretty dreadful. Ignoring the fact that it essentially disregards the original video game (save for a few character names and passing references), it's way too fast, and the dialog is very wonky.But still, this is one of those movies where you care more about the images than the written words. As mentioned above, Anderson is a king at making pretty pictures, and here, asides from his more over- the-top visuals, he delivers on some great action beats and decent sequences of suspense. So I can't say the film is a total loss just because the script kinda sucked. Anderson seemed to have the mindset that he wanted to make a fun action-horror movie. And I think that's pretty much what this film is. It's criminally stupid at times. It's under-written. But there's enough guns, gore and even some exploit-o-riffic nudity in a few sequences, so I'd say audiences looking for a good time should get what they're pay for.

The film was based on the best-selling novel of the same name by author Margaret Mitchell, and had the backdrop of the civil war between the North and the South of the United States, which has also been called the war of secession. It charmed generations, and is considered the most beloved and unforgettable movie of all time, and the most watched, because it can reunite the elements that hold the viewer's attention. Filmed in color with the new technology Technicolor and Cinemascope, the movie was released in 1939, presenting a dramatic storyline, a strong soundtrack and the magnificent performance of Vivien Leigh for the character Scarlett, that led her to win an Oscar for the best actress in that year. Gone with the wind was also nominated to other Oscar categories, won eight and, outside of the traditional nominations, won two other special ones (an honorarium and an other technical). I still remember the time when I was a teenager; I had not completed my 13 years yet when I watched this movie for the first time. It was love at first sight, because I enjoyed everything, especially the charisma of the character Scarlett O'Hara, who even in the face of adversity has never been shattered by something or someone. My attachment to this film was so great that after having watched it for more than five times, I decided to even read the book, which I thought was wonderful. It is a volume with more than 1000 pages. The movie starts in the year 1861, where in front of the spectator opens the scenario of a lush southern farm cotton plantation in the State of Georgia named Tara, where the protagonist Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), a spoiled and willful young woman receives the news that Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a man who was bored with his life, will marry his cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia Havilland). Scarlett is in love with Ashley, and decides to confess her love for him at a barbecue offered by Ashley's parents, at Twelve Oaks. There Scarlett meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), who was hiding in the library at the time of her revelation. Rhett was known as a good living and seductive man. He was enchanted by Scarlett and he promised to keep her secret. At a given time one hears the news that the war has been proclaimed. Scarlett, in order to hurt and to be close to Ashley, accepts to marry Charles Hamilton (Rand Brooks), brother of Melanie. Charles, with typhus, died in battle and Scarlett became a widow. The war continues and Atlanta is under siege. Scarlett decides to run away toward Tara, helped by Rhett. There she faces many adversities and she makes an oath God is my witness. God is my witness they're not going to beat me. I'm going to live through this and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again. Neither I nor anyone in my family. Even if I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill, God is my witness that I'll never be hungry again. Again in trouble, Scarlett creates situations and uses trickery to achieve her goals. The film ending is surprising to everyone, because Scarlett discovers something she herself did not know. This movie shows Scarlett's determination depicting a woman ahead of her time.

It depicts a pivotal experience that helped shape Hemingway into the writer now hailed as the greatest of his generation.Ernest Hemingway, played by Chris O'Donnell, is a volunteer ambulance driver with the Italian Army facing the Austrians in Northern Italy during WW1. When he is badly wounded, he is sent to an American hospital in Milan. It is here that he meets Agnes von Kurowsky &#x96; an American nurse with a Teutonic name. Before long, he is hopelessly in love with her. He is ardent but she is less so, although he slowly wears her down. They have an affair and Hemingway expects to marry her when they return to America.Although Hemingway goes home, Agnes stays, eventually informing Ernest that they are finished romantically. Hemingway is crushed and embittered, so much so, that when Agnes comes to see him back in America, he drives her away although she professes her love for him.The last scene in the movie is a powerful one, although, as a number of reviewers have noted, it didn't happen; Ernest never saw Agnes again after he left Italy, but he certainly was crushed and embittered.Some researchers claim their affair was never consummated. Agnes said as much in a letter to one of the co-authors of the book upon which In Love and War is based when she stated, I wasn't that kind of girl. However, other witnesses claim that it was an affair in every sense of the word. Whatever the depth of the affair, I can't help feeling that the filmmakers should have found a way to end it the way it really happened &#x96; but I guess the thought of that final meeting was just too tempting.In reality, Agnes sent a letter citing the age difference as the main factor; she was 7 years older and often referred to Hemingway as 'Kid'; he carried the pain of this rejection throughout his life.

In order to disarm the rockets, the FBI is sending their chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). And they're digging up a mysterious British agent prisoner John Mason (Sean Connery) who once escaped from Alcatraz. When the team sent in to take on Hummel is decimated, Goodspeed and Mason must disarm the rockets on their own.This is Michael Bay audacity to bring his heart pumping action style to bear. The action is big time bombastic joy. And for the best effect, he allows the actors to have fun in between the action. Nicolas Cage brings a lot of his manic energy and a bit of his crazy humor. And Sean Connery brings the Bond gravitas to the action. Plus the Cage Connery duo is a lot of fun, and they have great chemistry together. This is the best kind of popcorn movie-making.

This film is supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't see it as one. Sure, there were some funny moments but I feel this movie should be seen more as a feel-good drama. With a light atmosphere, this film is a great date night film for sure. Even those who don't like baseball would like this film.Ron Shelton's film is about a 12-year veteran catcher of the minor leagues named Crash Davis who is assigned to mentor hotshot pitcher Ebby Nuke. Along their moments of bondage, they rival each other in getting the attention of Annie who believes in the Church of Baseball and she has a program where she chooses one player per season to be her lover.This film is well-acted. Because of his acting abilities and natural athleticism, Kevin Costner does really well in this film. Perhaps one of his finest film roles rivaling Field of Dreams. Tim Robbins, who is a newcomer here, does very well and is quite a dandy to watch. Susan Sarandon has plenty of talent and she makes great use of it here.Overall, this film is one of the greatest baseball films made. It is not really funny, but more witty. I love the confrontations on the mound between Costner and Robbins since they show such great chemistry. This movie is basically a three-run home run right here. Perhaps one of the finest baseball films to hit this planet thanks to it's big heart and well-developed characters. I rate this film 9\/10.
