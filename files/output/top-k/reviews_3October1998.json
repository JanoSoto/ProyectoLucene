If you love the movie, I'm with you, but the damn thing ALWAYS makes me cry; so after about the tenth time I watched it over a 10 year period (I drink when I watch it) I finally realised that besides the very incredible cast, and the interesting story, there was something else swilling around at the bottom of the movie that inevitably made me blub at the end.  Sean Young is gorgeous of course, but so?  The real message of the movie is this that Deckard the protaganist, could fall in love with an android - something pretty much against ALL his training.  By the end of the movie we see that people you, me, the protagonist can fall in love with anything, just so long as it is able to capture your heart.  It is THE movie that is totally anti-bigot, that strips taboo down to raw emotion and declares if your heart WANTS this, you won't be able to stop it.  It is a movie about forbidden love, taboo, intrigue, death and life pretty juicy stuff.  And the unspoken message is simply 'people will give their hearts away to whoever will pay their price, and furthermore, they won't be able to help themselves'.  Because, if you remember, ol' Sean is just a machine - an appliance really, a big, complicated vaccuum cleaner with an incredibly great face, but still a machine; just a machine.  And to prove the point, there he is, the android Roy Batty who in the end loved life so much that he would not even take the life of his would-be killer.  It's THAT message about the individual that the Nazi can fall in love with the beautiful Jewish chick; that the militant black guy can be transfixed by the innocent white girl; that the boundaries of race or creed or color, or even of flesh and blood, are actually no boundaries at all... that if Deckard can cross them, anybody can. He falls in love with an android, and shows us that no matter how you were trained or raised or brought up, there is the possibility of love... that somewhere in time, even if we are sushi - even if we are cold fish -  we can love anything, or anyone.

Because one can communicate more in a book than in a movie it is usually the case that a movie is inferior, but here this is most definitely *not* the case, despite how moving the book is until the final ten pages when it proceeds to destroy everything and everyone, including Justin and Charles' relationship.

Though certainly not wanting to forget the skill of the screenplay writer the director has more than a little influence in that direction!As to previous allegations of Mel being a coward in dealing with the book's subject, such nonsense becomes apparent for what it is if one looks at the hard hitting approach Mel has taken in other masterworks.  I'd like to see people insinuate such things to Mel's face and be set straight right away, if Mel even bothered with such drivel.  The current politically correct homophilia (and the book only hints at homosexuality rather than presenting anything specific) disgusts me as much as homophobia and Mel's too good a man to stoop to such matters, one reason being his devoted fathering of his dear kids Hannah, Edward, Christian, William, Louis, and Milo.  Regarding his hard hitting style, Conspiracy Theory has gripped me the most along such lines to date.  He's always been a powerhouse, even in his subtlety, such as Tim.I deeply appreciate Ms. Holland's heartfelt approach to the relationship between Justin & Charles in her book, and read it regularly (except for the last ten pages where all is lost!) but some seem to fail to understand the dynamic there received far greater presentation onscreen.  In this case the dynamic of the relationship gripped you from the screen in ways the book couldn't capture.  Which would you rather have  a video or a book about your loved ones. Case closed.Mel accurately adduced that the core of the story is about the trust established between Justin and Charles, and although the movie rather chose (to me unfortunately) to have accusations by the family, authorities, and town against the two, than to so fully deal with the intensity of the relationship between Justin and Charles as in the book, it was an intensity redirected, not lost because Mel's own gratifiying and typically precocious intensity came through.

The greatness of a true father's stature can never be conceived of in this world (pun intended), in our present cold and fatherless age, but Mel is a true father himself, not only to his own children, but to us, at least to me, to those of us who love him and it is this profound fatherhood which is and will be the divine source of his enduring legacy of greatness, not some ephemeral superficiality of sexuality or stardom.

After all, the plot of a killer utilizing urban legends to off his victims is brilliant. I left the theatre pleased with the movie I'd seen, but disappointed at how much better it could have been. This is definately one of those movies that seems worse and worse the more you think about it.The main problem with this movie is it tries so hard to be Scream that the story becomes tedious. The movie revolves almost solely around Alicia Witt's character, making her akin to Neve Campbell's Sidney. The problem here is that the deaths occuring in the movie are much closer related to Alicia's character. You can't help but stop and ask, If all your friends are dying off why are you staying in this freaky college? Alicia's character degenerates to being a paranoid, whinny, annoying presence.Another problem from having the movie revolve around Alicia Witt is that the other characters in the movie are way overshadowed. You never get the sense of who the other characters are. In Scream, you got to know Randy's (Jamie Kennedy) character very well. The same goes for I know what you did last summer.Finally, the movie is extremely predictable. I saw it with two of my friends and we each had the killer pinned half way through the movie. Its also very obvious who's going to die, making the only interesting part how they're going to die. Contrary to the movie's title, not all the deaths appear to be based on urban legends, and most of the ones that are turn out very lame. There is only one really good urban legend killing, and that's the very first one you see (which is probably the best part of the movie). The ending of the movie is also predictable, but is disturbingly appropriate nonetheless.All in all, this is Scream, except the killer isn't as interesting to look at, the deaths aren't as interesting, there's no mystery, its bloodier, there are more cheap scares, the characters are lamer, and the ending isn't as gratifying. On a horror movie scale of 1-10 (10 being Scream, 8 being I know..., and Jason goes to hell as 1) Urban Legend is probably a 6. If you're going to see this movie, try to get a discounted ticket.

Now this is not to say that the novel was lacking in any regard whatsoever, but that Kubrick's directing made it apparent that Nabokov wrote timeless, almost archetypal characters and a story which could resonate in any place or time.  His directing is nothing short of genius as we can see in the pacing, the effectiveness of each and every scene, the superb portrayals of every character, and the way he nails the tragic-comedic tone of the novel. The worst that can be said is that he uses the novel as an excuse for social commentary, but Lynne's Lolita draws the opposite conclusion- he blatantly ignores the tone and socio-political aspects, using the novel solely as an excuse for pornography. Lynne's direction is of the poorest standard as the scenes drag on for minutes beyond the point has (or in this case, has not) been made, and the performances are all substandard. It is a shame so many ferverently believe that Lynne's adaptation is truer to the novel, because this view devalues Nabokov's artistry and contribution to literature.

To be a Vietnamese watching this film must have been an awful, mind-numbling experience watching your own descendants get brutally mis-treated as in this movie. 'Saving Private Ryan' was a very good film, but sending the overused message war is bad is pretty old, but this film is the first to show how Americans were the real enemy. Did Oliver Stone get a medal for this?

However, I was a little hesitant about rushing out to see this movie when it came out Oct. 1997 because I knew I was in for a slight disappointment, even if it was David as the leading man. So, I waited a while to see it in the theater, and I knew I had to see it on the big screen because it would mark my first time ever seeing David on the big screen. All his other movies I have on tape. So, I saw it, thought it was pretty good, and thought he was great and gorgeous in this movie. Of course, now I have it on video-cassette. Not his best movie, but watchable. Not bad for a movie that was shot in under 2 months.

At the end, it will be worth all the reward.2. Sometimes you think you win, but you've lost.  Don't be too happy just yet.  The loser may in fact be the winner.3. Don't try to be a hero.  If you do, just be careful.Art is a good way to help us appreciate and enjoy life.  The story uses creative imagination to come up with what Heaven and Hell looks like.  I have never thought of heaven or hell in this way.  For example, in heaven there is water? and in hell, what's with all the shipwrecks... is it at the bottom of the ocean?Funny moments -> Dog Heaven ) hahaha... Robin Williams couldn't resist with his accent thing... let it go please!  This is not Mrs. Doubtfire!Overall, definitely worth watching, bring a small pack of tissues, or if you forget, you can get it from the pop corn stand.  Otherwise, just let it dry, there are not too many wet moments ) have fun! ","genre":null},{"date":"3 October 1998","score":"","review":"  Three lessons learned from this movie1. Don't ever give up.
