For all its faults, in script and plot line, this movie is my all time favorite making me feel good after each viewing (and I've seen it a dozen or more times).  I'll have one of you and a dozen of your mate. The Mammas and Pappas are one of my favorite 60's rock groups and this movie is almost a 90 minute music video for that group.  Amazing too for the reason, that the Mammas and Pappas lyrics were mostly written to explain events in their lives and how well they translate in a different context in his movie.  I simply love the use of Make Your Own Kind of Music (how appropriate are those lyrics to this movie script and what the boys were going through poles apart from California in the 60's) as the two boys run through the park playing catch with each other and then kissing under the tree.  So too, the ending dance scene with Dream a Little Dream of Me and closing credits done to Move in a Little Closer Baby.  Leah playing the Mama Cass role is exceptional.  The script faults are an on-going mystery to me and I can never quite fathom the anomalies they pose - the rainbow colors and lights in the bedroom of a young boy who has just discovered he is gay, why the mother says that Ste might be happy living in a Greek island inhabited entirely by lesbians, why earlier in the movie in an altercation Jamie asks his Mum the question How am I weird? for no particular reason, the double take on Do you have to use words like that? only to get the joke right on the second take, and some rather abrupt looks and words between the two boys that feel out of context or inappropriate to the circumstances.  I've read the script and still cannot fathom the context of these script lines.  But this all adds to the fascination of an incredibly heartfelt story based on unconditional love between a mother and her son, and a relationship of young love that develops between the two boys.  The issues of homophobia are dealt after the credits close.  With the movie ending, we never know how Ste deals with his father's reaction to his public coming out by partnering Jamie in a dance on the common area of the housing development estate.  Fantastic stuff!  It's a pity we are not likely to see a sequel nor that either of the two boys have not taken up major movie roles in the UK.  Move in a little closer baby and make your own kind of music on repeated viewings is all I can say in closing. 5***** out of 5***** for compassion and acceptance on a touchy subject.

The plot is comprised of many different genres including romance, action and comedy. The romance between Clarence and Alabamma is in my mind the greatest on screen romance in a film. The attraction between them remains strong throughout the film. The comedy varies between farcical scenes such as the three way shoot out at the end and the pop culture chatter from all the characters. The action also crops up in every other scene. There are even some highly serious scenes including the classic mafia scene at the beginning. The superb direction from Tony Scott and the brilliant script from Quentin Tarantino together with the outstanding performances from the cast and great soundtrack all contribute to make this film a classic all round film and in my mind, the best film there is.

I got it... we'll make a movie about high school football.  Throw teen heart throb James Van Der Beek in there, put the MTV logo on it and we've got a cash cow!  This movie was terrible.  I watched this for free on TV, and still think I should have gotten a refund.  I rated this movie a 3 out of 10.  And it's lucky it even got that much.  First, let me point out it's good qualities, before I tear into it.It got one point just because of the fact that whole movie is about a town in Texas where the entire community bases its existence on high school football.  I related to this because in my hometown, or at least in my school district, it's the same thing.  It's not as extreme as it was in Varsity Blues but it is just as pathetic.  I laughed because of the fact that some of the characters are carbon copies of the community from my alma mater.It got another point for Jon Voight.  Voight's character may be a little far-fetched (the evil football coach who is hell bent on winning regardless the safety and welfare of his players), but was played to a T by the veteran actor.  In the entire movie, he was the best actor, and it was a pleasure seeing him perform.And the third point is the cinematography.  Granted, the actual movie itself isn't all that visually stimulating, but the football scenes... were tremendous.  Out of all the football movies ever made, the scenes for this movie were expertly well done with some excellent choreography, lighting, and photography.Other than that... this film SUCKED.  It is full of so many flaws that it's hard to narrow it down for the purposes of this critique.First, the casting.  With the exception of the phenomenal job down by Voight, the acting in this movie is laughable.  Van Der Beek falls in and out of his Texas accent so frequently, it makes Keanu Reeves' southern accent in The Devils Advocate sound authentic... ok... well, maybe it's not THAT bad, but bad nonetheless.  The casting for this movie (again, with the exception of Voight) was badly done.  Van Der Beek as a star quarterback?  Give me a break.  He's way too much of a pretty boy to seem like he ever even put on shoulder pads.  There were also some points in the script, where you know the scriptwriter wanted a point to be made, but Van Der Beek's lackluster performance didn't drive the point home.  The rest of the cast was adequate, but nothing spectacular.  The character Billy Bob, I must say though, was well cast... because he was a disgusting pig which I never want to lay eyes on again unless he sheds a couple of tons.The script, too, was horrendous.  First of all, the characters were all one-dimensional.  The quarterback who gets all the glory but is still of noble heart.  The slut cheerleader who's not as happy as she lets everyone beleive.  The low self-esteem fat kid.  The football-obsessed father who wants his son to have what he never could.  I could see right through all theses charcters.Another problem with the script was that it was full of holes.  First Moxon (Van Der Beek) doesn't like football because he's pressured into it by his father, than he loves it when he becomes a star, than he hates it, than he loves it... etc, etc.  There's one point where Moxon is trying to cheer up the depressed Billy Bob by telling him to quit the foot ball team... than... NOT TWO MINUTES LATER, he says (and I'm paraphrasing) Come on, Billy Bob... we need you.  Jeeze!  Make up your mind!  This is just one of the many plot holes in the movie, but to discuss any more might cause me to reveal some spoilers.  (although this movie does a pretty good job of spoiling itself)And the kid who's always changing religions, this was supposed to be a running gag, but somehow I found myself not smiling.  Not because I'm offended mind you, but it just wasn't funny.Regardless, this movie, from what I'm told, did pretty well with all the teeny boppers, which isn't surprising.  Again, the actual football scenes in this movie are the best I've ever seen.  If you take every scene that doesn't take place on a football field and throw it away, this is the best football movie ever made (at least from the ones I've seen.)

The location is unique and spectacular. The actors are amazing, both Hawke and Delpy are absolutely believable. The writing is sooooo damn natural and realistic you forget it's a movie - instead YOU will have a relationship with either Hawke or Delpy (depending on how you're inclined).This movie is a MUST for all hopeless romantics! Although most of it is just these 2 conversing among themselves, that for me was the BEST aspect of this movie. Movies like these show us once again (as many of us have forgotten) the raw power of a beautiful film. By the end you will have been through the relationship yourself and feel the same mixed feelings of contentment, sadness, exhaustion and whatever else the actors are supposed to be feeling.

The wrapping up of the loose ends with written explanations ruined the whole movie for me. It's obvious that they didn't want to the movie to run too long by actually depicting the scenes wherein the referred to investigation reveals the National Security Advisor's duplicity being uncovered. I would have preferred to have seen it rather than to read about it. It would have taken another fifteen minutes, tops. Besides, I like longer movies as long as they are entertaining. I can't help but think director Friedkin caved in to studio demands to keep the movie around two hours.
