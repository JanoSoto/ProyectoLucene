A film about Jewish survival in probably some of the most horrific acts of genocide this planet has ever seen. A film that reminds us just how disgusting and destructive racism can be...And then there is the Temple of Doom in the other corner.First sequence over, Indie escapes with a blond irritant who has an eighties hairstyle I might add not a thirties. Anyway, lets get back to the point. Indie ends up with poor Indian people who ask him to return a stone and worship him like a god. The good old Oh look white man falls out of the sky in metal bird, let's worship him trick never fails.So Indie sets out and goes on to face, wait for it, evil Indian people who want to throw the British out of India for good and rule it themselves. Gandhi you bastard. India should remain British because the British know what's best for India, I agree. But these warmongers do not stand up to a fair fight against with their machetes against British machine guns, Oh no old chap. No these Indians use blood and the occult to mind control their fellow Indians to go along with this evil. Come to think of it that is probably the reason Gandhi didn't eat a lot, he didn't want to be turned into a zombie.But all is well when Indy destroys the evil plans with a train ride that was simultaneously being designed as a roller coaster ride and the British soldiers capture those evil Indians...and probably slaughter them (historically seen) but this is after all a kiddies movie.Thank god one single American and two sidekicks have saved the British interests in India. See India is even too incompetent to deal with its own problems, because it will use child labor if the British are not there to save the children.Ice cream for everyone!

It really is a crummy movie, but oddly engaging... mainly because it is so incredibly surreal and laughable in how it takes itself so seriously.*Possible Spoilers*I remember even as a kid, I thought Holy cow, for a town that didn't allow dancing and music for years, these kids sure can dance well.  What are even funnier are the people who are in it - Lithgow did this film two years after Garp. Did he think that this was going to be a meaty role? But then again, he did willingly star in Third Rock from the Sun. And Dianne Wiest - Woody Allen staple and Oscar winner, who has about 4 lines in the movie. Her job is to pretty much look pensive and pious. I don't think I even need to bring up Mr. Kevin Bacon and his goofy dance through the grain mill.While this film is not as inherently horrible as say, Xanadu, it's also not nearly as hilarious because it takes itself waaaaaaay too seriously. Of course, it has its moments, especially the part where the dance is beginning and no one is dancing. Why?

Murdering millions in the name of social justice.IN the end this is why the movie failed, instead of concentration on thiese major moral and political issues, Berman aand Braga turn this film into a slapstick parody.Worf a conflicted tragic figure of the TV series, is relagated to getting zits. Dr Crusher gets better breasts and Troi and Riker covort around as the Federation borders on commiting Cultural genocide. Trek has in the end some almost a sad parody of itself which is not a good sign of health.In my TV criticism class, I learned when a genre or series is nearing end of it's life the as the quality and relevance of its newest products fade. This has started with Innsurrection and continued on with Nemesis.

Also good in supporting roles are Amanda Peet as Banek's wife (she has a just great restaurant sequence with him) and Sydney Pollack excels as the head of the company.  The film does have a formula Hollywood ending (that's why I'm only giving it an 8) but, until the point, it's just great.  Also director Roger Mitchell has many nice directorial touches when he intercuts between Affleck and Jackson.An intelligent script, great direction and two powerhouse performances.

The supporting actors and actresses play their roles splendidly, portraying human weakness, fear, greed, hubris, inexperience, and frailty, complementing Paul Newman as the stoic, low keyed, brooding but intensely powerful Hombre.  This was a low budget movie and the script is a little weak at times, but the power of Neuman and Richard Boone overwhelm any weaknesses to make this one of the best westerns ever.  Johnny Russell shows all, good and bad, especially those who looked at him initially with disdain, just what character, principle and courage are all about.BADASSCISSITY 20.0\/10.0 or maybe a lot moreFrom the opening scene in the bar, where John Russell disciplines a range bum who is disrespecting two Indians, the tempo of badasscissity is set. Harelip time! This classic western is all about badasses and wimps and provides a stark contrast in the individuals who can cut it and those who show their inexperience and lack of backbone.  Richard Boone is simply fantastic as the tough, craggy, foul-mouthed Cicero Grimes, a bad man with a knack for intimidating ALMOST everyone in a dark, hostile and very calculated manner.  He is so tough that even when crossing a desolate desert, he takes only whiskey, no water.  ALL RIGHT!  Paul Newman plays a tight-lipped, stoic, blue-eyed Indian who is not to be messed with, even by the smarmy Grimes.

Johnny Russell shows all, good and bad, especially those who looked at him initially with disdain, just what character, principle and courage are all about.BADASSCISSITY 20.0\/10.0 or maybe a lot moreFrom the opening scene in the bar, where John Russell disciplines a range bum who is disrespecting two Indians, the tempo of badasscissity is set. Harelip time! This classic western is all about badasses and wimps and provides a stark contrast in the individuals who can cut it and those who show their inexperience and lack of backbone.  Richard Boone is simply fantastic as the tough, craggy, foul-mouthed Cicero Grimes, a bad man with a knack for intimidating ALMOST everyone in a dark, hostile and very calculated manner.  He is so tough that even when crossing a desolate desert, he takes only whiskey, no water.  ALL RIGHT!  Paul Newman plays a tight-lipped, stoic, blue-eyed Indian who is not to be messed with, even by the smarmy Grimes.  Johnny Russell is as ice cold as the other side of the pillow, a tremendous acting effort, just what you would expect from a Paul Neuman.  Frank Silvera is the Mexican bandit who in spite of being gut shot by Russell,  laughs it off and gains much respect for the Hombre adversary.ONE LINERS  one million\/10.0 Never has one man said so much by uttering so littleHombre has to rank up there with some of the Clint Eastwood and Schwarzenegger movies with one-liners. Awesome!  Here are just a few....John Russell  Eaten one and lived like one.  Referring to Indians eating dogsGrimes  You're coming one way or the other... You're coming..John Russell Because I can cut it, lady.John Russell  Try not to puke, you may have to lie in it for a while. Talking to the inept MendezMexican Bandit Hey, Hombre.. A compliment on your shooting.. You put a hole in Me..' John Russell I would have done better, but I think you movedDr. Favor You've learned something about white people, they stick together. John Russell  They better.Jessie Well, what do you figure yours is going to read referring to grave head stone John Russell Shot dead, probably Jessie Don't people take to you, Mr. Russell? John Russell It only takes one who doesn't.John Russell You want a lot more than that from me, lady. Grimes Mister, you have got a lot of hard bark on you comin' down here like this. Now, you put two holes in me and I owe you. John Russell Two's usually enough for most. Grimes Did you bring the money? John Russell Guess I brought my dirty laundry by mistake.Grimes Now what do your suppose hell is gonna look like.John Russell We all gotta die, it's only a matter of when....And perhaps one of the best one liners in a western ever... How are you planning to get back down that hill?'   Hell Yes!!!in context John Russell Hey. I got a question. How are you planning to get back down that hill? Russell shoots the hell out of Grimes all the way down the hill as he tumbles head over heals among the rocks....  Did I say `Hell Yes? Jessie As Grimes crawls away after being shot Cicero Grimes, meet John Russell.SAPPINESS  1.0\/10.0 Very little hereThere is wimpiness, but not much sappiness in this movie.  Three distinctly different women characters are portrayed as the naive, the seasoned and the sanctimonious, but there is hard hitting action and drama rather than gooiness.  John Russell and the 'wedded, bedded & loved & let down' Jessie entertain a good-natured, succinct battle of the sexes, but no love here, only genuine respect, especially at the conclusion of this drama.  Jessie is the only one of the motley passenger crew that shows backbone, the kind of woman that you  definitely want on your side.~SPOILERS~Paul Newman plays it cold as ice all the way through.   The scene at the bar was absolutely awesome, I always feel like jumping up and cheering for the Indians when Russell makes the loose-lipped cowboy eat the shot glass. HELL YES!Richard Boone as Grimes just has a bad attitude from hell as he shows right off the bat in the stagecoach station.  He intimidates and bullies everyone with a cold and calculated ferocity that is so believable that it invokes anger every time I see it. Johnny Russell shows mettle like a combat hardened veteran as he calmly hops up on the top of the stagecoach and methodically blows away the harelipped cowboy and the sheriff gone bad, immediately assuming the role of leader of the stranded group of passengers. No fluff, just a masterpiece of a scene. The final shootout scene was also a masterpiece as it invokes tremendous courage and character along with irony and frustration. The frustration was that the most courageous character and all of the badasses died in a blaze of battle as the others survived, in spite of their human frailty.  The obstruction of the line of site by the rescued Audra Favor was an especially ironic twist, but Russell was still able to dispatch Grimes and the Bandit, but at the cost of his own life. Grimes' line 'Now what do your suppose hell is gonna look like?' was brilliant and chilling, extending the continuity of the dark personality of this disturbing character.A must watch!  A classic!  How are you going to get down that hill unless you watch this movie right now?SS  ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"20 November 2003","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  What does it tell about me that I'm so thrilled by the movie Sabrina? I first saw it (the original) once or perhaps more than once when I was a teen. It did impress me but I sort of forgot about it. As a grown-up I heard of the remake and as a fan of Harrison Ford bought the video. I loved it and watched it several times.Now, I finally got back to the original as it was sold on DVD for a nice price. The old magic is back and even stronger. Emotionally, this script and both its interpretations capture me. In my opinion both versions have excellent casts including the supporting characters. Scripts and dialogs are witty and captivating. In retrospect it is really amazing how similar both versions are regarding the script as well as their mental effect on me. The newer one seems to be just this a nicely refreshed version of the original one.After watching Sabrina of 1954 again, I read from different sources about the trouble between Bogart and his co-stars. This knowledge took a little from my genuine pleasure. On the other hand a certain dislike of Hepburn by Bogart might even have helped to make him believable as Linus. I suppose he's meant to struggle against his feelings for Sabrina - and this shows in a subtle way (even if it might be Bogart trying to hide his lack of interest in Hepburn).There are several absolutely funny scenes in the movie but my favorite scene is the dancing scene with Sabrina and Linus in the indoor tennis court. It's wonderfully written and performed great - even more regarding the possible problems between the two leads. It shows a good deal of chemistry - at least in my opinion.I'll continue to watch and enjoy both versions of the movie probably because I'm a romantic at heart and true romance is so scarce in today's world.

Not to say that Q was represented poorly by Desmond Llewelyn. He was a tremendous Q, and he is already missed. I do, however, believe that John Cleese's placement into the role was a rather smooth transition, and I think that there are definitely weaker choices than John Cleese that the role could've been given to. Other than that, the movie really had no redeeming qualities. Once again, this is upon its first viewing.After attempting to recover all of the 007 movies on DVD, however, The World is Not Enough decorated my shelves once again. No matter how hard I attempted to avoid the movie, my love for Bond movies forced me to view the movie again. The reason I didn't care much for this movie upon its first viewing is that I felt that it wasn't as fast-paced as the previous Bond films, Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies. With age, however, the tastes mature somewhat, and one realizes that glorious explosions with massive deaths isn't necessarily the formula for a great movie, especially a great Bond movie. This also happens to be the growing trend for Brosnan's Bond movies (even though I think he's an exceptional Bond), much like Roger Moore's Bond has a fascination for utilizing as many gadgets as possible.In this movie, we get to see some excellent character development, plus there's quite a few references to On Her Majesty's Secret Service. There's also the very scenic locations in the film, which Bond-lovers have grown accustomed to. Of course, the opening sequence has an adrenaline-rushing escape from an office building. Then, we get to see a fabulous boat chase through London. For those people that are the fans of Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies, or Die Another Day (which are all very good, but in a different method), the action scenes will be more than satisfying, but they'll be fewer and further between than you're accustomed to, so you probably will not leave a viewing of the movie feeling as gratified as you would from the 3 mentioned, but for those people who love the formula of previous Bond films, this will be an extremely pleasant surprise. Not to mention, Bond's wit in this movie is some of the most clever dialogue that has been witnessed in a Bond movie, since early Roger Moore. This movie is quite excellent.

I mean 'The Patriot' and 'Braveheart' took liberties, but this is outrageous! Firstly, I'm not sure where this 'Middle Earth' was (I'm guessing around the Leeds \/ Manchester area) and I assume that by 'The Shire' they're referring to Buckinghamshire. Well I used to live in Buckinghamshire Peter Jackson, and I can tell you it's nothing like what you show in the film. Next time you start slagging off a large English county I suggest that you do some proper research next time and actually visit the place! You'd be surprised to learn that less than HALF of people in Buckinghamshire are inbred and only 1 in 5 of them have extensively hairy feet.If that's not bad enough Jackson then starts insulting dwarfs and Welsh people. Apparently everybody in Wales is a dwarf. Well if I was a short I would be horrified to be associated with the Welsh, even a Welshman like Colin Farrell (who's very talented). AND to make matters worse, he then goes on to LIE that the Welsh live in huge underground caverns. Just were does he get all this from? Is he on drugs? Anyway, basically somebody Buckinghamshire finds this ring and goes back to a medieval version of Aylesbury (thankfully without the Aylesbury Vale District Council and their stupid 'must wear trousers' laws). I wasn't really paying attention, but apparently this ring is part of a set, like the kind you see in the Sunday Mirror Magazine. Well this guy call Sauron (I say guy, but actually he's just a huge eye! What's that about Jackson you mad Kiwi hack?! Where's Sauron from eh?

Traven surely lived in modest circumstances in Mexico, the details of run-down hotels being far too accurate to have been made up in a comfortable armchair.But it's not really important. Huston and his cast and crew have turned the novel into a movie that is as good as anything likely to show up on the screen. It is in fact an astounding achievement.

And the unforgettable batches, which doesn't need repeating.It is surely one of Huston's best films. A lesser director could have ruined the novel's plot. But Huston adds his own touches. Cody is killed, shot through the neck, and the old man reads a letter from his wife, retrieved from Cody's pocket. But -- he doesn't know how to read big words!So Curtin takes the letter and reads it. It's not just a directorial flash in the pan, because the scene resonates at the end of the movie when Curtin rides off to meet Cody's wife in the blossom-blooming orchard. What I mean is that the letter-reading scene is there for a larger purpose than simply adding to our appreciation of the characters at that particular moment. The fight with Pat in the cantina. Absolutely nothing happens the way it had always happened in previous movies. Huston stages it in a way that an artist would think of. In all movies before this one fights involved (1) a general melee in which no one wins or loses, or (2) one clip on the jaw and the guy is unconscious. Here, MacCormack, the heavy, done very nicely by Barton Maclaine, bashes one guy over the head with a bottle of booze and socks the other one. But somebody grabs his legs as he tries to walk out the door. More blows. Bodies slump to the floor and they have a hell of a time getting back up on their feet. More blows.

It's supposedly the best film version that conveys the novel's original story. There are several weaknesses in the film. First of all, the casting of Hopkins, who is normally good in everything, isn't quite right. Secondly, this is not one of Winona Ryder's strongest roles to date either. Her Mina is vulnerable, but not fully realized. Her accent wasn't very good either. In fact, few of the accents in the film were good. I don't consider Ryder compelling enough as a woman to convince me that Dracula would choose her as his eternal bride either, although the nymphet look was in during the Victorian Era. Thirdly, Keanu Reeves is not good at all as Jonathan Harker and he even seems silly at times. The story lags just a little at times too, but at over 2 hours long, that can happen even in good films. That being said, the film has many things to highly recommend it too. The star performance of Gary Oldman as the Count is magnificent indeed, but I felt that the tinted glasses catered to a young demographic movie audience, instead of adding anything to the character. Sadie Frost was quite good, releasing a lot of raw sexual power and energy as Lucy. The production itself is the real star of the film here. The cinematography is lush; the costumes (won an Oscar) are lavish; the makeup (won an Oscar) on Oldman is great; the music is hypnotic; the sound is crisp; the sound and visual effects are stunning. Think of the recent Sleepy Hollow and From Hell, and you can imagine the sumptuous production values that this film contains. The story is mostly familiar, even if you have never read the book; because, it contains many of the same scenes from previous Dracula films. Yet this one interweaves a religious motivation for the Count's search and portrays him as a horrific, but tragically sympathetic figure. This is a great date movie for sure. Look for Monica Bellucci as one of Dracula's three brides and what looks like Charlie Sheen on the sidewalk, tipping his hat, during the scene where Winona Ryder (Mina) first meets Dracula (Gary Oldman). *** of 4 stars.
