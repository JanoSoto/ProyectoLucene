Traveling through time is one of those what if fantasies one can continually dwell. I never grow tired of considering the endless possibilities involved if such thing were possible. I especially enjoy when a film gives us a new and entertaining twist on the subject. With Back To The Future, director and writer Robert Zemeckis along with writer Bob Gale has given us not only one of the best of the genre, but began one of the truly great film trilogies.If you don't know the story by now, Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) is a teenager with more than his share of problems. His father, George(Crispin Glover) gives new definition to the meaning of the word dork, his mother Lorraine(Lea Thompson) is a worn out closet alcoholic, his brother Dave (Marc McClure) works at a fast food joint, and his sister Linda(Wendie Jo Sperber) is on the verge of becoming an old maid. Outside of the home, a teacher named Strickland(James Tolkan) has it in for Marty constantly referring to him a slacker and his father's co-worker, Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) is constantly intimidating George even to the point of having George doing his work assignments for him. Marty's best friend is an old scientist named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and his girlfriend is Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). It is his relationships with Jennifer and Doc Brown that enable Marty to think he might somehow escape the trials and tribulations of his Daily life. Well, Marty does escape, but not a manner that he could not have imagined in his worst nightmare. It seems that Doc Brown has invented a time machine out of a Delorean and through a series of misadventures Marty gets transported back to his home town in the year 1955. Not only does Marty meet his parents and his Dad's arch enemy Biff as teenagers, he somehow manages to interfere with Lorraine and George's romance, thus jeopardizing his own existence. It is left up to the Doc Brown of the past to help Marty set things right, and somehow find a way to return Marty Back To The Future.This scenario sets up endless possibilities and Zemeckis and Gale make full use of the concept. Not only do they have Marty interfering with his parents relationship, but his mother develops a crush on him in one of the most hilarious romantic encounters one could imagine. The more Marty tries to set things right, the more Lorraine becomes infatuated with him. Don't worry, Zemeckis and Gale never let the idea sink into sleaziness, but instead develop it into one hilarious moment after another. What is amazing also is watching how the life of the teenage Lorraine is as different from the adult Mrs. Mcfly as night and day. It's a revelation to Marty and to us. As for George, it seems he has always been somewhat of a cowardly type, but as Marty discovers, he had hopes and dreams as a teenager much as many of us did.Michael J. Fox was the perfect choice to play Marty McFly. Initially, because of his TV series commitment, he had to take a pass. When Eric Stoltz was not working out as Marty, Fox was thankfully able to work things out to be able to do the film. For that we shall forever be grateful. It's not that I think Eric Stoltz is not a good actor, but his laid back and darker personality would never have fit into what Marty was. Christopher Lloyd brings a characterization to Doc Brown that makes him the glue that holds the idea of time travel together. He's crazy enough to come up with the idea of a DeLorean Time Machine and has us believe he could make good on the concept. His friendship with Marty is believable enough that their on screen moments together seem genuine and sincere. There is no other way to put it except to say that if there is one character in this movie stranger than Doc, it's Crispin Glover's George. His portrayal gives new meaning to the words wimpy coward. Lea Thompson as Lorraine sets the pace for everyone. Her future Lorraine is different in so many aspects from the teenage Lorraine, yet Ms. Thompson is able to pull it off without a hitch and still have us believe they are one and the same person. There is nothing lovable about Thomas Wilson's biff. He is the consummate high school bully that many of us dealt with on more than one occasion. We have to admit a great satisfaction in how his character is dealt with.Of course, as I have mentioned in other films about time travel, all this good stuff could have been wasted if the film makers had copped out at the end. It's the kind of thing that has ruined many other films of the genre. Zemeckis and Gale not only do not hesitate in their assumptions of the possibilities of what happens when you interfere with the past, they take the ball and run with it making the film just that much more satisfying.If you were to look at a list of my favorite films, you would see Back To The Future on there, occupying a place of prominence. It is in the top 250 films on the IMDB, and one of the films that earned its place justifiably so. And if you are on my personal list, and that list also, you get my grade and in this case it equals an A+.

He had seen the remake and therefore thought that the original would be as good if not better. We were both sadly disappointed.Okay, first of all, the filming of the movie was really rather poor. I mean half the time you couldn't see things that would have probably made the movie at least a little better. Yes darkness is good for horror films so that it creates an atmosphere but I don't feel that this was intentional. The scenes also were very grainy, which could have been because of the age but figured just in case it would be a mentioning.(Spoilers ahead)Than you get to the movie itself. It had NO plot what-so-ever. There is no real explanation why the 5 teenagers\/20 years old are going on a trip through nowhere Texas, I mean yes there is their grandfather or whatever but it really goes into no real detail. The whole movie just drags through, I felt like I was watching Titanic again wonder when the ship was going to sink except here I was wondering when they would just finally go off and kill the characters off. You sit through around 20 minutes of pointlessness where the characters just bitch and make fun of each other; you do not develop any feelings at all for the characters. This just makes the movie that less horrifying and the death scenes even more boring than they already were. I was actually cheering on leather face because he characters are so annoying and blah. Which makes me say, what is so freaky about leather face? You never really see his face..and sorry to say the faces over his weren't THAT scary.The characters actions throughout the movie can't be held against this film since almost all horror movie characters make really stupid decisions, like picking up hitchhikers who look like they haven't seen a shower in years and going off to investigate a strange house in the middle of nowhere and then just barging right in.All I can say is that there were three `good' scenes in the movie. The first being when Franklin gets killed. I mean, he has to be the most annoying, childish, idiotic character that I've ever seen. My friend and I cheered when Franklin got torn up with the chainsaw. The next scene was when Sally (played by Marilyn Burns, the best actor in the whole film) runs into the tree branch. It's like, she's looking forward and suddenly when she looks back she runs straight into a branch, which just comes out of nowhere. Finally, when Sally runs into the gas service man (I never caught his name, if he had one), who is actually part of the family, he ends of beating her up with a broom, of all things, and she drops her knife while he's beating her. It doesn't even look like he's hitting her that hard and it's with the bristles. I know if I was being attacked I would let someone hit me with a broom and drop the knife I was. This was just a funny\/stupid scene.For all the hype that there is on this movie, i.e. that it's a cult classic and that it's really scary, it was kind of a disappointment. I mean yes I understand that in 1974 people had never seen something like this before but really there are other older horror films that are much more frightening and actually have a plot. This IS based on a true story here. They could of at least made an attempt at putting a little of a story behind it other than a psychotic, cannibalistic family and a group of kids who run into them. It's like a PWP (porn without plot) except it's a FWP (Film w\/o plot).

Leonardo DiCaprio deserved more credits for his acting, Kate Winslet's and Gloria Stuart's performances were fabulous. The movie received much acclaim and criticism alike, simply because it was such a smash-hit.Like Romeo and Juliet, Jack's (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose's (Kate Winslet) love would never die, because it is cut short before it can- one brief encounter brings the love that lasts for a life time. I believe love makes anything possible, so even in 1912, an upper-class young woman would fall in love with a third-class male passenger, because Rose is a different girl. She is rebellious and audacious, but feels caged by her upcoming marriage with Cal (Billy Zane), all just for his wealth to support Rose and her mother. Jack falls in love with her at first sight, saves her life and the chemistry between them becomes burning and boiling. Such love affair is possible. Anything is possible. Rose admires Picasso, and Jack is an artist who travels around and only has ten bucks in his pocket. They set each other's spirit free. The party at the lower-class section is great fun, real fun.

But what really matters is, the Heart of the Ocean has still not been found. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) gives up his ambition.

First time I ever heard of them was from a friend back in Russia who told me I'd get scared out of my mind. I could not watch it, however, since we didn't have a VCR or cable back then. That was about 10 years ago; I've been in this country for over 9 years, and seen all of the series. I didn't get as scared as the kid said I would. But this set of movies made a better impression on me than any other horror movie I've ever seen. I thought that they had an abundance of imagination and creativity, as opposed to Scream where people kill each other because of stupidity. Ironic that both are made by the same director. This last one, however, wasn't quite what I expected. The problem wasn't that it shows all the previous victims as themselves, but that it doesn't leave one off wondering. I just don't believe in watching a movie where everything is spelled out for you. And that was what the series have excelled in so greatly. This last one seems to be afraid to let us think that Freddy can really hunt us out on the street, that if we happen to visit the studio someday, we're still not safe from his sharp finger knives and rubber skin.  I think this was Craven's way of letting us laugh at the movies for once instead of just sitting back waiting to see what the next confusing horrifying thing is to be brought on the screen. He may be trying to say that it's time to start thinking constructively and as a whole instead of just sitting at home and worshiping him for drawing us pretty pictures of unreal monsters. That's just an idea. No one truly knows what was his intention of making a movie that purposely kills the very mystery he created. Anyways, I'd give it 2 stars out of 5.

Twenty-four years later, and unlike what has happened with Showgirls, Paul is having the last laugh. Even his worst film, 1995's Showgirls, has a glimmer of redeeming value, but the difference in Spetters is that it doesn't need any.At heart, Spetters is the tale of two young amateur motocross racers and their mechanic. Along with their girlfriend, their lives are irrevocably altered when they cross paths with a fast food vendor and her brother. The whole film runs like a slice of life, and nothing that happens in real life is too distasteful for the camera.If you don't want elements of the plot revealed, you can stop reading now.The film has been accused of being anti-gay, anti-women, and anti-disabled. Once again, Verhoeven gets the last laugh when it becomes clear to anyone who watches it with their eyes open that none of these things are true. The story of one character's sexual confusion is played out in graphic detail, sure, but it is portrayed exactly as it would happen in real life. Sure, not every experience of homosexuality is as negative as in Spetters, but enough are to make this portrayal valid. The main woman of the story simply manipulates the situation or uses it as best she can to escape a situation she wants out of. Any woman with an ounce of strength in her character will do the same. The character who winds up paralysed finds himself reflecting on what he has lost, and it is enough to make him lose all sense of value in his life. Again, this happens every day in the real world.There is a reason why films by Paul Verhoeven attract a certain kind of fan. Regardless of whether he succeeds or fails with his artistic goals, I have yet to see him sell out to the lowest common denominator. I have also never seen a film directed by Verhoeven where the camera is moved extraneously, obscuring details for fear of what the MPAA might have to say. The viewer is spared no details, even if it might make them turn from the screen in disgust.If I could sum up Spetters in one word, it would be relentless. I've seen many a film or television show that claims to show what kind of extreme pressures teenagers or young adults live under. Spetters is the first film I have seen in two decades that even makes the attempt, and better still it comes uncomfortably close. All in all, I consider it worthy of a nine out of ten. There are some elements that seem at odds with what Verhoeven would like us to believe they mean, but the effect overall is surprisingly good. Anyone who wants to see what would happen if they merged realistic versions of your typical Brat Packer film with a realistic version of Days Of Thunder will be well-served by checking out Spetters.

Nowadays far too many films are time based. If it's old we like it because it's a classic and if it's new we like it because it's recent and a modern classic. So when I first put this on, I admit I wasn't expecting too much. People had raved about it and said how good it was, but ultimately I had this strong feeling it would be over-rated and adored simply for being old. How wrong I was.In Mr Smith Goes To Washington, Jimmy Stewart puts in one of the most amazing acting performances you are likely to ever see. People rave about him in Capra's other masterpiece (It's A Wonderful Life), but in that film he is nothing compared to the performance he provides in this one. Stewart plays Jefferson Smith, naive country boy who comes to Washington with an ideology of a democratic system of liberty and freedom where every man would look out for each other. Instead he faces a corrupt Government in which his ideology falls flat.This film moved me, which I confess isn't hard for any truly good film to do, but it moved me in a way different to usual. Mr Smith Goes To Washington brought intense sweating as it played out, it brought nerves, it felt desperation for Jimmy Stewart to succeed, it even brought a sense of pride. I'm not American, I never have been, and it's very rare for me to even consider wanting to visit the place, yet alone be American. This film made me passionate about America though. As I watched this film, past the slightly slow start, and through to the tense finale, I found myself feeling a sense of Pride in the American Institution of Freedom. It made me want to stand up, shout hooray for America and sing the Star Spangled Banner. Not many films can do this, especially not to me. It's weird since for a film so built on Liberty, it feels almost two years too early. At the time this film was released most of Europe was entering the Second World War, but America wasn't involved yet. This film was (and is) wonderful propaganda for America and if Capra planned it as such, did he know America would enter the war?In my summary, I commented that I also felt disgust in this movie. It's not hard to see why when you watch really. As well as the previously mentioned intense pride, the corruption of the Government and the obsession with a few men earning money brings disgust. It hits home especially since events in the world over recent years imply that nothing has changed. I hope this isn't true. I hope that we truly do have liberty and freedom in the Western world, somehow though, this would feel naive.Mr Smith Goes To Washington is a cinematic masterpiece. Jimmy Stewart is breathtaking, as are his supporting cast (Harry Carey in particular appeals) and with Frank Capra behind the camera, you know your into a treat.

One of the regrets of my life is that i have yet to see it in a cinema screen. Perhaps one day it will be released on its 50th anniversary on the big screen and a new generation will be haunted from going for a swim down by their local beach. I know that i will be first in the queue.Most users reading this review will be familiar with the plot. A gigantic Great White Shark starts feeding off the shores of Amity Island. A free spirited woman called Chrissie Watkins who takes a night swim is devoured in the film's unforgettable opening sequence. The Chief Of Police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider in his most famous role) immediately closes the beaches in fear of another attack until he is persuaded by Mayor Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton) to keep them open because Amity needs 'Summer Dollars' to survive in the winter.When it becomes clear that the shark has no intention of going away and kills again, the authorities bring in Ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, brilliant) to determine exactly what kind of creature they are up against and how they can solve the problem. Despite efforts to convince the Mayor to keep the beaches closed, the Mayor refuses and horror strikes again during the 4th of July. Finally, and with no other alternative, Brody hires Shark Hunter Quint (Robert Shaw, in arguably his greatest role) and along with Hooper they set sail in Quint's vessel The Orca, to hunt the Shark which takes up the last fifty minutes of the film.The photography, lighting, set pieces (including the wonderful Orca itself) are absolutely brilliant. This is a film that ages like a fine wine. Some detractors and critics of this film might deride the Shark for its unconvincing close ups towards the end of the film, but its as good as any Computer Generated Imagery simply because it is really THERE.John Williams memorable score is one of the most popular in film history. The music is terrifying when the shark is around, and it is thrilling when the crew of The Orca chase the shark across the Atlantic whilst firing those yellow barrels time and again. William's Score was fifty percent responsible for the success of this Picture. He also won the Oscar for it. Enough said.This is Steven Spielberg's Best Film. It is also The Greatest Film Ever Made. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and especially Robert Shaw should have been awarded special Oscars for such brilliant character performances. There have been rumours that they are planning a remake or a re imagining of Jaws, but if this happens, then Hollywood will have swallowed itself like a Boa Constrictor, for this was the first film that defined the term 'Summer Blockbuster' and created an era of big Hollywood movies that were King of the Box Office...a remake might destroy that forever.My Favourite Film Ever.

Lots of sexy fun and a few laughs, right?  Wrong! The characters in this film except Gere's T and Hunt's Bree are cartoon caricatures.  All of the gags stretch our suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.  Farrah got to be the new Farrah as we've seen her on late-night talk shows and collect a hefty paycheck for it (I hope).  Her breakdown is a weird scene and not funny.

And that was the highpoint of believability.  Laura Dern plays a bossy drunk, and that's basically all her character is--a bossy drunk running everywhere at once trying to organize the planned wedding. Hunt and Gere give typical performances and this is just past Hunt's peak of popularity so the chemistry should work well and it does--for awhile. However, T's willingness to cheat on his wife and throw away his family out of what? boredom? and Bree's general outlook make them unsavory as a couple. Everything spirals out of control.  All the women that the good Dr. works on (and we see more of them than necessary) are crazy about him, even his head nurse\/receptionist, played by Shelley Long.  One daughter is in the closet and going through with a sham marriage to an out-of-his-depth nerd who we only see quavering at the altar.  The other has some fantasy about being a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and the situations she gets herself into are utterly ridiculous.  By the end, nothing is recognizable anymore. Some poor, rejected patient with lots of cash and a very fragile ego makes a huge fuss when the doctor refuses to see her and this starts a chain reaction that disrupts T's practice.

And a tornado brews from nowhere to strike the outdoor wedding and reception to scatter all the guests.  In response, Dr. T gets into his beautiful convertible with the top down and drives through the storm on the newly christened Jayne Mansfield highway (which he earlier helped name) and drives straight into the tornado. Instead of killing him, the tornado sucks up his car in central Texas and plops it down hundreds of miles away in a native American village across the Mexican border--(somewhere near New Mexico if he'd landed in the US).  The car is undamaged, he is confused and a little disheveled but unhurt. After he lands, the tornado (great-nephew of the twister that landed Dorothy in Oz) dissipates.

And a tornado brews from nowhere to strike the outdoor wedding and reception to scatter all the guests.  In response, Dr. T gets into his beautiful convertible with the top down and drives through the storm on the newly christened Jayne Mansfield highway (which he earlier helped name) and drives straight into the tornado. Instead of killing him, the tornado sucks up his car in central Texas and plops it down hundreds of miles away in a native American village across the Mexican border--(somewhere near New Mexico if he'd landed in the US).  The car is undamaged, he is confused and a little disheveled but unhurt. After he lands, the tornado (great-nephew of the twister that landed Dorothy in Oz) dissipates.  Dr. T delivers an Indian boy and is thrilled.  Needless to say, I trudged out of the theater in disgust.

This film can very well change your life for the better. It is quite possibly the greatest gem in filming to be released since American Beauty. But even though this diamond is huge, it has a few faults. First it seems to lose its seriousness at points, and certain points seem random and err, well quite odd. That being said, this could be the greatest film ever. It has that eerieness that even when something seems so comical you cannot laugh. It is terrible to see what happens to these people, and I could hardly say that this movie will make you feel good once its over. At the end, more than likely you will sit in your seat for a minute just processing what you saw. This movie gives no hope, no beaken of light, and it shows the absolute worst case scenarios. If you think that our world is perfect, then Requiem will wake you up from that dream quickly, and once you wake up, you will only want to go right back to sleep. Definitely a powerful film. 9\/10Pros Characters feel real, it remains dark and bleak, tremendous acting.Cons Repetition of one scene in particular where drug use is shown, however different the drugs or the process of using it, this scene stays the same.

Women may see Bette Midler in Beaches comforting her friends or Susan Sarandon in Thelma and Louise shooting up the Southwest.  On the other hand men have the Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop series where dim witted detectives team up with fast thinking\/street smart partners. The formulas are typical and boring. This movie sets the stage for a different type of buddy movie. The premise is set right away with Michael Holzcek being orphaned(mother died previously with an illness) when his father dies in Vietnam and no one will raise him except his grandfather Rocky played by Peter Falk who becomes his lifelong buddy\/mentor.  Rocky is a Polish American in Pittsburg and at the time well past 65 but still working hard as a baker while his contemporaries are retired or dead.  He is told that he is too old to raise a kid but whoa this senior is on a mission and not done yet! Rocky has his own stubborn ways and the my way or the highway philosophy of life. The story unfolds with Rocky teaching Michael the values of family and life. Unfortunately, Michael picks up alot of Rocky's say it like it is habits. Along the way, Michael sets out to get his college degree and head off to medical school eventually interning in Columbus, Ohio.  Of course, Rocky has to join him in a home shared with Chinese medical students.  This part of the movie lends itself to many funny episodes with Rocky trying to fit in with the students. Michael's life seems to be in a rut-just work and of course no sleep because Rocky is a horrific snorer. Life stinks until he meets his future wife to be Beth. However, no one is good enough for Michael according to Rocky but eventually Rocky learns to live and let live and accept Beth. The marriage develops a number of new situations and it is Beth that teaches Michael the true key to becoming a good doctor,humanity and compassion. I really enjoyed the movie but it was Peter Falk that made the movie. He has an extensive movie history and although known for the extremely successful Columbo TV series,he has received many awards and got his first real recognition for the true life based movie Murder Inc.Roomates has a good story line but there are several goofs that prevent it from getting a top rating. Here are my observations.Although it is an ethnic movie and he was Polish American, there was no hints of Polish culture like food, dance etc.  It was like the story was a composite of traits of many ethnic groups and the writers just chose Polish American as a label. D.B. Sweeney was not a  good choice as Michael, his boyish looks are hard to make him look older as the years advance in the movie. He is also ethnic looking alright-like right out of an Irish movie with his reddish hair. However, a real big booboo was when Rocky was doing the laundry at Michael's house,(at this point Michael was married with children and had completed his doctor residency of 8 years)and had to have been 35.  Rocky at that point would have been 98 or 100.  He was moving around quicker than most 25 year old guys in a boxing match. Also he was a baker all of his life-a grueling, on your feet, all day occupation yet no physical ailments or complaints in the storyline. Falk also had a plastic cap over his head to make him look bald and old but it looked so bad that it reminded you of a game show host from the 70's with a lousy hairpiece(rug). I recommend this movie and had some of the details been attended to, it would have been outstanding. Perhaps this is the reason that this entertaining film was probably not released in theaters.

Well, watching Zoolander probably isn't going to give you any accurate representation of what being a male model is really like but it's definitely a hilarious spoof on modeling and fashion industry.  Zoolander relies heavily on the stereotypes of self-absorbed male models depicting them as airheads with their senses often limited to strictly fashion. I recommend you completely disregard Stiller's previous comedies Something About Mary, Meet the Parents, and Along Came Polly when approaching this film as it strays from his usual `boyfriend with bad luck who gets into hilariously embarrassing situations' style comedy. His role this film shows character diversity in Stiller not seen in his past films and it works.The sheer stupidity of the main characters Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and rival male model Hansel (Owen Wilson) are the primary sources of the genuine laughs found in Zoolander. Set in modern day New York City, the plot revolves around a sinister fashion designer named Mugatu (Will Ferrell) and his plot to brainwash male model Derek Zoolander to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  The Prime Minister harms Mugatu's clothing factories (run by children) by imposing child labor laws, angering Mugatu and other fashion designers. Although the plot is far-fetched it never tries to be taken any more seriously than a comic book. Once you see the remarks and reactions of the two main characters it's impossible to take seriously and often funny. One example of the hilarious stupidity in this movie Early on in the movie there is a `Male Model of the Year' awards ceremony Zoolander, being accustomed to winning the award several years in a row runs to the stage despite the fact Hansel's name had been announced to accept the award. Zoolander proceeds to give his cocky award speech when he the host taps his shoulder and points to Hansel standing behind him. Zoolander is struck with disbelief and it makes for a truly funny scene. There isn't much romance in this film but there is a little between a reporter named Matilda (Christina Applegate) and Zoolander but it's never really explored in the film and most of its referred to with humor. Picture Zoolander as a feature-length Saturday Night Live skit and you should know what kind of humor to expect.As I said before to enjoy this movie you can't take it seriously because you will take it as it was not intended.  This was a movie that caught me by surprise, I didn't think I'd like it and thought of myself as being `dragged' to see it but was very happy with after watching.  I never thought I'd be interested in seeing something about a male model (because I have no interest on the subject) but modeling is just what it makes fun of. Zoolander definitely achieves what it sets out to do and doesn't try to take itself seriously at all.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are compliment each others roles very well and are extremely funny together.Bottom Line- 7.5 out of 10 Better than `fair' but not great, lots of laughs to be had but it relies on the same `stupid' humor the entire movie. Even though the humor can be repetitive at times, it still managed to be funny for the most part throughout the movie. I consider it a solid comedy worth renting for those seeking laughter.

They decide that if it is meant to be they will find each others telephone number from a book insert and a dollar bill that they pass in to general circulation.The central premise rather reminds me of that WC Fields gag about a guy who threw himself out of a plane, taking a chance that below him was the world's largest haystack! With a device as silly as this you better hope that the acting and the script have something better to offer. Sadly they don't!John Cusack is a master at these lone romantic movies - reading through his credits he seems to play the oddball, the misfit or the self-pitying eccentric more often than most.  Maybe if he stood upright properly, put his shoulders back and spoke in a clear and confident voice he would get a wider choice of roles. The guy has a good head of dark hair, a slim build, a pleasant face  and is well  over six feet tall - he doesn't need to keep playing the man that has self-doubt over whether to use the bathroom or not.Kate Beckinsale is quite nice and well spoken, but doesn't have anything to suggest she is a star. There is no humorous undercurrent to her and the dialogue just falls out of her mouth like she is reading a dinner menu out-loud. She is supposed to be running around (literally) finding a man that she has let slip away, but her eyes are dead a dodos - I don't believe it. Mind you even Sandra Bullock couldn't make this work and she is the queen of offbeat romance!You can just see the pitch with this film A light romance with a twist. But the twist keeps the people in love apart so we don't really have much of a romance. It is more a pointless chase movie and even the most naive  watcher knows full well how it is going to end. If this is a film aimed at women then women should take offence that they are expected to  swallow this warmed over trash.
