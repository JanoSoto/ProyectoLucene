Don't get me wrong, he is a good enough director, but Carpenter runs rings around him, and this movie goes to show that he can beat him  with the same idea a crew trapped in an area with a dangerous, shape-changing creature that is trying to kill them (the exception being that Carpenter adds more suspense and mystery by making his monster change into people, not just mutate into a hideous, alligator like creature on legs.) I like Alien a lot, but it is mostly due to the cast, which is excellent. The Thing has a cast that is also very good, but without as many familiar faces. The action sequences are better, and the violence\/ gore is better as well. Obviously the focus of Alien was not gratuitous violence, but seeing people ripped apart by this ghastly creature was better than a little fake puppet jumping out of John Hurt's stomach and scurrying across a dinner table. The bleak atmosphere, lack of music (though there area few tunes here and there) and creepy noises make the ambiance better, for me anyway. Alien has a gross ship, but The Thing has desolate, arctic wasteland. It was more hopeless feeling to me. In terms of characters, The Thing is on par with Alien, even though the cast is less well known ( No big stars like Tom Skerrit, or Ian Holm). The only two actors I recognized were Kurt Russell and Keith David.... the rest of the cast is good though. The concept of paranoia also adds to this as well, with the crew killing each other... delightful.

Right from the first shot, the fading in of the grey harbour accompanied by Jack Nitche's brilliant electronic \/ jazz soundtrack, an atmosphere of oppression and gloom is set which carries on through to the final credits. This certainly isn't the most upbeat film but so what? I personally found the presentation of gays in this film far less offensive than pap like Philadelphia, which shows a Hollywood-friendly (and totally unrealistic) portrayal of a controversial subject. At least Cruising has the balls to show you something you haven't seen before and doesn't soften the blow (so to speak).I understand from the short documentary that preceded the movie that it was a real hot potato when it was first released in 1980. Indeed, during the shooting in the real life gay bars of New York, protesters hounded the production as Friedkin was damned for making a downbeat movie about homosexuals. Ever been to a heavy leather S & M bar? I have, it was wild and quite surreal. And don't think that the cruising that went in the film is wildly exaggerated, it wasn't...The film is dealing with a subculture of gay life (and an extreme one at that), not the mainstream. Surely anybody with a brain can see that this is not implying that all gay people are obsessed with anonymous sex and sadomasochism... but some are. If that's their bag then good for them. Some are decent people, some are arseholes, just like any other part of lifePersonally I think Friedkin and Pacino were very brave taking on a project like this. Pacino in particular gives a marvellous and very subtle portrayal of a man drawn in to this bizarre world whilst struggling with his inner demons. The scene in which he almost breaks down to his boss (I just don't think I can do the job) is Pacino at his pot-boiling best.As mentioned at the start, 40 minutes have been cut from this film, including a full fisting scene where a man's clenched fist is apparently clearly visible in the stomach of another (yikes). What was almost certainly cut were finer details of Burns' journey in dealing with his own, deeply buried, homosexuality. At one point Pacino's character tells his girlfriend there's a lot you don't know about me. As it stands, some people's interpretation that Pacino turns gay in this film is quite understandable, even though not really possible.It's funny that when you read reviews of Cruising, many will concentrate on its repulsive scenes of consensual gay sex. I can't ever remember a time when a film with copious amounts of consensual heterosexual sex was slammed on that basis alone. Plus c'mon now, it's hardly hardcore!The book by Gerald Walker (on which the film is based) is vastly different from the film and, believe it or not, is much more vicious and disturbing (the Pacino character in the book eventually turns killer himself - poor old Ted).So for me, Crusing is a winner for it's wonderful French Connection grittiness, atmosphere and guts, Pacino's gamble, the amazing and never-mentioned Jack Nitzsche score and all round top quality acting. Hopefully one day we'll see a release on DVD with a Director's Cut.

The scene in which he almost breaks down to his boss (I just don't think I can do the job) is Pacino at his pot-boiling best.As mentioned at the start, 40 minutes have been cut from this film, including a full fisting scene where a man's clenched fist is apparently clearly visible in the stomach of another (yikes). What was almost certainly cut were finer details of Burns' journey in dealing with his own, deeply buried, homosexuality. At one point Pacino's character tells his girlfriend there's a lot you don't know about me. As it stands, some people's interpretation that Pacino turns gay in this film is quite understandable, even though not really possible.It's funny that when you read reviews of Cruising, many will concentrate on its repulsive scenes of consensual gay sex. I can't ever remember a time when a film with copious amounts of consensual heterosexual sex was slammed on that basis alone. Plus c'mon now, it's hardly hardcore!The book by Gerald Walker (on which the film is based) is vastly different from the film and, believe it or not, is much more vicious and disturbing (the Pacino character in the book eventually turns killer himself - poor old Ted).So for me, Crusing is a winner for it's wonderful French Connection grittiness, atmosphere and guts, Pacino's gamble, the amazing and never-mentioned Jack Nitzsche score and all round top quality acting.

Right from the first shot, the fading in of the grey harbour accompanied by Jack Nitche's brilliant electronic \/ jazz soundtrack, an atmosphere of oppression and gloom is set which carries on through to the final credits. This certainly isn't the most upbeat film but so what? I personally found the presentation of gays in this film far less offensive than pap like Philadelphia, which shows a Hollywood-friendly (and totally unrealistic) portrayal of a controversial subject. At least Cruising has the balls to show you something you haven't seen before and doesn't soften the blow (so to speak).I understand from the short documentary that preceded the movie that it was a real hot potato when it was first released in 1980. Indeed, during the shooting in the real life gay bars of New York, protesters hounded the production as Friedkin was damned for making a downbeat movie about homosexuals. Ever been to a heavy leather S & M bar? I have, it was wild and quite surreal. And don't think that the cruising that went in the film is wildly exaggerated, it wasn't...The film is dealing with a subculture of gay life (and an extreme one at that), not the mainstream. Surely anybody with a brain can see that this is not implying that all gay people are obsessed with anonymous sex and sadomasochism... but some are. If that's their bag then good for them.

In stark contrast, are the loud, raspy scenes like the party scene (too much colour, noise, and timber!). The overly-emotional cat scene in the rain seems out of place- almost too dramatic, compared to the whole tone of the movie. Perhaps though (i'm trying really hard Audrey!

I now I had many ideas of what the movie talked about, until I heard other people opinions.Spoiler Some disturbing images, as the monster that haunts the guy from the restaurant and the rotting corpse in room 17. Well made make-up. I didn't liked the acting, it seem a little flawless, though Naomi Watts tried her best. I think she was better in The Ring. Laura Harring was mediocre, the only thing I appreciated in her was her beauty.

I think the closest I got to watching anime on a regular basis was watching the cartoon Voltron as a kid in the 80s.  Back then though everything was just a cartoon and who drew it really didn't matter.  Anyways, I rented Akira because I have heard a lot about it.  I rented it and was pleasently surprised.  I thought that while it was one of those films that was heavily influenced by the style of Blade Runner, the story itself was different and it had a great visual style.  I think the action was excellent (for a cartoon) and the scenes were really memorable.  I can't say that I would rent more anime movies because of it, but I'm definetly more open to the idea that cartoons can be entertaining to adults.  Rent it if you are interested in sci-fi\/action or want to see something we a great look to it.

This is a film composed of two parts. The first part is a love story which takes place in America but focuses on the violent overthrow of the Salvador Allende republic in Chile. Fielding Pierce, the protagonist, is an idealistic naval officer from a working class family. He meets Sarah (played by the always lovely Jennifer Connelly), a free-thinking social activist, and they begin a whirlwind romance. Soon, though, she leaves for Chile, where she is murdered during the coup d'etat staged by Pinochet. Fielding, of course is devastated, and it leaves a scar on him which still hasn't healed when the film flashes forward to the eighties, when he has gotten into politics. Attached now to an important politico's daughter, Fielding has to make some important decisions regarding the ideals he holds so important while coping with a tremendous loss he never really came to grips with. Many critics have panned this film for being contrived and unbelievable, mostly because of the ghost sequences and the chronological flashback vignette structure which Gordon uses to paint the story. I found it refreshing after so many Pulp Fiction wannabe timeline films having been made in the last 10 years. Also, isn't it a bit wonderful to see a film that equates personal emotional turmoil with personal idealistic\/political turmoil. In the midst of dealing with the loss\/reincarnation of Sarah, Fielding is forced into making hard choices about what kind of man he is going to be; a member of the political machine or a true servant of the people. A rare treat.

At least they were freshly if somewhat unsurprisingly presented. The much vaunted use of the numbers 8 and 2 was merely a gimmick rather than either a rigorous aesthetic or a skeleton key to the film's meaning. Alright the name MIM in roman numerals is the year the film was released but so what. Couldn't understand what some of the actors were saying, especially the rapping black kid, and some of the scenes between actors smelled like improvised workshop things but essentially I was reaching for the remote just before the hour mark. It was one of those 'less-than-meets-the-eye experiences. I was at least expecting to find out that Tom Cruise was gay or at least his character was. I mean the interview explains his hostility to his father but not his hatred of women. Which was the point of his character, drawing out the inherent hatred of women in the men of present day society. The film is set up seriously but not thought out or finely wrought enough. It's not enough to quote crap from other movies if I doesn't have a consequence in this film. They must have loved this film in France, especially the ending. I mean Holy Blue!
