One of them says to the other, clutching the dying canine in his hands and in a burst of emotion, tells the other Don't you ever tell me what's real!I'd like to address it at the move itself and all the reviewers trying to say that this movie is real, authentic youth - im sick of people, this movie, telling me whats real and that this movie is good because it has its grips on reality like Caulkin on a dead dog.  This movie, at the moment of saying Don't tell me whats real is trying to tell me whats real, and trying to tell it without irony or subtelty.I never realized authentic youth was a beer commercial.  Or gripping dead dogs along the road.  Or standing in front of your whole school and tearfully reading out poetry while everyone is gripped in emotion.  Or being a liberal, hedonistic, a free thinking genius in the midst of harsh Christian social repression.  Or truely bonding, tearfully, with your male friends.  Sounds like a wet dream to me.  That is, while i must say that the haircuts and bicycles are all very seventies, the actual scenes are simple, pointless, uninspired.  They are citations of other teen movies.  Its a seventies shell with a filling of hollywood cliches.A movie that is scattered, uninteresting (plotwise) and trying at every moment to force its version of Pepsi-Cola reality down my throat, as if its version of reality by itself were enough to overlook the plot and anything redeeming ironic or humorous content.RATING one of the worst i've ever seen ","genre":null},{"date":"26 November 2002","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I've tried in vain (google, etc.) to find a reviewer who saw this movie and laughed his\/her ass off like me and my friends did when we saw this movie.There's a completely random melodramatic scene where the two boys are biking along and one of them sees a dead dog.
