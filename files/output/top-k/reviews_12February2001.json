This is a kids movie by Disney. They already cut out the songs and made it eye candy for the parents, the only thing they were lacking was some humor for the kids. All the humor is towards my age group (teens) and the kids don't get it. I now that everyone gets a little tired about Disney reusing ideas, like Tarzan in this one. But its totally different. Since these were dinosaurs Aladar could have surely died if he couldn't adapt to new things, which he can and thats puts him ahead of Kron. I doubt Tarzan would have died if he went back to England. Also, theres a big size differnce in the fact that Aladar could kick Yar's butt any day. I think people need to lay off disney unless they can come up with a better movie themselfs. Sure this movie had a couple of scenes it could have done without, but has anyone ever listened to Titanic's dialoge? I think people should stop comparing Dinosaur to Jurassic Park because its in a totally different category and its script is almost 8 years old.Ouch! Anyway this movie rocks!

How could director Ridley Scott and Anthony Hopkins create a better sequel? They couldn't.  But they are pretty darn close.Hannibal Lector is Anthony Hopkins at his best.  He has not lost the knack for portraying the only cannibalistic serial killer in history to win an Oscar. One may say that Jodie Foster was lost however.  Then I would add they gained JulieAnn Moore.  She was very believable and did a great job filling Jodie Foster's role as Clarice Starling. I loved Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler.  He was perfect to play a 'ratfink' such as Krendler.  And although you never saw his real face, the makeup on Gary Oldman to portray Mason Verger was one of the most disturbing parts of the film.  The acting of the film deserves an A+, undoubtedly.Note There may be some spoilers here so proceed with caution if you haven't seen the film. At first I was a little disappointed after the movie- it was different than the first one...a lot.  I didn't want this sequel to ruin the image of the original, as many sequels do. I wanted to like it - I relly did. As time progressed, I thought the movie wasn't that bad- in fact not bad at all (this took all of 30 minutes or so).  We still got some freakishly freaky chills. We got a good filling of home-fried human organs. The plot, though much different than the first, grabbed my attention the whole time- no question about the entertainment. Yet some parts were funny.  I can't think of anything funnier than Hopkins saying OkeeDokee before he kills people. I think that humor though just goes along with my appreciation of all three Thomas Harris novels with Lector and the first film.My favorite part - without a question- was when Lector trapped Starling by her hair in the fridge. He went in like he was going to eat her but added That's my girl. Classic.  Classic, classic, classic.This next thought may be downright sick for a 16 year old to say publicly but I got a kick out of Krendler eating his own brain.  I was laughing (to myself) at the kid on the plane (It's good to try new things). I realize now how much I did enjoy the film.If you walk into the theatre expecting a movie superior to the original, you may be disappointed.  If you walk in not expecting anything, I guarantee you'll love this film. I didn't like the ending of the Hannibal book but I really liked that of the movie.  Kudos to Ridley Scott.  I sincerely hope they make a movie based on the first book, Red Dragon- a movie with Anthony Hopkins. Though he's a little older, at this point, no one else can play him.  It's like getting someone else to play Indiana Jones- it's just not cool.So, I recommend this movie to anyone.  It's much better than those teeny-bopper horror films starring Joe Blow from Dawson's Creek or whatever.  This is a movie.  A movie that has 'dogs and cats living together'- dogs being humor, cats being horror.  Go do yourself a favor get a nice bottle of Chianti and see it.  Dinner's ready; come and get it.

Well, I was one of those poor people who thought that, and I was amazingly disappointed.The movie is unbelievably bad, and I'm not exaggerating here.

Yes, it's thrilling. The only (but huge) problem is that the whole movie you expect something to happen, and nothing actually happens. You don't necessarily need to expect a twist at the end, like the one in The Sixth Sense, but you were waiting to see something actually happening. And what happens? Nothing. Willis rescues a family, in a short scene where he kills a guy, and then nothing. Yes, nothing. Then he goes to Samuel L.

Don't rent it if you're looking for a comfortable, conventional, predictable, or optimistic view of life; this movie is like a force of nature and you will never forget it.When I first saw this, both I and my date noticed how the movie's structure is like the train itself; it starts off very slowly and gradually, and slowly, inexorably builds speed and tension all the way to the end. The beginning sequences, set in Hell, set up the central question of the film Is Manny more than an animal? By the end, we know that, as grotesque and brutal as he is, he has achieved a kind of redemption. By exerting himself to save Buck and Sara, and by annihilating the evil warden, he has changed himself from whatever he was when he came out of the cell into a visionary figure. He is unforgettable, even though you hate him.In the sixteen years since this picture was made, lots of advances have been made in special effects. There's the photographic glories of The Matrix, the enormous powere of Titanic, the animation feats of the Disney and DreamWorks studios.

And while I still think Traffic is better, Gladiator still proved to be a really good film. However, I don't think it was the best film of the year.The story begins in wartime b\/w Rome and Germania. Maximus (Russel Crowe) is the general of the Roman army, and he leads them into battle. To sum it up, they kick major Germanian army booty in a really bloody battle (if you are intensely disturbed and grossed out at this point, don't continue watching the film). Anyway, the Emperor of Rome currently is all proud of Maximus, and it turns out he really admires Maximus after his good work all these years, which, of course, sparks intense jealousy from an already bad dude Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the current emperor's son. So when Commodus becomes Emperor, he orders Maximus to be killed. But Maximus dodges being killed, returns home to find his family dead, and then while wandering around lost, he's picked up by some salesmen and is held as a slave. He's then sold as a gladiator. The rest of the story chronicles him being a gladiator that sort of teaches Rome with his fighting and rebellious ways to be more powerful than the Emperor...which Commodus isn't too happy about.This was a better movie than I thought it would be. The story was good it was creative, pretty, touching, and interesting all rolled together.The acting was exceptional. Russel Crowe captured the intensity of Maximus' feelings and displayed them well for the audience to intake. Connie Nielsen was convincing as Commodus' sister. But the best performance in the whole movie was Joaquin Phoenix as the nasty Emperor of Rome, Commodus Caesar. He gave his character an evil that was seen through coyness and nastiness, both blended to give Commodus that bad guy touch that really makes you fear and hate him...and yet he seems so innocent at times. The only other time I've seen a performance like that is when Topher Grace played slimeball Seth Abrams in Traffic.I loved the cinematic artwork in this movie, namely seen during the first battle in the story. The camera dissolves and movement were all used to just make you say, Wow! throughout the whole movie. I also liked the color usage blues for outside scenes at the beginning battle, brownish oranges for inside, brightness in the gladiator arena, and darkness surrounding the Emperor. These techniques managed to turn a summer popcorn movie into a piece of art that can be appreciated through many movie goer's eyes.This film is definitely in my top 5 of 2000. While I personally think Traffic is the best film of the year, I won't ask, How much money was under the table? if this movie wins the prize.I give it an 8\/10, being it was a little overly long.

Although I originally hated the book, particularly the bizarre (to put it mildly) climax, I've revised my opinion in the almost two years since--it remains vastly inferior to Thomas Harris's two earlier Lecter novels, but is still a compelling tour de force of abnormal psychology and a display of devastatingly smooth writing technique. Love it or loathe it, Hannibal is irrefutable proof that no writer working today does monsters as well as Harris; his creations are among the most nightmarishly memorable in popular American fiction, beings who can make you cringe, weep, and root for a nasty comeuppance all at the same time, characters both monstrously evil and sadly human.In all fairness, it must be said that Ridley Scott and company began work on the film version of Hannibal facing several disadvantages. First, they were tackling a sequel to a modern classic--Jonathan Demme, Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and crew absolutely nailed The Silence of the Lambs, turning in a near-flawless film adaptation that cleaned up at both the box office and the Academy Awards. Second, they amplified the anticipation by doing it ten years later (although through no real fault of their own, since Harris took years to write Lecter's encore). Third, they're dealing with characters that have become icons, particularly Hannibal himself. Fourth, the book was enormously controversial--at one time, there was even speculation that Harris wrote it as he did to sabotage a film adaptation, bitter over how the success of the film Silence overshadowed his books (the reclusive author has since refuted that story). Demme and Foster opted out this time, citing their discomfort with the book's excesses, but they really may have well been afraid that they couldn't top themselves.In both its novel and film forms, The Silence of the Lambs stands as a veritable master class in the art of suspense, a propulsive, chilling manhunt for a serial killer that forces its protagonist to match wits with another monster, Dr. Lecter himself. But the novel Hannibal was altogether a different type of story, a psychological horror tale that deposited readers firmly in the wounded, dysfunctional psyches of its main characters and threatened to strand them there, a tour through layer after layer abnormal psychology that brought madness up close and personal, far too close for most readers' comfort.Where Ted Tally's Oscar-winning adaptation of Silence of the Lambs delivered an escalating spiral of suspense that stands up a decade later because it respected its source and trusted viewers to guide themselves through the thorny patches, the screenplay for Hannibal seems driven to re-invent the controversial material (the ending is completely re-worked) and winds up robbing the audience of the story's most compelling facets. Spoilers Alert On the page, Clarice Starling was bitter about the collapse of her once-promising career, a fall that was largely orchestrated by Justice Department official \/ cad Paul Krendler, a politically ambitious snake whose overriding flaw was his deep hatred and contempt for women, particularly successful ones. Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim, was a horribly disfigured millionaire pedophile who conspired to have Lecter captured and eaten alive by slavering boars, and who acted in collusion with Krendler to dangle Starling as bait. But the movie lets us in on none of these characters' inner workings. Just as we don't know what makes Hannibal tick in this movie, we're given very little about Mason--both his relationship with his lesbian sister and his philanthropy with orphaned children are excised from the film version, so he's just a disfigured beast, and in one scene a ridiculously Jim Carrey-esque jester. You don't feel pity, hate, or much anything else for Mason--he's just sort of there. We don't get to know much about Clarice Starling, as re-interpreted by Julianne Moore, so we don't feel much for her or her constant battle with the FBI's glass ceiling. Krendler, whose smarminess, sexism, and contempt for Starling were driving forces of the novel, is given a tossed-off reference to a failed pass at Starling as the reason for his hate; but even his spite doesn't seem particularly hateful, just oily, tacky and cheap.Worst of all, the title character is now almost played for laughs. In fact, the packed-house audience at the screening I attended giggled during Lecter's biggest moments, a reaction that would probably make author Harris's hair stand on end--his most potent and sinister creation has become, thanks to celluloid, a populist sideshow farce.Moore fills in admirably for Jodie Foster, and Hopkins, clearly comfortable in his most famous role, turns in a smooth, effortless performance. Ridley Scott does what he can visually, although you'd expect nothing less than great visuals from him.In the end, watching Hannibal unfold on the screen is like taking the cover off of a silver dining tray and finding a baloney and cheese sandwich.

The acting sucked, the places where the movie was filmed sucked(ex the mine with a bunch of bloody maniqins, etc), the killer was a disappointment and was a bad killer at that too, and the movie felt like it was rushed and they couldn't wait till the filming was over. But the death scenes were good and the fencing mask that the killer wears was cool. Other than that the movie wasn't all that great, the movie COULD of been A LOT BETTER.i give it a 5\/10 even though i feel like im over doin it.Urban legends 3 better be better than this I HOPE.

I must say that I was very impressed.  Firstly because the actors really carried it off.  It is such a dark subject but Agent Starling did not for one minute lose her credibility as an FBI agent and her decisions were based on good ethical and moral insight.  We got to know more about Hannibal and what motivated him to a point.  Even though he was such an evil man he had the ability to seduce you into wanting him to get away.  The Director was brilliant.  He did not for one moment dwell on the blood and gore.  There was a reason for everything that happened.  I for one enjoyed this film more than the first because not one person was innocently killed.  There were so many parallels and twists to the plot that seemed to justify.  As gruesome as it all was it seemed that in the end it was justified.  God forbid.  This film is definitely a keeper!  As dark as it was and there were points in the movie that I had to cover my eyes it was good entertainment!

The ghosts of their ancestors are offended by the fake ghosts so they lend their expertese to save the castle. The humor and the jokes are very good, but some of the hauntings, specifically the nuns, are better than others. Skinny and gawky Liam Neeson and Darryl Hannah, rather skinny and gawky herself, interestingly act out and stick to playing two ghosts stuck in a place memory as Steve Guttenberg plays a husband stuck in an unhappy marriage with sexy Beverly D'Angelo. Most of the movie circles around them and some questionable spernatural phenomenon. There's some holes in the plot as Hannah the ghost ends up in D'Angelo's body, but looks like herself ? Peter Gallagher and Jennifer Tilly share a barely seen sub-plot as Martin Ferrero plays a ghost-hunter\/harried husband. All in all, this isn't a bad movie. It's rather enjoyable but the only Irish countryside we do do get to see is rather dismal and depressing.
