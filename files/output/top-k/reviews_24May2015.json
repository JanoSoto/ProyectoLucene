I missed it when it was first released, and, and it's even more surprising because I am a great fan of the show.So, now that I've seen it as a film crew type and as a fan (and as a creative person), here's what I think fans objected to;First off, the film itself is exceptionally well shot, and has high production values. If I had one real criticism that crossed technical and artistic boundaries, it would be that a good portion of the spaceship shots were not well composed and poorly lit. Beyond that, the acting is fine, and the overall production values are good, but the script wasn't well vetted.What we have here is essentially a family member getting drawn in by a cult following. Only there's no setup for it. The fans are given a character who has a vision, but we as the audience are not privy to how that got manifested. Regular Joe movie goer and Star Trek fan alike needed the character driving the film to demonstrate to us how he got going. We're never given that. Therefore you have to take it on faith that there's going to be a payoff to the story at the end. And there is, but it's empty, or at best half full.The actors are older. And by older I think the script needed to address why these people were getting back together again, and to give the audience a bit of reality that, like a naval officer in any nation's navy in the here and now, you can't remain a command grade officer doing the same task over and over again. I do think that was needed to give some emotional grounding to this movie, to let the fans know that even in the Star Trek universe, life goes on.The film opens up with yet another shakedown cruise of the new Enterprise. Well, no offense, but is that ship ever going to be ready? In Star Trek the Motion Picture, ten years before, the Enterprise was about to go on a shakedown cruise. Then again in the next couple of movies. Granted this is a new ship, but, well ... is she ever going to be ready for active duty? One wonders.Shatner helming this installment of Trek actually does an okay job. Unlike Nimoy's style, where Nimoy focuses on character nearly to the exclusion of all else, Shatner doesn't lose sight of the fact that Trek was about addressing issues, and not really showing off how fun the characters can be (that rose organically out of the story and plot). But the story is more or less a glamorized TV episode, and for all of the high production values that went into the film, it does appear that things were skimped on for budgetary considerations.The planet in the opening scenes has a history. We're told about it in the dialogue, and never shown how it got to be that way, as perhaps we would have in a higher budget feature film. I already mentioned the main character of the film never giving his reasons, and us never seeing them, for his actions. The supporting characters also seemed to be a little too easily swayed for what the plot unveils. Again, this is not an issue in Shatner's direction of the film, but a script issue. And for the climax that we're given, things are lacking.So, implausibility from the start with a ship that is not fully ready, a main character whose background we don't get to witness in terms of the plot's relevance (i.e. why is he doing what he's doing), the world on which he is on is skimped on in exposition for the audience (and I'll add that the opening scene should have been grander; perhaps the main character stops a fight between two war-bands, showing the audience that he has great persuasion), inadequately staged SFX space shots, and, at the end, we're still not let in on who is doing what and why, nor why the main character brought the everyone to the point of climax in the film. Nothing is explained.And Trek fans, although being a pretty thoughtful bunch, perhaps couldn't quite nail what it is that was gnawing at them about this movie. And so they chose to nitpick at things until they believed they had found what was bothering them. I'll say this, if this film had been shot as a TV episode with a team of writers, it would not see day one in front of a camera until all the story shortcomings were worked out. As it stands I think the creative team felt they could patch over the points lacking in the story with dialogue and on screen talent emoting their parts. It's a superbly shot film as far as the live action sequences go, but without a cause for the characters to be doing their thing you're left with a pretty empty film.I don't know Shatner's background other than he was a Shakespearean actor before donning the Captain Kirk mantle, so I don't know whether he knew the script's faults before going in on the project, but he seemed to do the best job anyone could with the screenplay. And I think that's really all that can be said. Yes, there's a better movie there somewhere, but such is life. If you're just into the characters and want to see some Star Trek on the screen, then this shouldn't disappoint in that regard, but it does fall short of a full theatrical feature film.

This was not one of them. Likewise, though John Wayne was a somewhat limited actor, what he specialized in he did extremely well (e.g., Rio Bravo and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence). Unfortunately, for both Ford and Wayne, this film was less than impressive.If I were to pick only one single problem with this film, that problem would be the horrible acting of Constance Towers. One of the worst performances I've ever seen. While she made a few films, she mostly became a television actress (and as of this writing is still alive at 82). Well, no thank you. Her performance in the early phases of the film -- playing the Southern belle -- actually made me giggle. And it wasn't supposed to. Better she ended up on soap operas on afternoon television.Personally, I think there's also a problem with John Wayne's role here. Not with his performance, but with the way the role was written. He seems -- especially in the early parts of the film -- to just be an ass. He seems to insult pretty much everyone, including a doctor who is just doing his job. There is, in my view, nothing admirable in this John Wayne character.When it comes to William Holden, whether I like him or not depends to a large extent on the individual film (although more often than not, I did like him). Here I like him very much in a performance that is, perhaps, a bit more nuanced than usual.And, despite some weaknesses, there are some strong points to this film. Perhaps the most emotional being the young students at the rebel academy being called to fight.

What are you doing, well for the last three quarters of an hour I have been sitting on my ass waiting on you. This is Dirty Harry; he takes crap from nobody. The counterculture's only cop hero and he quits in the end. They would have fired him anyway. This is the best of the series; the rest are crap next to this one.

You will love hating him; you will look forward to seeing him get what he so richly deserves. Kids, women Andy doesn't mind torturing and killing anybody. His dialogue is so well written, no don't pass out on me yet you rotten oinker!!! The most famous scene, where Harry foils a bank robbery, while chomping on a hot dog, is drop dead funny. seeing this is a 44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off&#x85; Please, enough said, watch the movie. This film is non stop action with great comedy thrown in to lighten the grim story. The scene with the jumper on top of the roof; well, Harry is probably the world's worst social worker. It is also one of the funniest scenes in his films. Harry within the 'get the man' COOL HAND Luke era is a rebel like the hippies in the theater. The establishment does not work it is broken; Harry goes outside the rules like Luke. He has nothing but contempt for officialdom with a babbling idiot DA, played by Josef Sommer, prattling on about the rights of raving, murderous psychos. This fits so well with COOL HAND Luke, the counterculture hero fighting the rules 'get the man' Harry is the same. This is why it shot Eastwood to the moon; the perfect role at just the right moment of American History. The hippies fighting the 'man' all piled into the cinemas a rebel cop showing us how the 'man's system' was broken. At the end, Harry looks at his badge contemptuously and flings it away.

The mayor, played by John Vernon, who usually dominates in his roles, watch ANIMAL HOUSE, does not have a chance against Eastwood. What are you doing, well for the last three quarters of an hour I have been sitting on my ass waiting on you. This is Dirty Harry; he takes crap from nobody. The counterculture's only cop hero and he quits in the end. They would have fired him anyway. This is the best of the series; the rest are crap next to this one.

We learn all about how the mob runs Las Vegas. It was fascinating; I was ready to rate this above Goodfellas. The problem is that it all comes to a screeching halt about 45 minutes into the picture. Ace marries the hooker \/ hustler Ginger and the whole movie inverts, the casino story is relegated to the background and AS THE CASINO TURNS commences with some kind of sicko twisto love triangle with Ace, Nicky and Ginger with Lester thrown in for good measure. The casting is an utter disaster. Don Rickles as the casino manager? Look, Sharon Stone was beautiful but she was always a dreadful actress. Do not believe me? Check out all the films she wiped out with her awful acting. Sliver, The Quick and The Dead, Catwoman, The Muse; these were not all other peoples' faults. Here she shrieks often at the top of her lungs setting your nerves on edge; when she gets her voice up it sounds like dumping the silverware drawer on the floor. The last half hour of the picture has nothing to do with a casino; it is THE BICKERSONS. The highlight is Ginger ramming her car several times into Billy Sherbert's Caddy.

Please!! Martin always feels the need to gross us out; he says the world is a violent place. He feels the need to raise the bar every film. In Cape Fear, besides the lovely almost consummated pedophilia, nice touch Marty, we get a man biting a chunk out of a woman's face and spitting it on the floor. Bring the kids!! Here we get a man's head put in a vise and cranked shut until his eyes pop out. That is not enough for Marty, no we get to see Nicky and his brother beat to death with bats thrown alive into holes and buried. Hey, Marty, how about some cannibalism? Come on, something for the whole freaking family? The real reason Marty does this is he is one crappy filmmaker. His movies are boring; ever watched Mean Streets? How about Shutter Island?

Seeing it won 11 Oscar's and grossed over 1 billion dollars. I really did not care for this movie. It is long, boring and takes around 2 and a half hours for it to get good.Titanic is an ok movie. Leo does a good job like he always does, portraying a poor man who falls in love with a rich girl. Kate Winslet in my opinion, was a bad choice. She tries her best to act rich and proper but fails in general. Near the end she improves her acting but still is very stale. Billy Zane in my opinion really shines out of the two leads. He does a good job portraying someone who is very sophisticated, but also shines in all the other parts, when he is jealous of Leo and Kate's characters.What did I have wrong with the movie? It is so long. 3 hours and 14 minutes! It takes 2 1\/2 hours for it to get to the iceberg alone. The first 30 minutes of the film, is Bill Paxton and his crew trying to find the blue diamond (whatever it's called). Then the next 2 hours, are back and forth between Leo and Kate. While watching the film, I found myself tapping my foot in boredom and wondering when is it gonna get good. I really could have cared less for the first 2 1\/2 hours. Sure, there are a few good scenes here at there, but it takes so long for it to get to the good sequences.Even thought this picture is long, I should give credit where credit is due.

They were gifted musicians as well as comedians. Their comedy included dialog with one-liners and zingers, zany antics, slapstick and acrobatics. Some of their movies are among the funniest and best comedies of all time. Many sources regard Duck Soup as their best film. I don't, and here's why. This film was still early in their movie careers and strikes me as raw and unpolished. It has many lines and routines that seem right out of vaudeville. Indeed, the long scenes with the peanut vending come from a vaudeville act that the brothers recreate in a couple of movies. There's nothing wrong with the variety performances of vaudeville, except that today they are old hat and just not as funny. And many of the one- liners are so old that they too lack humor today. The long scenes of costumed players singing the Freedonia anthem lose their humor after the first one or two. Duck Soup seems to me to be a succession of skits held together by the thinnest of plots. Plots aren't necessary for great comedy, but then the comedy must be able to stand on its own. I just don't think Duck Soup has the comedy that does that. One last thing that bothers me about this film is the insult in some of Groucho's lines. It goes overboard here. As an aside, this is one of the few of the brothers' big films in which they don't perform musically. Their musical talents were surely of professional level and when they played in their other films, they added a little something to the story &#x96; and even to the mayhem at times. I rate A Night at the Opera as the best Marx Brothers film, and one of the greatest comedies of all time. Close behind it is A Day at the Races. Those films differ considerably from Duck Soup in that they have interesting serious plots that make for much more laughter with the zany scenes. And, they have much better developed dialog with witty lines and wonderful zingers. In the place of silliness (slaps in the face, verbal insults, etc.) that pepper Duck Soup, those films spend a little time with plot involving other actors. That makes the comedy all the more hilarious in the scenes that follow. Duck Soup may be the silliest movie the Marx Brothers made. But it's not the funniest by a long shot.

In the place of silliness (slaps in the face, verbal insults, etc.) that pepper Duck Soup, those films spend a little time with plot involving other actors. That makes the comedy all the more hilarious in the scenes that follow. Duck Soup may be the silliest movie the Marx Brothers made. But it's not the funniest by a long shot. Nor is it their best, in my view. ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, War"},{"date":"24 May 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It's 1957 Haley, Illinois.

Jacey tells Doug that Lloyd Abbott screwed their family out of money from their father's patent which saved Abbott's company. Lloyd warns the girls against Jacey.First of all, I hate the narration. It adds nothing but annoyance. I hate that Michael Keaton is narrating as an older Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix could have done it himself. The whole thing frustrates me every time it comes up. As for the actors, some of them don't seem to fit. Billy Crudup is suppose to be a ladies man and that's at the edge of his range. Joaquin Phoenix is suppose to be shy and awkward but he's outgrown that Parenthood character. Generally, I don't like the light breezy tone. The material seems to be build for something darker. The movie just doesn't have any tension. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 May 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It's 1957 Haley, Illinois.

Mertueil challenges Valmont to bed the soon to be married 17 year old Cecile de Volanges (Uma Thurman). Having determined that this challenge alone will be too easy for him, bed-hopping Valmont also sets about trying to seduce prim and proper Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer) whilst her husband is away. His prize for completing these tasks is Mertueil herself, but is all this as easy as Mertueil and Valmont hope? Cruel Intentions was a loosely based remake of this film which came out 11 years later; I enjoyed Cruel Intentions the first time I watched it and have seen it several times since, but sadly I didn't enjoy Dangerous Liaisons quite as much.I think the problem here is that I didn't find the story quite as involving; it was a bit talky for my liking and if truth be told it was probably a little over-plotted as well. In some ways, I was also a little turned off by the fact that it featured a bunch of rich aristocrats - I just found it all a little bit pretentious which is why I generally don't like period dramas. Dangerous Liaisons just seemed to amble along without ever really involving me in the story. Cruel Intentions told pretty much the same story in just over 90 minutes and one has to wonder why the writers felt the need for this film to run close to the 2 hour mark? The truth is that there just isn't enough material here to warrant that kind of run time.Another problem I had here was that I never really felt any connections to any of the characters; they weren't really fleshed out particularly well and at the end of the day I just felt like I'd spent 2 hours looking at cardboard cut-outs in pretty costumes. I also had a bit of an issue with Keanu Reeves character; he was the music teacher in this and aside from his wooden performance, he added nothing to the film and may as well not have been in it (compare that to how important the music teacher was to the plot in Cruel Intentions).Aside from an obviously miscast Keanu Reeves; the performances were all excellent with particular praise going to Malkovich, Close and Thurman. Thurman was perhaps the biggest revelation and I felt that she accentuated vulnerability and was actually very good.The film doesn't even shine at the end and has a rather formulaic and obvious ending. To me the whole film just felt rather flat and un-exciting. I found the ending to Cruel Intentions to be moving and somewhat surprising.Dangerous Liaisons has far too much polish on it for it to be a truly bad film, but it's also not involving enough for it to be considered a great film. I thought Cruel Intentions was a better film to be honest.
