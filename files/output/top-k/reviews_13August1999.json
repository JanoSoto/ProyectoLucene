I happen to fall in the middle.  I enjoyed this film, though not immensely.  I found it funny, which actually kind of disturbs me in a way.  Should it be funny when someone accidentally gets blown away? Yet I found it to be.  Still, I think the extreme amount of violence got to me, since it mostly did not have much of a point; it is really only the one scene of violence that I thought was amusing.  I thought the Bruce Willis storyline could have been done without, instead focusing on Travolta and Jackson.  Instead, the story meanders and seems largely without purpose.  Despite that, though, it was still an enjoyable film.  I recommend it as long as people realise what they're in for, and don't just watch it because of the hype surrounding it; when someone expects perfection and they don't get it, they tend to over-compensate and react more negatively than they otherwise would have, and end up giving this film a 1 instead of the 5 they might have given it had they not been shocked by the content.I give this film a 6.5, mainly for the dark humor.  This movie is not for everyone.  Don't watch this movie with blinders on, and hopefully it will be worth the 2 hours and (possibly) the $3-4 you spent to rent it (although in Canada, I know you can watch an unedited version of it on Showcase- that channel is great for films they can't show on the networks without such severe editing that part of the story is lost).  The other thing I liked about this movie was the characters themselves; Tarantino is very good at taking what would from the outside seem like despicable, inhumane creatures and making them human.  While I don't know how many hitmen are actually nice guys, it is nice to see films sometimes that have normal people doing bad things, instead of just evil, rotten, flat characters.  This film is thus a good character study, for those interested in the workings of the human mind.

And now hearing this at the beginning of Notting Hill with the  image of Anna Scott\/Julia Roberts makes me nearly faint. It is incredible beautiful. It sets the mood. I knew after 20 seconds that I would love the movie. That is something that only happened once before with Trading places and there the music was by Mozart. Why did it happen again with Aznavour? I don«t know. It is magic.If there is something wrong with the film it is that it is too perfect. There is not one bad scene in it. Never too slow never too fast. At first viewing I thought that the young ladies William«s friend introduce to him were a little off. But at second time I found that even these scenes worked. So it is a little bit synthetic. They tried to take everything from Four Weddings without really repeating themselves. All clich&#142;s are avoided. And that is something you feel and it made me just a little bit uncomfortable. But if it is done as brilliantly as that I do not mind at all.Although I do not like Julia Roberts that much Notting Hill was in a way even better than Four Weddings. And not because of Spike but because the character Hugh plays is better developed. Playing a young man who is shy (and polite) and at the same time witty he is totally believable. This is something only Hugh Grant can do. Along with Cary he is the only actor who really gets away with the fact that he is handsome (from a male point of view). Robert Redford for example or Clint Eastwood just seem to be too much in love with themselves to be endured. If I were a woman I would probably fall in love with someone like Jimmy Stuart but if the man had to be handsome only the Grants would be eligible. Others like Paul Newman or Gregory Peck look great without being annoying but they are too much like gods. You would not really want to be with them.One thing Notting Hill has adopted from Four Weddings is that the female character is not as pure, good as the male and that one can still understand why our hero loves her. And when Julia makes her I am just a girl speech I had tears in my eye. Rule of thumb Any film that makes me cry gets a 10.I had the good luck to watch the film in the original at first time. Normally a film does not loose much being dubbed. (Woody Allen is supposed to have said that the German voice fits his character better than his own and I certainly agree, same would be true for Robert deNero for example.) But Hugh«s timing is so exact that in this case the original is twice as good. But even the German version would get a 10 easily.

I've read so many versions of the Arthurian chronicles and I've liked all of them; the Mallory telling remains my favorite. But this. This was an insult to anyone who paid attention in their British\/World Literature class, and was most definitely a slap in the face to anyone familiar with the Arthurian Legend in any form. Each and every scene is a direct contradiction to anything recorded. Sure, it's supposedly a legend, and therefore open to artistic license, but this dismal rewrite becomes nothing more than a good idea gone horribly and terribly wrong.

Again, call me a purist, but I refuse to believe Arthur died in anything close to that manner, and I'll go to my end defending it. And this Malagant (whoever the heck *he* was, I recall his name nowhere in anything I've ever read) becomes nothing more than a plot device to spice things up when the dialogue starts to get slow again. You can't just bring in the villain because the lines are petering out! By the end of the movie you can just about time his entrances by the steady breakdown of whatever plot is left. And just where was Merlin? Shame on Sean Connery for doing this farce of a movie; I expected much more from an actor of his stature and talent. The chemistry between Gere and Ormond is at absolute zero; he should really stick to movies with Julia Roberts if he'd like to succeed at the box office. Connery is a decent Arthur for all that, but he cannot save this movie. Nothing, not even King Arthur himself, could save this movie.

Another contrast; while those three films had some big laugh moments in them(like in L.A.

He is probably tired of kids hitting him with axes and machetes and knives because in this episode of Friday the 13th, he is just plain mean.  Not that he was a nice killer in the previous entries, but this time he just seems like he is taking it personally.The Final Chapter is one of the best horror films I've ever seen and if you are a fan of the series, this is as good as it gets.  There are some great scares, a likable cast, wonderful direction, nudity and Tom Savini decides to show up to make the final death of the film a memorable one.  If horror films of the 90's could have this much energy then we wouldn't be starved for crap like Urban Legend and Idle Hands and others.  This is what horror movies are all about and this is a great horror film.What we have in terms of a story is Jason escapes from a hospital in a very tense beginning.  Right away, the film starts with some great scares and some really violent deaths.  Poor Axel, he doesn't fare too well.  And from here we are introduced to the typical characters, six vacationing kids and a mother and her daughter and son and Gordon ( the family dog).  We also have a Jason hunter that is due for a grizzly death.  But the funny thing about the Friday the 13th's is that even though the actors are on screen for such a small amount of time, we actually grow to like or dislike them.  And so when one of them dies we are actually cheering or dismayed that they kick it.  I really liked Jimbo in here.  And when he died ( in a most heinous way ) I was a little bothered.  Then when I saw what Jason does to him after he is dead, well that was just cruel.  But the worst death in this film ( and this rivals Andy getting split in two in the third installment ) is Paul. He meets an untimely death by being introduced to a harpoon gun in a part of the body that it is not meant to receive that kind of attention.  And this death is just another example of the hilarious gag in the series where Jason seems to find weapons that just shouldn't be there.  I mean a harpoon in this one and a spear gun in the third?  That is funny.Friday, the final chapter is a great example of a scary horror film that concentrates on gore and suspense.  It is easily the best in the series and if you forget what it is like to watch the early efforts of the series, then my recommendation is to watch the first four.  They are great and if the series would have ended here, this would have been a perfect ending.This is the best Friday the 13th.  Watch and enjoy.

He is probably tired of kids hitting him with axes and machetes and knives because in this episode of Friday the 13th, he is just plain mean.  Not that he was a nice killer in the previous entries, but this time he just seems like he is taking it personally.The Final Chapter is one of the best horror films I've ever seen and if you are a fan of the series, this is as good as it gets.  There are some great scares, a likable cast, wonderful direction, nudity and Tom Savini decides to show up to make the final death of the film a memorable one.  If horror films of the 90's could have this much energy then we wouldn't be starved for crap like Urban Legend and Idle Hands and others.  This is what horror movies are all about and this is a great horror film.What we have in terms of a story is Jason escapes from a hospital in a very tense beginning.  Right away, the film starts with some great scares and some really violent deaths.  Poor Axel, he doesn't fare too well.  And from here we are introduced to the typical characters, six vacationing kids and a mother and her daughter and son and Gordon ( the family dog).  We also have a Jason hunter that is due for a grizzly death.  But the funny thing about the Friday the 13th's is that even though the actors are on screen for such a small amount of time, we actually grow to like or dislike them.  And so when one of them dies we are actually cheering or dismayed that they kick it.  I really liked Jimbo in here.  And when he died ( in a most heinous way ) I was a little bothered.  Then when I saw what Jason does to him after he is dead, well that was just cruel.  But the worst death in this film ( and this rivals Andy getting split in two in the third installment ) is Paul. He meets an untimely death by being introduced to a harpoon gun in a part of the body that it is not meant to receive that kind of attention.  And this death is just another example of the hilarious gag in the series where Jason seems to find weapons that just shouldn't be there.  I mean a harpoon in this one and a spear gun in the third?  That is funny.Friday, the final chapter is a great example of a scary horror film that concentrates on gore and suspense.  It is easily the best in the series and if you forget what it is like to watch the early efforts of the series, then my recommendation is to watch the first four.  They are great and if the series would have ended here, this would have been a perfect ending.This is the best Friday the 13th.  Watch and enjoy.

This is not a good film and I can't see how the next could be any better, unless Cameron directed..... nah, that would be too good to be true.

Alien was a good film with lots of atmosphere.  Aliens was one of the best films ever made and it was one of the few films that I can say actually made me frightened and nervous.  Alien 3 was stylistic but annoying and Alien 4 displays nothing that made the first two great.  In the first and especially the second, Ripley was a scared but tough heroine that knew better than anyone what the Bitch was capable of.  In the second film she says things like  I hope you're right because just one of things managed to wipe out my entire crew.   Now she is a cyborg and she has no fear and that takes away one of the most rudimentary things that made the first two scary.  We could live vicariously through Ripley and her fear.  But in this one, it is just a bunch of idiots running around that we don't care about.  In Aliens we had Hudson ( is this going to be another bug hunt SIR? ) Hicks ( okay, we waste him, no offense ) Vasquez ( I just need to know one thing, where they are ) and even Apomb ( look into my eye! ).  These characters added an element to the film that Alien 4 could never hope to copy.  So what are we left with?  I'm not sure, but it is not a good product, that is for sure.  Even Winona Ryder can't do anything with the role that she was given.  So the series has worn out it's welcome.  It's time to put it to rest.
