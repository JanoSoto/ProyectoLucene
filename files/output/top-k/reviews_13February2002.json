Oh, Rita the high-paid lawyer with her cel phone and Porsche needs to be taught what's important by the mentally handicapped guy. Wow! The symbolism of the paper wall being torn down so she can TELL HIM (and the audience) everything that has just happened for the past two hours. It's like the filmmakers didn't trust the I.Q. of the audience either so they always nudged you and pointedthings out to you, just in case you were slow and weren't getting the message. Not sure what to feel here, well, we have some bad Beatles covers all cued up with a lyric here that will TELL you how to feel right now. Sheesh!!! Oh, the cynical, hard-working career woman needs a mentally retarded guy to TEACH her to be a better parent! There wasnt a subtle bone in this film's body - and then they have the NERVE to mention Kramer v.s. Kramer a few times and then they have a cop-out ending just like that film. (At least in Kramer - they let Hoffman lose in court and THEN Streep's character totally sells  herself out and hands the kid back over just so they could have a weepy, tacked-on happy ending.) But in this, they dont even have the judge make a decision - god forbid real life and real law interfere with this fairy tale, let's just have the Laura Dern character hand the kid back to Sean Penn - here ya go, take her, that way we dont have to have any more conflict or show the reality of the court system dealing with such a case. Time for the movie to end, time for a happy ending, cue up the Beatles music and cry. And I am huge fan of Penn's work in the past (Bad Boys, Fast Times, Taps,Racing With the Moon and of course, Dead Man Walking)but he was so inconsistent here - there were times when he had such intelligence in his eyes and then other scenes where he had found the look - the look that Leonardo was so brilliantly able to create during ALL of Gilbert Grape. Look, it's a hard thing to play for an actor. Mentally retarded, blindness - more actors fail than succeed. Plus, the voice Penn decided to use was so Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Now - the little girl, Dakota Fanning was stunning. Not a false move. She steals the movie. And yes, of course, there are touching scenes - you CANT do a film about a parent losing a child in a custody battle without hitting on some real emotional moments - but the film is more interested in fake tears and easy endings than reality. The actual REALITY of a retarded man trying to raise a child. Does he love her? Of course he does. That's not the point. The point was, as the court said, what is best for the kid. But the film seemed more interested in dealing with black and white, Penn- good, Courtroom people - bad!!! Please.

I have a strong feeling in my psychic verberaorations Ripper's life is about 100 times more fun than this doo-doo.Its sad because this is a great premise for a story, small time kid who plays in tribute band actually gets to sing for the band he has been emulating his whole life.  That's super.  Well Wahlberg plays the geekiness\/metalness pretty well.  But get this, even though he has dedicated his LIFE to loving, imitating, and worshipping this band, he gets all goofed up over the fact that he can't write their songs now that he actually is in the band.  Suddenly he doesn't know that the guitarist and drummer always write the songs(That would seem like vital info to a true fan).  Suddenly this is a problem.  WHAT?

Steven Spielberg had the script of an action film about Tornados in America and realized that this should be a job for someone who can put the audience in the edge of the seat; Jan De Bont was the obvious choice, and this obvious choice, proved once more to be one of the best action directors around.

Twister is one of those movies that you see not by its story and its depth, but for its compelling imagery, water tornados, sandstorms, cows hurling in the air, everything is seen during the heroes chase for the ruthless Twister.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"13 February 2002","score":"","review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** After reviewing many of the comments already left for this movie, I felt I had to offer my two cents. As a Philadelphia native, this movie has always held a little extra appeal for me, so I disclose that fact at the outset. Personal bias not withstanding, however, Rocky is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am probably not your typical Rocky fan- for one thing, I'm not a fan of Sylvester Stallone, I am a woman, and I was born after the movie made its debut. In spite of all of those factors, I love this movie and have seen it countless times.As one reviewer pointed out, Rocky is not a boxing movie. The comments regarding how Rocky is just another underdog-wins-big sap fest clearly do not remember the film that well, or perhaps are thinking of one of the many sequels. In most movies celebrating the underdog, the protagonist sets out to prove to the world that he is capable of greatness and triumphs. By contrast, Rocky has nothing to prove to anyone but himself. Rocky does not fight for the recognition of others- he fights (literally and metaphorically) for self-respect.Rocky learns to respect himself and, in a not unrelated side-effect, earns the respect of others. Rocky, who has never applied himself in any endeavor, learns that for others to respect him, he has to respect himself. That concept manifests itself in a boxing match and the training that leads up to it. On one level, Rocky trains his previously neglected body for the big event. On another level, and the far more interesting one, Rocky trains his previously neglected self-concept and learns that he is worthy and capable of the respect of others, as well as of self-respect.Both training endeavors develop in the context of the relationships Rocky pursues. First, we see the relationship between Rocky and his trainer, Mickey. Mickey has written off Rocky, as evidenced by a great scene where Rocky shows up to train only to find that Mickey has given his locker to a new boxer. Mickey regularly calls his student a bum and it is clear he has no faith in Rocky's abilities to do anything other than break thumbs and bust noses for his loan-shark employer. Mickey does not want anything to do with Rocky until he sees an opportunity to capitalize on Rocky's chance to fight Apollo Creed (lucky for Rocky, since noone else was lining up for the job). Rocky clearly believes Mickey's assessment of both his fighting prospects and internalizes the message of the father-figure to his life prospects as well. (Mickey tells him you're a waste of life.). Mickey is a bitter-old man who feels he missed his chance to be a great fighter and wants to attach himself to a winner- he does not see Rocky as his ideal match. However, fate is such that Rocky is the one who will give Mickey the chance to have a moment in the spotlight and to feel success.Another interesting relationship is that of Rocky and mousy pet-store worker Adrian. Adrian also won't give Rocky the time of day, however, it is not because she feels he is a bum. It is because she, too, doubts her worth. As we later find out, Adrian's mother once told her something to the effect You better develop your brains, 'cause you don't have much of a body. Rocky was once given a similar piece of wisdom by his father who said You better develop your body, 'cause you sure didn't get much of a brain. Adrian, however, sees in Rocky something she doesn't see in herself- power and determination. It is only through her relationship with Rocky that she eventually stands up for herself to her alcoholic brother, Paulie. At the same time, with Adrian's approval, Rocky learns to have faith in himself, and she gives him the strength (ironically) that he needs to get into the ring with the champ.The most interesting relationship in the movie occurs between Rocky and Paulie. Paulie works at a meat packing plant, where Rocky sometimes trains by pounding slabs of beef. Paulie is a truly pathetic figure, an alcoholic who is cared for by his sister who latches on to Rocky, another loser. It is when Rocky has a chance at success, a prospect that continually eludes Paulie, that Paulie erupts and confronts his friend, addressing feelings of abandonment and rejection. He is a tragic figure, and the perfect dramatic foil. It is not hard to imagine Rocky in such a context 20 years down the line unless he capitalizes on the opportunity to make a good showing for himself.The reason these relationships are so pivotal to the movie is because they contribute to Rocky's development. When Rocky, rejected by Mickey (also a father-figure) learns of his opportunity to fight for the championship, he assumes that Apollo Creed just wants an easy mark. Ever the realist, Rocky has no delusions of beating Creed. However, Rocky realizes that this is his chance, and probably his only chance, to show those in his life, including himself, that he is worthy of their time and respect. Rocky does not want to be just another bum from the neighborhood, and while he fights Creed physically, he is battling the demons of complacency, failure and mediocracy at the same time. To overcome the internal struggle, Rocky does not need to overcome Creed- he merely needs to show himself that he is good enough to be a contender. Noone suspects, for a moment, that Rocky could win the physical match as well.One point which is often overlooked is that Rocky LOSES the big fight. Creed wins by a decision. However, Rocky wins in the sense that he has proven to himself that he can make a respectable showing for himself if he works hard and is dedicated. He has also earned the respect of Mickey and Adrian. For Rocky, the fight was not for the championship - it was for respect and self-respect. And while he lost the boxing match, he won the bigger fight and thus has won regardless of the outcome.It is hard to imagine someone not liking this movie. The characters are real people, not likeable so much as familiar, not sympathetic as much as tragic, not winners so much as people who've found acceptance within and with others. One is far more likely to identify with Rocky than with Rambo- every day, people feel the struggle to earn and maintain self-respect amid others who doubt their abilities and perseverance. No one wins every battle, but so long as a good showing is made, the battle may be lost, but the war is won.I'd recommend this movie to all but the most literal-minded movie-viewer.

As a Philadelphia native, this movie has always held a little extra appeal for me, so I disclose that fact at the outset. Personal bias not withstanding, however, Rocky is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am probably not your typical Rocky fan- for one thing, I'm not a fan of Sylvester Stallone, I am a woman, and I was born after the movie made its debut. In spite of all of those factors, I love this movie and have seen it countless times.As one reviewer pointed out, Rocky is not a boxing movie. The comments regarding how Rocky is just another underdog-wins-big sap fest clearly do not remember the film that well, or perhaps are thinking of one of the many sequels. In most movies celebrating the underdog, the protagonist sets out to prove to the world that he is capable of greatness and triumphs. By contrast, Rocky has nothing to prove to anyone but himself. Rocky does not fight for the recognition of others- he fights (literally and metaphorically) for self-respect.Rocky learns to respect himself and, in a not unrelated side-effect, earns the respect of others. Rocky, who has never applied himself in any endeavor, learns that for others to respect him, he has to respect himself. That concept manifests itself in a boxing match and the training that leads up to it. On one level, Rocky trains his previously neglected body for the big event. On another level, and the far more interesting one, Rocky trains his previously neglected self-concept and learns that he is worthy and capable of the respect of others, as well as of self-respect.Both training endeavors develop in the context of the relationships Rocky pursues. First, we see the relationship between Rocky and his trainer, Mickey. Mickey has written off Rocky, as evidenced by a great scene where Rocky shows up to train only to find that Mickey has given his locker to a new boxer. Mickey regularly calls his student a bum and it is clear he has no faith in Rocky's abilities to do anything other than break thumbs and bust noses for his loan-shark employer. Mickey does not want anything to do with Rocky until he sees an opportunity to capitalize on Rocky's chance to fight Apollo Creed (lucky for Rocky, since noone else was lining up for the job). Rocky clearly believes Mickey's assessment of both his fighting prospects and internalizes the message of the father-figure to his life prospects as well. (Mickey tells him you're a waste of life.). Mickey is a bitter-old man who feels he missed his chance to be a great fighter and wants to attach himself to a winner- he does not see Rocky as his ideal match. However, fate is such that Rocky is the one who will give Mickey the chance to have a moment in the spotlight and to feel success.Another interesting relationship is that of Rocky and mousy pet-store worker Adrian. Adrian also won't give Rocky the time of day, however, it is not because she feels he is a bum. It is because she, too, doubts her worth. As we later find out, Adrian's mother once told her something to the effect You better develop your brains, 'cause you don't have much of a body. Rocky was once given a similar piece of wisdom by his father who said You better develop your body, 'cause you sure didn't get much of a brain. Adrian, however, sees in Rocky something she doesn't see in herself- power and determination. It is only through her relationship with Rocky that she eventually stands up for herself to her alcoholic brother, Paulie. At the same time, with Adrian's approval, Rocky learns to have faith in himself, and she gives him the strength (ironically) that he needs to get into the ring with the champ.The most interesting relationship in the movie occurs between Rocky and Paulie. Paulie works at a meat packing plant, where Rocky sometimes trains by pounding slabs of beef. Paulie is a truly pathetic figure, an alcoholic who is cared for by his sister who latches on to Rocky, another loser. It is when Rocky has a chance at success, a prospect that continually eludes Paulie, that Paulie erupts and confronts his friend, addressing feelings of abandonment and rejection. He is a tragic figure, and the perfect dramatic foil. It is not hard to imagine Rocky in such a context 20 years down the line unless he capitalizes on the opportunity to make a good showing for himself.The reason these relationships are so pivotal to the movie is because they contribute to Rocky's development. When Rocky, rejected by Mickey (also a father-figure) learns of his opportunity to fight for the championship, he assumes that Apollo Creed just wants an easy mark. Ever the realist, Rocky has no delusions of beating Creed. However, Rocky realizes that this is his chance, and probably his only chance, to show those in his life, including himself, that he is worthy of their time and respect. Rocky does not want to be just another bum from the neighborhood, and while he fights Creed physically, he is battling the demons of complacency, failure and mediocracy at the same time. To overcome the internal struggle, Rocky does not need to overcome Creed- he merely needs to show himself that he is good enough to be a contender. Noone suspects, for a moment, that Rocky could win the physical match as well.One point which is often overlooked is that Rocky LOSES the big fight. Creed wins by a decision. However, Rocky wins in the sense that he has proven to himself that he can make a respectable showing for himself if he works hard and is dedicated. He has also earned the respect of Mickey and Adrian. For Rocky, the fight was not for the championship - it was for respect and self-respect. And while he lost the boxing match, he won the bigger fight and thus has won regardless of the outcome.It is hard to imagine someone not liking this movie. The characters are real people, not likeable so much as familiar, not sympathetic as much as tragic, not winners so much as people who've found acceptance within and with others. One is far more likely to identify with Rocky than with Rambo- every day, people feel the struggle to earn and maintain self-respect amid others who doubt their abilities and perseverance. No one wins every battle, but so long as a good showing is made, the battle may be lost, but the war is won.I'd recommend this movie to all but the most literal-minded movie-viewer. The movie is subtle in its many layers of appeal. The performances are not over the top but quiet, reflective and pensive.

And the french title has the words fantastic destiny in its title. It is a very nice and charming piece of work, but with plenty of dark humour, extreme details and references to several other films.

I can't remember what film\/story it is, but the traveling gnome for one is not Jeunet's idea.

Yes, it has been done 100 times over..but not this way..M ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"13 February 2002","score":"","review":"  On one hand, this film is a simple, straight-forward, Hollywood star vehicle for Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.  On the other hand, there is actually a really strong story here, very well told, with good performances, a great script, and more than enough twists to keep even the most jaded viewer puzzled.To go along with these two levels are two versions of the film.  The theatrical version, released in 1946, was significantly re-edited to put more attention on the combination of Bogart and Bacall.  At the time, Bacall was a hot property with a shaky future.  Her career was on the edge, and she needed The Big Sleep to succeed in order to cement her standing in Hollywood.  But remember, this is the studio system.  Warner Bros. was even more concerned about her career than she was.  So, when the film was originally completed, red flags flew up all over the place, and people were scared that it would kill her career.  There needed to be more sexy dialogue between Bacall and Bogart.  The romance angle between the two of them had to be played up much more.  It's what the audience expected, and if you give them something other than that, even if it's good, the film will fail.  And for the love of God, get rid of the bloody veil.  Unfortunately, something of the story was lost.  The Big Sleep has a seriously complicated and confusing storyline.  The 1946 theatrical version adds to the problem.  That's why (call me a philistine) I prefer the 1945 pre-release version.  Yes, you heard me right.  I'd happily give up a silly, pointless conversation about horses to get that scene in the D.A.'s office.Look, I'm a fan of Bogart's.  I really am.  But no one is going to pretend he's the greatest actor in the world.  I happen to think he's under-rated, personally, but he's still no great shakes.  Better than Keanu Reeves, nowhere near Anthony Hopkins.  And Bacall... well, she's not nearly as good as Bogart.  The great strength of this film is the script and the story.  There's lots of great dialogue.  There are loads of colorful, devious, fascinating characters.  There is a fantastic, clever, and meticulously plotted story.  Why undercut all of those things to devote more screen time to Bogart\/Bacall?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not questioning the wisdom of the studio's decision.  They needed a star vehicle, so they made it a star vehicle, and it worked.  The judgement of history has to be with Warner Bros.  But Warner Bros. had a different set of criteria to make their decision.  They were worried about money... box-office receipts for this film, and the future marketability of Lauren Bacall.  But I don't care about that.  I'm just interested in the better film, and the pre-release version, in my opinion, is clearly the better film.  I do have one question, though... who killed Owen Taylor?  The conventional wisdom is that it was Joe Brody.  But watch the scene in Brody's apartment again.  Remember, this is a Hollywood detective movie from the mid-forties.  The scene clearly plays as though Brody didn't Taylor, and it certainly appears that Marlowe believes Brody on this point.  If it really was Brody, then this scene ends up looking weak.  If Taylor killed himself (highly doubtful, considering the evidence), that's even more weak.  Oh well.  It's really a quibble.
