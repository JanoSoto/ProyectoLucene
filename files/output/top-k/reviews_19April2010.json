Shot after beautiful shot of the Austrian hills, one after the other, until in the final shot we notice a tiny little figure off in the distance. The camera moves in closer to reveal that the figure is of course Julie Andrews who does a little twirl, spreads her arms and bursts into that oh so famous song. And immediately you get the sense that this movie is going to be something rather special. Critics will say that The Sound of Music is overly sweet and sugary. Well, what's so bad about that? We can use a little sugar now and again. This may well be the ultimate feel-good movie. There are so many reasons why this film is, for so many people, absolutely one of their favorite things.The film's story is so familiar that a recap of the plot seems rather pointless. Suffice to say that it is a great story which provides a worthy foundation for the moments, the songs, the beauty and, above all else, the performances which make the film so memorable. Of course as great as the cast as a whole are there is one performance which stands above the rest. Has any performer in any role in any film ever been as perfect as Julie Andrews as Maria in The Sound of Music? The perfect look matched with the perfect voice. Her acting is superb. Her singing is the stuff of legend. How do you solve a problem like Maria? Don't even try, just allow yourself to be charmed by her. And she can work her charm on anyone, even the toughest nut to crack, Captain Von Trapp. In the film's other starring role Christopher Plummer's Captain provides the perfect complement to the unrelenting sweetness of Andrews as Maria. But of course it will turn out that he's not really as deadly serious as he initially seems. At least he won't be after Maria brings some desperately needed joy back into his family's life.Yes it seems Maria is too good to be true. She's absolutely bursting with life and everyone around her gets swept along for the ride. And the audience gets swept along too. There are so many moments here to bring a smile to your face. Everyone remembers the songs of course. And well they should, they're spectacular, with Do-Re-Mi in particular being just about as fine an example of film-making as you'll ever see. Brilliantly choreographed, beautifully photographed, exquisitely edited...that sequence is pure genius. But this movie is so much more than its wonderful songs. There's the engaging story and the beautiful scenery. There's the tremendous cast, headed of course by the wondrous Andrews but with plenty of opportunities for so many others to shine including the young performers portraying the wonderfully precocious Von Trapp children. If there is any real quibble with the film it's that the third act seems a little tacked on. There's a natural high point in the story which would seemingly have made for the perfect, happy conclusion. But with the Nazis lurking in the background of the film's story throughout you knew they eventually had to rear their ugly head. So right after that natural high point it's Nazi time and the third act takes on a very different tone from all that has preceded it. Deep down you know the third act is important, that this is how the story really has to play itself out. But with all the dark, foreboding drama at the end you can't help but think you'd just rather be watching Julie Andrews get in another pillow fight with a bunch of children. But the film's conclusion, while certainly not all raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, does allow for its own moments of triumph. Ultimately the film gets the rousing conclusion it so richly deserves. The Sound of Music is an absolute treasure, a film which will be beloved for all time.

The beginning seems a very good idea, I first saw this film in 2000, although at my then young age I was put off by some elements of the film, I generally loved it. It's possibly the quirkiest and strangest film I own. It is surreal, and has an original, clever and funny plot. It is rare to find a film quite like this one, the acting is superb, especially the title character of John Malkovich. Cameron Diaz is also worth a mention, for an engaging and brilliant performance, I would like to see a lot more of this sort of thing from her, as opposed to the usual stuff she makes. Her appearance in this film proves that she can act.Spike Jonze, the films director, previously made his name directing music videos. Being John Malkovich, was his first foray into the feature film, in my opinion he has acquitted himself honourably. The direction is brilliant. Especially, a lot of the puppet sequences, which were fantastic and show real skill. Jonze has also filled the film with quirky little touches, for instance when Craig first discovers floor 7 1\/2 it is exactly 7 minutes and 30 seconds into the film. While adding nothing at all to the film, it does come across as a clever thought. Another clever clue, is when Lottie ( Diaz) enters the Malkovich room in Lesters house, if you look at the door knob, it is precisely the same one as on the portal door.One of my favourite scenes of the film is when Malkovich himself enters his own mind. The first time I watched the film I had a due sense of horror and dread as he crawled along the little tunnel. I really had no idea what was going to happen. It is rare to find a moment in a film which is as clever as it is funny, yet when Malkovich enters his own mind we are rewarded with just a moment.The pacing of the film is excellent, in films of this variety, it normally works that the build up is excellent, but the ending is a total let down, on thus occasion I don't think that is the case at all. Throughout the films entire length, you're eyes are glued to the screen. The story moves forward at exactly the pace you want it to, I never once feel desperate for the ending, and I don't have any unanswered questions at the end of the film, which is always a good sign.I must talk about John Malkovich, who I tghink was crucial for the film to work. In my eyes had you replaced Malkovich with any other big name actor the film wouldn't of worked. Malkovich's acting was excellent, and you can clearly tell that he had fun playing a fictionalised version of himself. On some omissions actors clearly go for a role they know will be fun, I think that is what Malkovich has done here. Taking on an extremely rare opportunity to portray himself. Well I say portray himself, for that is another brilliant part of his performance, how he is able to get the audience to suspend their disbelief and really believe there is someone else controlling his body, actions and life. I can't speak highly enough of Malkovich, he has taken everything in his stride and has clearly had a good time, and is a very good sport for allowing certain childhood scenes to be shown, when most actors would of refused.The film does have some serious issues, for example it does offer an opinion on the American publics growing obsession with celebrity, and the desire to achieve fame and wealth. The films tag line 'Ever Wanted To Be Someone Else?', sums this up. The film does show the lengths some people are willing to go to, to get what they want.

She's so, so.......Joan Crawford. One thing rarely mentioned about Joan aside from her eyebrows, her shoulders, her drinking etc. is her voice. She's able to change her voice in a movie to fit scenes when appropriate.In this one, in the last scene when she is explaining everything, her voice is a little deeper and sounds so reasonable and sane compared to the rest of the movie. It reminds me of one line she said in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane when she tells the maid Elvira We're sisters, Elvira. We know each other very well. It has such a worldly, knowing quality to it that I enjoy. She's done it in other movies where she delivers a really good line with that deeper, more natural voice.One of Joan's signature moves in many of her films (I don't recall if it was in Straight jacket) is to walk away from the camera while having a dialog with another actor. She'll walk up to a fireplace with her back to the camera and then make a swift turn to face the other actor and deliver her line. It's always so dramatic.Another thing I liked in her earlier films in the 40s was the diagonal shadow that shaded the lower part of her face, making her eyes even more expressive. I wondered if that was what they copied in the Addams Family Values film when Angelica Huston's eyes were always lit with an oval shaft of light wherever she was.Although her films after WEHTBJ weren't the best but still campy and fun, it was too bad she couldn't or wouldn't get parts that mature actresses could play like other actresses her age. I wonder if it was her alcoholism that affected her judgment even though she worked hard and was professional to the end with some really bad scripts, e.g. Trog.She still fascinates to this day. They don't make 'em like that any more. I tended to believe most of what was written by her daughter in Mommie Dearest as I've seen people behave differently in private than in public all my life. I don't think she was a warm or friendly person but I would have liked to meet her and tell her how much I enjoyed her work. And she did work-hard. In a way, it's sad that such a hard working, disciplined actor had such a downhill direction in her career and personal life in her later years.

It reminds me of one line she said in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane when she tells the maid Elvira We're sisters, Elvira. We know each other very well. It has such a worldly, knowing quality to it that I enjoy. She's done it in other movies where she delivers a really good line with that deeper, more natural voice.One of Joan's signature moves in many of her films (I don't recall if it was in Straight jacket) is to walk away from the camera while having a dialog with another actor. She'll walk up to a fireplace with her back to the camera and then make a swift turn to face the other actor and deliver her line. It's always so dramatic.Another thing I liked in her earlier films in the 40s was the diagonal shadow that shaded the lower part of her face, making her eyes even more expressive. I wondered if that was what they copied in the Addams Family Values film when Angelica Huston's eyes were always lit with an oval shaft of light wherever she was.Although her films after WEHTBJ weren't the best but still campy and fun, it was too bad she couldn't or wouldn't get parts that mature actresses could play like other actresses her age. I wonder if it was her alcoholism that affected her judgment even though she worked hard and was professional to the end with some really bad scripts, e.g. Trog.She still fascinates to this day.

I don't think she was a warm or friendly person but I would have liked to meet her and tell her how much I enjoyed her work. And she did work-hard. In a way, it's sad that such a hard working, disciplined actor had such a downhill direction in her career and personal life in her later years.

Having an older brother and sister and witnessing there early teenage years I could recall some nuances in D&C that seemed like Deja Vu. Many comments on this board refer to how accurate Director Linklater is in showing what high school people were like in the 70's. But he doesn't have much material to work with other than Muscle cars, long hair, bell-bottoms and groovy music. So I can't say that the effort on production value was elaborate or extensive.If you are looking for involving drama and some real laughs you will not find it here. What we see is basically a near documentary. Linklater has given us a picture, but he hasn't given us a movie. Linklater doesn't spend much more than a couple of minutes on one scene before he pans to another scene of a group of teenagers, etc. It's that kind of movie. The purpose here is to paint a cinematic scrapbook, a timepiece with minor events and inane escapades of high school kids looking for a thrill. Some of the dialogue and characters were funny and a couple even reminded me of some people I knew in my youth. The most interesting character, Slider, played very well by Rory Cochrane captures the spirit and personality very well of a teenage stoner. We initially see him as a cool and hip pot-head with some witty remarks exhibiting a crafty and sly demeanor. But we later discover that he is rather insecure and more of a tag-along to his friends.Besides some of the actors who showcase like McConaghey, Affleck, and Jovovich, some of them appear like amateurs and newcomers to acting. Mainly the younger kids and the parents I am referring to.Dazed and Confused serves its purpose in that it wants to be like a walk down Memory lane. Some of the actors capture teenage uncertainty and ennui. Who can blame them. The 70's teenagers didn't know how to define themselves. The post-Watergate era was caught between the cultural revolutions of the 1960's and before the materialistic 1980's took effect. Women's solidarity hadn't come into status quo yet either. We see freshman girls being hazed by the seniors through some initiation ritual as the upper-class boys passively sit back and watch. Ben Affleck (O'Bannion) and his bully cronies launch a rampage of swatting upcoming freshman with big paddles. I guess some kids were so bored and devoid of fun and games that they resorted to abusing the younger kids due to their own lack of fulfillment and direction in life. I persoanlly don't recall paddling in high school. That actually happened in college through the fraternity curcuit. But I do remember bigger kids abusing younger ones.All the characters seem to be on an even keel. Each character has the same adequate screen time as another. So we really don't have any leads, heroes or heroines, etc. The star quarterback, (London) seems too mature for a high school kid. He exudes a sort of older brother wisdom and rationale; it's not an appropriate acting choice given his age. Everyone else seems real in that you really can't ask for much when you take young actors and have them dress in shoddy 70's clothes and let them act indifferent and bored.

For a movie that is almost forty years old, I'm still thinking about it. There are many words that can describe The Exorcist. Enchanting. Brilliant. Frightening. Intense. Powerful. Creative. Disturbing. Shocking. These are just a few words that come to mind. The story is simple enough. Innocent girl possessed by a demon. But what makes The Exorcist different from any horror film is that it's not about blood and gore like most slasher films, and there are characters we care about, rather than just a bunch of airheads in which we tend to find ourselves rooting for the villain to slaughter them. Yes, there is plenty of disturbing scenes throughout The Exorcist, but it's a character-driven film. That's what I really enjoyed about this movie.All the performances are brilliant. Ellen Burstyn perfectly conveys the tension and fear a mother would experience during such a horrific supernatural event. Max Von Sydow (who's only in the movie for about twenty minutes) gives a performance that should've won him an Oscar. He conveys the sense of hope in the film. His words, The power of Christ compels you! still rings in my mind.Jason Miller expresses the sadness and imperfection that every person experiences, which is particularly unique since his character is a priest. And I can't forget Linda Blair as the little girl who's possessed. Even though Mercedes McCambridge did the voice of the demon (a voice that I will never forget), Blair's facial expressions and actions throughout the film as she transforms from good to evil is nothing short of perfect. And the fact she did this role at such a young age should've also garnered her an Oscar.The other aspect I cannot overlook in this film is the technical feats. As an individual whose just finished learning video production, I found the works of cinematography, editing, and sound design to be top-notched, even by today's standards. I mean, the filmmakers made a bed float in the air before the invention of CGI! That cannot be beaten. And the whole Exorcist sequence, well, I'll just say I could not keep my eyes off of the screen. I've now have come to appreciate William Friedkin as a legendary director for pulling off such a brilliant film.This movie won 2 Oscars back in 1974 for adapted screenplay and sound. Yet again, another superior film has been screwed over by the academy. I try not to put much stock in awards, but The Exorcist is a rare jewel that should not have been so sourly overlooked. This may be a horror film, but it's not like any other one. There's plot, characters, symbolism, and important messages of self-sacrifice and the presence and triumph over unimaginable evil.

In today's world, which is filled with talentless tabloid kings and queens posing as actors, studios that are too afraid to do anything new, and directors who overdo camera tricks to adapt the story for the most inattentive viewer, good movies, especially thrillers, are hard to find. If you want a good thriller, then see Double Indemnity.The film is told in flashback, with a wounded man confessing to his crime. That man is Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), an insurance salesman who falls for a put-upon housewife named Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Together, they plan to kill Phyllis's husband (Tom Powers) and collect on a huge insurance claim. But as perfect as their plan seems to be, thing's don't go the way they thought they would.The acting is outstanding all around. I was surprised to learn from Robert Osborne's intro that Fred MacMurray was known for his romantic comedies. MacMurray is outstanding; he's perfect in a noir thriller (even rivaling, if not besting, Humphrey Bogart). Barbara Stanwyck is brilliant as the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. Actually, calling her that isn't exactly true. For the most part, she's just as nervous and desperate as Walter is, although there is more to her than Walter initially realizes. It's amazing that Stanwyck, who was by all accounts a kind and gentle person off-screen, could pull off a role like this. Edward G. Morrow nearly didn't accept the role because after recently securing leads, he didn't want to give the impression that his career was on the downturn by taking a supporting role. It's a good thing that he took it, because Morrow is pitch-perfect in the role of Barton Keyes, Walter's boss. Actually, after watching him in Key Largo, I didn't think I'd be able to buy him as a sympathetic character. but Morrow pulls it off. When Walter says that Barton is a gruff man with a heart, we can really see it. Able support comes from Jean Heather, as Phyllis's step-daughter, Lola and Byron Barr, as Nino Zarchetti, Lola's boyfriend.During the period of the Hays Code, most of what happens had to be done through words, not action. Therefore, it might be a little disconcerting for viewers who are not used to films from this period to find that Walter and Phyllis fall for each other without sex of any kind, and only through words. Stanwyck and MacMurray pull it off, however.It helps that the script is a masterpiece of story construction, with dialogue that occasionally borders on brilliant. There's a fair bit of humor early on, particularly a scene between Walter and Phyllis that is a conversation about speeding tickets that serves as a series of sexual innuendos. The scene is quite clever and funny, though it does not inhibit the suspense that builds potently for the rest of the film. The story is highly inventive, with plenty of twists and turns, none of which are expected.This was the third Oscar nomination for writing that Billy Wilder received, but it was the first time his skills behind the camera were so honored (he didn't win either for this film, but the very next year he took home statues for both co-writing and directing The Lost Weekend). It's not hard to understand why he was nominated for both for Double Indemnity. The film is told with the hand of a master. It's rarely confusing (the ending is slightly so), and Wilder's sleight of hand is so subtle that the twists are impossible to see coming.

There's a fair bit of humor early on, particularly a scene between Walter and Phyllis that is a conversation about speeding tickets that serves as a series of sexual innuendos. The scene is quite clever and funny, though it does not inhibit the suspense that builds potently for the rest of the film. The story is highly inventive, with plenty of twists and turns, none of which are expected.This was the third Oscar nomination for writing that Billy Wilder received, but it was the first time his skills behind the camera were so honored (he didn't win either for this film, but the very next year he took home statues for both co-writing and directing The Lost Weekend). It's not hard to understand why he was nominated for both for Double Indemnity. The film is told with the hand of a master. It's rarely confusing (the ending is slightly so), and Wilder's sleight of hand is so subtle that the twists are impossible to see coming. And the tension is constant and unceasing.If you want to see a good murder mystery with great acting and actual suspense, check out one of the best Golden Oldies, Double Indemnity.

Maybe not as good as Seven Samurai, but boy it is by far one of the better remakes out there. If you want a bad remake, see Psycho, starring Vince Vaughan or The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, in my opinion they should never have been made. The Magnificent Seven is an example of how a remake should be made, it was one of those pleasant surprises for me of as soon as the first note of the score blared I knew hey this is great stuff.The plot is simple, but I like simplicity, sometimes simplicity is good, but it is a great concept and very well constructed. It really helps as well that the action sequences are tremendously exciting, and that the landscapes are truly dazzling. Elmer Bernstein's score has a lot to do with The Magnificent Seven's success I think as well, it is rousing, triumphant and bombastic and very like the score for Lawrence of Arabia it sticks in the mind for a long time afterwards. If I were to choose to which score I preferred over this and the Great Escape, I think this score, The Great Escape was great but I have always found that whenever I hum both tunes people are less annoyed by The Magnificent Seven.The screenplay is focused, humorous and wise, maybe a little stilted on occasions but it develops the characters well and has heart. And the actors are wonderful. Yul Brynner is the epitome of coolness here, I do think he was better in The King and I, where he was absolutely magnificent, but he does a great job here. Eli Wallach is suitably slimy as the villainous Calvera, who is more than a cardboard cut-out, and Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Robert Vaughn are all great.

For how it portrays love, and its impossibilities, it belongs with Casablanca, and what came before. The world, and the British, were reinventing themselves, after the war, and this world, of having to choose between passion or conventions was soon to be dead. But the play is from 1937, and was kept pretty much unchanged in what it depicted. So this film is as much in between worlds, in between conceptions of love, of cinema, of social conventions, as Rachmaninoff is a modern mind living in a Romantic world.To me this is a tragedy wearing a romance's clothing, but as a film, this one is dated. don't misunderstand me, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Simply new codes were invented, new (or simply different) demands were infused in the audiences. To our modern ability to see, the film is overly staged, the acting is overly dated. But we do have a great female interpretation by Celia Johnson, and that sure is a strong point, because the film depends a great deal on us buying our way into the world as seen by Laura.

In fact, the film was so well received when it debuted that the song Buttons and Bows went on to be a bit and a sequel came out four years later. In the sequel, of sorts, Jane Russell and Bob Hope return--but as different people (Hope plays the son of the man from this film). Why is this film so good? Well, part of it is that the music (which they seemed to always shove into 1940s comedies) isn't bad, the script quite good and the characters quite enjoyable.The film begins with Calamity Jane (Jane Russell) being broken out of jail. However, this is no ordinary prison break--it was organized by the government because they wanted Jane to do some undercover work. But, they staged it so that her partners in crime wouldn't suspect she'd made a deal to help out in exchange for a pardon.Soon after agreeing, she meets up with Bob Hope--who is a rather addled dentist. She pretends to fall in love with him and marries him to create a cover for herself--not because she has any interest in being married. And, considering that Hope is annoying and a wimp, you'd think he's realize he's being used. But, he's pretty dumb and has no idea his wife is a special agent or that they aren't making love. Every time she kisses him, she whomps him over the head--and he thinks she's so hot that is why he passes out! Eventually, the trail of the baddies leads to an Indian camp and Hope's prowess as an Indian fighter will lead to his dying a horrible death. That's because Jane has, on the sly, done all the trick shooting that everyone thinks Hope has been doing--and taking credit for throughout the film! Will they get out of it alive? Will love bloom for real? Will Bing Crosby make a cameo? Tune in to see.Overall, while the film ain't exactly subtle, it's pleasant fun from start to finish.

Meanwhile Joan has her leg elevated admiring it and pointing her foot in her high heel shoe, somewhat distracted by its shapeliness, I guess.Then, while the young woman and Betsy Palmer are on the floor looking at blueprints of the house Betsy will live in, they don't hear Joan enter till you see her high heel shoe with its ankle strap stepping on the blueprints and ruining their fun.Another delightful moment is when Barry Sullivan, 'Beauty' is in his office pacing in front of his desk where Joan is seated out of camera range while he is trying to tell her he wants a divorce. It's a heavy, serious scene. The camera pans over to Joan who is admiring herself in her compact make up mirror in a wonderfully blasé, Joan Crawford way.These little moments are worth sitting through some of the tedious plot development.

The dialog is one long shot while Sullivan is tying his bow tie, something we don't see in today's movies with all the quick edits.

Previously, he had been nominated a few times, once for his performance in The Sands of Iwo Jima and he should have made the nomination list seven years later for The Shootist, but this was the one and only time Wayne was accommodated for his acting. For that reason, True Grit is one of the Duke's most popular movies. But I think to tie its popularity only to this post-release award is a little unfair. True Grit receives my highest rating of four out of four (ten out of ten) an award I seldom shell out not merely because it feature John Wayne in an Oscar-winning performance, but because the entire as a whole is one of the gems of the genre. It's a virtually impeccable Western.The movie is adapted from a novel by Charles Portis about a young woman whose father is murdered by an outlaw, who then joins a robber's gang and flees into the Indian Nations. Young and arrogant Mattie Ross, played with strong conviction by Kim Darby, recruits a one-eyed, alcoholic marshal named Rooster Cogburn (played by, guess who?) and a fame-seeking Texas Ranger (Glen Campbell) to hunt down the outlaws and achieve her revenge. The three make an uneasy team, but as they fact danger and dodge bullets as well as rattlesnakes, they grow on each other a little more.The screenplay is the strongest element of True Grit. John Wayne called it one of the best scripts he'd ever read and it's one of the best he's ever brought to life. I don't know how much it derives from the book, which I have not read, but the screenplay by Marguerite Roberts effectively characterizes every cast member into a well-rounded human being. It's also packed with highly memorable dialogue such as Looking back is a bad habit and A gun that's unloaded and cocked ain't good for nothing. The performances by the cast are very strong. John Wayne shells out one of his best performances (he won the Oscar, after all) as the hard-nosed marshal with a drinking problem, but a good heart. Wayne was perfectly cast for the role. He'd played all sorts of tough guys before True Grit and combined assets of them all into one character. The screenplay gave him the motivations, but Wayne brought out the performance. Glen Campbell, though inexperienced as an actor, gives a commendable performance as the Texas Ranger. Robert Duvall is icy and solid as the mail robber with a grudge against Wayne. Jeff Corey is terrific as the cowardly outlaw and Kim Darby magnificently takes dialogue that might otherwise make her irksome to the audience and wields it with brilliance to make it so that she only has that effect on the other characters.True Grit is a classic of the genre. It has fantastic performances especially by Wayne and Darby, a fantastic music score by Elmer Bernstein, riveting bursts of action, iconic moments such as the climactic showdown, an effective blend of all of this with humor, and marvelous timing. I've seen True Grit at least ten times over the years and I haven't tired of it yet. It's not that there's something new to see each time, but just that you can't wear out such a compelling, solid Western.

","genre":"Adventure, Western, Drama"},{"date":"19 April 2010","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I was always aware of this movie back when I was a kid when they used to play it on TV, but for some reason it didn't interest me. Recently, I was surfing through the channels one late Saturday night, and I came across Soylent Green. Although I just got to see the second half of the movie, there was something about it that attracted me to see it. It was so good that later I purchase it on DVD and I was totally blown away by it. Now, today's demanding audience, are used to elaborate CGI, big explosions, and mindless violence. In Soylent Green you won't find that. Instead, you will find an intelligent movie with a deep environmental commentary, especially for its time. The StoryThis movie is scary, but not in the way you might think. It's scary in its near accuracy and depiction of overpopulation. The story takes place in N.Y.C in the year 2022, where pollution, poverty and overpopulation have reached a frightening point. Soylent is a multinational corporation that provides wafer like rations for the hungry masses. Detective Thorn, played by Charlton Heston, is set to investigate the murder of William R. Simonson, a VIP from the Soylent Corporation. The murder was meant to look like a common burglary, but while conducting the investigation, Thorn notices that there was no force entry and the supposed burglar didn't take anything from the victim's apartment, concluding that it was an execution. He informs his superiors about it, but they seem to be part of a cover up. Thorn, request his friend and roommate, Sol, played by Edward G. Robinson, to help him investigate some books he retrieved from the crime scene. Thorn gets deeper in the case and he also becomes a target. Eventually, Sol discovers the disturbing secret of Soylent Green. The CharactersThe highlight of the movie, other than the story which is great, has to be the acting and dialog of the characters. Detective Thorn is cynical, sarcastic and indifferent with others, but through the course of the movie, he becomes self aware of the pain of others and we get to see him change. Sol is the soul of the movie. He is an elderly cop who reminds Thorn of a different world in another time. There's a quote Sol said that really stuck with me, People were always rotten, but the world was beautiful. Shirl or the furniture is a young and naïve girl that has opted to become an accessory for those who can afford her. She is often treated as an object by Thorn, but eventually, a relationship between them grows. The ConceptThis is a future where mankind has totally messed up. People literally live on top of each other and basically live in every inch of space they can find. Natural food is a luxury, and even synthetic food is hard to acquire. The rich pays $150 for a jar of strawberry jam and vegetables and meat are a rarity. Society has become a police state, where only the privileged have access to curfew passes. The masses are treated as garbage, this is shown in a scene when Thorn is at a riot because Soylent rations finished at an exchange station and people are literally are being dumped into garbage trucks. But most disturbing is how the film shows how hopeless, aimless and godless people are in this world. Overpopulation is pretty real and it is expected to double in the next 40 years.The ActingI think the chemistry between Heston a Robinson is phenomenal. I truly enjoyed the dialog between them, and their relationship. There is a scene where Thorn and Sol are having a diner with the goods Thorn was able to collect from Simonson's apartment. You can see the how they enjoy their meal, giving you a sense of appreciation for what you have.Final WordsThis movie was made in 1973 and it does look like a 70s movie. It looks bleak, dark, and grainy. There is no advance technology and no alien monsters, but instead, the movie carries a heavy message of awareness of things to come. The ending revelation of what is Soylent Green is no secret by now, but I am not going to say it just in case you haven't seen it. The beauty of sci-fi is that it challenges you to think and rationalize on present issues that are happening around the world today.

Recently, I was surfing through the channels one late Saturday night, and I came across Soylent Green. Although I just got to see the second half of the movie, there was something about it that attracted me to see it. It was so good that later I purchase it on DVD and I was totally blown away by it. Now, today's demanding audience, are used to elaborate CGI, big explosions, and mindless violence. In Soylent Green you won't find that. Instead, you will find an intelligent movie with a deep environmental commentary, especially for its time. The StoryThis movie is scary, but not in the way you might think. It's scary in its near accuracy and depiction of overpopulation. The story takes place in N.Y.C in the year 2022, where pollution, poverty and overpopulation have reached a frightening point. Soylent is a multinational corporation that provides wafer like rations for the hungry masses. Detective Thorn, played by Charlton Heston, is set to investigate the murder of William R. Simonson, a VIP from the Soylent Corporation. The murder was meant to look like a common burglary, but while conducting the investigation, Thorn notices that there was no force entry and the supposed burglar didn't take anything from the victim's apartment, concluding that it was an execution. He informs his superiors about it, but they seem to be part of a cover up. Thorn, request his friend and roommate, Sol, played by Edward G. Robinson, to help him investigate some books he retrieved from the crime scene. Thorn gets deeper in the case and he also becomes a target. Eventually, Sol discovers the disturbing secret of Soylent Green. The CharactersThe highlight of the movie, other than the story which is great, has to be the acting and dialog of the characters. Detective Thorn is cynical, sarcastic and indifferent with others, but through the course of the movie, he becomes self aware of the pain of others and we get to see him change. Sol is the soul of the movie. He is an elderly cop who reminds Thorn of a different world in another time. There's a quote Sol said that really stuck with me, People were always rotten, but the world was beautiful. Shirl or the furniture is a young and naïve girl that has opted to become an accessory for those who can afford her. She is often treated as an object by Thorn, but eventually, a relationship between them grows. The ConceptThis is a future where mankind has totally messed up. People literally live on top of each other and basically live in every inch of space they can find. Natural food is a luxury, and even synthetic food is hard to acquire. The rich pays $150 for a jar of strawberry jam and vegetables and meat are a rarity. Society has become a police state, where only the privileged have access to curfew passes. The masses are treated as garbage, this is shown in a scene when Thorn is at a riot because Soylent rations finished at an exchange station and people are literally are being dumped into garbage trucks. But most disturbing is how the film shows how hopeless, aimless and godless people are in this world. Overpopulation is pretty real and it is expected to double in the next 40 years.The ActingI think the chemistry between Heston a Robinson is phenomenal. I truly enjoyed the dialog between them, and their relationship. There is a scene where Thorn and Sol are having a diner with the goods Thorn was able to collect from Simonson's apartment. You can see the how they enjoy their meal, giving you a sense of appreciation for what you have.Final WordsThis movie was made in 1973 and it does look like a 70s movie. It looks bleak, dark, and grainy. There is no advance technology and no alien monsters, but instead, the movie carries a heavy message of awareness of things to come. The ending revelation of what is Soylent Green is no secret by now, but I am not going to say it just in case you haven't seen it. The beauty of sci-fi is that it challenges you to think and rationalize on present issues that are happening around the world today.

While working on the building, terrifying events start to happen and it is soon realized that the hotel has been built on one of the gates of Hell. A local doctor and mysterious blind girl join Liza in trying to fight the evil forces that are unleashed by this portal.The Beyond is not a film for those who cannot ignore bad acting, terrible dubbing and ridiculous dialogue. All of those faults are certainly present here. However, seeing as this is an 80's Italian splatter movie, you shouldn't really expect things to be anything different. The whole purpose of this film is to disgust and thrill you. It's pure horror, with very little logical sense. Despite the lack of attention to acting and plot, there is no denying that visually this is a well made and imaginative movie. The widescreen compositions are often very good. There are a number of very striking scenes. The monochrome prologue is well conceived and nasty, setting a grim early tone. The dreamlike scene where Liza encounters the blind girl on the deserted bridge is excellent and an example of the occasional haunting moments that punctuate The Beyond, in direct contrast to the more obvious gruesome material. The other standout set-piece for me was the sequence in the morgue, where the bottle of acid falls onto a woman, while her daughter flees from the resulting sinister approach of the acid blood &#x96; this scene, by the way, is entirely devoid of any logic whatsoever, but it just works as a really original nightmare moment. Another element that effectively makes no sense when you think too much about it is the presence of the blind girl. She seems to be a ghost, yet is somehow still killed violently. I'm not entirely convinced by this logic. Nevertheless, she is the best character in the film and on top of that has a really good spooky piano-driven theme tune.It probably goes without saying that the gruesome effects and zombie makeup are very good here. Lucio Fulci is best known for his splatter films, and this movie certainly shows why. The level of imaginative slaughter is notable, and the zombies for the most part are well conceived. There's eye violence, a brutal crucifixion, many heads blown apart and even an extremely nasty zombie dog attack. There is also a scene where tarantulas eat someone's eyeballs. I absolutely hate this particular scene though and simply cannot watch it again. As an arachnophobia sufferer I simply find this idea vile. If you don't like spiders be warned. Another bugbear for me is the annoying fact that the hero keeps on shooting the zombies anywhere but the head after then point where it is blatantly obvious that head-shots are quite obviously the only way forward. But at the end of the day, sense is not a defining feature of early 80's Italian splatter films. And this one at least for the most part works as a fun ultra-violent nightmare.
