The latter film came on first and I had a blast watching it(don't discredit me for that). Then came this film. After it was over my friends and I had nothing good to say about it. We mainly talked about how much we enjoyed the Jason movie. Compared to the previous films, with the exception of 'Freddy's Revenge', 'The Dream Child' kind of sucks. To me it is the most heavily cut of the bunch, and it goes the whole horror\/comedy route which, in my opinion, worked in the previous installment but not in this one. The only part I found funny was in the opening scene where Freddy comes face to face with his nun mother, Amanda Krueger. Their exchange was pretty amusing, especially what Freddy tells her just before the church doors slam. Hilarious.The film opens with Alice, one of the survivors from the previous film, in a dream sequence centered around the conception of Freddy Krueger, the whole son of 100 maniacs theme, with her as the mother. She wakes up disturbed and freaked out that she was not in control for the first time since she defeated Freddy. Alice temporarily puts it behind her in order to enjoy her graduation, but then later wakes up in a hospital to learn that she is pregnant and one of her friends has died in a car accident. This time around the dream sequences are happening while she is awake. This is because Freddy is using the dreams of Alice's unborn fetus to slay her remaining Elm Street friends. Pretty clever premise, nonetheless spoiled by a lack of stand-out. Alice isn't as interesting this time around, and Freddy is hardly on screen enough to please fans. It still works, though, thanks to the character Yvonne(Kelly Jo Minter)who played in several 80's films including 'Summer School' and 'The People Under The Stairs'. She's the unbelieving best friend with an attitude, and her job at the hospital is constantly in jeopardy because Alice keeps coming in rambling about Freddy Krueger haunting her baby's dreams. Kelly Jo is just fun to watch, and her being in the film is the only reason I continue to watch this one.Dream sequences include a girl being force fed her own voodoo doll insides, a comic book world in which an ideal hero turns back into his own paper-thin wimpy self after being felled by Freddy's claw, a diving board that turns into a big claw, and an odd motorcycle sequence that I can't really describe. I think others have referred to it as the Freddy bike. All the sequences would have been way better if they weren't so tame. I expected much more grossness to the force feeding sequence. It was obviously trimmed down. One shot shows her being fed the first bite, and in the very next shot her cheeks are completely full. In another scene, after one of the characters gets sliced up in a dream sequence all that we are shown back in reality is a bloody hand. That definitely spells disappointment. I shouldn't blame the filmmakers for trimming and trimming the scenes enough to get by with an R-rating, but since there is no unrated version then the R-rated version is all I have to base this review on...and I didn't like it this time. 4\/10 is my vote. I hate having to rate it so low, but this installment is just not one of my favorites. Bottom line is that 'The Dream Child' is completely unscary with almost no gore or violence, so it relies on storytelling, dialog, and a lot of character interactions to pass the time. This was supposed to be a horror movie. At one point or another your going to have to toss a good amount of blood towards the camera to get my vote. Followed by 'Freddy's DeadThe Final Nightmare'.

Some of the effects work extremely well - some may be a little over done. Richard Dreyfuss plays the lead very nicely, and all the cast members are credible in their roles. I particularly liked Melinda Dillon's performance(I've always thought her to be a undervalued performer). Francois Truffault, the famous French director, has a rare turn as the leader of a group by the UN out to make alien contact. Ultimately when you shed the special effects, the aerobic direction of Spielberg, the fine performances, the haunting images of Devil's Tower in Wyoming(and all the things shaped to its mold), and the familiar, wonderful musical score by John Williams, you have a film with a great deal of heart and hope - Spielberg never even really lets the negative POV rear its ugly yet realistic head into the film. From the beginning man and alien encounters are deemed friendly and part of man's future.

I hadn't seen something like that since watching Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2.This one is supposed to be taking place thirty years after that film, which if it took place in 1940, places this one in 1970. No effort is made to make it appear to be set in the future, apart from aging the characters from the first movie.In The Mummy's Hand, Babe shoots four shots at point-blank range into an Egyptian High Priest, who then falls down a long flight of stone steps. Even though we are shown this clip, later in the movie we see that priest as an older man, initiating his son, the way he'd be initiated in The Mummy's Hand. He claims he'd only been shot once, in the arm. Yeah, right.The Mummy is also back, after having been shot at and burned in the prior film. The only difference seems to be that he has no eyes now (I'm not sure how he gets around, maybe by sound like The Blind Dead, who director Amando de Ossorio thought of as mummies, not zombies?). He's got old bandages wrapped around him. His old bandages should have burned, so presumably he was re-wrapped with old bandages (since if new ones were used, he wouldn't be as scary). Additionally, while Kharis needed to have potions of Tana leaves planted on the premises of people he was supposed to kill in the last film, here he can be sent out without that.The young Egyptian gets a job as a cemetery caretaker in America, where the Banning family lives, so he can set the mummy on them for having violated Princess Annanka's tomb. He doesn't seem to have any plans to try to get her or her treasures back from the museum, which is never seen. He seems set on killing the Bannings, apparently not knowing about Babe - who had shot his father! He only goes after Babe after Babe shows up and figures out the mummy is back, and the priest overhears him. Likewise, the priest doesn't seem to know or care about finding out what happened to the magician and his daughter. The daughter, we learn, died, but the priest never hears that. The magician, I suppose, disappeared.This Egyptian priest, like his father before him, and like Kharis before them, falls in love with a woman who does not have any feelings for him. Like his father, he uses the mummy to try to retrieve her.Seeing the mummy hobbling about in suburban American neighborhoods seemed fairly absurd. It would have been easier for the priest to go into the homes of the people he wanted dead and shoot them! Also absurd is the point at which all the townspeople go hunting for the mummy with torches! Would anybody in 1970s American be able to produce and light a torch at a moment's notice, like nineteenth century European villagers in a Frankenstein movie? They also start to burn a house down to get the mummy, thinking nothing of destroying the house. They don't try to kill him in a more efficient way, and seem to give no thought to the welfare of the mummy's captive. Some also try shooting him when he is struggling with someone, giving no thought to the bullets passing right through him. Of course, no one is harmed. Additionally, while the mummy seems afraid of fire, torches are thrown at him to no effect, and he also walks through fire a few times without burning.Overall, this is a pretty flawed movie. Still, watching it was sort of fun, and it's hard to dislike a classic Universal monster movie.

Basically Bastian Bux (Barret Oliver) is a lonely little school boy who is a constant victim of bullying, particularly from three older meaner kids, and to escape this he has a big imagination and a love for reading, this does concern his widowed father (Gerald McRaney) a little. One day while running from his bullies Bastian hides in a bookstore, owned by grumpy bookseller Mr. Koreander (Thomas Hill), and asking about one particular book, The NeverEnding Story, he warns him it is not safe, but without him looking he borrows the book, leaving a note to return it. So he starts reading the book, and in his imagination he is transported into the world of Fantasia, a land threatened by a destructive force known only as The Nothing, an unseen darkness that destroys everything in its path, so a Rock Biter (Alan Oppenheimer), messenger Teeny Weeny (Deep Roy) and his racing snail, and Nighthob (Tilo Prückner) with his narcoleptic bat seek help. The only hope for Fantasia everyone knows is the Empress (Tami Stronach) who lives in the Ivory Tower, but servant Cairon (Moses Gunn) tells everyone that she is sick and dying, so they have sent for the Plains People to send a warrior, and they get young Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), and he is given the medallion the AURYN to guide and protect him. While Atreyu starts his quest riding with beloved horse Artax, the Nothing sends its vicious wolf-like beast servant Gmork (also Oppenheimer) to kill the warrior, and the young hero ends up trudging through the Swamps of Sadness, where the poor horse is overcome by the sadness and sinks to his death beneath the swamp. Atreyu continues through the swamp to find the wise giant tortoise-like creature Morla, Bastian is heard by them screaming at her appearance that he can see, Morla does not answer his questions, she only tells him to go to the Southern Oracle, which is over ten thousand miles away. After narrowly escaping Gmork, Atreyu finds himself in the company of luck dragon Falkor, who has taken him most of the ten thousand miles to the home of two gnomes, one being scientist Engywook (Sydney Bromley), who is an expert on the Southern Oracle, including knowing about two gates to be passed before reaching the Oracle itself. After passing the two eyes that know if you believe in yourself and kill you if you have no faith, and a mirror that shows your true self, or in Atreyu's case he sees Bastian, he reaches the Oracle, that tell him that the Empress can only be saved if he can find a human child on the boundary of Fantasia that can give her a new name. Atreyu and Falkor fly to find the boundary, but they are caught in the powerful storm of the Nothing, Atreyu falls and wakes on a shore of an abandoned town, and it is there that he comes face to face with Gmork, who explains the power of the Nothing, and realising he is the warrior he was hunting he attempts to kill him, but the boy stabs him. After being saved by Falkor, the storm has destroyed all of the land, until only fragments of it remain, Atreyu asks the AURYN to guide them to the Ivory Tower if it still stands, they are happy to find it, and inside the young warrior is apologises to the alive and well Childlike Empress (Tami Stronach) that he failed in his quest. She reveals that he has not failed, the human child he seeked has been with him all the time, it is Bastian, and as Bastian realises it is more than a story the Nothing returns to start destroying the Ivory Tower, the Empress please to Bastian to save them and shout her new name, so he goes to the window and shouts Moonchild. After a few seconds of darkness, the Empress appears in front of Bastian in a black void, holding one grain of sand, what remains of Fantasia, she tells them that if he uses it to make wishes Fantasia will be restored, so he wishes for the land back and to ride Falkor, see Atreyu and all other characters revived, and also to fly Falkor into his city and scare his bullies away. The narrator (Oppenheimer again) says that Bastian made many more wishes and had many more adventures, before eventually returning to the real world, but that's another story. Oliver is likable as the child reading the story, and the supporting characters all add something to the tale, especially lovable Falkor the luck dragon and the funny Engywook, but obviously Hathaway as the young warrior is the one that you watch and root for the most. This was the English language debut for Petersen, and it is a great film because it is so simple, it has fantastical lands and imaginative creatures, the action and is exciting enough, the special effects and puppetry used are terrific, and even cheesy things like some of the dialogue and the title song by Limahl work well, it is a great fun family fantasy adventure.

Seeing this film again, I was more impressed by Al Pacino's rendition of some excellent scriptlettes and the deliciously bad sex appeal it offers. Only Al could perform these soliloquies; he made the hair on my neck stand up with his performance of these intelligent, cutting perceptions of the sic fat, vane, bloated world we live in today.

I can not stand this sequel at all, Batman and Robin was better then this crap! The sequel brings in two tone villains from the cartoon that nobody even liked including The Penguin and Catwoman. Danny Devito was the best choice for the Penguin but I never liked the villain. He just seemed like some old guy in the sewers with a birth defect who likes to play with birds and collect umbrellas. Catwoman was a bad choice for second villain. She made no sense to be here, I hated her character as well. Plus ever sense the Halie Berrie version of Catwoman came out, you can't take Batman Returns Catwoman seriously. Christopher Walken as Max was alright, not a bad guy from the cartoons but he was a good mad up bad guy who ran on his own rules. Keaton returns ounce again as Batman and his performance has dropped low ever sense the first Batman. Sure this film is dark and has an edge but it falls like a rock. Batman and Robin at least was perfect for a six year old to enjoy while this film would make kids run and cry. The villains are lame, the plot with Penguin is stupid, and the directing is all down the toilet. Batman Returns gets the big 2, low sequel that has no entertainment.

Who brings a priceless and vicious vigor to the roll which is almost impossible to top. Alex and his gang of 'Droogs' wreak havoc on 21st century London, as they rape, rob and rampage throughout the early scenes of the film and novel alike. Both stories following each other very closely with just a few minor changes. But when Alex is betrayed by one of his traitorous droogs after giving him a thorough 'Tollchocking' He finds himself holding the bag for a burglary gone awry. Which turns into the bludgeoning death of an elderly cat lover. With a long and frightful arrest record Alex finally lands in prison. Where he sets out to convince the in house Chaplin and anyone else who'll listen that he is reformed and ready to rejoin society. And when a radical new treatment becomes available to one lucky inmate. A therapy which can be completed in a mere two weeks. Alex considers himself the perfect candidate to be revamped and released in a fortnight's time. Not realizing that he will become 'A Clockwork Orange.' When Kubrick previewed his film for critics and audiences alike. People were stunned by what they saw. And whether or not you liked it or hated it one thing was for sure. No one had ever seen anything like it. The 'Ultra violence' is amply gratuitous and the rape scenes are harrowing, especially for the era that only immediately followed the sexual revolution. It's hard to imagine that Kubrick got the code and ratings administration to slap an R rating on there. Actually the film was originally hung with an X rating and it only after Kubrick revamped the editing, which included speeding up some scenes which were downright pornographic that he was able to get the labeling changed to an R rating. The dialogue is similar to the dialect which Burgess employed in his brilliant novel. Which is Alex's own mix of Russian, street slang and the regular King's English. Hearing McDowell speak these lines with wit and vinegar is very satisfying. His performance is a special accomplishment. I'm sure he brought more terror and life to this persona than even Burgess, who was also an accomplished conductor and writer of classical music, dared dream. And Kubrick isn't too bad himself. No one had ever even attempted to make a film this daring up to that date. And whether you gather the moral implications or not. There's not one scene that wouldn't entertain as it's own entity. With the engrossing and fascinating McDowell leading the way in almost every frame. Many have called Kubrick the greatest film maker of all time. Including, among others, the not too shabby himself Martin Scorsese. And after watching 'A Clockwork Orange' and being thrilled by it for the umpteenth time. I can find no avenue to disagree.

Where it's going? Where it's coming from? The people you share it with? The events that have shaped your life right up until this point in time? That's the dilemma Truman Burbank is facing.Truman (Jim Carrey) lives in the idyllic town of Seahaven. The sky is always blue. The people are always friendly. He has a loving wife and mother. It's as if everybody knows everybody. Life couldn't be better. But something is missing from Truman's life in a way he can't explain.Although Truman's life is seemingly perfect, he doesn't get much fulfilment out of it. There's a desire burning in Truman to explore. To see the world. To get out of Seahaven. But most importantly, to find a woman called Sylvia. A woman he grew to love. A woman who filled the void in his life. A woman he has never forgotten.If Truman's life sounds perfect to you, that's because it's been engineered that way. Unknown to him, his entire life is a TV series. A series called The Truman Show.Truman is the star of his own personal reality show. Cameras follow his every move. The town of Seahaven is an elaborate set, and the townspeople are actors. Including Truman's wife and mother! The events of his life are all under the watchful gaze of Christof (Ed Harris), the show's creator and overall overseer. He decides Truman's destiny, his every decision, possibility and train of thought. He controls Truman's dreams and ambitions, broadcasting his life to an audience of millions.The Truman Show is a truly extraordinary film. One of the most daring, thought-provoking and intriguing films to come out of Hollywood in God knows how long. The attention to detail in this film is just amazing, but it's the little things that keep bringing me back, such as the ominous advertising posters dotted around designed to put Truman off travelling.The film has been created in such an intricate way it constantly improves with repeated viewing. The way we follow Truman's exploits are incredible, how the influence of the creators are always around, like the way Truman has been deliberately traumatised to keep him away from the ocean, and thereby discovering the truth.Jim Carrey is the emotional core of the film, and he rises to the challenge admirably. For the most part, he reins himself in, becoming increasingly disturbed as he slowly senses the truth. Little errors and discrepancies such as a stage light seemingly falling out of the sky, stage hands caught putting together sound stages and the conversations of the creators filtering through his car radio start to alert Truman to the truth.The small details of Truman's artificial world really enhance the viewing experience. I like the adverts on TV subliminally suggesting he should stay home instead of thinking of travelling, as well as the creators trying to make good when they've slipped up in their routine. The subtle attempts at brainwashing are everywhere, and send the chilling message of how much power the media has over our lives.Ed Harris also puts in an excellent performance as the megalomaniacal Christof, a man with a Messiah complex. He's been watching every aspect of Truman's life, from the day he was born, and will continue to script his existence till the day he dies. Which may be a day of Christof's own choosing. Another chilling possibility. The possible what if's and maybe's are intriguing, because there is so much potential to this type of situation.One of the most touching aspects to Truman's life is the connection he formed with Sylvia. She was a sympathetic co-star, and tried to reveal the truth to him. But a relationship with her went against Christof's master plan, and you can see the way he's scripted encounters that would lead Truman to marrying another woman, Meryl.So Christof had Sylvia kicked off the show, but she touched Truman's heart, and he spent so many years searching for her. Unsuccessfully, of course. One of the best scenes is during a talk show with Christof about the making of the show. We learn so much about Truman's artificial world, and how much power Christof has over his life. The idea of a corporation buying a child from birth is not only sickening, but also a chilling foreshadowing of what the media will do for ratings. Sylvia has every right to be appalled by this, and the arguments between her and Christof are both compelling and intriguing.As things come to a head, and Truman begins to rebel against his existence in Seahaven, I found myself rooted to the spot. There are seldom films these days that can have that effect on me. Truman on the sea trying to escape, Christof using every means at his disposal to stop him, the people glued to their TV screens. I was practically cheering Truman on.I'll never forget that part at the end, when Truman finally gets out. The look on Christof's face is priceless. He looks a broken man. For the first time in his life, he's lost his power over Truman.But the ending is truly exhilarating, and is the emotional icing on the cake. The only complaint I have with Peter Weir's film is I wish it were a little longer. I would have liked to have seen more of the relationship between Truman and his on-screen wife, and how they cope with their sexual relationship and their jobs.But The Truman Show is still a magnificent film. A wonderful, insightful journey of one man's dreams being observed by the everyday world.

A wonderful, insightful journey of one man's dreams being observed by the everyday world. As Christof puts itWe accept the reality of the world we're presented.Next time you look in a mirror, make sure you really look. You may not be the only one staring back.

Nastassja Kinski, Wim Wenders is the only one that can reach the edges of human nature with such simplicity and a story that we can live as long as we love life. The meeting of Hunter and Jane is one of the best sequences, and the best shot of cinema history is the confession of Hunter and Jane, the meeting is so moving. I enjoy a lot every time i watch this film. I recommend this film, to every one that is not loving his mother, and wants to love her again, the portrait of the search of Hunter's mom is the best narration of a film ever done, there's no doubt about it. Wim Wenders is the best filmmaker in his gender, and is the only one that can get you out a tear, with the single existence of a simple take.

It's action packed, and Brandon lee is simply amazing in this, plus the finale was great!. Yes it's very familiar and has been done before, however it's very good brainless entertainment, with lots of gunfire and exciting martial arts action to keep you entertained!. Brandon lee and Powers Boothe are great as the 2 main leads, and have very good chemistry together, plus the ending was good. Yes it's predictable, however i am a sucker for action movies and can be entertained easily by them, this movie is no different!. The character development isn't bad, and i did enjoy it very much, but as i said it's familiar, however it's well worth a watch, and i will be watching it again!\/ This is a familiar but above average Action film, that's entertaining, with great performances!. The Direction is good. Dwight H. Little does a good job here keeping the film fast and furious good camera work, and just doing a good job overall. There is a bit of blood and violence. We get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds, exploding body, bloody broken nose, and some stabbings. The Acting is great. Brandon Lee is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious had great chemistry with Powers Boothe, kicked that ass, and really had a lot of charisma! (Brandon Ruled!). Powers Boothe is very good here, he had great chemistry with Brandon, and really did a good job!. Nick Mancuso does what he has to do well as one of the main villains. Raymond J. Barry is good in his role. Kate Hodge is pretty and does fine with what she had to do, and had okay chemistry with Lee. Tzi Ma is okay as the other main villain, but wasn't that menacing. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall well worth a watch, worth buying if you get it cheap!. ***1\/2 out of 5(barely) ","genre":null},{"date":"1 July 2005","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a familiar but an above average action film, that's entertaining, with great performances.

He has this alleged Edwardian Lady stick her middle finger up at David Warner at one point and then slugs unconscious some burly crewman who was getting in her way. To top it all she has sex with a total stranger from steerage. Please!! With his tin ear for dialogue he should have stuck to doing thick ear action movies rather than this overly ripe disaster movie. There's an amateurish attempt to demonstrate the stupidity of Ruth's mother having her dismiss some sketches of Picasso (How did they get on board) with the words that he would never amount to anything. Subtle this is not. It looks far better than it sounds which is a great pity as some of the visuals are rather good. One unexpected laugh happened when Cameron picked up his Oscar he screams a line from the film I'm the king of the world. Of course it fell completely flat on the assembled audience, who had never seen this dire movie or had forgotten the execrable script. The poor man must have thought his doggerel was memorable in some way, If this wasn't all bad enough we had to endure Celine Dion terrible song going on and on. The iceberg was the best thing in the movie and should have appeared far earlier than it did.
