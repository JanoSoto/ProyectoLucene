I mean, yeah, sure, there were a lot of plot holes, but it built a good atmosphere and I, for one, am fascinated by urban legends, cryptids, Alien abduction and so forth, and this sequel looked like it had potential. I was young, and I liked this movie, and I also thought the killer's mask thing looked kinda cool. But now I'm older, and I realize how un-fun this movie is. nothing like the first film! I few things were nice, like Loretta devine, the ending, and the sci-fi nerds, but the kills didn't do it for me. I was let down by this sequel. I have also just realized how stupid the killer looks. what is he even wearing? It looks awful, nowhere near as scary as the killer's design for the first film, just a creepy fleece hood. it could be anybody. but how many people would own something like this? Also, the motive is outrageous. horrible. the first solution was quick, clever, and I almost sympathized with the killer for a few moments. But this has no shocks. I felt the first one was constantly strong, if not the best, though, but this one is just too slow.

It is just very laughable, but in a good way, unlike the rest of this garbage. I'm frustrated now. as well, the girl getting killed with the broken window, the kidney and the dog...Ridiculous, just ridiculous. and that sums up this film for me. A cheap scare fest with very little plot, annoying characters who get it early on so thank god! minimal gore. I disown it from the Urban Legends time line. i've heard that while bloody Mary isn't as bad, it's still pretty awful, but I haven't seen it yet, so, until that review, i hate this movie, altogether.

It's fast paced and full of goofy and zany acting. The first film leveled itself out with excellent pacing, and heart where it needed it. The movie is fast paced, but it's the right level of it, and gives itself time to cool down with scenes of dialogue. This movie starts, and it keeps going till it's over. This is one of the fastest paced movies ever, with a lot of stuff happening. There is no time to cool down in this movie as it keeps it's pace for almost two hours! With that said, it's still pretty effective as a sequel!Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) travel forward in time to 2015 with Doc Brown (Christopher LLoyd) so Marty can help prevent his future son from becoming a criminal. After several occurrences, some caused by Marty himself, Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) has his hands on both a sports statistics book that gives stats through 2000, and on the Delorean. After going back to 1985 where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley owning a huge casino, is married to Marty's mother (Lea Thompson), and Marty's father is dead. What ensues is a trip back to the 50s to stop this ever from happening.This movie has some really impressive sets. 2015 Hill Valley is a great set, and an excellent variation on the 1985 and '55 version. The Biff hotel set is another really cool looking and impressive set, and everything about the settings of this movie are really atmospheric. Normally this is something you don't even notice about movies, but here the aesthetics are a real positive.The movie starts off really well, and the ridiculously fast pacing isn't a problem. Set piece 2015 is fast paced, fine, then we get back to the fast paced 1985 Biff takeover, which is fine. It's once we get back to the 1950s where this movie becomes somewhat tedious and despite it's quick pace, it grows slightly boring. The zaniness is here more than in the first movie too. The Doc is zany, Marty is zany, Biff is zany...in fact, everything is so slapstick and silly it grows somewhat annoying. Even the scene that the trailer eagerly showed off Michael J Fox playing Marty, future Marty, Marty Jr., and Marlene McFly is sort of annoying because every character in the scene is really loud, like each character is trying to one up the last one. And that's one of the major problems in this movie is how loud every character is. Constant yelling does not mean hilarious performances.The acting, despite being too over the top at times is as good as the first. Thomas F Wilson plays a pretty convincing bad guy, and definitely knows how to be evil well. Michael J Fox and Christopher LLoyd also give excellent performances, along with the ensemble cast.Overall, this is a very good sequel. It's not up to par with the first, and grows annoying at times, but it's still an excellent second part to an excellent trilogy.My rating *** out of ****. 110 mins, PG for language and violence.

The actors that play Matilda's parents and principle really overact their evil persona's almost to a laughable point, and the battle between Matilda and her principle is pretty cheesy.However, like I said, the movie has it's really strong points. I love Matilda's character and the way she bonds with her teacher, miss Honey. These two actresses did very good jobs. The relationship they form is played out really well.

Most Americans that actually watch this film will be confused by it. Very strange, maybe, in that it is a truly American movie American cast, American production, American themes, American sets, American problems, American answers. But, tell me--how do you rate yourself when you look back at that nude in the full length mirror right after you get out of the shower? If you're feeling generous (and you're only rating for yourself), you might get a 6 or a 7, right? Rafelson's early (funnier...haha, couldn't resist that), more critically successful Nicholson vehicle, FIVE EASY PIECES, has some really GREAT moments (like the toast-ordering scene), but ultimately, the pacing is off. There's just not enough there, there. Not so with King of MV. WOW, this is one helluva emotional roller coaster. The much, much underrated and underutilized Bruce Dern gives one of his best two or three performances as Nicholson's manic (American through and through) salesman brother. This riffs on Arthur Miller and all the best dramatic pitchmen roles from the 1st half of the 20th Century. Ellen Burstyn is spot on, as is the other female interest. But the real focus is on the guys. (And just a word about the late, great Scatman Crothers--so so excellent and iconic in this.) And now we get to Jack... ...I think this is arguably his best performance. It is one of the very very few where his eyebrows were nailed down, anyway. His character is so weary, so defeated, so human, you're tempted to think he's a Russian or a Jew or maybe even a Russian Jew. But no, he is a through and through Willie Loman American. And one we so rarely see on the stage or screen--though we all know\/have known them.

Whether it is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's drowned out feel or Fight Club's frenetic hipster camera-work, it's Se7en that definitely is his best film. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt give excellent performances while the script engrosses the audience. Any way one looks at it, this film is great and there's no doubt about it.Se7en follows two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) in their search to find Jonathan Doe (who later appears as Kevin Spacey), a murderer who has been leaving crime scenes that follow the Seven Deadly Sins. Freeman is great as an old, wise detective who is ready to retire while Pitt only good as a cop turned detective who is looking for action. Pitt's wife, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, makes for a good secondary character who is constantly trying to relate to the two detectives in their search. As the detectives push further to solve the case, the crime scenes become grislier and tensions rise in the corrupt, rainy unnamed city.There's many great things about Se7en, but one of the best is the opening credits. One might ask how the opening credits can be so great, but it must be seen to be believed. The opening credits consists of many cut together shots of someone, presumably Jonathan Doe, creating a disturbing notebook of photographs and letters set to music that is barely even music, but rather just creaking. Most of the shots are shaky and overexposed and yet so beautiful. How is it possible that something so beautiful? Only David Fincher could achieve a sequence so effective. The credits set the tone wonderfully through the movie and, if watched very closely, clues to the plot can be unlocked. If anything, the credits are worth a look.To continue explaining Fincher's greatness, one must explain how he creates the tone of the movie and what he does that makes the viewers feel disturbed by the end of the movie. Although there is almost no violence on-screen, the crime scenes are enough to make people feel sick. Every shot in the movie is very dark and almost hard to understand. There are no shades of bright colors throughout the whole movie. These dark shots, which may remind many viewers of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, give the film a very gloomy feel that no other film really does. Combine the shades of black and gray with the gruesome crime scenes and one gets a very dark and creepy movie.There really is no other way to say it Se7en is quite an amazing movies. There's some brilliant direction from David Fincher (as per usual) and great performances from the cast. The movie is thrilling and at the same time brutal forcing audience members to wonder whether or not they would like to finish the movie. Roger Ebert once said that a true film buff sees films that nobody else has heard of. I must say that I disagree. To become a true film buff means seeing movies like this and then appreciating and understanding them.

Scottie investigates her and eventually falls in love with her; he tries to help her overcome her belief that a spirit is possessing her, but in the end she kills herself just like the other woman.The first part of the movie is a tense thriller, but it's the second part that really makes the movie the masterpiece it is. In it we discover how far a man will go to recover the love of a dead woman. Necrophilia, although the word is never used in this movie, is never too distant.Stewart is amazing in the movie. The movie was a commercial failure and Hitchcock blamed it on Stewart's age, but for me the frail, slightly bumbling personality that he gave Scottie makes him one of the most interesting detectives in the history of cinema. And when he lets out all the darkness in his soul in the second part of the movie, then he reaches new heights of perversion.But Kim Novak also deserves recognition for her performance, in which she must display several personalities over multiple roles.This movie is not as exciting as Hitchcock's The Birds or North By Northwest these are exciting movies that never stop; North By Northwest is a chase movie so it's always in motion; and The Birds has an atmosphere of dread that keeps the viewer on the edge even not much is happening. But Vertigo is Hitchcock doing a character study about obsession, love, insanity and jealousy.The first sequence in the movie, a chase scene on rooftops, is followed by slower, but tense, scenes of detective work in which time slows down so the viewer can appreciate Scottie's mind at work as he puts the evidence together in Madeleine's mysterious case. Little by little the movie picks up its pace until the becomes a roller-coaster of tension by the end.Two things stood out for me in the movie the cinematography in its use of colors, especially green; we see it in all the key moments, whether in the trees, in Madeleine's costume or in neon lights. Also, the use of depth to portray Scottie's fear of heights - hence the vertigo of the title - was very imaginative.And secondly, one cannot disregard Bernard Hermann's tragic score for the movie. Built on the music for Tristan and Isolde, Herrmann's score is perfect for a movie about doomed love it's melancholy and dreamy. The movie wouldn't have been the same without the score's tone of tragedy it brought to it.

In addition, Robert DeNiro is encouraged to similarly overact in some of his scenes, and Harvey Keitel (as well as the usually excellent John Spencer) isn't far behind.On the plus side, the female characters are interesting, it's nice to see Stallone playing a more subtle character (even if he turns into the usual superhero character at the end) and the friendship between Liotta and Stallone has a feeling of genuine warmth and sincerity to it.

However, I did know that the co-stars were Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, two Hollywood movie stars I had been familiar with for a long time. I also knew that it was directed by Richard Donner, who directed the Lethal Weapon quadrilogy, which Gibson also co-starred in. I had seen all four of those films, and thought that overall, it was a good franchise. So, I rented Conspiracy Theory because I knew it was another film directed by Donner and starring Gibson and it also looked like a promising thriller. Still, I wanted to like it more than I did.Jerry Fletcher is a New York taxi driver and dedicated conspiracy theorist. He can think of conspiracy theories for anything, and constantly talks to his passengers about them. He even writes his theories in his own newsletter, which is sent to only five different people in the mail. The taxi driver has a crush on Alice Sutton, and woman who works for the Justice Department and whose father was murdered, but she doesn't know about Fletcher's feelings towards her. One day, after he is kicked out of Alice's office, he is soon captured by a group of CIA agents and finds himself in a mysterious place where he is tortured by a CIA doctor named Dr. Jonas! This sends Jerry into a fit of insanity, and after he bites the doctor's nose, severely injuring him, he manages to escape from the building. It turns out that at least one of the New York taxi driver's many conspiracy theories appears to be true, but he can't tell which one it is! The beginning shows the main character ranting to various passengers in his cab about his conspiracy theories, and this is a fairly shaky beginning. Soon after that, there's a flashy sequence showing Jerry's frightening memories, and I found this part to be a little rushed and unfocused. A lot of the film can probably be described that way. That part is followed by a cheesy and overlong scene with the taxi driver watching his love interest through her window, singing on her treadmill. Despite all this, it still looks like it's going to be at least a fairly decent thriller around the beginning and it is at times, but it's not consistent enough. The early torture scene didn't do much for me, and it even features frightening memories of Jerry's flashing before his eyes again, with the same problems as the first time this happens. Another thing that doesn't help is that Jerry's constant conspiracy theories can get tiring. Fortunately, there are definitely some good thrills and action, and Mel Gibson puts on an impressive performance as Jerry Fletcher, though his character here is no match for the likable Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon series. Julia Roberts as Alice Sutton and Patrick Stewart (another actor I've been familiar with for a long time) as Dr. Jonas are also memorable cast highlights.At 135 minutes, this 1997 thriller is a fairly long movie, and later in the film, it didn't seem as flawed to me as it did for a long time before then. It might improve after a while, and Gibson's character might eventually get easier to sympathize with. I may have been worn out during the second half or so, and get the feeling I could have gotten just a BIT more out of the film (at least closer to the end) if I'd had a bit more energy. For that reason, I feel I could almost give it a 7\/10 instead of a 6. On the other hand, I don't think having a high energy level would have hidden this movie's severe flaws from me, flaws which make Conspiracy Theory somewhat disappointing. Even if it does improve along the way, I would say it definitely takes quite a while to do so. This movie is by no means horrible, and could be entertaining if you like a good romantic thriller and are old enough to see the violence here, but it still didn't meet my expectations.

The first thirty minutes of the movie are a lovely homage to classic cinema, in the way it sets up countless gags that are later pulled off with whimsical and hilarious results, and with perfect timing. There's a lot of physical humor in the movie that reminds one of the old silent comedies.After the viewer has fallen in love with Guidio and become intoxicated with Guido's love for Dora, the movie turns a darker turn and details how Guido and his young son are sent to a concentration camp. For Guido is a Jewish, as the movie stated from the start. It seems an insignificant detail at first but it changes Guido's life forever.In the camp Guido, using his endless imagination, convinces his son that they were sent to a fun camp where they have to earn points working and performing special tasks to win a tank in the end. Guido loves his son so much he wants to spare him the truth about the world's horrors.This movie has been much criticised for trivialising the Holocaust, I claim I couldn't care less about. Art is not beholden to matters of good taste. In fact, as Rabelais, the father of the modern novel, has shown us, art is full of vulgarity, blasphemy and humour. Why should cinema be any different? This movie is pure invention, a ridiculously simple version of the relationships between prisoners and between prisoners and guards. But in its fiction it's closer to novels, which always start from invention too, and by being invention it manages to speak about themes that transcend a mere account of Holocaust reality.

He only didn't provide the music; that was accomplished by Nicola Piovani, who also deserved his Oscar.

But who can blame Mommy when Daddy happens to be Burt Young&#x85; When Daddy happens to be Burt it's a wonder she ever went to bed with him &#x96; without being dragged, kicking and screaming. Nevermind the prequel to Amityville 1, what I want to see is Burt & Violet The Early, Sex-Laden Years. She's not exactly a beauty, but how the hell did she end up marrying Burt? Were Ernest Borgnine-like butcher-type males all the rage as husband material in the 60s? Every time something eerie happens in the house Burt beats up on his wife and kids. It must be fun to have an entire family as a frustration-outlet punching bag.The priest is really, really bright he shakes the boy's hand - the result of which is that all hell breaks loose - yet the bible-hugger is more occupied with Burt's bad manners than the obvious supernatural goings-on! And I want to know who cleaned up the mess in the kitchen. I think the priest should have done that chore. It was his handshake that made the mess in the first place! Later on, he even ignores Diane Franklin's phone calls.I'm astonished at the ease with which this family goes back to their daily routine after all the insane stuff that goes. A hurricane goes through their kitchen, doors slam shut on their own, weird noises left and right, etc, and yet this family just cheerfully goes on with their chores, even celebrating Sonny's birthday.What is it with these exorcism priests and their tendency to plead for help from a God who barely even throws them a bone? Any entry from the Amityville series makes a suitable accompanying piece to any given idiotic Reality Channel documentary about things that go bump in the night.The positive side is that the movie has that early 80s feel and photography, which elevates it from similar B-movie-ish ventures from the late 80s and 90s.You've got to love that lenghty scene in which Sonny stares into the cameraman's lens, after which he undergoes a Hulk-like transformation. The less-than-incredible skinny zit-faced Hulk. And then he gets a neck tumor. But before that he is nailed to the bed by the ghost\/demon. That scene confused me was he raped or merely sat upon? Is this demon a homosexual, or was he merely looking for a chair?

Noticeably gone is that sweeping, dramatic score for the original, which added a sense of sadness and later, a sense of hope for Gloria and her young companion. Gloria first and foremost, is a New York story, and the city plays the largest part. Face it, the gritty, diverse and savage NYC that existed in 1980, is sadly no more. And that is why this 1999 effort lacks the heart, the quality that made the original a classic. Sharon Stone is quite good here, but she is too young here to play the middle-aged, world-weary Gloria; she simply does not look all that much like a woman who has had a truly rough life. And the young actor Jean-Luke Figueroa, while being very adorable, and a fine child actor, isn't always convincing as the streetwise, Spanish kid from the Bronx. Sometimes he reveals himself as a spoiled, very Americanized kid who has never seen the inside of a ghetto in his life. Remember John Adames, the kid from the original? Now that little guy was the real thing, seemed like he had lived all his life in the barrio. I believe his acting was weak because he wasn't an actor, just a real kid cast as a character like himself. The realism that made the first so great is lost here, in a remake that is too slick, and too stylish to have any real heart. Another thing that is missing is the grittiness, such as the hotels they are hiding in when the mob is chasing them. In the original the sleazy flophouses and shady hotels Gloria and Phil were staying in really added to the level of danger and desperation. This time around, Sharon Stone and 'Nicky' (they changed the boys name for some reason?) are staying in 4 star hotels! Generic and a bit boring. Of course the weakest thing about the remake, is the total lack of connection between Gloria and the boy. They don't seem believable here. In the original the little boy actually falls in love with Gloria, almost in a romantic way, and that was the sweetest, and most endearing thing about their relationship. Maybe in this day and age it was thought inappropriate to go that route. And the ending for the remake does not really work. For the audience to believe that the mafia would simply release a boy who witnessed them murder his family, they would have to be pretty gullible. No, the boy was 11, and all would assume that in a few years, he would return to avenge his family. notice in the original, Gloria and Phil planned an elaborate escape, where the mob would assume they were both dead, which added an extra level of suspense. For the average viewer, 1999's Gloria is a fun, enjoyable movie, but was a pointless remake. seeing this I can only pray that some idiot doesn't try to remake Taxi driver.

As another reviewer pointed out, it could have been one of the all-time great war films, but it fell a bit short.

It is simply a Vietnam war film about the bond between a commander and his men in the field, and it was very well done in that aspect. I don't remember a whole lot of dialogue in the script about who was right and who was wrong, or why we were there. It was all about survival in the face of a determined enemy. I also don't agree with the reviewer who stated that the LZ Albany ambush was avoided in order to paint a one-sided version of the battle, because that was a separate event that didn't involve Colonel Moore or his men. Involving other units would have meant a much bigger film in scope, even though I still think that it could have been handled well. The battle scenes were some of the best filmed.

And he may be able to undertake a local job at the same time. It must be destiny. But can a man of Blank's unique talents possibly survive an entire weekend catching up with old friends (including the great Jeremey Piven), avoiding others sent to take him out of action (led by Dan Aykroyd), reuniting with the girl (Minnie Driver) he has been obsessed with ever since the last time he saw her and prising advice from his psychiatrist (Alan Arkin) over the phone? School reunions are enough to fill normal people with homicidal thoughts so just how long can a professional hit-man keep his hands away from his gun?

It actually seems effortless because it's all put together so well. More people should see and enjoy this movie because the fans it already has will, like me, always enjoy revisiting it and trying to convert others to rating it just as highly.See this if you like The Matador, Leon AKA The Professional, The Mechanic.

There's nothing too flashy here but we get great acting matched to a great script accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack and interspersed with one or two great action sequences (one being an entertaining shootout and the other being one of the best and most realistic fistfights ever put on screen, in my opinion). It actually seems effortless because it's all put together so well. More people should see and enjoy this movie because the fans it already has will, like me, always enjoy revisiting it and trying to convert others to rating it just as highly.See this if you like The Matador, Leon AKA The Professional, The Mechanic.

He seems to be losing his passion for the job and rethinking much of his life just at the same time as, coincidentally, his assistant (Joan Cusack) informs him that he has received an invite to his high school reunion. And he may be able to undertake a local job at the same time. It must be destiny. But can a man of Blank's unique talents possibly survive an entire weekend catching up with old friends (including the great Jeremey Piven), avoiding others sent to take him out of action (led by Dan Aykroyd), reuniting with the girl (Minnie Driver) he has been obsessed with ever since the last time he saw her and prising advice from his psychiatrist (Alan Arkin) over the phone? School reunions are enough to fill normal people with homicidal thoughts so just how long can a professional hit-man keep his hands away from his gun? Grosse Point Blank is, quite simply, a superb action comedy that succeeds on every single level. The acting is consistently great. Alongside those mentioned we also get support from the likes of Hank Azaria and even the faces not well known to viewers provide just the right performance for their characters.Then we have, arguably, it's greatest strength the script. Every line, or at least every other line, is a slice of cool or a comedy gem. There's a lot crammed into this movie and no fat on it whatsoever.
