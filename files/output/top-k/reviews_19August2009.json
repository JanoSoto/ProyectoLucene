The movie simply doesn't hold up as the great classic it was expected to be back yon.John Wayne and Robert Duvall pretty much hump the whole load, along with a great supporting performance by Dennis Hopper, and that's about it. Kim Darby's sickeningly sweet character Mattie supplies plenty of drag to the aerodynamics with over the top simpering judgments and over educated speech. In fact, there's a few lines in the movie she delivers that make no sense at all, or are totally out of sync with the emotional development and continuity. And her character isn't alone. At several other points in this movie, there is scattered dialog between other characters that left me with a feeling of, 'huh? what did he say?' Glenn Campbell does OK as an actor, but would have done better had he been allowed to pick more than a few tunes on the guitar as a distraction.I have a feeling this may have something to do with the fact that True Grit was filmed during the height and madness of the Viet Nam conflict, and perhaps Hollywood might have been a little confused as to just what characters in a big budget western were supposed to sound like.

A great old mansion that makes a perfect location for a horror movie. A good score, better than this film deserves. Moves at a decent pace. The humor is pretty stupid, but some of it's amusing.

Some good creepy moments. Unintentionally humorous because it takes itself so seriously. Some, and I stress that, decent effects.Cons Apart from the two leads, the rest of the characters are cardboard cutouts who we could care less about. Most attempts at humor fall flat. Most of the effects, including the Ghoulies themselves, are pretty shoddy. A good concept, but a pretty poor script that doesn't do it justice. Hasn't aged too well. Not the least bit scary.Final thoughts 'Ghoulies' and it's three sequels (That's right, three) can only really be enjoyed if not taken seriously. This first installment is not one of the greatest cheesy 80s horror films you could find, but it's still worth a look if that's your thing. And if you do find yourself enjoying it like I did, then I recommend you check out part II because it's actually better.My rating 3\/5 ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"19 August 2009","score":"8 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" The Clockwork Orange treatment was actually done by putting the victim into the transpersonal of perinatal matrix three (Hell) with large doses of LSD.

The bravado and swagger of the Bonnie and Clyde actor is a scene stealer that generates that great feeling of tension and action, complete male adrenaline that adds tension and spice to a well depicted plot.The plot centres on Doyle's suspicions about a couple of unusual looking guys behaving strangely. After debating this with his chief the real action starts as Popeye and Cloudy pursue the bad guys. The interesting aspect of this close observation is that it is built completely around speculation rather that hard core evidence and therein lies the deep meaning of this film, what is behind closed doors so to speak. The passion and drama denoted through the debates and speculation adds to the tension within the force and adds a spice to the drama amongst the heavy crime ideologies.As the tension and the forgettable bad beginning subside does the film settle down with a moderate stakeout and more conversational scenes but then the action picks up with the numerous inclusions of car chases, heavy deception and a finale to remember.The big car chase was one of the most renowned when filmed in the early 70's. Taking an apparent 5 weeks to get accurate, the chase sees Hackman taking a small wound from a sniper and following the assassin as the mystery man gets on a train and Hackman steals an unsuspecting guy's car, much like he does in Enemy of the state only with more passion and excitement.As the train flies overhead we see Popeye diverting the traffic and speeding through lights, past the oblivious road users in determination to get his first proper hold on the case. This chase is certainly remarkable as the close calls and shifting camera angles really add to the realism of the moment, in contrast to some of the obviously staged Bond chases. With as much action and intrigue as the Bourne chases, this is a highlight.Regarding the French mastermind there is a finely staged deception on the train station when the on and off hopping proves to be more than deceiving the other. It is a highly contested battle of minds and a wonderful wave to finish off the sharp war.The ending is sharp and so sudden you can't believe it. With an accidental shot and a montage of the after effects, the French connection rounds off in a sharp and realistic way, makes this a true crime with wonderful acting and charisma.

Then, after Ms. Lockwood dozes off, Ms. Witty vanishes&#x85; Lockwood asks everyone where the lady went, but nobody recalls seeing the old woman on the train. Prague doctor Paul Lukas (as Egon Hartz) suggests Lockwood is suffering a concussion, due to a mysterious hit on the head she suffered just before boarding; this, he reasons, caused Lockwood to imagine the old woman. Lockwood is unconvinced, and finds an ally in flirty musician Michael Redgrave (as Gilbert Redman).A dense, droll, and marvelously directed classic. Alfred Hitchcock deservedly won the Best Director award from New York Film Critics. In hindsight, the group's 1930s awards seem more on the mark than the Oscars; and, Witty might have won their Supporting Actress prize, had they been awarded in 1938. It being purely British, The Lady Vanishes features Hitchcock reaching new levels of wit and whimsy; and it's chock full of the master's trademarks; you get glasses, The Birds, and even a flash of panties (assisted by waiter Rudolph). Repeated viewing is recommended, especially considering the seemingly confused introduction of characters and pre-train events - which will all make sense, if you're paying attention.Hopefully, Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford have been re-inserted into their single pair of pajamas.********** The Lady Vanishes (11\/1\/38) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave, May Witty, Paul Lukas ","genre":null},{"date":"19 August 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" An avalanche strands a bunch of mostly British train passengers in a European hotel.
