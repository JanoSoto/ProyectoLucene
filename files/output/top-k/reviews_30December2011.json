It's supposed to be a comedy except that it really isn't very funny, there are some issues involved with the casting and the characters, and while it's a comedy that isn't all that funny (or, for that matter, a romance that isn't all that romantic) there are parts of it that actually work reasonably well.Hugh Grant (who plays Samuel) is not someone I consider to be an A list actor. He's pretty one dimensional - always seeming to play variations on the same character the lost and confused romantic, whose life just isn't working out the way he wants. As Samuel, he's a guy who has it pretty good. He's a successful child psychologist, he's living with a beautiful woman (Rebecca, played by Julianne Moore) and everything's great until the day Rebecca tells him that she's pregnant. Samuel has no dreams of being a father, and his life and relationship with Rebecca go downhill from there. The most interesting part of the movie to me was watching Samuel's evolution from a guy who was totally uninterested in fatherhood to being a guy desperate to hold on to his new family. Grant did well with the role. He didn't overwhelm - he never does; he's just not that type of actor - but he was solid.The weaknesses in this movie revolved around the comedic elements. Yes, there were some funny moments, but there weren't enough truly funny moments for this to qualify as a really solid comedy. The real problem was that the movie often tried too hard to be funny. It went way overboard. That was, in part, a problem with the cast. Tom Arnold was cast as Marty Dwyer. He and his wife meet Samuel and Rebecca at the start of the movie. His wife Gail is also having a baby, and the two couples enter into a sometimes reluctant relationship. I've never been a big fan of Arnold, and once again he grates on me a little bit here, and his character comes across as irritating rather than funny. Then there was Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich, the obstetrician who has just arrived from Russia and has never delivered a human baby before. Williams puts on a pretty typical, slapstick Robin Williams performance in the role - but this character was way too over the top and added very little to the movie except a real feeling of total unbelievability.And yet, watching Samuel grow in his level of comfort with pending fatherhood is satisfying. He makes a difficult evolution from a character at the start of the movie for whom you have very little sympathy, to a character who becomes very sympathetic, and who you end up rooting for as he tries to put the pieces of his life back together. You expect that a degree of comedy might come from the idea that Samuel is a child psychologist who doesn't want children, but that really isn't central to the movie (and, all things considered, I can actually see why a child psychologist might not want children - after all, he's going to see all the problems!) It's just watching him grow from a guy who's part selfish and part frightened to a guy increasingly comfortable and then even enthusiastic about fatherhood. The ending is perhaps a bit sappy, but also very appropriate to the story.It's not a great comedy. If you want something to give you a lot of laughs - look elsewhere. But it's not a bad movie really, if you can get past the excesses of Arnold and Williams.

The remake wasn't much better... however, the first sequel in the franchise I'm happy to say has completely changed my view on Jason Voorhoos and this franchise. Friday the 13th Part II is not only a brilliant sequel that is subsequently superior to the original, but on it's own, I think is an excellent, creepy and suspenseful horror film with a decent body count as Jason - not yet sporting his iconic hockey mask, but instead, a burlap sack, terrorizes and slaughters teenagers at the abandoned Camp Crystal Lake. Featuring one of the longest pre-credit sequences in film history (Almost fifteen minutes) we see the sole survivor of Mrs. Voorhee's rampage from the first film a couple of months after the horror trying to get her life back together. She is stalked around the house, before Jason kills her, after she discovers Mrs. Voorhee's decayed head in her fridge. Five years later, a camp is built beside the abandoned Camp Crystal Lake, now a place of urban myth and ghost-stories. So it's inevitable that the teenagers who come along for the camp counsellors training are going to end up investigating the old camp to see it for themselves. The training is led by Paul Holt (John Furey) and his girlfriend, only not much training ever takes place as they all head off into town to get drunk, leaving a handful of them at the camp. Jason, wearing a burlap sack, leaves his shack where he worships the decaying head of his mother, to enact a savage revenge on these young people for his mother's dead at the hands of a young woman five years earlier. And we are in for one hell of a night of it...This is a very suspenseful and creepy film, finally given justice to Jason after his incredible absence from the first film (apart from his ghoulish assault launched from the bottom of the lake at the end). Directed by Steve Miner, his directorial debut, he would go on to direct the next sequel in the franchise and with him at the helm, I look forward to watching it. In the style of a TV series, the start of the film recaps the ending of the first, which is a good idea, considering the majority of people may have forgotten the details of that ending, and it was always nice to see possibly the only redeeming thing in the original, where Jason jumps out of the lake at the end and drags your one into the water (That was terrifying, and had impressed me enough to bring the rating of the first film up a star). The characters in Part 2 are pretty likable, including the jock in the wheelchair after a motorcycle accident, but unfortunately, his death came too quick when I had hoped for a struggle and his murder seemed very blurry and quick due to the film becoming a victim of the censors rampage during the 80's when it received an X-rating due to it's violence (Very tame nowadays of course). As a result - the fallout felt even today - some of the violence comes across as choppy and hard to make out .... anyway, Miner directs it very well, re-creating the atmosphere of the first film and upping the tension a couple of levels. Mrs. Voorhees's head is awfully ghoulish looking, and the little shrine Jason has made for her is pretty cute. Poor Jason... a crazy, blood-thirsty lunatic, but at heart, he is nothing but a mommy's boy. The ending is kinda confusing, but it's a salute to the ending of the first film and is quite decent. It had to leave it open for another sequel, after all, it was made on a budget of just over $1,000,000 and it earned just over $20,000,000 upon it's release. Not a bad take. Crazy Ralf (Walt Gorney) is back again, and not prematurely he is finally killed after laying his final warning to this fresh pile of young meat - I told the others, they didn't believe me. You're all doomed. You're all doomed! Well said Ralph... ironically he has the most sense.

In answer to many prayers from the folks of Bedford Falls, Clarence is assigned to help George Bailey, the town's hero, in his darkest hour. George Bailey is a man who has positively impacted many people's lives by putting the needs of others ahead of his own; but still, he has regrets. After giving up his own career aspirations, he steps into his late father's role of running the small Building and Loan business in order to continue his father's good work to help the folks of Bedford Falls and keep it out of Potter's greedy hands.

A typical action\/war film from the Cannon Group, notorious for producing low-budget and brainless action films during the 1980's - without a doubt one of the best decades for trash like this, including the Death Wish sequels and countless Chuck Norris films on a similar calibre to this including The Delta Force and Invasion USA, as well war films such as the excellent 1988 Michael Dudikoff film Platoon Leader (directed by Chuck Norris's brother Aaron). Norris is Colonel James Braddock, an ex-special forces Vietnam War Veteran who spent years in a Vietnamese Prisoner of War Camp before eventually escaping (As depicted in the prequel which I'll talk about in a minute). He accompanies a investigation team of American diplomats to Ho Chinh Minh City for the POW delegations convention to lay the issue to rest once and for all. The Vietnamese government of course, depicted as the villains and evil, deny any evidence of there being any US servicemen still being held captive in the country. The lack of evidence puts things in their favour, with only Braddock's word against there's. Present at the delegations happens to be a guard who tortured Braddock while he was in captivity - I see you've come up in the world, Braddock sarcastically remarks to him at a dinner party before being threatened by the cretin. The Vietnamese government is calling Braddock a war criminal, insisting that he was held prisoner in the country because of his war crimes. Braddock has had enough... and after holding the Vietnamese general at knife point, he discovers the location of a camp down country holding American POW's. Braddock is now on a one-man mission to save them, and after arming up in Bangkok and recruiting his old-army buddy Tucker (M. Emmet Walsh - Airport '77, Blade Runner), they head upriver into Vietnam on a battle raft to bring the boys home...This is an absolutely god-awful film with cringing dialogue and unrealistic and lazy action sequences. However, what saves it is it's pure entertainment ability, that had me laughing all through and in fairness, there are worse ways to spend an hour and forty minutes than watching Chuck Norris rising up out of the river with an M-60 Machine Gun at his waist blasting away a whole platoon of Vietnamese soldiers without so much as breaking a sweat. It's very enjoyable... for me it's something of a guilty pleasure because I laugh all through it, be it at Chuck Norris's horrible acting and blunt dialogue, or the action scenes which sports the typical drop-your-rifle-when-shot-and-throw-your-hands-in-the-air-as-you-jump deaths of the villains. The ending is brilliant, and needless to say, always has me in stitches. This received horrendous reviews when it was released, called a Rambo rip-off and what not. Which is what it is, as the storyline is very similar to the first Rambo sequel. Although Rambo First Blood Part II wasn't released until a year later, the storyline for it had been in circulation for a few years and the Cannon Group was inspired by it to ride the success of Rambo and quickly churned out Missing in Action - which explains the quick editing and the 'lazy' action scenes. It's prequel Missing in Action 2 - The Beginning was originally intended to be the first movie, with Missing in Action to be the sequel. But when the producers realised that this was in fact the better film, they released this one first and marketed the other one as a 'prequel'. Which explains the often times confusing relations between the first two films when you watch them (In a flash back, Braddock is tortured by the Vietnamese soldier who he meets at the delegations - however, there is no sign of that character in the prequel! And also, the camps in the two films look totally different. But this could be written off as being two different camps Braddock had inhabited during his 'internment').

A typical action\/war film from the Cannon Group, notorious for producing low-budget and brainless action films during the 1980's - without a doubt one of the best decades for trash like this, including the Death Wish sequels and countless Chuck Norris films on a similar calibre to this including The Delta Force and Invasion USA, as well war films such as the excellent 1988 Michael Dudikoff film Platoon Leader (directed by Chuck Norris's brother Aaron). Norris is Colonel James Braddock, an ex-special forces Vietnam War Veteran who spent years in a Vietnamese Prisoner of War Camp before eventually escaping (As depicted in the prequel which I'll talk about in a minute). He accompanies a investigation team of American diplomats to Ho Chinh Minh City for the POW delegations convention to lay the issue to rest once and for all. The Vietnamese government of course, depicted as the villains and evil, deny any evidence of there being any US servicemen still being held captive in the country. The lack of evidence puts things in their favour, with only Braddock's word against there's. Present at the delegations happens to be a guard who tortured Braddock while he was in captivity - I see you've come up in the world, Braddock sarcastically remarks to him at a dinner party before being threatened by the cretin. The Vietnamese government is calling Braddock a war criminal, insisting that he was held prisoner in the country because of his war crimes. Braddock has had enough... and after holding the Vietnamese general at knife point, he discovers the location of a camp down country holding American POW's. Braddock is now on a one-man mission to save them, and after arming up in Bangkok and recruiting his old-army buddy Tucker (M. Emmet Walsh - Airport '77, Blade Runner), they head upriver into Vietnam on a battle raft to bring the boys home...This is an absolutely god-awful film with cringing dialogue and unrealistic and lazy action sequences. However, what saves it is it's pure entertainment ability, that had me laughing all through and in fairness, there are worse ways to spend an hour and forty minutes than watching Chuck Norris rising up out of the river with an M-60 Machine Gun at his waist blasting away a whole platoon of Vietnamese soldiers without so much as breaking a sweat. It's very enjoyable... for me it's something of a guilty pleasure because I laugh all through it, be it at Chuck Norris's horrible acting and blunt dialogue, or the action scenes which sports the typical drop-your-rifle-when-shot-and-throw-your-hands-in-the-air-as-you-jump deaths of the villains. The ending is brilliant, and needless to say, always has me in stitches. This received horrendous reviews when it was released, called a Rambo rip-off and what not. Which is what it is, as the storyline is very similar to the first Rambo sequel. Although Rambo First Blood Part II wasn't released until a year later, the storyline for it had been in circulation for a few years and the Cannon Group was inspired by it to ride the success of Rambo and quickly churned out Missing in Action - which explains the quick editing and the 'lazy' action scenes. It's prequel Missing in Action 2 - The Beginning was originally intended to be the first movie, with Missing in Action to be the sequel. But when the producers realised that this was in fact the better film, they released this one first and marketed the other one as a 'prequel'. Which explains the often times confusing relations between the first two films when you watch them (In a flash back, Braddock is tortured by the Vietnamese soldier who he meets at the delegations - however, there is no sign of that character in the prequel! And also, the camps in the two films look totally different. But this could be written off as being two different camps Braddock had inhabited during his 'internment'). Worth watching back-to-back with it's prequel (That worked out well I think - a prequel always screams more originality than a sequel). I wouldn't recommend Braddock Missing in Action III where Braddock returns to Vietnam to rescue his wife and subsequently rescue a load of orphans. Pretty low-key, and even weaker than it's two predecessors.

There are also shades of THE PASSION OF ANNA in the structure. It's one of his harshest films, and it's also hard not to see it retrospectively as some attempt at justification for his personal choices, which were just coming to light at the time of release, if I recall correctly. He does make himself the most sympathetic and least flawed character. Nonetheless, it's a great piece of work, loaded with insight and intense confrontations and palpable bitterness. And it's funny, too. The entire cast is terrific, even Juliette Lewis pulls off the impossible by making you believe she's got a brain in her skull. The scene-stealer, however, is Judy Davis. She gets the lion's share of the script's best lines, all those wonderful back-handed compliments and barbed criticisms and raging outbursts. Some people complain about the hand-held camera and abrupt editing choices, but to be honest I hardly even notice I get so wrapped up in the immediacy of it all. It's a powerhouse of a film.

Instead, I'm almost overflowing with thoughts about it. First, to address my two tiny nitpicks from the previous review. The fart scene... I don't really mind it anymore. I even kind of look forward to it. It gives Carl a mischievous sense of humor, something to take a little bit of the edge off his darker side. I also suggested that Ewa Fröling (Emilie, the mother) isn't quite as good as the rest of the cast. I will revise that she isn't quite as distinctive as the rest of the cast. With so many grand personalities running around, it's hard for Emilie to leave a strong impression. But this time I realized how good Fröling is, nailing many of the subtle shifts the role demands.Speaking of grand personalities, among an amazingly strong cast, Gunn Wållgren (Helena, the matriarch) towers above them all. It was her final screen performance, and what a fantastic swan song. I want this woman to be my grandmother. She exudes endless warmth and compassion and patience. I must seek out more of her work, having only seen her in this and one of her earliest films, ORDET (and I can't recall her role in that at all).This is a film that celebrates the creature comforts of life, finding pleasure in the little world. For as much as Bergman gets saddled with labels like austere, here we see him practically spitting in the face of austerity. The Ekdahl home is joyously lavish, stuffed with artwork and food and precious items. And of course there's also the packed-to-the-rafters shop owned by Jacobi, filled with exotic and supernatural mysteries. Where Fanny and Alexander suffer is in the stifling environment of the barren Vergerus household, forbidden from bringing any of their belongings (the bishop reluctantly allows Alexander to hold on to his battered teddy bear). It's a wholehearted endorsement of material, physical decadence. Let us be happy while we are happy. Bergman is careful not to completely idealize the world of the Ekdahls, however. We see Carl's unbearable cruelty to his wife, Gustav's endless philandering which is amusingly tolerated by his spouse (two more wonderful casting choices in Jarl Kulle and Mona Malm) and even hints that Oscar is sexually distant towards Emilie. As much as they revel in the joys of life, they haven't quite got the male-female relationships right... after all, it's still Bergman we're dealing with.The director is exceptionally generous with his faith in the audience. In some of the finest examples of magic realism, we are shown impossibilities without explanation, and are trusted to make of them what we will. It is a story that is much concerned with the power of imagination, and of course Bergman's love of the theater and its ability to fire the imagination. As Oscar spins an improvised fairy tale about a common chair to the children, for a moment we believe every word he's saying. With that same magical power of storytelling, Bergman makes us believe in ghosts and mummies and evil forces.It's such a phenomenally beautiful piece of work (thanks especially to Nykvist and the set design) that always offers me something new, and keeps me enthralled throughout the entirety of its 5+ hour running time (okay, the Hamlet rehearsal drags a bit, but it has such thematic resonance). I think I feel a stronger personal connection to SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, but Fanny is an astonishing film on every level.

Despite a lack of forensic proof, and the shaky testimony of peoples involved, Bloomfield carves out a clear and infallible MOTIVE for the murder of Kurt Cobain, and that is perhaps this movies achievement. It is worth it to watch and judge for yourself.

With a labyrinthine plot that is ostensibly oriented around a missing diamond, Snatch introduces viewers to three groups of characters intent on retrieving the elusive stone, which has been stolen from an Antwerp jeweler. In the first group are friends and business partners Turkish and Tommy, who join up with Mickey, an Irish gypsy and boxer. Turkish and Tommy make arrangements with Mickey to take a fall in a match engineered by lunatic gang leader Brick Top. In another corner resides equally loony Russian gangster Boris the Blade, who has asked Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers to place a bet on the match for him. Boris is also scheming to have Sol, the owner of a pawn shop, rob the place with a couple of dim associates. Meanwhile, Avi, freshly arrived in London from New York, hires Bullet Tooth Tony to find Franky when he goes missing; it seems that it was none other than Franky who was supposed to be transporting the purloined diamond to New York.It is distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, a circular plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and causality, and a fast pace.Through this style,Rictchie makes the film totally satisfying and entertaining. Also,it holds the audience interest from beginning to end. This also make the film original which makes it not formulaic and predictable.The movie is also characterized by brilliant performances as they enhance their interesting characters through their great portrayal.As a result,Snatch is a must-see for it is one excellent movie.

It appears as if the director wanted him to act like Mickey Rooney. To this we add a series of one note characters. The mother who just wants her daughter to get married, before she turns 21? I know this is 1950's midwest America but how about a slightly enlightened mid-western 1950's mother. Then there's Novak's character, beautiful, sexy, dull. Just what's up with her? She's tired of being told she's just pretty and then falls for Holden who insists on calling her baby. The younger sister, ugly but smart. Then the masterpiece of cliché that is Rosalind Russell's school marm. She's spends the entire movie causing conflict, bragging, insulting people and makes a drunken pass at Holden. Then we have to endure the scene where she begs her boyfriend Howard to take her away. Obviously the audience is meant to sympathize with her plight but what intelligent person would? The only character i really thought had some depth was Robertson's rich son but even Inge has to give him a ridiculous and illogically overwrought scene to play. Like Teneessee Williams ,Inge has not aged well. Except for Kim Novak's timeless beauty and James Wong Howe's stunning photography this is a real stinker.
