[{"date":"19 October 2015","score":"","review":" Now first off, I must set the table before we can dig into the meat of this review. This movie was not made by the likes of Disney Animation or their then-fledgling affiliate and now property, Pixar. It was made by Warner Bros. Now, in the 90s, particularly the late nineties, there were a rush of animated movies not made by Disney or any real animation company that won't happen again. It was an interesting time for animation. Not a good one, perhaps; other than this film, the best of these so-called second-string animated movies (not counting TNBC, which is stop-motion) by common judgement is Anastasia, a movie that I professionally dislike and personally despise. But an interesting one.This movie is a great example of why it never happened again. Here is one of the best movies of the year in a year that was filled with great movies, and yet it completely flopped at the box office due to legitimately horrible management by Warner Bros. Seriously; this movie was not relatively expensive (though it looks the part), and it has a very marketable premise. How do you screw that up? That's not rhetorical; I'm confounded. Yes, I'm aware Warner has a history in animation. But that's mostly in television; they should leave movies to the experts.Wow that was long-winded. Thankfully, this movie is not; at only eighty-six minutes, it flies by. You often want it to stay longer; not because it does anything incorrect, but because you don't want it to leave you. This is the kind of film where, if I saw it at the cinema, I would stay during the credits and afterwards. I would stay until they forced me to get out; that's the sort of film it is.If the animation is not as well-funded as Disney's, it does not show it. There are ambitious scenes in this film, scenes that seem to be the lovechild of 70s Disney, 80s Ghibli, and 00s Pixar. You can't honestly say that Tarzan looks like it has more money poured into it than this movie. The motion is especially eye-catching. Speed is one of the hardest things to get right, really right in animation. And yet when it is done right, there is nothing on planet Earth that looks prettier.Miyazaki is the best at this; the first time I watched a scene in the third act of Porco Rosso, one where Porco flies his plane for one last long sequence over the land and to the sea, to meet his final challenge, my life was forever changed. I'm not exaggerating; those were some of the most invocative, most profound minutes of my life. But Bird clearly takes cues from, and shares interests with, Mr. Miyazaki. It does not surprise me that the two of them are friends. And of course, thanks to him helping bring Miyazaki's works over to the West, I'm glad they are.This is a movie that gets darker as it goes along, but it does it in a smart way, a sensible way. And a way that can still get a kid-friendly rating. When I first-watched this movie, the first thing I thought of was eighties Spielberg (though without some of the sappiness.) If this isn't already, (I don't know) it should be one of those films that is in everyone's house, along with Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, Totoro, Finding Nemo, Kiki's Delivery Service, etc. Kids deserve to have this movie be a part of their childhood. If I have kids, I'm showing them this.And of course, it is a gift to us adults as well, whether or not we believe that we deserve it. After the first ten minutes, the transition from 2D to 3D, doesn't feel weird at all. Even more, it feels magical, like it were conjured out of some fantasy world that we only by chance get to see. The writing is stellar and shows a lot of that quick wit that would latter become a staple of his. You get a lot of great lines without the sense that they're trying too hard like you do in The Avengers.I wouldn't say the music is spectacular aside from a few pieces, but it does fit the tone of the film well. The same is true to some extent with the characters, who are my one grievance with the film. They feel too cliché and used. The good acting, particularly from the stars, Connick and Aniston, helps, but overall, he doesn't play enough with the characters. That's the main reason this film isn't as good as The Incredibles and one of the reasons why it isn't as good as Ratatouille (which also could have used stronger characters (except Ego, who was brilliant) but it is not as big of a problem and the rest of the movie is ambient enough to cover for it). And it's the reason I would give this film a 4.5 out of 5.But that's just me comparing Bird to the ridiculously high standards he has set for himself with his era-defining work.

At first thoughts I felt yeah sure it is great but then after a little more time I came to realise this is incredible, I won't say it's 100% perfect but still it just exudes this feeling of well, fun. It's the kind of movie that only after do you really understand how Woody feels and how Buzz feels, you also realise how easy it would be to watch it again because it's really a calm but also an exciting watch. It's hard to call this a kid's movie owing to the fact that all fans of this back in the day are fully grown adults now, but the fact that they still return to this and say it is a masterpiece even today, well it shows how impressive this really is as well.The story is of course about toys, and in particular a new toy arriving because Andy the toys owner got a new Space Ranger named Buzz Lightyear for his birthday. Woody the favourite toy of Andy is jealous of Buzz's new found fame among all the other toys and starts to both feel angry but also kind of obsolete as well. The story moves along at a frantic pace, the amount of things that happen though to say this has an 81 minute run time is amazing and the timing is absolutely wonderful. Another point I found only after thinking back on the movie was the humour and how is just really good, one moment in a certain pizza restaurant arcade where we see a Whack-a-Alien game in reference to Alien sums up the overly kidult tone this movie possesses. Among the voices we have Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as a small potato toy, Wallace Shawn in his trademark voice as Rex the dinosaur toy and the smoky voice of Jim Varney as Slinky the well, slinky toy dog. The voices are very memorable and the voice cast are perfectly picked, none seem out of place and maybe that is because of how much this movie has dug itself into film culture. I found Hanks and Allen's voices to be at the same level as each other only because they are both so great, Buzz is made even more courageous sounding by Allen and Hanks provides a kind of cool kind of toy voice but also brings out Woody's scared side or angry side well.John Lasseter the director is among many names behind this movie who seem to all hit the right spot with this, they create the first animated feature length picture and turn it into one of the still most popular of them all. The writers hit the movie from another flank, Lasseter brings humour out from his vision but I think the writers, Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow really bring another face to the movie where the humour but also the emotion can mix really well. As animation goes it of course does not look as it maybe did back then (still isn't bad though), although it doesn't matter anyway because it is the storytelling that blows you away and the characters really grab your attention. Pixar kicked off their stellar works in animated movies in style and brought not only a new way of making a movie, but also a fine way of telling a story and not making it over the top or just for kids, this is for everyone. There isn't too much too find wrong with this I mean, maybe some of the jokes aren't great, but really they may be still good anyway, it is kind of a movie that you can easily watch again without feeling it will quickly become boring, the kind of movie that is fun for quite literally, all the family.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"19 October 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Next up in my series of BTTF reviews is Back to the Future Part II, the film that wowed everyone with a glimpse at what the future could possibly look like, and although it is clearly nothing like it was envisioned in 1989 it is still very interesting to see the 'future that could have been' come to life on screen. Back to the Future Part II did what all sequels should do, it was larger in scale, it took bigger risks and it took the series to a whole new dimension by really focusing on the use of time travel. Now although it was bigger and the timelines got a whole lot more complex, topping the first film was nearly impossible but they tried their hardest and it payed off, making this film also an instant classic. Like its predecessor, this was also an endlessly entertaining film, still capturing the same humour that the first film did so well it manages to make you laugh consistently throughout. The characters of Doc and Marty again have great comedic timing and their chemistry is like no other film and it adds to the realism of these characters relationship. Whilst also maintaining that comedic aspect, the film also does spend quite a bit of time getting pretty serious and developing the plot for later in the film and for Part 3. This film had the daunting task of having to top the first one, and how do you do that? Rather than going 30 years in the past they decided to go 30 years into the future. But why stop there? lets go 30 years into the future then 30 years into the past in another timeline and then 30 years into the past again just to mess with people. Although there was a lot of jumping between timelines in this film it managed to hold itself together very well without seeming like it was moving too fast. As expected, with all of these time jumps, the timeline of events is going to get a little more confusing, but the film i thought did a pretty great job at keeping audiences informed as to what was going on. There were a few exposition scenes that were a little too 'heavy' on information that could have been spread out a little. Having just watched it for like the 10th time, it all makes sense to me but for a first time watcher it may take another viewing to fully grasp the timeline changes. A very minor thing in a film that still does time travel better than 98% of time travel films out there. One of the things that this film is remembered for is its visualisation of the future. Seeing all of these technological advancements in terms of cars, and clothes, and shoes, and hover-boards was incredibly mind-blowing for me when i watched it so you could imagine how it must have been for an audience that was even further away from that possible reality. It was a very interesting contrast with other more dirty dystopian futures you see in most sci-fi films, the cleaner, brighter look made it so much more memorable. Like i said, they are the scenes everyone remembers, the hover-board chase scene is an iconic action sequence that will never be forgotten, the sequence in Marty's future house was amazing seeing all of the small but significant advances in technology that people would only dream of. Many people often forget that the film also does represent the future in a very dystopian environment, and i thought in its own way, that was a very interesting juxtaposition to put in this film. Although it wasn't as fun and lively as seeing the cleaner future it was definitely interesting to see how greed and a money driven future would look like. Looking back on it now, i would say that the Dystopian representation of the future isn't any more far off than the Cleaner, more technologically advanced one, just saying. But one of the most impressive sequences for me was when Marty and Doc travel back to 1955, the setting of the first film, and have to go around this time period whilst avoiding their other selfs from the first film. This is what really wowed me in terms of the incredible film-making and visual effects that were used in order to make it look like they had actually travelled into the setting of the first film without compromising what the first film set up. The shots were placed perfectly and the use of footage from the first film in combination of recreations of scenes from the first film from different angles was incredible, and for a film released in 1989 it was amazing to see. It also has what i think was the most exciting and fun ending sequence of the series that had me laughing, and in suspense the entire time. It closes off the story of this film perfectly and sets up the next film in a similar way to what the first film did. It may even be one of my favourite movie endings ever, i get goosebumps every time i watch it.Again, the attention to detail was incredible, with fantastic call-backs to the first film and the little details that connect the alternate timelines timelines together, and also some foreshadowing for what is to come in Part 3, Robert Zemeckis' love for this world and these characters is on show. In the end, this film goes bigger, it goes to more places and it retains everything you love about the first film. It does lose some of that magic that you feel when watching the first film but it is still a masterpiece and a classic that even helped to elevate how good the first film was upon return viewings. - 9 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Next up in my series of BTTF reviews is Back to the Future Part II, the film that wowed everyone with a glimpse at what the future could possibly look like, and although it is clearly nothing like it was envisioned in 1989 it is still very interesting to see the 'future that could have been' come to life on screen.

As expected, with all of these time jumps, the timeline of events is going to get a little more confusing, but the film i thought did a pretty great job at keeping audiences informed as to what was going on. There were a few exposition scenes that were a little too 'heavy' on information that could have been spread out a little. Having just watched it for like the 10th time, it all makes sense to me but for a first time watcher it may take another viewing to fully grasp the timeline changes. A very minor thing in a film that still does time travel better than 98% of time travel films out there. One of the things that this film is remembered for is its visualisation of the future. Seeing all of these technological advancements in terms of cars, and clothes, and shoes, and hover-boards was incredibly mind-blowing for me when i watched it so you could imagine how it must have been for an audience that was even further away from that possible reality. It was a very interesting contrast with other more dirty dystopian futures you see in most sci-fi films, the cleaner, brighter look made it so much more memorable. Like i said, they are the scenes everyone remembers, the hover-board chase scene is an iconic action sequence that will never be forgotten, the sequence in Marty's future house was amazing seeing all of the small but significant advances in technology that people would only dream of. Many people often forget that the film also does represent the future in a very dystopian environment, and i thought in its own way, that was a very interesting juxtaposition to put in this film. Although it wasn't as fun and lively as seeing the cleaner future it was definitely interesting to see how greed and a money driven future would look like. Looking back on it now, i would say that the Dystopian representation of the future isn't any more far off than the Cleaner, more technologically advanced one, just saying. But one of the most impressive sequences for me was when Marty and Doc travel back to 1955, the setting of the first film, and have to go around this time period whilst avoiding their other selfs from the first film. This is what really wowed me in terms of the incredible film-making and visual effects that were used in order to make it look like they had actually travelled into the setting of the first film without compromising what the first film set up. The shots were placed perfectly and the use of footage from the first film in combination of recreations of scenes from the first film from different angles was incredible, and for a film released in 1989 it was amazing to see. It also has what i think was the most exciting and fun ending sequence of the series that had me laughing, and in suspense the entire time. It closes off the story of this film perfectly and sets up the next film in a similar way to what the first film did. It may even be one of my favourite movie endings ever, i get goosebumps every time i watch it.Again, the attention to detail was incredible, with fantastic call-backs to the first film and the little details that connect the alternate timelines timelines together, and also some foreshadowing for what is to come in Part 3, Robert Zemeckis' love for this world and these characters is on show. In the end, this film goes bigger, it goes to more places and it retains everything you love about the first film. It does lose some of that magic that you feel when watching the first film but it is still a masterpiece and a classic that even helped to elevate how good the first film was upon return viewings. - 9 ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"19 October 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Next up in my series of BTTF reviews is Back to the Future Part II, the film that wowed everyone with a glimpse at what the future could possibly look like, and although it is clearly nothing like it was envisioned in 1989 it is still very interesting to see the 'future that could have been' come to life on screen. Back to the Future Part II did what all sequels should do, it was larger in scale, it took bigger risks and it took the series to a whole new dimension by really focusing on the use of time travel. Now although it was bigger and the timelines got a whole lot more complex, topping the first film was nearly impossible but they tried their hardest and it payed off, making this film also an instant classic. Like its predecessor, this was also an endlessly entertaining film, still capturing the same humour that the first film did so well it manages to make you laugh consistently throughout. The characters of Doc and Marty again have great comedic timing and their chemistry is like no other film and it adds to the realism of these characters relationship. Whilst also maintaining that comedic aspect, the film also does spend quite a bit of time getting pretty serious and developing the plot for later in the film and for Part 3. This film had the daunting task of having to top the first one, and how do you do that? Rather than going 30 years in the past they decided to go 30 years into the future. But why stop there? lets go 30 years into the future then 30 years into the past in another timeline and then 30 years into the past again just to mess with people.

How it has become so forgotten is not only a sad reflection on film, but also on audiences. Rarely do people flock to the cinema to see such an unflinching neo-realist tale of depravity and dysfunction and perhaps this is why so many people overlooked this engrossing work of art. Films like At Close Range, released in 1986, tread on those very personal lines that make the viewing experience too close for comfort. We all know people who have fallen through the cracks of society, who are morally corrupt, people who represent a failure of school, of parenting, of discipline, of the law, of art, of the accepted way of life... people who are potentially capable of anything at the right time and place. These very people are at the center of At Close Range, which is based on the true story of a notorious Midwestern crime gang with strong familial ties. The Midwestern United States has become more than a geographic compass, more than a mere region of a nation. It is now representative of a place where change seldom visits and a very outdated, unjust way of life is upheld. Stagnancy seems to be ripe in the region. Prejudicial intolerance and hatred bred out of ignorance has been rampant there. Of course, it is not all like this, but this is how it is commonly depicted in cinema and it makes for some very interesting character studies. History hasn't exactly been kind to the region, tarnishing its reputation with many grisly murder cases. As a result, the 'Midwest' could almost be an epithet of sorts, a setting of a series of similar films that detail the redneck rurality that propels people into nihilistic turpitude and banal evil. A few of these Midwestern films that come to mind are Badlands (1975) and the exceptional Boys Don't Cry (1999). At Close Range is certainly a Midwestern crime drama, just like the aforementioned films. All three of these films are based on harrowing true stories. Of course, the Midwest- crime tale does not just exist in cinema, but also in literature. It harks as far back to Truman Capote's iconic 1960s book 'In Cold Blood', a true crime story about a brutal slaying in a Kansas farmhouse. Thus, the Midwest being painted as a nether-region of sorts where crime seems to be just as familiar to the inhabitants as crop farming is so deeply ingrained in art that At Close Range feels like a tale we have seen or heard about before, yet it is portrayed with such beauty and stark honesty that it takes on a reverence. In At Close Range, Christopher Walken plays Brad Whitewood Senior, the head of a crime gang who have made millions stealing from other people. His estranged and wayward son, Brad Whitewood Junior, (played brilliantly by Sean Penn) has recently reconnected with Brad Senior, and has a taste for the gangster life that his father so ruthlessly pursues. To Brad Jr, this life of crime is not only alluring, it's a denunciation on the American Dream, a life he refuses to live. Things go awry when Brad's girlfriend, the pretty and petite Terry (Mary Stuart Masterson) and half brother Tommy (referred to Brad Senior as the bastard child) come into the picture. Before long, Terry is an unwitting pawn in a situation of pursued vs pursuer. It is her restless eye for Brad Jr. that sets this drama in motion. A blood curdling finale ensues, which threatens to change the lives of these small town lives irrevocably.At Close Range is many things. It is a tale of love on the run, of a young man growing up in rural America, the tale of idyllic small town life that very finely treads the line of reckless abandon (the boys and their girls spend summer afternoons at the lake, drinking and making out), the tale of family dysfunction, of lower middle class life, of the corrupt, of vengeance, and ultimately of justice. But I think what is truly at the heart of this film is a son's coming of age - a desperate need for a father, which is what makes the final act so heartbreaking. Brad Junior so desperately needs guidance, love and affection, but the very man who should have given it to him is so hopelessly screwed up and even dangerous, so dangerous in fact that he would murder his own son if he threatened to spill the beans on his crime gang. Very few characters have been as terrifying and evil as Christopher Walken's Brad Senior. When Brad Junior finally finds the love he has sought after for so long in Terry, it is cruelly snatched away from him... by his own flesh and blood.Everyone in this film was at their very best here as far as talent goes. The acting is mesmerizing, there isn't a weak link in the entire cast. Walken, Penn and Masterson all deserved Oscar nominations for their deeply effecting performances. The cinematography was another pleasant surprise, every shot unfolds as though it was plucked straight out of a waking dream. The scenes at night evoke so much mood and suspense, while the sun-drenched scenes at the lake and on the farms recall those glory days we all knew and long for. Of course, things move at a languid pace at times, but the direction remains tight and the suspense picks up very rapidly. As the film progresses towards the final moments, it becomes increasingly harder to watch, but it's equally as difficult to look away. I was hooked, thanks to the expertly crafted worked by the cast and crew. At Close Range is truly a diamond in the rough. I highly recommend this film for being an intricately layered, absorbing study on moral abandon that eventually spills into violence. I will not forget it.

Dux claimed -and still claims- to have been taught Ninjitsu as a CIA operative during service in a Top-Secret Full-Contact tournament somewhere on a island in Asia; -nobody can confirm because, again it's top secret; case & point- back when Asian fighters only knew straight-path linear fight techniques but were unfamiliar of Western Boxing-circular techniques and especially the Death Touch (Dim Mak) as with coveted Japanese Ninjitsu Clan's (Not tribes). -they would fall for those moves. So it's no surprise Dux unexpectedly won the tournament in real life...you can't get away with that now...everybody has seen those moves since the 80's martial Arts movement - Frank Dux - Howard Stern Radio InterviewTalking to people who know Frank Dux personally, claim he's not a amazing fighter, and that Dux impossibly, prematurely, and suspiciously had risen through the Black Belt ranking system during Bloodsport with bowing devotees -one even living in Frank's house also quickly and suspiciously risen in many ranks; Is it true?.After Bloodsport JCVD and Dux battled in court, and nearly got in a fist fight after Dux shouted That's a lie!. Dux argues JCVD cheated him based on the oral agreements of money due; Is it true?After Bruce Lee JCVD is the only REAL Martial Arts actor to launch his own career above any other and nobody since. Bolo said in the JCVD Documentary...After Bruce Lee no one...look around where someone?...no one....why?...think-(pointing to his head)...meaning JCVD is very clever. Also, JVCD was Ivan in No Retreat, No Surrender -a Bruce Lee themed impressive film- and that was a Lead role NOT a small role as one ignorant commenter mentioned and there was maybe just as much if not more to appreciated in Karate Tiger-(International title) than in Bloodsport because of the Jeet Kune Do training factor; that's a story line which, is why movies succeed or fail. Hollywoods steals and revamps instead of creating now days as with Family Guy non-sense instead of being original like the Simpsons although in the last several years the Simpsons have a family Guy writer infestation so....On to BloodSport itself ******SPOILER ALERT****** There is no Vengeance for Mr. Tanaka's dead son as others have mistakenly commented . Bloodsport is about honoring Tanaka's son who was supposed to enter the tournament representing the Tanaka Clan (Masters Son -car accident) and your Shidoshi\/Teachers family Clan BECAUSE the TANAKA Clan's ART is past down from father to son...father to...son. Father to SON key word here. Although FRANK DUX was NOT Mr. Tanaka's lineage ,merely his son's training partner\/punching bag, as Dux argues You always taught to always have a opened-mind! So Mr. Tanaka NOT CONTRADICTING his own teachings- trains Frank for the Kumite tournament for the prized sword from the iconic sword makers clan.

Arriving at the remote location with his wife & son, Jack intends to use the solitude of the hotel to pursue his passion for writing but once the family settle into the hotel, his condition worsens as he begins to act strangely, suffers from writer's block, becomes prone to violent outbursts & is constantly haunted by the supernatural entity that reside there.Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, The Shining is his first stint with horror and yet he exhibits a far better understanding of this genre than most established directors of horror cinema. From the opening moments, the film is able to establish an ominous mood thanks to the eerie score that accompanies its title sequence and the aerial photography that finds its camera hovering over those rocky mountains, lush landscapes & narrow roads leading to the Overlook Hotel, thus already foreshadowing the isolation that awaits the Torrance familyThe technical aspects in almost every Kubrick film is carried out with precision care and The Shining is no exception. Production design team deserves kudos for the meticulously designed set pieces for it provides the hotel an identity of its own. Cinematography makes very inventive use of its camera & follows our characters like a silent observer at all times while the fluid movements, clever angles, steady zooms, perfect lighting & aptly chosen colour tones greatly amplify the whole look & feel of the picture. The real highlight however is how the Steadicam is utilised.Kubrick here pushes the Steadicam to its extreme to achieve a smoothness & stability that hasn't been replicated ever since. The flexibility & sleek flow provided by this new technique didn't just allow the director to stage some of modern cinema's most iconic shots but also brings the viewers into the story by placing them behind the characters as the plot unfolds. Editing is a strong highlight too for almost every scene ends up playing a relevant role in the story. And the background score is in perfect sync with each & every moment and elevates the whole experience by encapsulating the entire film with a highly unsettling mood.With Jack Nicholson in the lead role, Jack Torrance already looks like someone who's just waiting for a little push to descend into total madness which doesn't come off as a surprise when it eventually happens. The stressful experience Shelley Duvall underwent during its production is well-documented but the effect of it all can be felt in her rendition of a broken Wendy, as the entire ordeal only helped her performance. And Danny Lloyd plays their psychic kid and just like every kid in almost every horror film, he's annoying to an extent. All three actors are over-the-top at times but this added exaggeration somehow works in the film's favour.On an overall scale, The Shining is a thought-provoking meditation on madness, isolation & paranoia that defies everything that was usually a norm in the genre of horror back then yet puts on screen a cinema that is now regarded as a definitive example of atmospheric horror. Immortal for its contribution to horror, a staple of pop culture, and a classic amalgamation of superb direction, deft writing, innovative camera-work, skillful editing, menacing score & devoted performances, The Shining remains one of the greatest achievements of its genre that's only getting better with time and is definitely amongst Stanley Kubrick's finest works. Highly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.

The acting is great and the directing is tight. The film totally parodies the rehab clichés - the slogans, the camp environment, the wholesome songs, but the central character, sports columnist Gwen, also genuinely goes on a journey from adolescent-brained party girl to the more mature, intelligent woman inside. She's never stopped to reflect on her life and the consequences of her actions until now. The death of her teenage roommate from suicide is a compelling reminder that not everyone magically transforms their lives at rehab. The support cast including Elizabeth Perkins as Gwen's sister and Marianne Jean-Baptiste as a fellow addict, are great. As a counsellor and alcoholic, Steve Buscemi has a nicely sardonic way about him. He tends to spout sayings, but he's interesting. And as the troubled sports star attracted to Gwen, Viggo Mortenson has great chemistry with Bullock, and is self mocking and rueful. As Gwen's self centered partying boyfriend, Dominic West is fantastic -- his character manages to be light as a cloud while simultaneously representing the evil temptations of drink and debauchery that Gwen must avoid. Special mention goes to the troubadour Loudon Wainwright III who plays guitar and sings in several scenes, as a kind of one man Greek chorus. It gives the film an offbeat, wacky charm. Sandra Bullock is maybe too likable -- even when Gwen is doing despicable things (not that there are many of those) we forgive her. Maybe in real life such a character would really stir our hatred, like the gambling addict who steals money from her child's school.

Then for some reason he leaves it behind for the assassin to pick up and shoot at him. It's annoying when smart characters do stupid things. This is simply inferior to the original. It's not as much fun. It is sillier and not as compelling. It's not terrible but it's not good. ","genre":"Action, Thriller"}]
