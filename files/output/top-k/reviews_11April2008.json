Based on a novel by brilliant Polish-Soviet Imaginative Fiction author Stanislaw Lem, Solyaris is an intensely philosophical sojourn into inner and outer space. It is also a lengthy, beautiful and very eastern European film. Solaris capture the stoic and sometime nihilistic imagination of Lem, but very little of his quirky sense of humor. Instead, the film is an intense, brooding examination of the conflict and dualism of the human urge to explore and possess the limits of knowledge and being.Kris Kelvin (Donatus Banionus) is a psychologist who is sent to the research station in orbit around the planet Solaris to prepare its crew for the station's shut down. Solaris, however, is not just a planet, but rather a living, evolving neural net, and the mission of the various scientists (Solarists) who have been studying it for decades is to understand and make contact. The earth-side administration for this project has become frustrated with the fact that the Solarists do not seem to be able to force a 'breakthrough', but it seems that Solaris itself has been reaching out in its own way. The story focuses on Kelvin's metamorphosis, but this is really just a vehicle for Lem's multitude of philosophical points. While intellectually brilliant, the film could not approach the philosophical scope of Lem's lucid but dense writing. Those who want to explore his ideas on extraterrestrial intelligence, the human condition, progress, etc, should read the book - after seeing the movie(s).The cinematography is absolutely superb. Each shot is a work of art. The acting is very good and very consistent - none of the actors falter and Natalya Bondarchuk (Hari) and Juri Jarvet (Dr. Snaut) are particularly mesmerizing. The pace may be a bit difficult - particularly for American audiences - but don't even start with this film if you are not willing to invest in it - it's not an easy film and it is well worth expending a bit of patience. Since this IS Sci Fi, I feel obligated to mention the special effects. They are appropriate to the subject matter - never overdone, and certainly not the focus of the film. Stephen Soderbergh's Americanized version of Solyaris http\/\/pro.imdb.com\/title\/tt0307479\/usercomments is one of the few Americanizations of a foreign film which does justice to the original, but still, Tarkovsky's film is the better of the two. What Soderbergh did particularly well was to translate Solaris from Soviet\/Eastern European to American cultural contexts. This involved dialog changes, characterization and a few subtle plot changes. Although both films focus heavily on the central male character, Soderbergh's film proportionally spends more time with Clooney to the detriment of his fellow Solarists. Perhaps the most noticeable plot change is the fact that Tarkovsky's film explains itself fairly early on as the scientists discuss the nature of the phenomena Solaris appears to cause, while in Soderbergh's film, the mysteries are retained for a bit longer. Finally, Tarkovsky's film is a work of art, and although Soderbergh's technique is very good, Tarkovsky's cinematography is unusually powerful. Every scene is picture-perfect. Both films are highly recommended, but only for patient and thoughtful Sci Fi and drama fans. If you're not sure, you may want to try Soderbergh's version first.

Shortly thereafter he helmed an unfortunate number of Hollywood films (American Flyers, Point of No Return) that may be considered guilty pleasures at best. He was also called upon by fellow director Peter Jackson to head up the second unit on all three Lord of the Rings films but declined. So what is the point of this little history lesson? Hollywood kills good directors (John Woo and Sam Raimi, prime examples).But, I digress. Despite the a lackluster couple of decades, John Badham does have a grand if only marginally well known legacy in Another Stakeout. Science fiction and horror fans will recognize and appreciate the premise; Detective Chris Lecce (Richard Dreyfuss) wakes up one day, goes through the motions like any and every other day, and slowly realizes that he is, inexplicably, on another stakeout. The scenario plays out basically as is expected but it is the manner of the presentation and plotting that make it remarkable.The film ultimately has only three characters, whose dynamic, touches on Alfred Hitchcock and Shakespeare without any pretense. Chris' subtle and deliberate decline into the reality of his new position in the world leads to him swinging from disbelief to depression to mania to megalomania to acceptance and back to disbelief. The storytelling and character interaction allow for empathy without distraction and the science fiction elements are beautifully woven into the fabric of the drama so that the one doesn't overshadow the other.There are several mysteries involved in the story that are revealed with wonderful precision by the director through a series of well placed flashbacks and the subtlety of mood and movement, but you'll have to find the film and watch it to understand the full glory.This is not a flashy film.

Wayne was right when he said that this ruined the myth of the old west; it updated the Western into a modern context. Whereas in the 50s we all had this idea of morally upright characters, just battles, and indomitable wills, the late 60s was a time in which the Vietnam war had shattered America, and the Western world, to the core. After the seemingly just victory over Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, there was a sense of justice in the world, helped by the fact that the coverage of the war came through propaganda films. In Vietnam the war was wholly politically, and by the late 60s the world had seen how brutal war really is through television footage, and how morally bankrupt it was. The world was thrown back into an existential crisis which stripped away all of our feelings about the way the world is, and our mythos for how the world was. And thus we have the Wild Bunch. At the start we feel that good will be done as Ernest Borgnine and William Holden, traditional heroes of cinema, ride forward in army gear. We expect them to bring order to a lawless town. Instead they rob a bank in one of the most bloody sequences in cinema. In this movie there are no good guys. The Mexican army are bad, the Wild Bunch are bad, and the law, the railroad companies, are bad. In the middle are two guys, Holden and Ryan, trying to make sense of all this. In this way I think the characters and the story are very interesting, and well thought out. But this is the WILD west, not Wayne's good 'ol West, where men were men, women were kept quiet, and homosexuals and non-white people were laughed out, or chased out of town. This movie showed not just that the West was violent, but that it was morally bankrupt. The only morals are what people made for themselves. Having said that the editing was not fantastic, and sometimes the directing was obvious and heavy-handed. But these points are easy looked over, as the action carries the story anyway.

Howard is a beer-swilling, cigar-chomping waterfowl from another planet who gets transported to Earth, befriends a struggling rocker (Lea Thompson, who gives the best performance of her career, I kid you not), and finds enmity in the form of an evil Dark Overlord.When it was released (and every day since then), HTD acquired a strong build-up of loathing from critics and viewers everywhere. Most people jumped on its cheesy one-liners, bad visual effects, numerous bestiality gags (those are pretty bewildering, I'll admit), and probably an early scene in which a female duck in a bathtub is shown with eerily bizarre anthropomorphic bosoms. But those (except, again, the last two) are the reasons why the film is so great.Nobody laughs at a master of Quack Fu! Desperate ducks commit desperate acts! What's white, ovoid, and reminds me of my birthday?- The eggs! Ducky also has a fantastic soundtrack, both in John Barry's score and the Thomas Dolby-produced original songs (both Hunger City and Howard the Duck have to be two of the best movie songs of all time). And the visual effects at least look semi-realistic-- or they would, if such things were physically possible. Today's technical FX wizards have but to punch computer buttons and things just appear for them; I appreciate the fact that these people put in some real effort.Unfortunately, it was quite clear that these people *couldn't* make it in Hunger City, and the film will never find its niche. But as far as Lucasfilm movies go, it's better than most of the Star Wars movies and every horrid second of THX 1138. It's even better than Willow! So check it out.

The acting was superb and although I could potentially pick faults in the script, it kind of takes away the whole essence of the film and what made it Beautiful.I think that it's great that a British film has made me really stop and think about my past and indeed my present. Not many films have achieved that. Which of us can honestly say that in watching the scenes between Jamie and Ste, that we haven't all felt and thought like they did. True for straights then swap one of the guys for a girl but the effect is much the same.I found it sad that some reviewers thought that the accents were too much and should have been toned down. Hello folks, its London were talking about here. Quite a few of them really do talk like that and lets face it, wouldn't it really be dumbing down. That would ruin the film.I found Sandra particularly well cast and played. There was real emotion between her and Jamie. I only wish that all Mothers and indeed Fathers reacted in such a supportive fashion. True the end of the film was a bit.....over done, but I don't think this detracts from the film in any way. I too, would like to have seen a sequel. I think that for quite a few of us, this film perhaps hit a little too close to the mark about ourselves and hence our desire to see the next part. I know that's true of me. There is a site that provides fan fiction for this film and allows some really great sequel variances that I really would recommend as an additional read to the film. It's at http\/\/www.daveant.net\/btfanfic\/At the end of the day, the film was enhanced for me by the fact that all of the sex scenes where left to the imagination and you could read what you would out of it. This film really touches me deeply and I wish there where more of the same style, class and calibre of this. Not to everyone's taste to be sure but one that stays sitting in my mind every day and perhaps has even influenced the way I am towards others. Thank you so much for creating this most excellent and heart wringing film.

However they soon realise that they need a great deal more water, a problem that can be solved by a spring that has long been forgotten in a neighbour's field. The neighbour dies and it is left to a hunchbacked tax collector Jean (Gerard Depardieu), who also has a dream to live as a farmer. As their dreams are not compatible, Ugolin and Cesar block up the spring and plot to rid themselves of their unwanted neighbour.Director Claude Berri shows great skill in bringing the classic Marcel Pagnol novel to the big screen and does it without losing any of the integrity of the source material, making a masterpiece of cinema in the process. Having seen it for the first time some years ago as part of French class at school, it has not disappointed on repeated viewings.The acting from all the cast is impeccable, especially the three leads, Yves Montard, Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil, whose names are not among the most famous in the history of French cinema for nothing. Casting Elisabeth Depardieu (at the time the wife of Gerard) in the role of Jean's wife adds something to the realism and Ernestine Mazurowna acquits herself admirably in her only film role to date as Jean's daughter.The film acts as a beautifully observed study in human nature and morality. What I love about the book is that unlike the majority of fiction that labels actions in black or white, all through both parts of this drama there are shades of grey. Despicable though the actions of Papet are, he is working for the benefit of Ugolin rather than himself. Also, though most of the villagers appear to suspect that Papet and Ugolin have blocked up the spring, none seem willing to do anything about it and they just watch Jean on his way to his inevitable destruction, so the whole blame can not be left at the doorstep of the Soubeyrans. It is interesting how different the characters of the three leads are. Simple-minded Ugolin gradually loses patience and is corrupted by the far more intelligent and hard-hearted Papet into following his greed. Jean remains steadfast despite all the setbacks he faces, remaining good and ever optimistic despite his increasing troubles.The decision to use Giuseppe Verdi's 'The Force of Destiny' as the title music is entirely apt, though makes more sense after the viewing of 'Manon des Sources.' The cinematography is also superb, making a stunning backdrop to the film and capturing the mood of the story perfectly. Though it is debatable as to whether or not this film or the sequel is superior, I prefer to think of them as two halves of a whole rather than two separate entities. Manon des Sources is pretty much required viewing for anyone who wants to get a fuller appreciation of 'Jean de Florette.' Cinema at its best.

I was expecting what I had heard about with Ben-Hur, and got that- the vengeance plot, the chariot race, a story of redemption with Christ as a background figure and major presence- but I wasn't expecting such things revealed like the devastation left on a family by leprosy, and the disintegration of one's morality by the cloud of vengeance on one's mind. Even if you're not much of a Christian (and even as a non-practicing Jew as I am), there are some deep chords that are struck with the material for an audience that is going in not expecting a lot of sermonizing. Only in the final reels, as we see first-hand the 'Christ' as he is sent to die on the cross, does the film get overbearing with the symbolism and heavy weight of the circumstance of this being a tale of the Christ.This isn't to say also that with Judah Ben-Hur having the strife in coming to terms with his family being at first, he thinks, dead, and then later as made deformed thanks to the Roman's imprisonment, that this is all the film is. It's also grand spectacle, a film that takes you along on its epic ride with imagery that pierced the public consciousness so strongly that you've seen the scenes as parodies or referenced before you've even seen the film. Surely we have the chariot race to contend with, which has been so influential on modern action sequences and chases that Lucas copied most of the choreography for the pod race in Phantom Menace. And to give credit where it's due, you could show that same sequence in any theater today and it would unquestionably bring down the house, not just for its technical achievement but for the visceral impact (i.e. the downfall of Ben-Hur's rival by his own undoing).But there's also other great images; possibly my favorite are the scenes with Judah Ben-Hur as #41 among the rowing slaves, all moving at the whim of the drum beat. That in and of itself would make Ben-Hur a must-see. But then there are more emotionally impactive places and settings, like the valley of the lepers, Judah's struggle across the desert (and the tastefully done angle of Jesus' back only), many others that would take too long to mention. It's all so massive a production that it's almost TOO big (according to Charlton Heston the budget, at 14 million then as the most expensive film ever made, would today cost something like 250 million), and it's a credit to William Wyler that he never makes it too dull, even as supporting characters may verge on leaning to overacting. With only calling attention to it at certain moments (and sometimes not at all with a more subtle effect), Wyler is a virtuoso here in corralling all aspects of the production under his firm handle.And then there's Heston, who gives one of the very best of his (now late) career. He's full of bravura and gusto, and seems like a guy- for those guys who crave action film stars- who can get things done in the right mindset. But he's also excellent at conveying the tragedy of this character, a very good man with high ideals who becomes corrupted by his need to get his respite. Underneath all of that machismo and the swagger that eventually became old hat for Heston, is a strong presence at the helm of Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd, too, is also very good as the boyhood friend turned rival. In fact, most of the actors here are very good, from Hawkins to Hazareet to Jaffe to O'Donnel and so on, as they all contribute to the epic scope.

I was expecting what I had heard about with Ben-Hur, and got that- the vengeance plot, the chariot race, a story of redemption with Christ as a background figure and major presence- but I wasn't expecting such things revealed like the devastation left on a family by leprosy, and the disintegration of one's morality by the cloud of vengeance on one's mind. Even if you're not much of a Christian (and even as a non-practicing Jew as I am), there are some deep chords that are struck with the material for an audience that is going in not expecting a lot of sermonizing. Only in the final reels, as we see first-hand the 'Christ' as he is sent to die on the cross, does the film get overbearing with the symbolism and heavy weight of the circumstance of this being a tale of the Christ.This isn't to say also that with Judah Ben-Hur having the strife in coming to terms with his family being at first, he thinks, dead, and then later as made deformed thanks to the Roman's imprisonment, that this is all the film is. It's also grand spectacle, a film that takes you along on its epic ride with imagery that pierced the public consciousness so strongly that you've seen the scenes as parodies or referenced before you've even seen the film. Surely we have the chariot race to contend with, which has been so influential on modern action sequences and chases that Lucas copied most of the choreography for the pod race in Phantom Menace. And to give credit where it's due, you could show that same sequence in any theater today and it would unquestionably bring down the house, not just for its technical achievement but for the visceral impact (i.e. the downfall of Ben-Hur's rival by his own undoing).But there's also other great images; possibly my favorite are the scenes with Judah Ben-Hur as #41 among the rowing slaves, all moving at the whim of the drum beat. That in and of itself would make Ben-Hur a must-see. But then there are more emotionally impactive places and settings, like the valley of the lepers, Judah's struggle across the desert (and the tastefully done angle of Jesus' back only), many others that would take too long to mention. It's all so massive a production that it's almost TOO big (according to Charlton Heston the budget, at 14 million then as the most expensive film ever made, would today cost something like 250 million), and it's a credit to William Wyler that he never makes it too dull, even as supporting characters may verge on leaning to overacting. With only calling attention to it at certain moments (and sometimes not at all with a more subtle effect), Wyler is a virtuoso here in corralling all aspects of the production under his firm handle.And then there's Heston, who gives one of the very best of his (now late) career. He's full of bravura and gusto, and seems like a guy- for those guys who crave action film stars- who can get things done in the right mindset. But he's also excellent at conveying the tragedy of this character, a very good man with high ideals who becomes corrupted by his need to get his respite. Underneath all of that machismo and the swagger that eventually became old hat for Heston, is a strong presence at the helm of Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd, too, is also very good as the boyhood friend turned rival. In fact, most of the actors here are very good, from Hawkins to Hazareet to Jaffe to O'Donnel and so on, as they all contribute to the epic scope.

He gets send on a top-secret operation to bring back POW's still held in Vietnam. Dumb, big, overblown action movies really don't get any better than this! It's therefor shameful that his movie currently has a mere 5.5 rating on here. This movie is a true '80's action classic. Although yes, I admit I have always had a weak spot for Rambo and Rocky movies, perhaps because they are so overblown and quite silly once you start thinking more about it but yet always manage to work out so well.The movie is actually quite in contrast with the previous first Rambo movie; First Blood. In that movie in fact hardly any soul died, while in this movie Rambo is on one big killing spree. Rambo shows his killing spirit again, when he returns to Vietnam, that is often described in this movie as his 'home'. He is one of those persons who lives and should die on the battlefield and isn't much good for much else. This is what also got him in trouble in the first Rambo movie. It's this movie and the other sequels that made Rambo a synonym for action and killing. A true one man army, while the first movie was a much more personal and restrained movie with its main character. You understood the character while now instead you have a tough character simply running and shooting on everything that is moving. It's a sort of shame that they didn't developed the Rambo character any further from the same perspective as in the first movie. But oh well, than we wouldn't had the big overblown Rambo character we know today and Sylvester Stallone is so well known for. The story is this time written by Sylvester Stallone himself and none other than James Cameron, who worked on the screenplay before getting fame as the director\/writer of The Terminator. However this doesn't also mean this movie has a good story. In fact if you start over-analyzing it, it's pretty poor all, so lets just simply not do so. This is not an action movie that's a bout its story. if you want an action movie with content you should stick to watching the first Rambo movie.Of course not only the Vietnamese but also the Russians get involved because after all this movie got made during the cold war. A theme that also often returned in several Sylvester Stallone flicks, as if he fought his personal own cold war during that time.It's mostly this movie that shows why Sylvester Stallone is one of the biggest action heroes that ever lived. He is tough, has big muscles, knows how to handle guns and smaller weapons such as his knife and good old bow & arrow. This is however not Sylvester Stallone's finest acting moment tough, while he was still rather good in the first Rambo movie. But I don't really think that this movie its story allowed any of its actors to shine in it. The movie also features Steven Berkoff, who always knows to play the sort of ultimate Russian villain, even though he himself is British. Richard Crenna also reprises his role again from the first movie.The action is nice and big and is what makes this movie such a fine one to watch, especially of course when you're into the genre. The movie is directed who was an action movie specialist, even though his movies were often of questionable quality, except for Tombstone, which was his finest moment, even though its debatable how much of that movie he actually directed. The movie is being uplifted even more by the musical score. It's Jerry Goldsmith's best score for a Rambo movie and a true fine piece of action scoring.

The bridge on the river Kwai and 12 Angry Men. Both of them has enough power to blow you out of your mind and possibly your seat, but hopefully not your window ) This production is of course not a very big one, not involving any CGI or action sequences. But, it just proved again a movie should essentially be justified by its story, not the visual effects, unless you can make all the visual effects a part of the movie, which will not be discussed here. 12 Angry Men is, to my surprise, not really a court movie, but instead, a jury room movie. 99% of the story was told in the same room, showing 12 men talking with each other in probably the real time. When I realized this, I was fearing the next 90 minutes could be a boring torture. But I was sooooo wrong.The interactions of all the characters are simply awesome. Henry Fonda is not less and not more than what he intends to be--a good guy. Thruogh the 90 minutes all he was doing was to bring justice and truth back to the eyes of jury, I was surprised by how advanced the director's cinematographic and editing were.

El Mariachi (the character) was wonderfully played by Carlos Gallardo, who should have gotten an award for his part. You sympathized and rooted for him throughout the entire film.

For those not familiar with the term one-shot comic book, it means a stand alone story that lasts only for one issue and does not have to be part of the traditional canon. The result is essentially a mixed bag of characterizations, but nevertheless a film that mostly entertains, but at the same time provided a foundation for downfall.This film has Batman (Val Kilmer) contending with both Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and, who are in cahoots in their attempts to get rid of Batman and Bruce Wayne respectively. This goes on as Bruce Wayne, Batman and criminal psychologist Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) are going through a strange love triangle. Bruce Wayne also adopts young Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell) as his ward after the death of Grayson's parents, and eventually takes him under his wing as his sidekick Robin in his fight against crime.When it was released in 1995, the most surprising element came in the direction the film took. Gone was the dark, macabre playground that existed in the Burton films, but instead, a more campy and light-hearted experience. Schumacher's Gotham City is neon-lit and grandiose, and the visuals as a result are engaging. The tone of the film has far more humor compared to the predecessors, sort of a mild throwback to the 1966 series. The soundtrack is also lighter, as heard in Elliott Goldenthal's score and U2 and Seal's theme songs.Kilmer does a somewhat decent job as Batman and is better as Bruce Wayne compared to Michael Keaton. Kilmer's Bruce Wayne in this film is shown as he should be a celebrity and socialite, rather than a morose recluse. O'Donnell is more Jason Todd than Dick Grayson, in that he is more petulant and reckless than Dick Grayson should be (just to clarify for those who don't know, Jason Todd was the second Robin in the comic book series who was known as an angry miscreant). Chase Meridian, created for this film, is a mixed bag, but Kidman does a good job of making her as alluring as possible.Carrey is entertaining to watch, but he is far too manic as the Riddler, who should be more calculating than zany. Jones gives the worst interpretation of all the comic book characters, in that his Two-Face is not really Two-Face. Rather than being a conflicted, morally complex foe, he is simplified into a weird manic-depressive and being more silly than menacing. The way he referred to himself as we was completely off and the scene where he flips his coin repeatedly was completely wrong, as Two-Face would always accept the first outcome of his coin flips. This was particularly disappointing, given that Two-Face is perhaps one of the most tragic villains in comic book history, given his transition from being a legal crusader against injustice (and one of Bruce Wayne's closest friends) into a super-criminal bent on destroying the system he once fought for.The interesting paradox of Batman Forever is that there is sort of an attempt at investigating and attempting to delve deeper into the characters, but that comes at the expense of many of the characters being true to the comic books. In a way, one can sympathize with Warner Brothers decision to make the film lighter, as it is, theoretically speaking of course, better business, given how violent and grim Batman Returns was. This caused the film however to take too many deviations from the comic book to be an effective adaptation. Because it was campy, that set the stage for Batman and Robin to become an atrocity. Furthermore, Schumacher's name with casual and hardcore fans has become synonymous with the sequel to this film, thus hurting the credibility of Batman Forever. As a committed Batman fan, I do feel there are problems with the way the characters were portrayed. However, as a film-goer, I was entertained by what I saw and took it for what it was cinematic comfort food.

My sources must, therefore, have been faulty, for the first two-thirds of the film perceptibly avoid any genuine associations with the genre, and the main character's interactions with an exploitative femme fatale and her violent boyfriend are played primarily as a light drama, almost as a dry comedy. Most of the story up until this point, with the exception of a suitably dark and stormy opening, plays out in broad daylight, failing &#150; or, indeed, not even trying &#150; to evoke that sense of claustrophobic anxiety that is present in film noir's finer representatives. Because we are consistently kept well-informed of our villains' wrongdoings, there's little sense of shock, deception and betrayal, and, at various points in the story, it almost seems as though we're supposed to actually sympathise with Kitty March (Joan Bennett).Viewed as a straight drama, Lang's film is considerably more effective, if only because the viewer is not waiting on the first cold-blooded murder that is so long in arriving. Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) is a docile, dependable cashier, a dull bank employee with fruitless aspirations to become a recognised artist. Stuck in an excruciating marriage to a wife (Rosalind Ivan) he can't stand, Chris decides, on one particularly stormy late night, to stray from his comfort zone, and thus achieves a level of happiness that he had never experienced. After ostensibly rescuing a helpless damsel, Katharine Kitty March (Joan Bennett), from the clutches of a would-be attacker (Dan Duryea), Chris risks a tentative relationship with the young women, never realising that Kitty is cunningly exploiting his affection for her own monetary gain. When Kitty and boyfriend Johnny begin passing off Chris' unique paintings as Kitty's own work, I momentarily thought that I'd strayed into the mistaken identity trappings of an Astaire-Rogers musical; the tone of the story is much too light to pass for film noir, and might easily have been transplanted into a fully-realised comedy.Of course, my description thus far has neglected any mention of the film's final thirty minutes, when the film undergoes an intense and radical transformation. Following the unexpected return of Adele Cross' ex-husband, and an ironically-ineffective blackmail attempt, the film finally strays decisively into the classic film-noir tradition, and what an entrance it is! Exploding with alarming abruptness into a fit of brutal cold-blooded violence, the typically-meek Chris hacks Kitty to death with the blade of an ice-pick, and callously allows her cocky boyfriend to die for the crime. Though the Production Code typically dictated that all murderers must either die or be convicted, Lang reserves an even more disturbing punishment for his main character; the guilt and torment of his actions leaves Chris a cold, soulless figure prowling the squalid streets of the city, forever a prisoner of his own conscience.

When Kitty and boyfriend Johnny begin passing off Chris' unique paintings as Kitty's own work, I momentarily thought that I'd strayed into the mistaken identity trappings of an Astaire-Rogers musical; the tone of the story is much too light to pass for film noir, and might easily have been transplanted into a fully-realised comedy.Of course, my description thus far has neglected any mention of the film's final thirty minutes, when the film undergoes an intense and radical transformation. Following the unexpected return of Adele Cross' ex-husband, and an ironically-ineffective blackmail attempt, the film finally strays decisively into the classic film-noir tradition, and what an entrance it is! Exploding with alarming abruptness into a fit of brutal cold-blooded violence, the typically-meek Chris hacks Kitty to death with the blade of an ice-pick, and callously allows her cocky boyfriend to die for the crime. Though the Production Code typically dictated that all murderers must either die or be convicted, Lang reserves an even more disturbing punishment for his main character; the guilt and torment of his actions leaves Chris a cold, soulless figure prowling the squalid streets of the city, forever a prisoner of his own conscience. Had the film maintained this dark, bleak tone for the entirety of its running time &#150; rather than just for its final act &#150; 'Scarlet Street' would certainly have been a superior thriller, but, even as it stands, at least a single viewing is essential.
