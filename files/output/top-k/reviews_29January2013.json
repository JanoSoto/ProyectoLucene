When I was in high school, nothing happened, and I don't remember meeting one single person with depth, or even any interest in acquiring depth.All the actors were way past high school age. That's a common phenomenon, but the effect is to make us view high school students as essentially adults. In real life, they look and act younger and dumber than the actors who play them. Some of the girls were 25-27.Nevertheless, I admired the way these kids were engaged in life and school. They have friends, relationships, a school play, hard classes, extra curricular activities, and cars. There are high school kids who are fully engaged like this for sure.I also liked the idea of an accessible Principal or Dean. Those guys are educators, but most of us saw them as annoyances when we were young.The huge failing of this picture was the pathetically weak build-up to the lost friend's suicide. He felt overwhelmed by the pressure to be productive, so he jumps off a cliff? I know that he may have been drinking, but I just don't buy it. Having said that, the movie really wasn't about that. It was about his suicide's effect on those he left behind.I think that it affected the other kids so deeply, not because they knew him well and loved him..although Keanu did, but because he was a teen icon to them. He was a rock, even to those who just admired him from afar, because he represented stability, confidence, capability, success, and opportunity. One character mentions that notion. (If David couldn't make it, what chance do the rest have, who don't have even half his ability and talent?) The film shows the kids in Portland and the beach constantly, as if those two places are close to one another. They are not. So I am assuming that they lived somewhere between Portland and the beach and frequented both places. I liked the exterior shots at the beach and in the city, with a light rail system.I couldn't stand the sappy, sentimental song solo at the end. But I suppose that the character was determined to memorialize David (suicide character), by singing his composition, even though it was in the midst of an established classic play. (David had been working on this song for his band to record) I didn't really believe the blonde who had been David's sex partner. I get the idea that a busy guy like him didn't really have time for a relationship, but she looked too worldly and old. If you look her up, you will see that she was some kind of beauty queen in real life, and was pushing 27 in the film.I also did not get the Jennifer Rubin character.

I guess she just admired him enormously.I did however love the way one actress portrayed Keanu Reeve's girlfriend. She was quirky and genuinely supportive and involved in people's lives. She tried to be a good girlfriend, despite her boyfriend's eccentricities, she was trying to find herself through writing, and she tried earnestly to memorialize David. Great job by this girl who played a sex role in Valley Girl 5 years earlier.Everyone has already complimented Reeves for his break-down crying scene. I will too.

It is that last scenario that may very well be why time travel is as appealing to us as it is. What if we could go back and change the errors of our ways or save the lives of those lost in some tragedy, be it war, an accident, or murder. Many movies have featured this but not as many manage to do it with as much action, suspense, and good writing as 1997's Retroactive.This nice, little film was released as a direct to video piece but don't let that fool you; as you soon discover while watching this, not all direct to video movies belong on the direct to video docket. In the beginning, we are introduced to Brian (played by the great character actor Frank Whaley) who is desperately trying to save a top secret time traveling project from being cut by the pentagon. He succeeds in sending a dead mouse who was just killed by a trap in a maze back in time as well as bringing it back to life. However, he only realizes this after watching a video he made of himself while performing the experiment. You see, only the person or animal who goes through the machine will remember what happened before hand while everyone else has no memory at all. Enters Chicago police negotiator Karen (played by the beautiful and talented Kylie Travis who would only go on acting for a few more years before marrying a New York real estate magnate in 2001. Lucky for her but a shame for us movie goers) who's running away from her own past when she crashes her car into a road side sign while traveling the lonely desert roads of Texas. While stranded, she's picked up by a seemly jovial man named Frank (played by the always delightful James Belushi) and his wife Rayanne (played by Shannon Whirry in a very convincing performance). Everything's goes well until they stop at at a gas station and Frank learns from the shop owner (M. Emmet Walsh, another great character actor) that his wife's been having an affair. From there, we soon discover that underneath Frank's jovial persona lurks a psychotic killer and he responds to the facts by killing his wife and chasing Karen to a concrete building which just happens to be the secret lab of Brian. One thing leads to another and before she knows what's happening, Karen finds herself back in the car with Frank twenty minutes in the past. She decides to try to change the events but only ends up making things worse. She then goes back in time again but makes things even more terrible than she did during the first attempt of changing the past.And that's what makes the movie as suspenseful and entertaining as it is can Karen change the past for the better or is she doomed to an eternity of time traveling folly? The film accomplishes this by weaving together a story that manages to be intelligent while at the same time keeping you on the edge of your seat. The effects that are used for the time traveling scenes are very good while at the same time the filmmakers are careful in not allowing them to be the drive of the picture like you see in some films. I must also emphasize that James Belushi is pure entertainment in the role of bigger than life Texas psychopath Frank. Its because of little films like this that made 90's cinema so great, that combination of having a cool story and a great production to make it.

Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker\/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's  Wealth of Nations  in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker\/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's  Wealth of Nations  in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

I want to say there is a general lack of tension. Some may completely disagree with this, as I have seen many who felt there was plenty of tension and suspense but I wasn't getting it. I sat through the film feeling like I was watching reality TV, not in a good way though. Common people doing in a realistic way a common thing (as far as their job is concerned). Problem for me was that they were so ordinary they were boring as well as falling into two-dimensional. The acting was by no means an issue here though, I'll admit that. I just didn't feel anything for them as characters. See, this is the problem I ran into. The tension wasn't high enough to keep me on the edge of my seat and so that leads me to pay attention to the characters, but the characters aren't interesting enough to care about which leads me to not caring what happens to them. So when the tension actually does rise I'm meh about it. There is one part in the film that uses a great use of camera work with lighting to create a creepy and back chilling affect. Problem is, this is the only time and it happens middle of the movie. Build up, peak, then plummet into meh. In the end the movie (which I watched alone and in the dark) did not make me even feel a little bit uncomfortable (aside from one event in the middle) and left me underwhelmed. I didn't have trouble dismissing it. It could have used a clue from, can't believe I'm saying this, Paranormal Activity, in how to capitalize on camera angles. Long hallways with corners and lighting or lack of that barely touched the potential to make you freak without a sudden scare tactic. I kept waiting for that shadow or subtle outline, something to make me feel like there was someone, or something there with them.I can't justify more than 5\/10 because I walked away feeling like I had found out my friend bought a chocolate bar with almonds when he wanted crunch.

Basically eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) has invited five strangers, who he personally knows in some way, to a party he is putting on for his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), he is throwing it in a secluded mansion, and he has offered each of the people $10,000 to spend one night in the house thought to be haunted. These five strangers, Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.) and Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum), who all arrive in funeral cars, are all told that they can leave before the stroke of midnight, but all the doors and windows have been barred and secured, so there is no means of escape once they are locked in, and if they stay and survive the entire night they will each be paid $10,000. Loren also explains about the rumours of the ghosts that haunt the mansion, and he gives each of the people a pistol to defend themselves, but Annabelle tries to convince them all that he is psychotic, they all grow suspicious of him and are naturally very nervy about the house. Nora quickly becomes terrified and fearful for her life as she sees what looks like mysterious ghouls and the doors and walls make loud noises, and she is not interested in staying in the house, even for the money, but the people are trapped when the doors have been locked before the start time. The big shock comes though when Annabelle is found dead having hanged herself above the staircase, so everyone is told to return to their rooms until the morning and keep themselves safe, Lance wants to help Nora as much as he can, but she thinks that Loren wants to kill her and the others. It turns out though that Annabelle is not dead, and has been planning with Dr. Trent to make someone kill her husband so that she can get her hands on his fortune, obviously hysterical Nora is the obvious person that could shoot her, and sure enough she does mistaking him for one of the ghosts she thinks she is seeing. Dr. Trent tries to dispose of the body of Loren in the acid pit in the basement, where a body will melt until only the bones are left, but the lights go out, and both men disappear, and when Annabelle appears she sees a skeleton emerge from the vat, but all of the sudden thought the skeleton rises and the voice of Loren is heard, she recoils in terror and accidentally backs off and falls into the acid, and the real Loren comes out of the darkness, he was controlling the skeleton which is the body of Dr. Trent. Nora thinking she killed him takes all the guests to the basement, and Loren explains the whole night was to stop his wife killing him for his money, and all the guns were loaded with blanks, but paranoid drunk house keeper Pritchard looks terrified and announces that the ghosts are coming for them. Also starring Leona Anderson as Mrs. Slydes, Howard Hoffman as Jonas and Skeleton as Himself (LOL that is genuinely a name in the cast). Price with his indelible voice and charismatic personality gives a zesty performance as the man trying to scare his guests, Cook Jr. plays the paranoid drunk very well, and the other players are fine as well, the film is filled with obviously camp and old fashioned tactics to scare the audience, with decapitated heads, witches and an acid vat, but this only adds to the fun, and there are some genuinely spooky and jumpy moments to keep you satisfied, a terrific horror.

Never been there. But I taught middle and high school for 13 years, and then was a school administrator for another 20. Overall, TSWL is believable.With that out of the way, I just want to say a few words about Sidney Poitier. I didn't always like the films Poitier chose to make, but there was never a role that he took that didn't impress me. Poitier had a power on screen that is rarely matched. He's one of those few actors who can say as much without speaking, as many actors say with long soliloquies. And just watch the way he projects anger -- not by being loud or vocal, but with something inside that even the viewer can see. And while this isn't my favorite Poitier film (that is reserved for Guess Who's Coming To Dinner), it's a close second. I hope we never forget what a national treasure Sidney Poitier was and is.The other thing that impresses me about this film is that the kids and the situations seem real. At least to American audiences, none of the young actors are well known (except, of course, for Lulu, and she is known primarily for her singing). Yet, their portrayals here are very realistic.I rarely give an 8, but I will for this film. Watch it! It's a treasure, as was Sidney Poitier. I'd have him to dinner anytime.

Julianne Potter (Roberts) is a New York food critic, who, after receiving a mysterious voicemail from her former lover and long-time best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), realizes her affection for him. Unfortunately for her, upon returning Michael's call, Julianne learns that the new-found man of her dreams has himself met someone and intends to marry her within four days.Unaware of Julianne's recently acquired feelings for him, Michael insists that she join the wedding party in Chicago and support him in his hour of need. After some goading from her other best friend, George (Rupert Everett), Julianne decides to go in the hope of breaking up the couple before they can say their I dos. The ensuing madness is both enchanting and hilarious, as Julianne finds herself being continually and innocuously bested by Michael's fiancé, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), resulting in a series of hilariously irate phone calls to George, who always happens to field them at the worst possible times (i.e. his entire family gets an earful from the answering machine over dinner.)Diaz and Roberts are perfect comedic matches for one another as the innocently saccharine fiancé and the plotting best friend, and Mulroney is so suave and sexy as the man of our dreams (as Roberts puts it) that it's incredible more of the film's female population aren't fighting for his affection. Everett is equally well cast in the role of George, the gay best friend who plays it straight at one point for Julianne's sake. His scenes provide some of the film's funniest moments, particularly when George teasingly embarrasses Julianne in front of the rest of the wedding party by launching into his rendition of I'll Say a Little Prayer (For You).Aside from just its comedy, which is considerable, and its romance, which is unorthodox, My Best Friend's Wedding succeeds because its characters are fully-formed, dimensional beings who live in a very real world. Julianne, with all of her charm and charisma, is really just a desperate, wavering soul who fears what might happen if everyone finds happiness besides her. Kimmy, instead of being flat and static (as the other girl is wont to be in a romantic comedy), is a likable and endearing character that the audience can empathize with. Michael, however, is perhaps the most fascinating character of them all.Michael is both the perfect best friend- teasing and adoring, while never crossing the line- and the perfect boyfriend. He balances his affection for both of the women in his life and draws his own line regarding the ways in which he can love each of them. His decisions and character both break the traditional mold of a romantic comedy's dream guy by injecting a measure of reality and at the same time uphold it, by demonstrating that there is a way in which a strong, selfless, and moral man can exist without becoming a mere fantasy.

As such, City Lights serves as a kind of watershed. His prior work basks in certain boisterousness and hyper-energy that his later work, whilst impeccably refined, does not exhibit to the same degree. Perhaps there is a sense of self- consciousness that many later works display. Perhaps these early works, now that I'm revisiting them so consciously in retrospect, contain more of Chaplin's exuberance. Or then it's just me projecting, aggressively.Be that as it may, The Gold Rush (1925) is an altogether enchanting film. Tragicomic in its exultation of love on one hand and its portrayal of the love here as a mere fling on the other, there are many wonderful visual moments that have been used to build our cinematic pantheon the cottage in the storm, the eating of the shoe, the roll dance. And in the midst of the fireworks, there's Chaplin himself, his timing perfectly nuanced, his expressions fresh. He is at his most handsome, charismatic and unforgettable in how he reacts to the roll dance reception &#x96; just look at the man!I prefer the longer, original 1926 cut to the 1942 sound version, mainly because I just can't see the point in having the voice-over. The newer version cuts a few corners, some of which are for the better, and perhaps it is the voice-over that allows Chaplin to do it, but I don't see it as so much tighter a film to encourage myself to revisit it as often as the 1925 cut. The older version breathes and never lags. It could, however, be a nice experience to watch the 1942 cut with the sound off.Whichever your preference, the beautiful Blu-ray released by the Criterion Collection (Region A) is worth its weight in gold, as are all their Chaplin releases for that matter.
