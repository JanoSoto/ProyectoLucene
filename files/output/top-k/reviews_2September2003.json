[{"date":"2 September 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore, as so many others on this website have already pointed out, is subtly drawn movie that is actually better with multiple viewers.  Whether you consider it to be a great comedy or not really depends more on your sense of humor than on Wes Anderson's script, but that's true for any comedy.This film is worth seeing for Bill Murray's performance alone, easily one of his best.  The rest of the cast is also pretty solid for that matter, especially Jason Schwartzman.   There are a few things about this movie that bother me, and most of it centers on the character of Max Fischer (not Schwartzman's portrayal of him).  Maybe I shouldn't be so critical, but I can't justify calling something a cinematic masterpiece simply because it is being compared largely to a bunch of second and third rate films that had no business being made in the first place.  Still, by all accounts, `Rushmore' is a very good film and deserves most of the accolades it has received.****************SPOILER ALERT***********************In the movie trailer, Max is compared to the likes of Leonardo, Shakespeare, and Einstein, some of the greatest human beings to ever step foot on the planet Earth.  Max is certainly great in his own mind, and he probably has the potential for greatness in the real world.  Maybe it's just me, but Max comes across as a pathetic overachiever.   Sure he is involved in every school activity under the sun, and can deliver the occasional wry comment or two, but he is too caught up trying to be everything to everyone that he doesn't really appear to be much of anybody at all.  At least, that's all Wes Anderson allows us to see of him.  Take for example Max's student plays. His plays cover some potentially entertaining subject matter, but do we ever really know if he is a great playwright and\/or director?  Who knows? This is an interesting theatrical device by Anderson, but we only get a small nibble of what Max is doing on the stage.  There isn't anything shown in `Rushmore' to suggest that Max has any real talent as a playwright.  I wish Anderson would have done more with these play sequences, perhaps used them more as a vehicle for Max to woo Miss Cross instead of the -Aquarium.  When Max asks Herman for $8 million to build the aquarium for Miss Cross, the two of them aren't exactly best friends anymore.  Is Herman really crazy enough about Miss Cross to throw away 80% of his net worth to help Max get this aquarium built so they can impress her?  Well, I suppose if we can believe that Max is the next Bill Shakespeare we can believe this as well.Lastly, why in the heck does Max give up on Miss Cross in the finale and settle for Margaret?  This seems totally out of character for him.  We spend two thirds of the movie watching Max scheme and make a total w**ker out of himself to try and win a woman over twice his age.  Despite all his hair brained plans and seemingly hopeless efforts, I couldn't help but sympathize and root for the guy after awhile.  Then for whatever reason, he throws in the towel at the end.  Damn Max, you really are pathetic.
