[{"date":"5 September 2015","score":"","review":" The synopsis for 'Run Lola Run' is as follows After a botched money delivery, Lola has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 Deutschmarks to save her boyfriend Manni from the wrath of his boss. Now on first glance that looks very thin and it also looks like the plot for a very generic and bland action film. But that's where the viewer can get misled. This film is all about the themes that the director\/writer is trying to explore and I find it to be immensely captivating.'Fate', 'Alternate Realities', 'Butterfly effects' etc. are primarily the themes that are dealt with here. These aforementioned themes can sound pretty daunting and heavy, but it is due to the director and writer Tom Tykwer's brilliance that even though the themes are larger-than-life, the film itself is packaged and crafted in the most exciting and enjoyable manner possible. Most parts of the film take place in real time which heighten the tension in the air. It kept reminding me of that brilliant montage in David Fincher's 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' which beautifully underlined the concept of the Butterfly Effect which basically deals with the fact that little, subtle and seemingly minor day-to-day events can have a huge bearing on and can alter the fate and destiny of a person's life. Well 'Run Lola Run' is pretty much the film version of that scene revolving around this concept. A connection can also be made with 'No Country for Old Men'. The basic philosophy that drove Anton Chigurh in his gruesome deeds was his belief that everything depended on chance. Free Will and an almighty superpower do not exist. 'Run Lola Run' also explores that very concept of chance and its effect on life and fate through the Butterfly Effect. Similar to 'No Country for Old Men', this film too in a way towards the end hints towards the idea that maybe human decisions borne out of our own will can have some bearing on the outcome of our life and our destiny, and maybe, just maybe there is someone up there who has a hand in shaping our lives by judging the choices that we make. But that's just my interpretation and this film is open to multiple interpretations.Tom Tykwer's vision and his direction has to be admired here. He showed a lot of boldness to make such an experimental film and still make it a film that has an effect in the minds of the viewer. This film is philosophical, but it is also impeccably stylish. The screenplay is influenced by Groundhog Day. The whole film looks like a prolonged 90s music video. The soundtrack comprises primarily of techno pop and percussion based scores and it completely complements the visual style of the film. The cinematography is also admirable. The film is very colourful in nature with colours being used to convey certain themes. Tom Twyker skilfully maintains the speed and the tension of the film throughout the runtime. Another important thing that helps the film is that it is only 81 minutes long. The short length helps it because the novelty of the experimentation and Tykwer's visual style does not wear off.'Run Lola Run' is not only snazzy and exciting, but it is also philosophical and will encourage debates and analytical conversations. I think it is extensively re-watchable too. Highly recommended.

A blend of unique, exciting and sophisticated storytelling, and visual mastery. Rashomon is essentially a crime mystery set in Japan. The crime is recalled very differently from different people's perspectives, so the audience is never entirely sure what the truth actually is. You build up an idea of the characters, but since they're presented differently each time, you can never have a set idea of who they truly are. The way the plot structured is very stimulating. Often plots that work this way come together at the end like a jigsaw puzzle, but not so with Rashomon. You're left with four very different jigsaw puzzles and no real answers. Visually it's truly excellent. The men recounting the story in a temple in the pouring rain is a glorious visual. I found the whole world that has been created very convincing and completely absorbing. Kurosawa builds tension through knowing exactly when to cut and when to linger, and the music creeps right under your skin. My only minor criticism of the film would be that, by choosing not to show the court, Tajomaru talks in a strange expositional way where he'll repeat the unheard question before giving his answer. This just wasn't my favorite thing as it was a stylistic choice that brought me out of the film if only for a moment. Other than that this film is pretty much perfectly balanced with truly stunning performances. The acting is so visceral, and it has to be to capture the many nuances of these characters. Mifune as Tajomaru is particularly absorbing with his constant animalistic stance and his frequent itching. It's hard to take your eyes off him.I thought this film perfectly captured much of the human essence. Of how people think of themselves, and how they think about others. It will keep you mesmerised throughout and thinking long after it has finished. Masterful storytelling from one of the masters of cinema.

The Fantastic Voyage (in-case you didn't read the description) is a movie about a team of people being shrunken down inside a nuclear sub to then be injected inside someones bloodstream to remove a clot of the brain. The movie is definitely far-fetched and doesn't go into much detail about where the shrink-ray* came from, how it was developed, or why its effects are not permanent. Anyways, the point is this movie doesn't have a lot of depth to it in plot but it has an interesting story.Now anyways the movie was released in 1966 which was way WAY before I was born and I understand the effects weren't great back then but this movie actually surprised me. I don't think any of the scenes to me looked like a cheesy old 60's movie. Maybe it had something to do with me watching an HD copy but the actual scenes looked pretty good. The sets were interesting and the special effects looked great.Now back to the story... so your in a sub travelling inside the human body... most movies nowadays would just show a journey and the destination but not the exact parts of the journey. This movie actually described where they were in the human body, what certain parts and conditions were called (assuming anything said was remotely accurate), and what function a lot of the parts of the body did. The movie was very educational* (again assuming anything said was accurate) and entertaining to watch! I never thought that the space between our blood cells would have another fluid... I always thought our blood was made up of cells moving all together at once which made it look like a fluid not the cells themselves suspended in a fluid called plasma.Anyways, the movie like all movies has some bad parts to it BUT I'd say like 95% of the movie has good parts to it. The movie also isn't all educational it is entertaining I'd say very different to watch. This is definitely a movie for someone who wants to kick back, relax, and watch something different. Something that isn't like your standard movie nowadays. I only wish we could have more movies like this... the only thing I didn't like is how it ended so briefly. Essentially they went in and then they went out. It didn't really explain much after that which leaves you as the viewer with a lot of unanswered questions.Overall I'd say 7\/10 for effects, 5\/10 for plot deepness, 9\/10 for originality, and 8\/10 for entertaining bringing my total score to 7.25\/10.

I love it. I just watched What Happened Was&#x85; so that I can dwell more into the icy depths of lonelinesm. Tom Noonan is a G for writing this. I believe it was first adapted into a play and then later turned into a feature film. I like it so much because it is so different and so simple, yet complex in a very disturbing sort of way. The relationship between the couple on their so called date is so awkward that even the audience is lost in a trance. I LIKE THAT FEELING. It is neither a good, nor bad feeling, but it is LIVING and a psychological game we as humans play with one another that always has the same rules\/outcome. Always; You hide. You hide who you are and what you do to PROTECT this person from figuring out who you really are. Which is a boring, unmotivated vessel. Their is a scene towards the end when, after Tom Noonan pours his heart out and says how pathetic he is, our main actress, Karen Sillas' character, mentionsIt's funny, you know? You finally GROW UP. You know, you finally figure out who the hell you are. And just when you got something interesting to give, they're not interested anymore.See now these are one of those lines that make me filled with utter jealousy when I hear them, and say to myself, why didn't I think of that?! It has been right in front of me the whole time but I've just been too stupid to figure it out! I believe strongly that what she is saying is true you know? It is saying (in my opinion), that you do not know what you got till it is gone. A little bit of that, mixed with the lonesomeness of not fitting-in in with the world. You wait so long for something to come. Something to make it all right. And when it finally does, then you realize that you actually are useless and won't receive anything from anyone until you go out and get it yourself. - One has to make their own self worth something, even if it takes pretending (which, I know, I shouldn't be the one talking since I cannot even pretend myself). - Misery; And doing things wrong is good. It's alright! You think you are digging yourself deeper in a hole, when actually you are building yourself higher than most individuals. It is not a piece of cake, let me tell you that, my friend. It is a disease and a curse. What is that QUOTE? Curiosity killed the cat. Well, I was a curious-George myself, and, even though I am learning to accept my depression, I had to go through a lot of unnecessary pain. And the worst part is that from this curiosity, I am going to have to deal with this hurt for the rest of my life. It is going to affect my children, and their children. It is going to mess with my siblings relations and my parents' reputation. Yes, and I have to deal with it.

At the dawn of the 90s, the slasher genre was dying as Hollywood was failing to come up with anything new and was repeatedly recycling the same formula of the genre. This was until Wes Craven resurrected the genre with this unique, self-aware, teen- horror slasher film that parodies its genre with new elements, new twists, and new scares that many horror fans were not expecting. This film stars Neve Campbell as Sidney Scott, a 17-year old high school girl traumatized by the murder of her mother, who begins being stalked by a masked killer who begins taking the lives of her fellow school mates. Sound familiar? Just wait! The teenagers learn to survive against the killer's onslaught by using advice from horror movies by learning how characters in the movies become victims.Featuring a cast of Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Drew Barrymore, this movie drifts away from the typical slasher-horror clichés and comes up with new elements. Instead of having the characters make unwise decisions by failing to run out the door to safety while being chased it a killer, this film creates characters who are aware of their mistakes that characters from other horror films make and realize why the killer is after them. Like many horror fans, they also manage to point out every cliché that happens in a slasher movie like characters who are virgins end up surviving or how characters die because they fail to run out the front door instead of random places in the house. Basically, this movie is about teenagers who get killed from making a whole new set of unwise decisions. Neve Campbell does the great job as the main character. Then there is Skeet Ulrich who plays Billy Loomis, her clingy boyfriend, and Jamie Kennedy who plays Randy Meeks who is a huge move buff and is well educated on what goes on in horror movies. Many scenes where he makes references to other horror movies and establishes a set of rules in order to survive against a masked killer. These rules include do not have sex, do not drink or do drugs, and do not I'll be right back before leaving somewhere. He is one of those characters who is really smart and has knowledge on how to survive a horror movie. Then there is the rest of the cast who demonstrate some great acting skills. Scream is one of the most original and clever horror movies. Like many slashers, it has the blood and gore that many gore fans come to appreciate. Overall, this movie succeeds at avoiding most (if not all) of the clichés that many horror films are known for. This is probably the best movie by Wes Craven in his career.

Unfortunately none of them actually won out right and realistically it was a draw even though Apollo wins by a judging decision and then Adrian cries out she loves Rocky and comes into the ring with him.

As this genre is increasingly popular, it is hard to compare and to see how this film works in regards to itself. Keeping in mind that this is a very early cop film I would have to say that it did a pretty good job.I don't think I have ever actually seen a young Clint Eastwood before, and it was rather unnerving to see so much likeness of how he looks now compared to then. He did a good job of playing the cool, tough cop who - though is a man of the law, doesn't really follow it. He judges his morality as higher than others and in the name of justice, does what he thinks is right in order to correct the wrong. Andrew Robinson who plays the killer gives an erratic performance which befitted his character. Very wild and out of control, his 'crazy' eyes are characteristic of his character, as are the animalistic screams he makes.The story is pretty average, with the focus on Harry and his obsession on getting the killer. The film kind of shows that the law isn't very good at protecting its citizens though, with Harry being depicted as the only one who really cares if the killer is caught (with the exception of his partner Chico). But the story was pretty engaging and had good action scenes.There was also some pretty great shots in this. We get some pretty good point of view shots from Harry and the killer's perspective. But noticeably, the most impactful shot is probably the one where Harry is standing on the bridge as the bus travels on the road below. For some reason it reminds me of the terminator, what with his sunglasses and all.However this film does have some issues with race, gender and social hierarchy. For one, all the high ranking officers\/ powerful figures are white and the robbers who appear briefly are black. The killer himself while is white, is feminized in the way he walks and screams while Harry is the epitome of masculinity with his calm demeanour and low voice. There are hardly any women in this film too, except to be victims or someone's wife, not to mention that the killer is made out to be homophobic as he targets a gay man in one of the scenes.

That said, this is such a rare exception. Dickens is softened, a small bit, the harsh ending of Oliver visiting Fagan in the jail before his hanging has been replaced with Fagan and Doger going off together into the sunset. Other than this, the story is quite true to the work. Oliver's voice is obviously dubbed with a feminine one but combined with his sad, little face increases our sympathy for him. The songs are surprisingly well written and no they are not idealized nausea inducing crap. Wild sings the best Consider Yourself but Fagan has some entertaining ones like I'm Reviewing The Situation, Gotta Pick A Pocket Or Two. There are sad songs by Oliver that are well done without being cheesy Where Is Love? The story faithfully tells his story from the dreadful Beadle crooning Boy For Sale, the vulture like undertaker's wife and finally his falling in with Fagan's pickpockets. The music occurs within the story and augments it not bringing the movie to a screeching halt for no reason. The treat of the movie is we get an excellent Fagan with Oliver Reed stealing the movie, among the adults, as the psycho Bill Sykes with the ever present dog Bull's Eye.Dicken's themes of the horrors of the industrial revolution in England are preserved with great shots of the lords of the workhouse stuffing their fat gullets with food while the children eat a few spoons of gross looking gruel. While the hanging of children is not shown, for pickpocketing, it is spoken of openly by Sykes and Fagin. Parents should be warned that child abuse, of a minor nature, is depicted and may upset small children. Dickens' novels were not renowned for their optimism, ergo, it is dark, depressing with moments of Oliver being in great peril. The only song I disliked was the anthem of dependency sung by Syke's tragic girlfriend, whom he later beats to death, Because He Needs Me. When she tries to return Oliver, he waylays her on the bridge. While all we see is his cane crashing down on her, on one of the upstrokes we see blood on the handle. Like I said, pre teens or teenagers but not little ones. The intelligence of the musical with its realistic depiction of human beings and their dialog will stun you for a musical. The movie is long, there are a few slow parts, not many. I would keep the remote control handy to skip the overture and the entrance music after the intermission.I love the movie for teaching a great work of one of England's greatest authors, after The Bard, to children. The lessons it contains are the consequences of a life of crime. How the perpetrators turn into monsters of greed like Fagin and Sykes is a worthy lesson for your children to learn. The movie, like the Wizard Of Oz, has its morality deep within the story it will not beat you about the head and shoulders with its lessons like certain other musicals. The other lesson is the power of friendship with Dodger sticking up and trying to protect Oliver. Jack Wild's voice and acting will stun you for one so small. Besides Consider Yourself, he also does well on I'd Do Anything. He steals the small cast by a mile; Oliver does well but Wild is the best Artful Dodger I have ever seen. Want to appreciate this movie? Put Flashdance on after watching this if you can make it all the way through. It deserved ever reward it received. An Excellent, Intelligent Musical.

The lessons it contains are the consequences of a life of crime. How the perpetrators turn into monsters of greed like Fagin and Sykes is a worthy lesson for your children to learn. The movie, like the Wizard Of Oz, has its morality deep within the story it will not beat you about the head and shoulders with its lessons like certain other musicals. The other lesson is the power of friendship with Dodger sticking up and trying to protect Oliver. Jack Wild's voice and acting will stun you for one so small. Besides Consider Yourself, he also does well on I'd Do Anything. He steals the small cast by a mile; Oliver does well but Wild is the best Artful Dodger I have ever seen. Want to appreciate this movie? Put Flashdance on after watching this if you can make it all the way through. It deserved ever reward it received. An Excellent, Intelligent Musical.

That said, this is such a rare exception. Dickens is softened, a small bit, the harsh ending of Oliver visiting Fagan in the jail before his hanging has been replaced with Fagan and Doger going off together into the sunset. Other than this, the story is quite true to the work. Oliver's voice is obviously dubbed with a feminine one but combined with his sad, little face increases our sympathy for him. The songs are surprisingly well written and no they are not idealized nausea inducing crap. Wild sings the best Consider Yourself but Fagan has some entertaining ones like I'm Reviewing The Situation, Gotta Pick A Pocket Or Two. There are sad songs by Oliver that are well done without being cheesy Where Is Love? The story faithfully tells his story from the dreadful Beadle crooning Boy For Sale, the vulture like undertaker's wife and finally his falling in with Fagan's pickpockets. The music occurs within the story and augments it not bringing the movie to a screeching halt for no reason. The treat of the movie is we get an excellent Fagan with Oliver Reed stealing the movie, among the adults, as the psycho Bill Sykes with the ever present dog Bull's Eye.Dicken's themes of the horrors of the industrial revolution in England are preserved with great shots of the lords of the workhouse stuffing their fat gullets with food while the children eat a few spoons of gross looking gruel. While the hanging of children is not shown, for pickpocketing, it is spoken of openly by Sykes and Fagin. Parents should be warned that child abuse, of a minor nature, is depicted and may upset small children. Dickens' novels were not renowned for their optimism, ergo, it is dark, depressing with moments of Oliver being in great peril. The only song I disliked was the anthem of dependency sung by Syke's tragic girlfriend, whom he later beats to death, Because He Needs Me. When she tries to return Oliver, he waylays her on the bridge. While all we see is his cane crashing down on her, on one of the upstrokes we see blood on the handle. Like I said, pre teens or teenagers but not little ones. The intelligence of the musical with its realistic depiction of human beings and their dialog will stun you for a musical.

Fox) and Dr. Emmett Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) this time journey to the future in 2015 to prevent Marty's son from being thrown in prison. However, Marty's nemesis, an elderly Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), got a hold of the time machine and used it to change his past in 1955, sending the course of events to spiral out of control, leaving Marty and Doc to journey back to 1955 to prevent what Biff created.The special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean, and the futuristic look, with the flying cars and skateboards, in 2015 was a great touch.The direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film captivating throughout, from Marty seeing his son in the future to him chasing Biff around to steal a sports almanac which Biff stole from the future to use to change his past. Seeing the transformation from the characters in present time to the future and back to the past was just entertaining. And, Doc's notion that no two of the same persons must run into each other in the same time dimension adds onto the suspense of the film - great fun! Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson and James Tolkan. They all made the film engaging and intriguing. As a time travel film, the race against time plot makes this movie an edge-of-your-seat experiences and is one of the best sequels I've seen!

Basically Walter Davis (Bruce Willis) is a workaholic, all work and no play or attention to his appearance or personal life, so he allows his brother Ted (Phil Hartman) to set him up on a blind date. Walter's date, who will accompany him to his company's business dinner with a new important Japanese client, is Ted's wife's cousin, Nadia Gates (Kim Basinger). Nadia is new in town and wants to socialise, she is shy and there is an awkwardness between her and Walter, as the evening goes on Nadia has a drink, and this causes her to behave in a wild manner, Ted warned Walter beforehand about her behaviour under the influence of alcohol, but he thought this was a joke. The situation gets worse when Nadia's ex-boyfriend David Bedford (John Larroquette) shows up and starts stalking the couple all night, trying assaults of all sorts, including ramming Walter's car. Walter ends up going insane with Nadia's mishaps and David's pursuit, he wreaks havoc at the dinner, and Nadia gets Walter fired, his car is destroyed, and he is put in a prison cell after threatening David with a mugger's weapon, including forcing him to moonwalk and firing at a frightened man's feet. Nadia pays the $10,000 bail for Walter's release, and she is forced to agree to marry David so he will help Walter avoid prison time during his court case. Walter realises he may in fact have real feelings for Nadia, so to spoil the wedding he injects a full box of chocolates with brandy, she eats all of them before the ceremony, and chaos ensues with her drunken behaviour. In the end Walter, previously seen going all over the house trying to talk to Nadia, stops the wedding and expresses his feelings, the paid kiss and embrace what looks like true love, and they get married.

It is unsurprising critics thought Willis would be another TV star attempting an failing somewhat in his first film, he doesn't quite fit, and Basinger, despite being beautiful, is rather irritating as the woman turned crazy by alcohol who causes disaster for others. This film has almost nothing that works, the attempts at slapstick create only titters of laughter, the mad behaviour gets the point where it cringing and unbearable rather than funny, and there is hardly any believability with the love story, it is most disappointing comedy.
