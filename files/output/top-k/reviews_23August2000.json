He is well known for some of his great movies like The Maltese Falcon (1941) and The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre (1948), two movies who earned themselves a position on AFI's top 100 list and what many consider to be his best picture ever, 1951's The African Queen which was ranked 17th on AFI's top 100 list.  His major collaborations with Humphrey Bogart also made him quite popular in the beginning of his career.  Unfortunately, he died in 1987.  However, he did not leave us without giving us an 80's classic à la John Huston.  Prizzi's Honor was his final stand and what a stand it was.  The Mob is probably the topic that has been the most used in Cinema.  Movies like Little Caesar (1930) and The Public Enemy (1931) are the young classics that gave us a taste of things to come for the more modern classics such as Goodfellas (1990) and the ultimate movie of all-time, The Godfather (1972) and its terrific sequel, The Godfather Part II (1974).  As with every other common movie topic, Hollywood has produced many disappointing movies about the Mob such as Scarface (1983).  However, it has produced the ultimate disgrace to the Mob movies with 1998's Mafia which tried to parody The Godfather, Scarface, and many others.  This is something that I can not tolerate, to make a parody of such great movies.  So looking at Prizzi's Honor, I thought this might be a movie that had a similar objective to Mafia with a few big stars in it.  I was mistaken.  Charley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) is a wiseguy.  At a wedding, he sees a beautiful tall blond woman (Kathleen Turner) with whom he immediately falls in love with.  He finally meets this woman.  Her name is Irene Walker.  He soon finds out that she had made a hit for the Prizzi family, the family of which he is part, the day of the wedding.  The two of them fall in love and make plans for marriage.  But Irene goes back to California for a few days.  During her trip, Charley also learns that a scam has been going on in one of the Casinos owned by the Prizzis and that the man who orchestrated this scam is a man named Marxie Heller.  So Charley is sent by the family to get the money back from Marxie.  Charley goes to Heller's house and knocks off Heller.  He waits for Heller's wife to return as she apparently had something to do with the scam.  But surprise surprise for Charley as Heller's wife turns out to be Irene Walker.  Charley spares her after she returns half of the stolen money and goes back to Brooklyn claiming he could only find that and he marries Irene.  But complications are bound to arise and they do.  Huston's smart directing does not allow the viewer to call out a mistake in the movie an Richard Condon's script is intelligent as it releases all its small twists and turns in the correct order at the right moments.  One of the key actors in the movie is Anjelica Huston's role as the rejected daughter of a second level boss for the Prizzi family.  Without her, the movie would probably not end the way it does.  Jealousy, greed, love... these are the principal themes of this black-comedy along with, of course, the theme of murder.  But as I said at the beginning, this is a typical Huston classic and is not to be missed.

I am also glad that at least 1\/2 of the reviews were good. Now to my review on this movie.First of all, I saw Tom Cruise for the first time on the big screen in this movie.  I thought that his performance as Ethan Hunt was positively mesmerizing!  In my opinion, his acting was very good and he showed a side of Ethan Hunt's personality that was not portrayed in the previous movie. Even when he doesn't talk, he is acting.  Just look at the expressions on his face when he doesn't speak.  I think that he was very convincing as Hunt and that he was sensitive and caring in his feelings for Nyah.  As for their chemistry, it was awesome, romantic and cute! Who says that you can't fall in Love after one night.  There are some people in this world who have done it!I think that Tom Cruise is a very extraordinary actor.  After viewing this movie a few weeks ago for the first time, I took it upon myself to rent his other movies.  I feel that he has done equally well in all of his movies. Some of them are truely Oscar worthy performances.Back to MI-2. Tom has matured since his role as Ethan in the last movie. He is very handsome, sweet, sensitive and caring and was generally concerned for the welfare of the people of Australia, as well as the world.  By the way, he was supposed to be a super-spy and therefore he acted accordingly. Some of his stunts were unbelievable, but they were supposed to be!! Wake up! I thoroughly enjoyed his performance.  Nyah was also interesting, pretty and a good actress.  I felt a little jealous of her!  Dougray Scott was OK as the villian and the actor that portrayed Luther was great. The other cast members were good performers.I never felt that this movie was a Tom Cruise Ego Trip as many of you have stated, but that he was thoroughly enjoying himself in this movie and that he worked hard in giving his all to this movie, both in acting and producing. He is a very serious man when it comes to his acting (I read his book and he is a very interesting person in many ways). I give him credit for doing many of his own stunts (they were spectacular)!  I also enjoyed the directing style of John Woo.  I did not know his previous work, with the exception of Face Off, which I found enjoyable. MI-2 just blew me away!!!MI-2 was spectacular, awe inspiring, great eye-candy, romantic, an edge on your seat action thriller, had great special effects and had wonderful cinematography.  I thought that the script wasn't half as bad as a lot of you have mentioned and I give Tom Cruise, John Woo and Robert Towne credit for collaborating and producing a great Summer movie!  I have seen 4 of the new Summer movies and MI-2, bar none, was the best movie this Summer.In conclusion, I just want to say to the people who bashed this movie, that apparently you are either jealous of Tom Cruise or you don't know how to sit back, enjoy and be thoroughly entertained by a good action-packed Summer movie. I also liked MI and I found it easy to understand the plot! I have regretted not seeing the first MI in the theater, I saw it on video. This movie is totally different from that movie, but that is OK as they are supposed to be two different kinds of movies.  I found this movie more exciting than the first. This movie was pure entertainment and I felt good after seeing it.  This movie was nothing short of exhilerating. Incidentally, I have seen it several times and it gets better every time!!!

The score was also fantastic!  I am not a heavy metal fan but I thoroughly enjoyed this score.Go and see this movie on the big screen.  You will not regret it!!!!!!I give this movie a 10 out of 10!

In the three movies I have seen with Hoffman in them, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Magnolia, and Flawless, Hoffman has consistently lost himself in the character. He is able to do this to the point of the viewer not being able to recognize the actor - the greatest compliment an actor can receive. De Niro is De Niro, delivering a spot-on performance of a man struggling with change due to a stroke. The rest of the cast delivers an entertaining array of characters, which just adds to my disappointment with the film. Because, as good as the acting was, the directing - and to some extent the writing - was a let-down. Much of the violence seemed misplaced in what was a touching, humorous story. A few times I found myself pulled away from the story and wondering why Schumacher felt he needed to add someone being shot in the head. The ending was simply ridiculous - meant more for a Sylvester Stallone I-can't-believe-this thriller than for the emotionally-gripping story that Flawless should have been. This is a good movie. However, had the direction been more true to the main story, it could have been a great movie. And had it not been for superb acting, this could easily have been a bad movie.

And yes, this is somewhat the point of the movie, or is it? What is it's point?

As a fan of the cartoon and comic books, I was really looking forward to seeing the motion picture. The parts were played well and I believe the correct actor for each part was chosen and that they played to the best of their outstanding ability. Fans of the cartoon will notice that favourite characters such as 'Beast', 'Gambit' and 'Jubilee' did not make profound appearances in the movie. At first I was shocked and annoyed that they had thoughtlessly left out these parts. However, now I can see some reasoning to it I appreciate the action taken. As this will undoubtedly be the first of at least one sequal, we can be sure to see our favourites in later editions of the series. An opener to a series, such as this film was, would obviously have to be a mere introduction to the plot, characters and general story. Therefore, I hope to see my personal favourite, 'Gambit', in the next film as, I'm sure, do many. If the sequal is only half as amazing as the first then I'm sure no one will be disappointed.

There are several lapses of logic, however, which shouldn't happen in a good thriller. The tension should be maintained by the fact that not only is it fast-paced, it should also have a logical integrity.For instance, the second that Dean knows that his conversation with Rachel Banks (ultra-gorgeous Lisa Bonet) has become public, the first thing he should be doing is walk to the nearest department store and get a change of clothes, shoes, socks, and cell phone.Secondly, him calling home after being on the run is totally illogicalfrom the character's point of view (of course, it keeps the chase going...).He may not be a tech-head, but as a super-slick lawyer, he should at least have a clue that they're on to him.And what's more. It's as if the bad guys are all cutouts from a funky version of Hackers - they seem way too young to be hardened covert operatives. It is as if the makers wanted to give the audience an alternative side to root for.And what's even more, Hackman's oratory on how the NSA is tapping all conversations that come up with the words Allah or bomb is, to me, totally unbelievable. There is no voice-recognition softwareout there that can reliably distinguish between bomb, boom or bam, in everyday conversation, over a phone line, not with all the regional accents out there (buuuhm, bahwm, bom).And, you get to find out what happened to the guy (well, almost) from The Conversation, after he tore up his room looking for bugs (he's living in a copper wire mesh loft, to keep out the radiowaves). ;-)All that aside, even though this film feels horribly familiar (Mission Impossible, Hackers, The Firm), it is entertaining, although it doesn't spend very much effort on developing an interesting plot, the effects are exhilerating. And, I do love high octane thrillers. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 August 2000","score":"","review":"  As movies go, this is a pretty good movie, and worth seeing at least once.

The cast is generally well-chosen, and, although I generally dislike too much updating, I appreciated the set design.  Quite a bit of the costuming and setting reminded me of the most recent Richard III.What the play did not need were further artistic flourishes.  The surrealistic scenes were nothing more than recycled Ken Russell hallucinations, this time with a rote techno-metal soundtrack.  The Roman orgy scenes were merely gratuitous, and the ending shot was completely incongruous and useless.The most frustrating thing for me is that Taymor's version is not bloody enough.  A scene that was supposed to involve two severed heads being revealed as a punctuation to Titus' final revenge is not even included. This film could have been so much better if Taymor had ended her artistic ambition with the set design and costumes, and had not continued to interfere every time things started getting good.
