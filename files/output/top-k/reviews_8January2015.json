We've seen the story of Exodus done multiple times now, but this animated version manages to bring something new to the field. Like any great film, every detail has been carefully considered, from the colour palettes which are adapted depending on the mood of the scene to the details on the Egyptian buildings which make this world feel genuine. What I really love about this adaptation is that it never skimps out on the spectacle of the story, with numerous crowd shots were thousands of characters are moving and enormous statues and buildings to really make it clear how overwhelming powerful the Egyptian empire is. It also manages to do several things that wouldn't have worked in a live action film. My go-to example is the dream sequence that is animated to look like moving Egyptian art. You've never seen anything like it and I think it really brings something special to the story. You would think that this movie is a Disney knockoff when you hear that there are several songs throughout, but this is a story that will appeal both to children and adults. There aren't any silly talking animals or magical talking statues that give advice to Moses or Rameses. The songs are used to develop the characters and further the story, in a way that is similar to a montage, but significantly more entertaining in my book because it gives you something to listen to besides catch phrases uttered between brief action shots. The voice acting is also very good and there are some subtle but interesting choices that will speak differently to you depending on your views of this biblical story (such as the casting of Val Kilmer as both Moses and God). There is humour present, but the focus is on the drama, the feelings of being torn between two different lives or two opposite and important choices. I feel like because of the spectacle of it, the well made animation, the acting, the soundtrack and the tried-and-true story of a Prince who must choose between his adopted family and his biological one, one to come to blows with his brother, that you can enjoy The Prince of Egypt even if the passage isn't a part of your faith.

Every single word spoken in this film has been crafted with such care. Tarantino does this with all his films, dialog drives them. There are so many elements that bring this film together and make it a prime example of good filmmaking. 1. Chemistry between characters This works so well between all characters who share the screen, but most importantly, Jules and Vincent. They are the glue which holds the whole film together. Back to the wider picture, whether they are out to get each other or they are trying to protect each other, it is entertainment at its finest.2. The WritingThis is undoubtedly my favorite movie script ever. Period. End of story. It is so perfectly executed. A day doesn't go by without me quoting one of the many famous lines from this film. So of the films darker moments, take the Gimp for example, is watchable, even enjoyable because of good writing. Something simple, like the briefcase, which would be a rather dull scenario in other films, is one of the most famous items in movie history, and lives on in internet forums 20 years after the films theatrical release.3. The CharactersThe characters are all so perfectly unique that it makes for an incredible ensemble cast of stars from different time periods and genres of films.

He is so funny, smart, quick and he makes for a hell of a time while your watching him. Half the famous quotes come from him. Not to mention this film catapulted Samuel L Jackson into a superstar, and gave John Travolta a second life as a megastar.4. The StoryI won't go to much into depth regarding the story, but Tarantino takes so little, and launches this into a thought provoking, crime, black comedy.

Do the Joads give up all hope or continue to pursue their dreams during the one of the most flavorless times in American history? Let's take a look.

The acting was great, but it was really Tom and Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) that captivated me by their amazing acting with their facial expressions and Southern accents.

I noticed a lot of the uniforms seem inspired by WW2 German military and the SS uniform to say the least. Whilst the flag of the Federation has a symbol that looks like the Imperial Eagle from WWII Germany.Overall this is a great guys movie, defo not not one to watch on a date though.

The film is the first big-budget production of his career & yet the manner in which the then-young Kubrick handles its huge cast & epic scope is a testament to his skills as a filmmaker. Written by Dalton Trumbo, the screenplay isn't very accurate to its historical facts but it does make the story more relatable with current events.The technical aspects are always gold-standard in Kubrick films & Spartacus is no exception. The set pieces are amazing to look at, locations are elegantly chosen, Cinematography makes fab use of its camera, the panoramic shots are spectacular, colour composition is vibrant & the level of detail is quite extensive. Despite running over 3 hours, it kept me deeply invested in its story & Alex North's majestic score provides an epic feel to its narrative.Coming to the performances, Spartacus features a star-studded cast in Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, Tony Curtis & others. Douglas gives his all in the role of Spartacus & delivers a fantastic performance, Olivier plays Crassus with fine elegance, Laughton as Gracchus ends up stealing every scene he's in, Gavin doesn't do much as Julius Caesar, Curtis is brilliant as Antoninas & Jean Simmons does a good job as Varinia in a film dominated by men.On an overall scale, to know that the screen being filled with thousands of people doesn't have one pixel of CGI in it, to know that each one of those extras was a real person indeed & to know that Kubrick managed to churn out an epic that more than lives up to its word are amongst a few things that makes me admire Spartacus all the more. Grandeur in scale, highly entertaining, very engaging, and covering love, betrayal, corruption, slavery, mutiny, civilization & leadership with finesse, Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus comes strongly recommended.

Maybe because it's not about the characters we're used to. The characters we see are lifeless except for maybe Dr. McCoy. The original series characters weren't bland they were just calm and didn't argue a whole lot. These people have their characters stripped away and we are forced to endure a ship flying into a giant space cloud.The film's tagline claims to be about the human adventure but that is a lie. Humans have flaws and come with remarks that make them them. But perhaps we're missing the picture. The Motion Picture. Which is the starship Enterprise. It's about staring at it for two hours. Seeing how far we could go. What's lingering behind that space cloud? Could it be life? If we're going to focus a whole movie on staring at a starship going to explore what might be alien life why not have the Enterprise itself become a source of harvesting alien life that's growing inside it? (a concept they did in the Next Generation) If we have to do a story about staring a starship for two hours why not turn a twist? Have the Enterprise literally be The Motion Picture that we are watching. Or maybe explain why it's going so slow. Maybe an alien is screwing it up and Scotty has to fix the engines while ship slowly drifts toward an asteroid?The music score redeems the film somewhat and is the only reason to watch it. All and all, this is not the deep grand story of us in space that was the purpose.UPDATED After giving this film a second chance to grow on me I can say I liked this in a different light now. After taking a look at 2001 and Interstellar I think I get this kind of thing now. The film is something beautiful to look at if it's on TV and there are things. The film is at least profoundly boring. There is something about it to be talked about and made fun of. I stand by that this is not the human journey that it should have been. But even so, it is closer to the mark of getting its morals across than perhaps The Original Series was. This did have balls for trying to be different.

Because that's all it is &#x96; fun. A lot of people liken it to the Indiana Jones movies and I can see where they're coming from. Then again, an equally high proportion of the audience detests how the two movies are likened to each other. No, I'm certainly not saying that The Mummy is anywhere near as good as the Jones trilogy (notice how I'm leaving out the Crystal Skull out of that statement!), but it is similar.The Mummy is one of those 'family fun' kind of movies &#x96; an adventure which should most likely be screened on a Saturday afternoon for everyone to cheer along to. Brendan Fraser takes the lead and is at his best when he's acting big and dumb, but, in doing so, he's also completely lovable and easy to root for. Rachel Weisz is his 'love interest' and, apart from being able to read\/speak the ancient texts, doesn't do that much for the portrayal of women in cinema, as she spends much of her time in need of rescue (you'll have to watch the sequel if you want to see her kicking some a$$!). John Hannah is her on-screen brother and he's the main 'comic relief' of the film &#x96; a part which sometimes goes horribly wrong if it's handled incorrectly. However, fortunately, despite being the coward of the bunch, he's funny enough not to be annoying (and even fires a gun or two near the end if you watch closely).So, our blundering trio of heroes only go and wake up an ancient mummy when they're raiding a tomb in Egypt. And he's not happy. Not only does he want to 'borrow' the bodily parts of those who woke him up, but he also wants to take over the world &#x96; typical, huh? The creature itself is actually CGI for the most part. I guess they couldn't get an actor who was decomposing to play the part. However, when he's fully formed, he's played by Arnold Vosloo, who does the job to act menacing (even when he doesn't say a word of English).So, expect gun fights, undead creatures chasing our heroes, the odd car chase and pretty much everything else you'd come to find in a PG action\/adventure movie. Yes, nothing here is that new, but when something's handled correctly that doesn't matter. It's still a fun a film that should please everyone. Basically, there are two ways of watching The Mummy &#x96; you can either nitpick the whole thing and pull it apart, or you can simply gloss over any of the plot holes and simply enjoy it from what it is &#x96; the filmic equivalent of Brendan Fraser himself &#x96; big, dumb, silly fun, fun, fun.
