The reason they are targeted is obvious to any movie goer, but in real life would not be at all evident, so you sit back and watch people put clues together. The younger brother is the central and most likable character in the movie (by the process of elimination). It is very reminiscent of a Japanese kung fu movie in the story of the brothers. A lot of characters are very badly written in order to make points, but that's acceptable in film making if the point is important enough. Sutherland and De Niro play two of the badly written characters, and portray the stereotypes they play too often Sutherland as a psycho, and DeNiro as a superman is on top of everything and probably never had to sneeze in his life. Both of these actors are much better than this, and it is disheartening to see them take on the same role every movie, especially when they have proved themselves to be excellent actors in their early movies (Sutherland in THE DIRTY DOZEN, De Niro in BRAZIL, THE MISSION, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN America). Here, they have the same one dimension they have in all their movies of that ten year or so span. If you can get past the fact that the writers are incapable of creating identifiable characters, this is a very exciting and fun film.

He doesn't get the kind of credit he deserves. He did some hard research for On the Waterfront in order to dig up lines like, You take away dem pistoleros you got in there and you're nothing'. You hear me? You're NUTHIN'. Compared to On the Waterfront, though, this politically tinged drama is overwritten and its dialog lacks the same ineluctable force. It's still pretty good, no mistake about that, but it seems to depict a time when we were an awful lot more naive about TV and politics than we are now.Or does it? The first major political advertisement back in the early 50s was so monumentally harmless. A cute, smiling, little cartoon figure, on the order of Elmer Fudd, marches across the screen holding a sign which a lilting chorus reads out for the audience, in case they can't read. I like Ike. I like Ike. Everybody likes Ike. Those were the good old days.This story involves Andy Griffith who begins as an absolutely guileless ex-jailbird whose only talent is his appeal to the common man by playing it as the dumb flaneur he actually is. Recruited for a TV commercial by a reporter, Patricia Neal, he makes fun of the product and the audience loves it. By leaps and bounds he climbs the ladder to TV stardom as a seller of products like Vitajex and the bald Senator Curly Fuller. And then Schulberg the writer has him go apparently maniacal overnight. Shouting, bullying, pompous, and ultimately destroyed by Pat Neal, the woman he's used and abused from the beginning.One of the reasons the film is so important is that it tagged the period when politics was switching from innocent cartoons to the kind of suppurating, mindless smears we're witnessing today. A character points out that nobody wants to listen to long-winded debates anymore. They want slogans (now called sound bites) like The Family That Prays Together Stays Together, More Bang for the Buck, The Mess in Washington, Mission Accomplished. Oops. Maybe a misquote in there, but it illustrates the point. The talking points and sound bites are still hard at work and we're still swallowing without chewing, not that much more sophisticated than we were in 1957.If the film seems a little dated today it's only because the future it shows us has now arrived. And worse, because now we have the internet where a whisper can become a roar overnight. The issues are amazingly resilient. Griffith promotes a presidential candidate and they sit around the Old Cracker Barrel on his TV show dissing Social Security because everybody wants coddling. Did Daniel Boone have Social Security? No. All he needed was a gun and his freedom. Andy Griffith is a nice guy. He was my supporting player in an episode of Matlock. Good sense of humor, as unpretentious as his screen persona, but no dummy, a show-biz pro. He didn't make that many films but this one is quite good and No Time for Sergeants was a generally successful comedy. He's way over the top in some scenes but is able to modulate his performance to accommodate moments in which his character is more thoughtful.This was his film debut, also Anthony Franciosa (edgy as always, a bottle of ambitious champagne about to pop its cork), and Lee Remick who was 22 when this was shot but looks a convincing 17 years old. Man, can she swing a baton. Patricia Neal turns in her usual quietly effective performance. She was never a glamor puss and she's perfect for the part of the loyal friend and sometime-lover of the hero, Lonesome Rhodes. It's believable that he should throw her over for Lee Remick's airhead because Rhodes himself sees nothing in anyone except the extent of their value to him, kind of like the way humans look at the Earth. What a splendid place the Grand Canyon is. Let's build a row of motels and Burger Queens along the rims! It isn't that Neal's steadfastness and genuine love for him doesn't mean anything to Rhodes. It's just that he doesn't see it. Walter Matthau is a college graduate whom Rhodes sneers at as an elitist, calling him Vanderbilt '44 and Frontal Lobe.Okay, the movie's overwrought at times but it really ought to be seen for its aesthetic as well as its didactic value. I ought to add that it stands up well on re-viewings, despite the occasional overstatement and clumsiness. The performances are nearly flawless and the direction is more than competent. Keep an eye on Griffith's sidekick, Beanie, to see what I mean.
