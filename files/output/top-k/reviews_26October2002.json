But hopefully they come back to that old time forest rampage action with the next film, which seems enivitable with the final sequence involving the mask floating in the water.With that being said, New fans to the series may like this one, and perhaps old school fans will too depending on whether you've lost faith in the series altogether or not.

Many others on here have given the blow-by-blow on this picture, so I won't add that.  I will, however, point out some plot details that seem to have been over-looked by many people.**SPOILER ALERT**-Pacino's insomnia is not being caused by the never ending daylight. Hilary Swank's character says, good cops can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing, and bad cops can't sleep because of the guilt.  In Pacino's case, you don't know which one it really is.  He is a good cop in that he always has the right intentions, even when he does wrong things.  But he's also a bad cop by some of his questionable police work (planting evidence, lying about shooting his partner).  The light is a metaphor for all of this, he feels as if he's under a spotlight, so to speak, because even he doesn't know if he's good or bad anymore.  This really comes focus when the Innkeeper comes into his room as he's try to block out the light.  She says, it is dark in here, and then turns on the lights in a blinding effect. The room had been suitably dark all along, it was his conscience keeping him awake.  This certainly wasn't a plot hole and, infact, was one of the strong points of the movie.-The ending of the movie was excellent in my opinion.  Not only did it focus on the ambiguities of the two main characters, but it also showed how William's character was just a slightly darker shade of grey in comparison to Pacino's.  Deep down William's character was an evil man, despite doing some good things.  Pacino, on the other hand, turned out to be good when his life was on the line, despite some of his past misgivings.  He steered Swank's character in the right direction, even though she was more than willing to protect his legacy.-In the end, the flawed people died.  Having not seen the original, I can't compare the two, but I thought it was fitting.  Pacino essentially 'saved' Swank by directing her to do the right thing in the end, clearing his conscience as he was dying.  He knew that if she were to lose the bullet casing, she would end up to be just as doomed as he found himself to be.In all, great acting, a superior script (contrary to unpopular belief), and perfect symbolism make this a very good movie.  If you're a person who needs everything spelled out for them, then don't even bother.

If I've seen a film worse than this, it certainly doesn't spring to mind right now. I managed to get to the first screening in the local area and, even though the audience was fairly small, I still counted eleven people who walked out at various points in the movie and never came back. Now either Michael Myers slashed them up on their way to the lavatories or, like me, they were bored stiff by this absolute CLUNKER of a flick.The plot, or what little semblance there is of one, is simple yet completely ludicrous. An organisation called Dangertainment, headed by the entrepreneurial Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes), gets together a group of six students (!) to spend the night in serial killer Michael Myers' childhood home, in the hope that they will find clues as to what drove Myers to kill and kill again. Quite why, 25 years on from the murders, they think they will achieve anything by sending a group of teenagers into a house that, in the real world, would probably have long been demolished, is beyond me. Surely it is the job of police psychologists to dissect the minds of serial killers anyway? The film conveniently forgets the previous five sequels (with the exception of H20; this gets an irrelevant reference in the gratuitous opening scenes which serve merely as an excuse to waste Jamie Lee Curtis' talents in some customary 'running around' antics) and throws us almost immediately into the environment of the house, where each of the six kids are given a little handy-cam to strap to their heads and told to go searching for clues... You with me so far? Well, that's pretty much all there is to it. Needless to say, Myers himself shows up at the house about 10 minutes into the movie (how? why?) and decides he wants to kill everybody one by one, in the style we've now become accustomed to.This paper-thin tale is told so badly, it's almost hard to believe what you're seeing on screen and that anyone was dumb enough to spend time and money filming it. I suppose you could almost see it like a series of noisy soundbites strung together randomly. It keeps things simplistic to the point of being nonsensical, presumably to avoid confusing its target audience of dribbling inbreds. I think I could've written a better, more entertaining and reasonable script myself on the back of a beermat. Nothing is ever explained or justified, no matter how implausible and ridiculous things get, and yet, bogglingly, the film still seems to take itself fairly seriously. It tries desperately to shock with a series of boring but bloody knife murders (nothing we haven't seen ad nauseam in any of the previous films) and innumerable 'false' scares with flashlights and toys falling out of cupboards. It's all so by-the-books and done-to-death that you'd have to have never seen a single horror film in your life to find it even remotely tense or scary.I think what bugs me the most about the film is just how terribly made it is. Even forgetting the GAPING plot holes, there are loads of obvious continuity errors and a sad, desperate style of direction that seems to drag every scene to the point of agony in a desperate attempt to pad out the already-short running time of the film. The cast do nothing to help things - all the characters are cardboard stereotypes and the ugly, plastic teens seem to be having a battle to see who can be the most skin-crawlingly irritating. I think it ends up as a tie between Katee Sachoff's hyperactive, squeaky airhead and Bianca Kajlich's jitterbug 'heroine', who spends the entire movie simpering and screaming loudly every time someone drops a pin. Oh, for the record, Busta Rhymes is absolutely ATROCIOUS in this. His entire purpose in this movie seems to be to deliver the worst examples of wisecrack-by-numbers dialogue I've ever heard (ie Trick or treat, motherf**ker?) and he plays his role as a cross between Eddie Murphy and Vin Diesel, but without the charm or charisma of either.I'd like to say John Carpenter would be ASHAMED to see such a horrible mess made out of his characters, but when you consider the maestro himself is making films almost as bad as this these days, he probably couldn't give a toss so long as the money keeps rolling in. I think this fact in itself proves just how much horror movies have changed since the first Halloween was made and, to its credit, Halloween Resurrection would be a perfect example of an of its time product you could stick in an 'early 21st century' time capsule for future generations to balk at. It is every bit as throwaway and pointless as the culture that spawned it. It is loud, crass and in-your-face constantly, despite having absolutely nothing to say when it gets there - it's like the movie equivalent of an annoying little brat screaming at you, desperate for attention. Look at me! Look at me! I'm being noisy and irritating!... I would highly advise, for your sanity's sake, that you don't look since, like that annoying child, you'll only encourage it and I, for one, don't think I could cope with another sequel this bad... This film is utter garbage and I fail to think of a single way in which they could've made it any worse. A resounding 0 out of 10.

If I've seen a film worse than this, it certainly doesn't spring to mind right now. I managed to get to the first screening in the local area and, even though the audience was fairly small, I still counted eleven people who walked out at various points in the movie and never came back. Now either Michael Myers slashed them up on their way to the lavatories or, like me, they were bored stiff by this absolute CLUNKER of a flick.The plot, or what little semblance there is of one, is simple yet completely ludicrous. An organisation called Dangertainment, headed by the entrepreneurial Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes), gets together a group of six students (!) to spend the night in serial killer Michael Myers' childhood home, in the hope that they will find clues as to what drove Myers to kill and kill again. Quite why, 25 years on from the murders, they think they will achieve anything by sending a group of teenagers into a house that, in the real world, would probably have long been demolished, is beyond me. Surely it is the job of police psychologists to dissect the minds of serial killers anyway? The film conveniently forgets the previous five sequels (with the exception of H20; this gets an irrelevant reference in the gratuitous opening scenes which serve merely as an excuse to waste Jamie Lee Curtis' talents in some customary 'running around' antics) and throws us almost immediately into the environment of the house, where each of the six kids are given a little handy-cam to strap to their heads and told to go searching for clues... You with me so far? Well, that's pretty much all there is to it. Needless to say, Myers himself shows up at the house about 10 minutes into the movie (how? why?) and decides he wants to kill everybody one by one, in the style we've now become accustomed to.This paper-thin tale is told so badly, it's almost hard to believe what you're seeing on screen and that anyone was dumb enough to spend time and money filming it. I suppose you could almost see it like a series of noisy soundbites strung together randomly. It keeps things simplistic to the point of being nonsensical, presumably to avoid confusing its target audience of dribbling inbreds. I think I could've written a better, more entertaining and reasonable script myself on the back of a beermat. Nothing is ever explained or justified, no matter how implausible and ridiculous things get, and yet, bogglingly, the film still seems to take itself fairly seriously. It tries desperately to shock with a series of boring but bloody knife murders (nothing we haven't seen ad nauseam in any of the previous films) and innumerable 'false' scares with flashlights and toys falling out of cupboards. It's all so by-the-books and done-to-death that you'd have to have never seen a single horror film in your life to find it even remotely tense or scary.I think what bugs me the most about the film is just how terribly made it is. Even forgetting the GAPING plot holes, there are loads of obvious continuity errors and a sad, desperate style of direction that seems to drag every scene to the point of agony in a desperate attempt to pad out the already-short running time of the film. The cast do nothing to help things - all the characters are cardboard stereotypes and the ugly, plastic teens seem to be having a battle to see who can be the most skin-crawlingly irritating. I think it ends up as a tie between Katee Sachoff's hyperactive, squeaky airhead and Bianca Kajlich's jitterbug 'heroine', who spends the entire movie simpering and screaming loudly every time someone drops a pin. Oh, for the record, Busta Rhymes is absolutely ATROCIOUS in this. His entire purpose in this movie seems to be to deliver the worst examples of wisecrack-by-numbers dialogue I've ever heard (ie Trick or treat, motherf**ker?) and he plays his role as a cross between Eddie Murphy and Vin Diesel, but without the charm or charisma of either.I'd like to say John Carpenter would be ASHAMED to see such a horrible mess made out of his characters, but when you consider the maestro himself is making films almost as bad as this these days, he probably couldn't give a toss so long as the money keeps rolling in.

An agent has the bad luck of walking in on hundreds of ravers dancing to the fire blowing sounds of the German band Rammstein. Bad luck since his dressed in a tux, he goes on, trying to stay alive but no such luck. The scene works but it's a bad joke at Bond.Meeting our hero, he does a lovely job of wasting to bits a nice Red car. It's this that gets him in big trouble, taken against his will, he meets agent Gibbons. Pushing Xander through a whole lot of bone aching tests, which he makes through in one piece. We're given a chance to see why the NSA would even think of having him as an agent, put simply, the boy is good and not gun shy! Some truly mind-blowing stunts later and Xander is on his way to lovely Prague and the movie is none-stop mindless fun from then on.Vin is good through out, clearly enjoying himself and the one-liners that pop out of his mouth. But when he tries to give Xander more emotion, he fails somewhat. Most of all when his in the same scene as Asia Argrnto, while her emotional arch is great to watch, since we're to believe her character feels nothing, her tears were something I believed. Vin on the other hand, lost some of the emotional effect he seemed to want to give to Xander, other then that, it was great to watch him. I can't say enough how great Asia is in the film as Yelena, I don't think her character was this good in the script, it's thanks to Asia's talent that something other than tough bitch, good looking chick comes through.Her scenes with Vin are great, the best really, very funny, it's hard not to like her. The moment I loved best between them is when they kiss the first time.She's trying to be all tough, trying to hide the fact that she's both angry and upset at being used. Xander being gentle with her as he lends her into the kiss is not helping matters. Samuel L Jackson is as cool as ever, he and Vin play off each other great. Most of all during the caged lion speech, there's something in Vin's eyes that makes it clear he won't go anywhere near a prison, thanks to Sam, the scene is a lot more than it could have turned out. Michael Roof as agent Toby Lee Shivers is out-loud funny, both a nerd and wanna be action agent, his too funny not to like. And last but not least our bad guy, Marton Csokas, his a better villain than what we've seen, madly over the top but handsome enough to pull it off.Now, onto the other little things. Editing is clean cut, fast and easy on the eye at the same time. Most of all for the car and bike jumps, the editing is at it's best. Photography is wonderful; Prague has never looked more beautiful, look out for the bedroom scene, where both the photography and lighting are great.Production Designee really went all out for the two club scenes, it's all great to look at and suits the music. Costumes are relaxed yet sexy; making the actors fit in with the background, also suiting the characters. The music is really cool throughout the film, I have no idea why the soundtrack turned into two CD's, since it's all mostly rock, couldn't for the life of me hear any rap. Other locations look great, again thanks to editing and photography. Stunts are pretty out there, thanks to special effects and clever stunt double work, Vin looks good. Though the avalanche scene is damn great to watch and the effects are great, it is over the top but still exciting.So, for the next James Bond, Xander Cage works, though the film could have been funnier and less over the top. Plot holes and weak dialogue didn't help, the next film is still one to watch out for.Also, I think that for the next film, Rob Cohen should not direct, someone else could take over.

To be honest, after reading the verbal slammings it got from other IMDb users, I wasn't expecting too much. But in the opening 15 minutes I was pleasantly suprised. The dark corridors in the Sanitarium gave an eerie and suspenseful feel, the same suspense which made the original Halloween movie such a success. When watching a Halloween movie, you must NOT perceive it as being realistic. You have to realise that Michael Myers isn't really human, and no matter what you do, you cannot get rid of the guy. Move onto the new segment with the students. To tell you the truth, although I don't think the whole 'webcam internet show' idea worked as it was intended, I applaud the originality of it. How many other horror movies have done this? None. It is inevitable that people will say the Blair Witch Project did this, but the only similarity is that both movies used cameras. With Halloween Resurrection it was live instead of recorded. I congratulate the writers with the originality of this concept. Unfortunately I found the whole 'internet geek rescues online-girlfriend' plot stupid. The scenes inside the Myer's house were good, with lots of nice dark shots, but frequent cut-shots back to a teenager in a tuxedo in a living room surrounded by student cretins distracted from the narrative of the movie. In fact, the movie would have done better had Sara NOT had the assistance of her geeky sidekick. Never mind. Busta Rhymes was awful, the guy can't act at all. Also I believe he set a record for using the 'MF' word most times in an hour period. Busta, stick to scratching and rapping, at least that sort of thing doesn't require much talent. At least the end of the movie ended on a high note, which of course I won't tell you what it is...but it definetly was a VERY good ending. I have seen ALL of the Halloween movies (including the bloody awful Halloween 3), and I believe that this is the 4th best. I'd say Halloween 1, 5 and 6 out-perform Halloween 8. Percentage score?

Well, that's what I expected anyway.Nah!This movie is actually a very funny and British, it's like an intellectual version of Snatch, which, obviously, is awesome. Starting from the Walking on the Beaches, looking at the peaches refrain of the cheeky (heehee, I made a bad pun) Peaches song in the opening credits and ending with what is probably the greatest last line in movie history, this movie never slows down.

The monster that is the zombie has been a little experimented with before with the film White Zombie but never like the dark depths that George took it too. To think that this film almost never would have made it to the public since George threw it in the trunk of his car thinking nobody would ever buy it, low and behold not only did the film sell but has one of greatest group of fans to follow it. Such a degrading film for it's time with naked, scarred up, chewed up zombies eating human flesh, there was no film like Night of the Living Dead. The metaphor that we are guaranteed 2 things in life birth and death, the slow inevitable death that is walking towards you as if you are looking at your future self is just horrific. George was way ahead of his time and that's why Night of the Living Dead still gives me nightmares to this day.Barbra and Johnny drive to rural Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave. When Barbra is afraid Johnny teasingly frightens; whereupon they are attacked by a zombie. Johnny tries to rescue his sister, but is then presumably killed when the man shoves him head first onto a tombstone. Barbra flees, with the killer in pursuit; eventually she ran off to an empty farmhouse where she discovers the half-eaten corpse. Running out of the house, she notices a man named Ben arrives in a pickup truck, drags Barbra back into the house, and barricades the doors and windows. Meanwhile, hiding in the cellar are a married couple, Harry and Helen Cooper, their daughter Karen, and teenage couple Tom and Judy. Harry asks everyone to hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a deathtrap and remains upstairs. As they fight through the night for their lives, they try to escape to a safe house but the zombies outside have pulled up the table with the salt and pepper and are a bit hungry for some human flesh.George casted a black lead, which was so unheard of at the time, I'm sure he never looked at the color but what a groundbreaking moment. He's the smart man who knows how to fight and even hit a white woman, what risks George took with this movie. The film is by no means perfectly made, but you have to understand that this was a low budget film made by a group of friends, however, when you think compared to today's low budget films that have no story with it, it's all about the gore, Night of the Living Dead broke that mold. I have a little tradition every year on Halloween, I have to watch this movie because it is one of the best horror movies of all time. How could you not still get the chills when little Karen turns into a zombie and goes after her mother with a shovel, her mother screaming Baby! and falls crying and screaming as her daughter just continues stabbing her to death, God, what a horrific scene! Taking a chance with a depressing ending, not to spoil too much as I feel that I already have but I envy anyone who sees this film for the first time because I like to see their reactions to this movie. A groundbreaking film, a horrifying story and a cast and crew that gave all effort, Night of the Living Dead is a terrific scary movie not to be missed.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 October 2002","score":"34 out of 37 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't think George Romaro ever had in his mind the masterpiece he created when he made Night of the Living Dead, one of the greatest horror movies of all time and gave birth to the zombie genre.

I've missed my chance to gloat over this great new talent discovery- and I'm not the only one because since then Pitch-Black has become a little sci-fi\/monster movie cult classic.  Forget about that other stuff, this movie is Diesel actually acting, before he became boxed into the usual Hollywood sex symbol roles that pretty much ruined the carreers of other promising talents like Josh Hartnett and Charlize Theron.The premise of this thing is so wonderfully multi-facetted and original it deserves to be the first space\/alien movie to not be constantly compared to Alien.  Try to describe it in one sentence.  Space transport ship populated with a various colorful characters (including an almost mythically evil prisoner in chains) crash lands on a deserted planet where everyone ends up running for their lives from a race of hungry alien monsters that invade the sky at night effectively wipping life clean off the planet.  I agree with another poster that this is a real thinking man's monster movie.  The monster's aren't particularly scary, but serve their purpose as the danger that binds this crew together and forces them to creatively solve one problem after another.  And the story keeps tightening the screws on them...Twohy seems to have a desire (as he did with The Arrival) to take a typical sci-fi\/horror genera flick and spin it into something we haven't seen before.  Pitch-Black opens with a standard space shot and a mess of a crash landing sequence that puts us in a cliché and comfortable place and sets our expectations low.  Then as the plot unfolds and the characters (and their many secrets) come out the movie slowly but surely chips away at our expectations.  As a result Pitch-Black might be one of the few popcorn throw-away movies that is so well made it might require multiple viewings to see it in it's true intentions.  I still can't quite decide if the ending is an anti-climactic let-down or a wisely restrained rejection of the usual slam-bang action ending.There are two great highlights to the film.  Vin Diesel, and watching Riddick go from a methodical and dangerous serial killer (this is, after all, the movie that made the phrase skull f***ing cool) to being the crew's only hope for survival against the creatures- and his acceptance of the responsibility.  It drives the story.  His change and many of the other changes that are revealed in all the characters always made me think that Pitch-Black was most of all about one thing perception.  The question is do the events in the movie change Riddick or just bring out a hero side that was already deep in there and nobody else has seen?  The second highlight is the visuals, both the lighting and effects and POV shots (which are stunning) and the aliens themselves.  Not the usual reptilian or insect aliens, Thowy and his crew made some effort and gave us something strange and new to contend with.  As Vin modestly says on the DVD commentary- I just really like this movie.  It's not Citizen Kane but it's not supposed to be. It does it's job and does it better than most other movies of it's kind.

Vin Diesel, and watching Riddick go from a methodical and dangerous serial killer (this is, after all, the movie that made the phrase skull f***ing cool) to being the crew's only hope for survival against the creatures- and his acceptance of the responsibility.  It drives the story.  His change and many of the other changes that are revealed in all the characters always made me think that Pitch-Black was most of all about one thing perception.  The question is do the events in the movie change Riddick or just bring out a hero side that was already deep in there and nobody else has seen?  The second highlight is the visuals, both the lighting and effects and POV shots (which are stunning) and the aliens themselves.  Not the usual reptilian or insect aliens, Thowy and his crew made some effort and gave us something strange and new to contend with.  As Vin modestly says on the DVD commentary- I just really like this movie.  It's not Citizen Kane but it's not supposed to be. It does it's job and does it better than most other movies of it's kind.

I had heard so many people say it sucks, and so many others say it was a riot. After reviews like that and having seen every episode of Scooby up until the point that Scrappy made his presence known, I had to see it for myself. While there are plenty of slow spots, there are some outright funny parts. The flatulence contest, while very crude, definitely appealed to my less mature side.  I was just about rolling on the floor howling.  And what can you say when smoke is rolling out of The Mystery Machine and Matt Lillard as Shaggy (as one reviewer perfectly put it, it is as if he was genetically created to play this part) while grilling some bread shouts Talk about toasted!  One would have to be very dimwitted to have missed this reference and not laughed (excepting the prude of the bunch).  I really think Sarah Michelle should have been given large, flowing, red hair like the cartoon Daphne, and FP Jr. just doesn't have the build to quite pull off Freddie completely.  Linda Cardellini as Velma, however, if perfectly cast and plays the part perfectly (not to mention she's far prettier than SMG).  This movie combines plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor amongst a plethora of sight gags that makes it work overall, despite the shortcomings in casting.  The CG Scooby I think works quite well as making the Great Dane look real might have made it just a little too difficult to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy the movie at all.  James Gunn, screenwriter and co-writer of the original story and a good SF writer, does an adequate job at this, though I think parts of his humor fall just a bit flat.  All-in-All, on the pywrit scale of 1-10, this one gets a 7.  Not perfect, but ultimately watchable and enjoyable with plenty of good, gut-busting laughs. And an oh yeah.  It's great to see that little Scrappy get his comeuppance.
