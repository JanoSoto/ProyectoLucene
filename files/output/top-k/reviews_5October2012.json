I hate when people say that because that's not being fair. Books and film are two completely different forms of media. Of course it's not going to be 100% accurate to the book, unlike a book, a film has dozens of people working on it, and it has to be made to fit the film format. A movie based on a book doesn't need to be 100% accurate to be good, and I think James Whale's Frankenstein from 1931 is the perfect example of that. It does baffle me that people complain that this particular movie had very little to do with original Mary Shelly novel, because the original book is one of the darkest, most jaw dropping story ever written. Besides, they made a more accurate version in the 90s, and look how that turned out. Anyway, back to the movie. From beginning to end, this movie is just fun. The opening with the guy coming out and warning the audience that this movie might be too scary for some people, that just sets the tone for what you're about to watch. Every scene in this movie is just classic. There's Dr. Frankenstein and Fritz digging up bodies in the graveyard, the laboratory scenes, the little girl by the pond, the angry villagers, and so on. As a kid, I saw most of these scenes for the first time parodied in Saturday morning cartoons; and it's really cool seeing where it all began. Even if you think this movie sucks for being unfaithful to the book, this is the classic Frankenstein. This is what people think about when they hear the title. Sure, there can be other versions, but they'll never be as iconic as this one. When you hear Frankenstein's monster, do you think of Boris Karloff or Robert De Niro? Obviously you think of the classic, with the Jack Pierce make-up. To me, there will never be a Frankenstein to match this one. It's just so classic, so creepy, so entertaining, that it's impossible not to enjoy. Who cares if it doesn't do the book justice? The movie was made, and it has become so iconic that people are starting to accept it as the classic it is. P.S. This applies to the first three Frankenstein movies by universal. To me, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein are all equally good, so the sequels should definitely not be overlooked. Frankenstein is the most classic, Bride of Frankenstein has the most heart to it, and Son of Frankenstein is the creepiest.

And just like Frankenstein, fans could care less. Once again, this is a movie that is so classic, and so iconic, that it doesn't matter if it does justice to the book or not. Just like how Boris Karloff set the popular image of Frankenstein's monster, Bela Lugosi set the popular image of Dracula. His clothing, his haunting stare, his rhythmic voice, Bela Lugosi is Dracula. This movie also has one of my favorite movie quotes of all time Listen to them. Children of the night.

The lack of a soundtrack may bother people, but to me, that just makes the movie much more haunting. Even though I love this movie, I still know it has its fair share of flaws. A lot of the side characters aren't very memorable, and the ending is kind of rushed, but those flaws don't really bother me. For the first sound horror movie, it's still great. I love the over the top acting. I love the fake bats. I love the Gothic sets. I love classic monster movies like this. This movie may not be for everyone, and I would have to admit that there are better vampire movies out there (Nosferatu, Let the Right One In, the Hammer Dracula series, and Spanish Dracula), but this is a must see for any classic horror buff.

Yes, I'm aware it was a big hit when it came out, and I know it was nominated for several academy awards (first to be nominated for all four acting categories), so why is it constantly overlooked when it comes to classic comedies? To me, this movie did something that not a lot of screwball comedies from the 1930s could do; it gets you invested. Usually these movies are too goofy and over the top for you to take them seriously, but My Man Godfrey has a very mature feel to it, which makes it stick out from the bunch. It has the right amount of drama to keep us invested, and it has the right amount of laughs to keep us entertained. I can't really think of another movie from this time period that has this perfect mix of comedy and drama. A lot of that is because of the intelligent writing, but where this movie's real strength lies is in its characters. The film is great in its way of spoofing high society during the depression era with the Bullock family. This is an unforgettable cast of characters. You have the scatterbrained mother, the spoiled, mean daughter, the kinder, but more naive daughter, the blowhard father (who doesn't seem to understand his own family), the wise cracking maid, and the mother's mooching protégé. But what completes this perfects cast is the contrast of the character Godfrey. He's so laid back, and normal compared to the Bullock family that we're on his side. We're with him as he deals with this family that is so far removed from the real world, and that's why he steals the show. Now this whole cast is amazing, don't get me wrong (it wouldn't work as well if the rest of the cast didn't contrast with the main character), but the main reason to see this movie is for William Powell's performance as Godfrey. Usually in this genre, characters like Rufus T. Firefly (Duck Soup) or Susan (Bringing Up Baby) steal the show, but here, it's the more down to earth character who steals the show. He's just one of those characters you want to be. He's so cool, so mysterious, and you know he's always one step ahead of the other characters. He reminds me of other famous characters like Mary Poppins, or Willy Wonka, who are also very mysterious characters who leave a lasting impact on the others around them. The film is only a little over 90 minutes long, but it accomplishes a lot in that time. It feels longer than it really is (in the good way), and by the end, you'll wish it were longer. This is a great movie, and one of the great classics of the 1930s. The only flaws it probably has are the ones that only apply to the time it was made.

But I had seen Devon Sawa in The Boys Club from 1995 and really liked that film, so I decided to watch this 12 years after its original release. I remember almost going to see it when it opened, but never got around to it.That said, after the first 15 minutes of this movie, I thought I was going to thoroughly enjoy this seemingly original idea along the lines of Sixth Sense. But soon it just devolved into a teen slasher film, with the killer being death cheated, overly explained by the coroner about 30 minutes in. Then Devon has to come to discover death's plan and try to fool it, supposedly ending the plan through interrupting it. This allows for a lot of grisly close calls and murders which seemed to me totally ludicrous, with objects self propelling and fires or explosions trying to kill the intended victim.I confess that I don't believe that any events in one's life are preplanned by fate other than genetic tendencies, so the premise itself was one I could not accept. But if the story had instead emphasized the guilt of having survived and how that affected them psychologically, perhaps a better film could have emerged, where the viewer could question whether there was intent or just coincidence. But that would have required some subtlety and an intelligent script, which were not in evidence in this pedestrian film. The clever surprise at the end was not enough to add more than one point to the rating. So a 2 from me instead of a 1. By the way, Devon Sawa did a good job, considering the poor material he was given. Hard for me to believe this sub-mediocre effort spawned numerous sequels or remakes. I wonder if I would have liked this more were I in my teens or twenties. Probably, since when I re-watch some of the films I thought were good back in the 50's, I often wonder how I could have possibly enjoyed them.

Soldier was written by David Peoples, who co-wrote the script for Blade Runner. By his own admission, he considers Soldier to be a sidequel\/spiritual successor to Blade Runner. There are a lot of Easter eggs in the movie, homing tribute to Blade Runner. It also obliquely references various elements of stories written by Philip K. Dick (who wrote the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, on which Blade Runner is based), or film adaptations thereof. The film stars Kurt Russell as Sgt. Todd, a soldier trained from birth. The film also features Gary Busey, Jason Scott Lee, Jason Isaacs, Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and Michael Chiklis in supporting roles. In a futuristic society, some people are selected at birth to become soldiers, and trained in such a manner that they become inhuman killing machines. One of the best of these soldiers (Russell) gets pitted against a new breed of soldiers, and after the confrontation is believed to be dead. His body is left behind in a semi-abandoned colonial planet, where everything is peaceful, and he is taught about the other aspects of life. But eventually he has to fight the new breed of soldiers again, this time to defend his new home. 'Soldier ' definitely has a lot going for it, an interesting take on the future of warfare, a solid cast led by Kurt Russell, above average artistic vision, memorable lines, and well thought out action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. Personally, Kurt Russell s performance as Sgt. Todd is just not that good-just because you were born and bred to be a soldier doesn't mean you are going to walk around like a terminator shooting everyone instead of hiding and ducking behind cover like any rational human. It's hard to sympathize with a ruthless killer, just because he gets replaced by better killers? He slowly becomes more human as the film goes along when he finally somewhat gains a family in a community. Then the corporation hunting down towns attacks and he decides to defend it and get even. Still not strong enough, as it's clearly hard to figure out his humanity. It felt like one dimensional acting, yes I know he was made with one purpose, to be soldier. So yeah he's supposed to be a one dimensional guy. In this movie obviously it requires minimal dialogue&#x97;for such character. As the movie progresses and he spends more time with the family he shows more feelings and emotions&#x97;but still Kurt Russell's character is like a bored dog staring at you when it's not biting the mailman. The main premise of this movie is that old Sun Tzu saying (paraph) One man defending his family is worth 10 hired men attacking him. Todd is a better warrior because he gets something worth fighting for. Nice visuals and stuff as there were some weak CG in a couple scenes. The movie did a fine job of raising important questions. Example if you aren't fighting to protect civilians, what is your purpose? It brings into focus the whole issue of a state versus its citizenry, possibly the dominant problem of the 21st century. Then there is the ethical issue of tampering with nature. Sociopaths always think they can get their way if they just find more sophisticated ways of manipulating the world around them. The outcome is always disastrous. How could you even use that sentence in the context of this movie? Why? It's got a great story, some solid acting, awesome characters, and just the right amount of action and story. Check out Soldier.

Granted it's not the most elegant or sophisticated one, but I liked it, I liked it so much I could watch it again, and still laugh at the lousiest jokes.Now, that's still a tough review to give, because as much as I have the deepest respect for such distinguished critics as Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, it would be a lie if I said that I didn't laugh at Ace Ventura Pet Detective. They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh. Maybe it's the most primary and raunchy level of humor, maybe I shouldn't even be entitled to judge another film, let alone a comedy, if I was capable to appreciate Tom Shadyak's film. But I guess I would be more to blame if I was pretending not to love it just to look smart. Hell, I don't even know why I'm feeling sorry to love the film, I really do, and too bad some people couldn't laugh at it.Ace Ventura Pet Detective is so straightforward in its approach to comedy that it's nearly impossible to find it unfunny.

It's precisely because he was obnoxious that Ace Ventura was funny, think about it, a man who loves animals so much that he hates human. Does it make sense? What's the matter, as long as it makes laugh?And the opening scene of the couldn't have set the tone any better, Ventura carries a sort of fragile bag with such carelessness, any clairvoyant mind would automatically wonder if there is some fragile stuff inside or if it's just an undercover. The whole opening credits consists on showing him mistreating the little case, just in case we forgot that. Tom Shadyak, who directed Dumb and Dumber the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag.

What can I say about this part? Well, Mel Brooks said once that The Producers 'rose below vulgarity', Ace Ventura is probably the comedy that comes the closest to that definition. Indeed, Ace Ventura belongs to a special kind of comedies, dumb enough to be funny, without being annoying, and smart enough to &#x85; nah, it's not that smart, or maybe it's smart in the way it's funny when it shouldn't normally be.

It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it.

It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny.Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does. With The Mask, Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura (all of them in the Top 10 highest-grossing films), 1994 was the breakthrough year of Jim Carrey, that launched his career and put him in the Hall of Fame of the greatest comedic performers. And you have to give credit to Jim Carrey, especially because he played three different characters &#x85; and he's just too damn funny.

That's the feeling I kept getting throughout this film. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie well worth watching. But the director's habit of over-explaining things kept making me wonder if he thinks we're all idiots.For example, there's a really cool scene where 2 pianists have a duel. Pianist #1 plays something amazing. Pianist #2 duplicates it note-for-note. It was almost a perfect scene except the director felt the need to have some extras in the audience yelling, He's playing the same thing! The exact same thing!Another example would be during the same scene when one pianist breaks into a taunting version of Silent Night. It was a funny moment, but again those stupid extras start yelling, Haha, he's playing 'Silent Night'!!Whenever anyone plays something impressive we get those same unnecessary commentaries from peripheral characters, essentially telling the audience, Ok, you're supposed to be impressed here. In that vein, the whole production struck me as being very operatic... meaning characters exaggerate reactions and emotions for the sake of giving the audience cues. Reminded me of a Kenneth Branaugh film. If you like em that way, then no problem. But if you prefer films on the subtle side (Kubrick, Bergman, Kieslowski), you might start to get distracted by this film's overtness.THE FILM'S SAVING GRACE... is the incomparable Tim Roth. He offsets the melodrama of the characters around him with his calm, sober portrayal of the guy who knows it all yet has seen nothing. Roth plays the central character, a man who has lived his entire life within the bowels of a boat. And he pulls it off with amazing authenticity.The film's final 15 minutes are where Roth really shines, and the director gives him every opportunity to do so with no distractions (no music, dark set with only faces illuminated, nice slow pacing so the dialogue can breathe). When it was all over, I could forgive the minor flaws mentioned above, and I came away impressed and fulfilled.I definitely recommend 1900 if you liked the films Copying Beethoven, Shine and of course Cinema Paradiso... It has the same polished style. In many ways it also reminded me of the Herzog film Invincible, a movie that similarly comes across as a little overdone, but as soon as Roth appears everything falls into place.

Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. So off to 2015 we go. The future. And then we go hurtling back to the past, 1955 again. With a pit stop in a dystopian 1985 in between. It's quite the adventure, albeit a tad confusing if you're not really paying attention. The first movie was very straightforward, Marty McFly stuck in the past having to ensure his parents ended up together. Simple. This one is not so simple, it's a bit of a maze. But a maze well worth working your way through. Back and forth through time Marty and Doc Brown go and we're along for the very enjoyable ride.In 2015 Marty and Doc do what they set out to do, preventing Marty's future son from getting himself in major future trouble. And the vision of what 2015 would look like which director Robert Zemeckis presents is a hoot. Flying cars are only the start. But Marty and Doc aren't there for some time-travel sightseeing, they accomplish their mission and get the heck out of there and head back to 1985 before they can screw anything up. Little do they know they screwed everything up. When they get back to 1985 it is not the Hill Valley they know and love. Hill Valley is now Hell on Earth, a miserable place lorded over by the evil Biff Tannen. What happened? Well, as Marty and Doc soon discover while they were in 2015 old Biff stole the time machine and went back to 1955 where he gave his young self a sports almanac with the results of all major sporting events for the rest of the century. Biff bets on all the winners, becomes obscenely wealthy and takes over the town. When Marty and Doc get back to 1985 they find that fate and Biff have now dealt them a very unkind hand. But if Marty thinks he's got it bad he need only look at what's happened to his poor parents who've got it much, much worse. Only one thing to do. Hop in the DeLorean and head back to 1955 to prevent Biff from getting his hands on that book. They must set right what has gone horribly wrong.It all sounds a bit convoluted and in truth there are times where the movie is a little too complex for its own good. The first movie was just flat-out fun all the way through. Here the movie has to slow down to explain itself. And things are much bleaker this time around too, the alternate 1985 being such an awful place. The sooner the movie gets out of there the better off it is. Especially considering where it is the movie's going. Back into 1955, back into the very day which served as the climax of the first film. Yep, we're going back to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. It's the rare opportunity for a movie to go back into itself, see itself from new perspectives and Zemeckis takes full advantage of the opportunity. Those scenes we know so well from the first film are given new twists and it is here that this sequel really shines. Watching Marty try to solve his new problem without undoing what he did in the first film is simply terrific stuff. Part II may not have been as consistently captivating, nor as out and out fun, as the original but the story ultimately pays itself off brilliantly.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are pitch-perfect again as Marty and Doc. Thomas F. Wilson does a great job playing multiple incarnations of the villainous Biff. Poor Lea Thompson spends most of her screen time playing older versions of Marty's mom Lorraine, to whom time has been unkind. Thompson does what she has to do well but the film does miss that youthful charm, spunk and vivaciousness of the first film's Lorraine. And the film also clearly misses Crispin Glover in the role of George McFly. Glover is such a unique performer, he brought so much bizarre yet endearing personality to the role of George. This film's attempt to work around Glover's absence is awkward to say the least. But best not to quibble about what this movie misses. Better to embrace what it has. It's a great story which takes us on a wild journey through the space-time continuum. Yes that story requires a little effort on the part of the audience to keep up through all its twists and turns. This movie doesn't make itself as easy to enjoy as the first one did, you have to work a little for this one. It's worth working for. Marty and Doc are such great characters, such a great team.

Having a very unique plant, Seymour names the plant after his love, and he accidentally finds out that the plant needs blood to live. As the plant grows in size, which it does at an alarming rate, the plant grows more and more hungry and need more than just blood to satisfy it's ravenous desire.The storyline is very good, easy to follow and offer some funny moments. Being such an old movie, don't expect too much from the props and scenery, although I will say that the movie actually fares quite well with whatever meager props and scenery they made use of.And of course, Jack Nicholson, is in this movie as well, one of the first performances of his I have seen personally, but he is not the star of the movie. After his fame and success in Hollywood, of course, his name is one of the headliners on the DVD cover, despite him having a small role only.The Little Shop of Horrors is a definite must watch movie, because it is a great comedy from that age, and probably a pioneer in its genre at the time.

There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with Stalingrad.Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single clean form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about humanity in war. There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth.But the Das Boot approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's party&#x97;robs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it all&#x97;Khrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened.EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the evil German is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle.Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior.The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the humanity in war theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flickIn all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5\/10.

Acting is swell Jake Gyllenhaal is effectively perfect as the title role, while Holmes Osborne, Mary McDonnell, Jena Malone, and Beth Grant all contribute quality performances. Additional smaller roles by Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, James Duval, and Maggie Gyllenhaal are also noteworthy. Despite a few odd lines, the writing is really good.

The acting is sub-par (even by Milla Jovovich's standards), the plot is laughable, the action is dull and repetitive and the Matrix style bullet time effect is over used. For fans of the games, this film has nothing to offer you. In fact you're likely to end up hating Paul Anderson, that is, of course, if you didn't already hate him for his previous travesties.For fans of zombie movies, this film has nothing new to offer to you. All you will get from this film, and indeed the plethora of abortive train wrecks it's spawned, is an uninteresting rehash of things you've seen before, nothing has even been used in an original way. For fans of horror films, this film contains no suspense and is about as likely to frighten you as offering salt lick to horse is likely to frighten it. This is an action film pure and simple, an all style no substance action film at that.For fans of well-made movies, the genre of which really doesn't bother you, look elsewhere. If you are masochistic enough to feel you that you just have to see this film for yourself don't say I didn't warn you.There is a very special group of people who will love this movie, namely 14 year old boys with below average IQs and way too much testosterone. The only redeeming feature of this film is the soundtrack, but if you like that kind of music you'll probably have every song you hear in this film already.My suggestion save your money and get yourself a tin of paint, you'll have a lot more fun watching it dry than you would do sitting through this steaming pile of horse manure.

Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, an eight-year-old boy, frustrated with his family, who wishes he didn't have one. We as the audiences don't blame him, as most of the family member's really do treat him horrible mostly the Uncle and brother Buzz. The family is made out of mother Catherine O'Hara, father John Heard, Devin Ratray and Roberts Blossom in other family roles. When he wakes up on Christmas morning the next day, he discovers he's been accidentally left home alone after his entire family flies to Paris on vacation, and forgets about him. It's does feed the same story as It's a Wonderful Life, in a very odd way, when it applies to both the main character and the supporting cast, where both sides wish that the main character never existed and when they are apart they realize they really do love each other and want to be together for Christmas. At first, he's relishing the time with himself. I'm surprise that the pizza guy didn't call the cops in one of Kevin's pranks, but the closing it get to Christmas, the more he miss his family and matured. Matters are complicated when two bumbling burglars attempt to rob the large house Kevin is home alone in played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci known as the Wet Bandits. The two adult idiots quickly get outsmarted by a kid is always fun in a sick demonic way and protected his home. Kevin eventually manages to outwit them with a series of booby traps and tricks. Now, it's a race between time, as the parents rushing home to rejoin Kevin, and the Bandits trying to hurt him. I wonder what would happen if Kevin accidentally kills them. Would he be charge for man slaughter? Parents should still watch the movie, just in case if the movie has way too much violence and swearing in the movie. The characters in the movie are presented as cartoon-like. But the fact remains the actors are real people and not animated images, and the visual effects are done with a very high degree of realism. It's a bit disturbing. That the protagonist is himself a victum of child abuse is a bit disturbing in itself. The violence he inflicts on others is only an acting out of the resentment and rage he fosters towards his parents. So there might be something wrong with Kevin, indeed. Still, one of the most memorable aspects of Home Alone is the score by John Williams. It's amazing to hear. I love the planning song. The slapstick might be cruel, but in heart, the movie does have a Christmas theme with the story of Kevin and his snow- shovel carrying neighbor. It's truly a XMAS movie indeed.

Don't let that bother you, this is really good.The first dislocation is from happy 1950's 'reality' to the world of fiction and storytelling - our 'shrinking man' is now a nationwide media sensation, he is the 'story', we are as interested as the reporters who ambush his house. He is writing his own 'story' of what is happening to him.The second is to the world of 'freaks' and outcasts, of carnival performers on a stage - a cinematid device. He finds the possibility of a new life here, new love behind the stage. No dice. He keeps shrinking.We shift a third time to now a parody of the world of scintillating sci-fi movies; the gigantic beast is not some tentacled atomic mutant but a common household cat, his house is an actual miniature house, the desert landscapes of films like It Came from Outer Space and Tarantula now become the vast expanses of carpeted living-room floor.The fourth is death and the spiritual journey of transmigration beyond death. You will note that he is reported dead on TV, his wife is mourning and making preparations to move on. He is at this point effectively 'dead' to the waking world of normal life, having forever slipped through the bars of perceived reality. It is not a 'real' journey however, like we get in Aguirre, The Searchers, Apocalypse Now, the premise is fantastical after all, the landscape entirely figural. It is much closer to film noir in mechanism. What does this mean?It is a story being recalled by a narrator at the mercy of callous fates.It effectively starts with him passing through a mysterious mist, something from out at sea that 'clouds' and distorts his vision. The rest is the narrator framing himself inside an increasingly hallucinatory story that he presents, one he has no control of and sweeps him through different worlds of performed life, which is the life we all know, one of acting roles and being a part of stories. In each of these worlds, the narrator 'dies', or experiences if you will a metaphysical loss of himself.More to the point. In each new world he enters he is stripped of a part of ego that strives to control life, quite plainly by shrinking in size, he loses everything else that comes with it; pride, desire for respectability, vanity, etc.And with each loss of the baggage of ego, the disembodied narrator is free to swim to the edges of consciousness, past the fabricated reality of stories to where things can mean themselves and have an empty center, what the Buddhist know as awakening to shunyata. It is when he stops struggling that the psychonaut can freely go from his prison and be one with things.The ego-redemptive journey horrifies, because it is from the Western self-centered pov.

Many say it was the best time of his career for comedies. If I didn't know any better, I'd think it would've been his worst.And here I am, where I usually wind up after rewatching an Adam Sandler movie; appalled and dismayed. Billy Madison is a wretched, unpleasant comedy exercise from the beginning, with Sandler playing yet another rendition of the hopelessly unlikable schlub. Call them stupid movies, call them turn your brain off films, I call these kinds of films, anti-character studies, when we're given a character who doesn't even try to be remotely likable and one simply not worth studying.Sandler plays the title character and we open on the desperately unfunny note of Sandler lounging in his pool, spraying sunblock on his stomach, and eagerly anticipating the arrival of his nudie magazines in the mail. Upon driving his go-kart to the mailbox, we see Billy is quite drunk and hallucinates a large penguin that he begins to chase through his yard. As you can infer, Sandler's character is a lame-brained, overgrown child also equipped with one of the most annoying, insufferable accents of his career (second to only The Waterboy).Billy's life is made; he doesn't need to work because his father is filthy rich and he is permitted to act like a senseless buffoon as long as he doesn't interfere with his father's line of work. But when he does, his dad reveals to Billy that he will not be handing over the company to his son but to a fellow employee because he views his son as unfit and incompetent. He too reveals that he paid all of Billy's teachers, from first to twelfth grade, to pass him no questions asked. Billy proposes that if he were to go back and repeat every grade for two weeks each, and pass with a test, that he could be given ownership of the company. His father accepts and so unfolds a comedy of dead ends.Some people will be in tears watching Sandler's character yell, scream, and fight as he repeats every grade and some will even list it as one of their favorite films. Not me. I chuckled once and fell into a dreary, never-ending silence for the remainder of the picture. It takes more than stale sight gags, a childish character, and a ridiculous accent for me to laugh.Immaturity seems to be running ramped in comedies today, and when handled delicately, with heart and wit, it can be quite funny and sometimes quite entertaining. Here, it's so dumbed-down, cloyingly idiotic, and jaw-droppingly childish that any expectations are crushed upon arrival.All likability for the Billy Madison character is destroyed after the first few minutes as well. What's his reason for acting so goofy and simple? How did he become so ridiculously incompetent when he has an immensely successful father? And why does he so often commit random acts of senselessness like throwing dodgeballs at young kids and even making his shampoo and conditioner argue in the bathtub. Those questions can all be answered with, for a laugh. Billy Madison's formula is contrived and hopelessly unremarkable. Its humor stems directly from laughing down at the character when we wonder if he can actually help it or not. Sandler's screen presence grows stale and unbelievably intolerable after only a few short minutes and we are left with an implausible story, a monotonous line of events, and a character we feel nothing for. I'm astonished when people call this the best Adam Sandler movie. Have these same people seen Reign Over Me? Probably not; they would not give an Adam Sandler drama the time of day.Starring Adam Sandler, Bradley Whitford, Bridgette Wilson, Norm Macdonald, and Darren McGavin. Directed by Tamra Davis.
