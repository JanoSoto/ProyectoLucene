Almost thirty years from the day his father died, he discovers a radio that his dad used to talk on around the world (kind of like instant messaging, but you're not typing). John and his friend Gordo set it up to see if it still worked. It worked more than they thought it would. Later in the night, John hears a voice coming from the radio.

I thought that the book was particularly bad, little more than an enumeration of shock scenes and cheap thrill effects with very little plot. I found the book particularly disappointing in lots of longish chapters that were nothing but red herrings, I thought it was a bad idea to reveal the cause of Hannibal Lecter's madness and I particularly didn't like the book's ending.That said, I think David Mamet and Steve Zaillian did a good job at rewriting this flawed novel into a solid, albeit not excellent, thriller. I don't blame them, the base material was simply not good enough for being filmed.Contrary to the novel, there is actually a plot, which is not vying for spectacular moments, but develops rather slowly and gradually. Even though this may at some point seem to make the movie appear a bit longish, I think the pace is adequate and well-balanced.(minor spoilers follow) The only thing I missed was Mason Verger's sister; without her, his death seems somewhat contrived; there seems little motivation behind it. The good thing was that Mamet\/Zaillian also got rid of Lecter's past and significantly changed the ending, and I prefer this ending very much to that of the novel, which never rang true to me.So the script was good, what about the acting? Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter reprise lacks some of the demonic darkness of Silence of the Lambs. Since Silence, Lecter-like characters have become so much of a stereotype that even the original hardly rings true. Julianne Moore as the older, more experienced Agent Starling lacks Jodie Foster's vulnerability; that is understandable given the 10 years that have supposedly passed, but then it was exactly Starling's lack of experience and her vulnerability that made her such an interesting character. So despite a solid performance from Julianne Moore she simply is no match for Jodie Foster. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger is barely recognizable between layers of mask, and nowhere near as evil and mentally disturbed as the character in the novel. With his elaborate make-up he has little opportunity to act or emote, which is a pity.As for the rest of the cast... well, unremarkable.I give this 7 points, mostly for a well-done script by Mamet\/Zaillian, who turned a bad novel into a film that made some sense and for solid, but not exceptional directing by Ridley Scott. To come close to Silence of the Lambs, Thomas Harris should have written a better novel than Hannibal.

Mark lays down an emotionless performance. Aniston is no more vibrant than her character on Friends, which isn't that different from the one in the movie, really.  The best actor in the film was the old British manager guy, who wasn't stellar.The worst part of this movie, apart from having to hear way too much of the crappy music (nothing like fake old metal songs performed by some studio artist and lip-sinc-ed by Marky Mark) was that there was only script for the half of it.Here we go - boy likes band, boy tries to be like band, boy loses his band, boy gets to be in his favorite band.  This much we knew... and after this point in the film - the little jokes leave, the vicarious excitement leaves, and the cliches take over.  The film loses any momentum it had, and people start going to the bathroom, getting more popcorn, talking to their dates, etc.  Boy parties too hard, boy loses girl, boy quits band.Gee, who saw it coming?Had the film been a true biopic, with legal rights as such, it might have been better.  But the oh, no, we're definately not talking about Judas Priest act is a little lame.  It left me wondering what parts of the film were fact or fiction, if they even interviewed, etc.  And the effect was lost -- songs performed were (as far as I could tell) fake, not authentic rock songs, outfits were cheezy and lame (Dragons?  They came up with Dragons??  Who wears a dragon?), and the viewers couldn't get into the falseness of it.

I don't think it even qualifies as a horror film, the high level of graphic violence notwithstanding.Where HANNIBAL works at a high level, as high as any film I've seen this year, is a psychological drama that moves like a thriller and takes time to explore all of the major characters. It's a manipulation that Hannibal Lecter is not as bad a man as the stories major villains--Mason Verger, Paul Krendler, even Pazzi--but the movie pulls it off. Once again, we don't much mind when Lecter kills and, um, does other stuff with his victims because they're jerks. They certainly treat Clarice Starling like crap, and Julianne Moore does a brilliant job at showing an older Clarice, someone who knows she's great at what she does, knows the powers that be (especially Krendler) hate her for just not going away, and knows that she'll never be accepted. One sly notion floated in the film is that Clarice does fear and hate Lecter, but at least respects him for not lying about what he is.

Ridley Scott simply has the right touch to propel a film's narrative through the ennui or lengthy exposition that has torpedoed many a dramatic thriller.

One of them, Marie (Natacha Régnier) is apartment-sitting for a mother and her daughter who are in the hospital, victims of an accident. The other, Isabelle (Élodie Bouchez) has been living day to day with her backpack on her back, sometimes selling handmade cards on street corners. Almost immediately there is an affinity, and they find joy and adventure in one another's company.Part of the power of Erick Zonca's forceful and precise direction is to make us not only identify with his two heroines, but to force us see the world from their point of view. They are tossed about by strong emotions, powerfully projected by both actresses. Their lives and happiness are at the whim of forces beyond their control, the most powerful of which are their own feelings. When I was a little boy and went to the movies I would see three films, bang, bang, bang, one after the other, and when I came out, five or six hours later, I was transformed. I had grown, and I could see the world in a different way. Of course I was a little boy and every little bit of experience was amazing and added to my knowledge of the world. Now, such transformations, like moments of Zen enlightenment, are rare and precious. The Dream Life of Angels is one of those rare and precious films that has the kind of power to make us see the world afresh as though for the very first time.Bouchez and Régnier shared the Best Actress award at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival for their work in this movie. Indeed it is hard to choose between them. Both are wonderful. Bouchez's character, Isabelle, has a gentle, fun-loving, child-like nature, tomboyish and sentimental. Marie is cynical, uptight and wired. Her emotions swing wildly from deep pessimism to a tenuous hope for something better in this life. When she is seduced, rather forcefully, by the arrogant and predatory Chris (Grégoire Colin) who owns nightclubs and is accustomed to having his way with women, she is stunned to find that she wants him, needs him, loves him. But she knows (and is warned by Isabelle) that he is just using her and will dump her. She hates herself for loving him and therefore lashes out at Isabelle who is a witness to her humiliation.As a counterpoint to the raw animal love that Marie finds in Chris, there is the tender, dreamlike love that Isabelle finds for the daughter of the woman who owns the apartment. The mother dies from her injuries, but the daughter, Sandrine, lives on in a coma. Isabelle finds Sandrine's diary and reads it, and is touched by the sentiments expressed by the girl, and falls in love with her. A nurse tells Isabelle You can talk to her. She's sleeping, but she can hear you. Whether she can or not, we don't know, but to show her love Isabelle visits the comatose girl in the hospital and reads from her diary to her.In a sense we feel that the dream life of angels is the dream of Sandrine, who is dreaming the life of the young women who are living in her apartment.She is an angel and they are her dream, a troubled dream of raw emotion contrasted with her state of quiet somnolence.The Dream Life of Angels is beautifully shot in tableaux of pastel interiors in which the characters are sometimes seen at offset as in portraits. In one scene we see one of the girls in the apartment while in the right upper corner is a window through which we see in clear focus a car pass in front of a picturesque building, so that the scene is seen in layers, so that we experience the inner life and the outside world at once. In another scene, Isabelle is reading Sandrine's diary, which we see over her shoulder. Just as she reads the words that excite her passion for the girl, there is just the slightest quickening of tempo as Isabelle flips the page to see what Sandrine writes next, and in that small gesture, we feel the emotions of the girls, the one who wrote the words and the one who reads them.As a foil to the smooth, but bestial Chris, we are given Charlie (Patrick Mercado), fat motorcycle dude who is gentle and wise. This enlightened juxtaposition of character is part of director Erick Zonca's technique. We see it also in the contrasting characters of Marie and Isabelle.Obviously this is a work of art, but it is also a triumph of film making in a directorial sense. Zonca's careful attention to detail and his total concentration throughout turn something that might have been merely original into a masterful work of art.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

We see it also in the contrasting characters of Marie and Isabelle.Obviously this is a work of art, but it is also a triumph of film making in a directorial sense. Zonca's careful attention to detail and his total concentration throughout turn something that might have been merely original into a masterful work of art.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Although I don't expect each and every one of them to be of the caliber of `My Fair Lady,' it still amazes me how such a profoundly clever and witty source work can result in so many lowbrow and humorless imitations.  The latest such fiasco is `Miss Congeniality,' an alleged comedy starring Sandra Bullock as a tomboyish New York City FBI agent who is sent undercover as a contestant to help nab a killer threatening to target the Miss United States Beauty Pageant.  Ms. Bullock plays the Eliza Doolittle to Michael Caine's Professor Henry Higgins, in this case a snooty, effete `groomer' of prospective contestants whose job it is to pass the less-than-ladylike Ms. Bullock off as a viable candidate.  If Shaw was nothing else, he was a brilliant writer of scintillating dialogue.  To say that what passes for dialogue between these two characters &#150; essentially a barrage of crude, uninspired insults &#150; falls far short of Shavian wit would indeed be a massive understatement.   One of the biggest problems with the film is that Bullock, in an attempt to appear unpleasant and abrasive, manages to obscure the one quality that has sustained her in most of her previous films &#150; her innate sweetness and charm.  Unfortunately, we neither believe nor like her in this role - and without that crucial element of audience identification, the entire comedy falls to pieces.  We simply don't accept her for a second as the uncouth slob she is attempting to portray.  We know she is just `playing' at being dowdy and crude so that she can be transformed, Cinderella-like, into a lady in time for the ball.   Her prince, a fellow FBI agent played by Benjamin Bratt, starts off as a bland foil only to turn into an even blander romantic love interest.  Only Candice Bergen as the pageant's director and William Shatner as the show's emcee seem to have the slightest clue that they are even in a comedy at all.  Considering the fact that there is really only one laugh-out-loud moment in the whole movie (Bullock's attempt to tackle a supposed suspect), they might be mistaken after all.If you want to see a GOOD modern version of `Pygmalion,' (also starring Michael Caine in the Higgins role), check out 1983's delightful `Educating Rita' and skip `Miss Congeniality.'

Right from the word go, it is clear that there could not have been a better man for the job. While a distinctly &#145;Kubrickian' tone, to coin a phrase, emerges later, the start is all Spielberg &#150; light as a major player, a clean, comfortable setting and the focus throughout is of a child David, the one-of-a-kind robot programmed to feel love.  While the opening may seem lifeless and insipid, it is merely a common trick employed by the director to agitate the audience and create a sense of unease, that stays in the picture long after the initial tones evaporate. This certainly works, as the first day of David's visit (a family has been chosen to look after him and try to love him back), especially in scenes with his &#145;mother' (Frances O Connor) there is an overriding feeling of discomfort, even though there is something vaguely comical about the way the robots speak and the way their mind works.  However this does not last all that long, and once David goes off on his own (and even in scenes beforehand), a more real and menacing tone emerges, as the true nature of the differences between humans and robots make themselves known. Jude Law's character, the wonderfully cool &#145;Gigolo Joe' is vital to this, thickening the plot just before the mood gets overly pretentious.       This also gives us an uncontrollably high level of emotion to deal with, especially to do with David, as played by Haley Joel Osment, who conveys such loneliness and despair that it's absolutely heartbreaking. His performance, which is pivotal, reminds us just why he burst onto the scene in 1999 with &#145;The Sixth Sense', and while at times it's a completely different role his ability still shines in the same way.  With its strong performances and fascinating subject matter, there is no doubt this film is a gripping spectacle, but it always seems to maintain a sort of distance, never quite as engaging as you might expect from a film with so much emotion bubbling under. For example themes that touch our most basic instincts, such as protecting a child in danger, are all tainted by an air of uncertainty which permeates the entire movie.  However this is a typical Kubrick trait and perhaps this is the mark that he leaves, or rather Spielberg leaves for him. No other living director has the genius Spielberg has to make use of an enormous arsenal of film knowledge and to make Kubrick's idea into Kubrick's film while still keeping you interested.  Smart without pretension, accessible without ever failing to surprise us, and truly absorbing, Spielberg and the entire cast can look back at a job very well done.

No other living director has the genius Spielberg has to make use of an enormous arsenal of film knowledge and to make Kubrick's idea into Kubrick's film while still keeping you interested.  Smart without pretension, accessible without ever failing to surprise us, and truly absorbing, Spielberg and the entire cast can look back at a job very well done.
