He finds out much about life and about himself along the way...but his indomitable spirit is bolstered by his sense of humor, which helps give him a bright outlook on life. He wants to share the spirit through medicine in a holistic sense. Of course he does so at his own peril...and often it appears that the odds are against him. But he manages to outwit the competition at their own game. The story is sensitive one, and Patch does not let the spectrum of human emotion escape him, touching lives along the way where others fear to tread. He makes a difference...and others who see his success are driven to distraction at his un-orthodox methods.There are laughs and tears along the way. I don't want to say too much about the movie for fear of giving it away. But it is, ultimately, a stand-up-and-cheer type movie. Robin has gone on in the last decade to broaden his spectrum by accepting roles against type, playing villains, playing men haunted by their pasts ( as in 'Goodwill Hunting'), but here he is at his finest, playing a Pagliacci type doctor who stumbles his way into the hearts of some, and stumbles his way onto the do not invite lists of others. It is a rewarding watch, not a lot of violence or objectionable language. I fully recommend a viewing of Patch Adams.

Basically Lucas (A Scanner Darkly's Rory Cochrane) is in charge of closing the Empire Records independent music store, and when he sees that the store could be taken over by another business, he decides to take the $9000 in the safe and gamble it in Atlantic City to win big and save the store, ultimately he loses it. The next day he returns to work to tell boss Joe Reaves (Lantana's Anthony LaPaglia) the bad news, and Joe punishes him to stay sat on the office sofa, and only to move if he comes up with a way to get the money back. This day happens to be the day that the store has invited pompous and fading pop singer Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield) to promote his new album and sign autographs. Each individual teen character, high school students and young adults working in the store, are having their own emotional problems, all coming out on this day. Overachieving student Corey Mason (The Lord of the Rings' Liv Tyler) heading for Harvard University discovers Rex isn't the lovable singer he seems to be. Lovesick A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) wants to tell Corey his feelings for her at a precise time, and when he does it's the wrong time. Gina (Ren√©e Zellweger, a year before Jerry Maguire) is the free spirit who takes advantage of her chance to get with Rex, but it may not have been the best decision and everyone disapproves, don't worry, this will change. Debra (The Craft's Robin Tunney) entered the store immediately shaving her hair off, and continues most of the day being a hostile, antisocial and near suicidal person, burying herself in work, but she come out once in a while. Finally, Mark (Ethan Embry\/Randall) is the geeky one who is willing to make a tit of himself on the live news right outside to spread the word that the store needs money to survive. There is also the frequent appearance of the shoplifter calling himself Warren Beatty (Brendan Sexton III) who starts out as a troublemaker, but everyone warms to him and are willing to forgive him, and even consider him for a job in the store. In the end, after a big alcohol and music filled party in the street and the store, they manage to raise enough money for Joe to pay manager Mitchell Beck (Ben Bode) at first for a deposit, but he allows him to buy the store for himself. Also starring Debi Mazar as Jane and Coyote Shivers as Berko. Besides the up and coming stars Tyler and a more overshadowing Zellweger appearing, Cochrane is really good as the sarcastic and near brooding at times teen, and Caulfield has his moments as the snobbish and despised disappearing pop star. What I really liked about this teen movie besides the great cast and let's pull together attitude was the soundtrack, including The Buggles' Video Killed The Radio Star, Edwyn Collins' A Girl Like You and The Flying Lizards' Money (That's What I Want), a good fun comedy drama.

The concept of stories not matching, despite their common facts, is one of the truths of truth's impossibility. This is the core and the fame of this somewhat forced movie.Rashomon demands, and rewards, thinking. Each of the four main accounts are reflections of the needs of the teller. While there are some traditionally Japanese issues (of honor, both from a male and female perspective), non-Japanese audiences can get it, too. There are mannerisms that are not only Japanese (and therefore foreign to others) but are old-fashioned even for contemporary audiences, kind of like watching Robin Hood, where it takes a little getting used to the style. The sword fights, in particular, seem oddly incompetent in fighting terms. But not at all in cinema terms--they are films with amazing beauty.Kurosawa always found camera operators with real vigor and visual finesse (both!) playing with shadows and light, and moving with a three dimensional logic to the figures in the space. You can, in a movie, like this, almost turn off the subtitles and just watch, and if you lose the details, you get the overall power of it all. It is traditionally beautiful with all the shadows and light, and is also compositionally strong, even as it moves through space.

However, if you understand the video game series and appreciate it, this is an enjoyable action\/martial arts flick.The film starts off with Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, and Sonya are chosen to compete in the martial arts tournament, Mortal Kombat, by Raiden, to prevent the Outworld from winning their 10th MK tournament and conquering Earthrealm. While Liu Kang and Sonya have legitimate reasons for entering the tournament (revenge for lost brother and partner, respectively), Johnny Cage is just a selfish asshole looking to disprove media rumors of him being a fake.The characters in this movie are portrayed fairly well. As stated, Johnny Cage is a selfish asshole who fails at hitting on Sonya. This was a letdown as Johnny Cage was my favorite fighter as a kid because he wore sunglasses. Sonya is a dedicated special forces soldier who takes her job seriously. Liu Kang is a Bruce Lee clone who is sort of a dick to Johnny Cage, and seems to be the main focus of the film.The chosen actors are actually rather fitting, with the exception of Liu Kang actor Robin Shou whose hairstyle is ridiculous and looks nothing like classic Liu Kang.The film itself is incredibly cheesy and over-the-top, not unlike the video games. The violence is surprisingly low and nobody performs any fatalities with the exception of Shang Tsung. Scorpion's toasty fatality appears but fails to actually kill anyone. While it is lacking in fatalities, the characters' special moves do make appearances, such as Johnny Cage's ball breaker, Liu Kang's bicycle kick, and Sonya's legcrotchgrabstrangle.The fights are decently choreographed and look very MK-esquire complete with impossible yet hilarious-looking stunts and cheesy effects. Something I noticed is that there is an excessive amount of GRUNTING AND SCREAMING, particularly from that annoying bastard Liu Kang.You won't find any of the MK2 fighters in this film although it is certainly referenced a few times. I actually like that they stuck with the original MK cast because some of the new MK2 characters kind of sucked, and Johnny Cage, Liu Kang, and Sonya are fan favorites despite Liu Kang being infamous having the worst fatality in the series next to Stryker's stupid taser fatality.The story is present but you won't really care unless you are one of the aforementioned retards who is expecting a serious martial arts movie. MK is loaded with humor that will be enjoyed by fans, both new and old, and to be fair the whole tournament\/Outworld backstory does make sense in the MK universe. I must note that the term Flawless Victory is used after like every freaking fight despite both parties sustaining a decent amount of hits. It got annoying after a while, and is proof that the script writer had never played MK in his entire life and had a very loose grasp on the English language.Overall, Mortal Kombat is an enjoyable experience for fans of the series, with its cheesy effects and story tying in perfectly with the game series. The fighting is choreographed with great consideration to the movesets in the games and the personalities of the characters, while they may be different from what our minds had to conjure up as children, are understandable and fitting. If you played MK, see it. If not, play MK dammit.
