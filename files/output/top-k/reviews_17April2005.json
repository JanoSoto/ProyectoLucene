The film opens with a scene of a previous victim being chased by Jason wearing his sackcloth over his head. We have a brief flashback sequence with Betsy Palmer as the disembodied Mrs. Vorhees and then cut to the present as a van full of teens, soon to be the cattle for Jason's slaughterhouse by the lake, drive into the woods where a girl was once attacked by Jason but survived. She has let two years pass and feels compelled to make herself stay at this cabin - even though the body of the murderer Jason was never found! This movie is just as futile and pathetic as its previous sources, but, because it thinks it is doing something innovative with 3D special effects, it is all the more laborious to sit through. Those special effects - we get juggling fruit, a yo-yo, a spear, a pitchfork(both ends), a fake snake head, an eyeball out of socket and one in, and several other cheap ways of utilizing this once-thought dead art form - the 3D method. The cast is nothing great in any way. No one really is an actor. Cliché characters are in vogue though in this third installment the older (and I mean MUCH older) boyfriend of the girl driven away two years ago, the two potheads smoking and sleeping all the time, the trio of bad youths out to settle a score, and, my favourite, the fat, unappealing kid who acts like he is dead with blood and an ax in his head just to get the attention he so desperately craves. The murders are robotic, and there is no real compassion or feeling to be generated toward any - ANY - of the characters. It is so very sad that a movie like this, a sequel to a barely superior film, could help keep the sequels churning out. This film should have ended it all. It really sucks! Oh, one last thing - at least in this film Jason finds his hockey mask. Big Deal!

No matter what comes after it, Tombstone, The Missing, or Wyatt Erp, Unforgiven has the final word. Not that I wouldn't characterize those films as Westerns, but the spirit of Unforgiven, from the opening shot of the house with the scrawny tree and lonely grave, to the end which returns there, is imbued with the finality of a spent genre. The feelings evoked are ambivalent and distant, much like the characters within Unforgiven itself. Perhaps Clint Eastwood's genius lies partially in that he doesn't allow for us to mourn. It wouldn't be western to cry because a story-form is over, it wouldn't be leather to empathize for a broken man who doesn't want your sympathy, it wouldn't be spurs to despair about the implacable and corrupt forces of life which turn men like William Munny into killers. Clint Eastwood presents to the audience the most distorted configuration of the western; the most disfigured example of a genre whose classical conventions were untouchable and sacrosanct. We have no heroes and no villains, only a protagonist and a puffed up sheriff who thinks he's doing the right thing (and does in fact have more moral vision than the dried out killer) The movie itself is riddled with identity crises, the killer has turned into a farmer and a father, the young gunslinger is a virgin to bloodletting, the sheriff shows signs of being a slave master, and the innocent one gets it first and gets it dirty. Gone are the days of the Magnificent 7 where one rode into town, rallied the brave cowpokes with shiny silver pistols, and dispatched an easily recognizable enemy. Gone even are the days of Bonnie and Clyde where gunslingers were attractive and fascinating to the audience, exuding flair, charisma, and sparking the imagination. They were legends; William Munny is a sad bit of history. He is presented with deadpan honesty, not as a caricatured Tarantino assassin, or a misunderstood old man who has atoned for past wrongs. He is a broken human person, so lost along the moral frontier that the only compass he can grasp is more killing. Throughout the movie, we are reminded again and again of the stark contrast Unforgiven stands in to most other Westerns, by the obsequious scribe W. W. Beauchamp. He was the one who wrote the John Wayne stories, (the ones with ethical clarity at least). He was the one who coined phrases like high-noon and hot lead. In Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood, takes apart the classical western narrative piece by piece allowing the audience to inspect the illusion. Characters like English Bob are unscrupulous frauds, ladies in distress are revenge bent whores, and old men really don't ever change for the better. They become that way when sensationalized by hack storytellers like Beauchamp. And when the only character materializes who seems to at least fit the description of gunslinger, Munny is so empty and hopelessly unheroic that we begin to reconcile ourselves to the end of the Western. Where else is there to go? We understand how the old stories were crafted thanks to the insider's view provided by Beauchamp, and what's left is a craggy faced cadaver with a dead wife, a dead friend, and two forgotten children.Every character within Unforgiven inhabits a gray zone that clouds the audiences's ability to easily categorize them as good or evil. We are forced to come to a more nuanced understanding of each as a human being with redeeming as well as corrupt qualities. The two cowboys committed a horrendous crime by knifing the prostitute, but did they deserve death, especially the young one, who didn't do the knifing, clearly felt remorse, and tried to make a peace offering? The whores are right to demand justice, but do they ever take into account the wishes of the victim, who if anything seems to strike some romantic sparks with the young cowboy. By the film's end, they are bloodthirsty sirens screaming at the body of the dead young cowboy. The sheriff Little Bill, compounds the opening crime by allowing it to go unpunished, but later exposes English Bob and tries to keep people from getting killed--(is he protecting unrepentant criminals, or is he allowing old wounds to heal?) And of course there's Munny himself, who won't pay to touch a woman but will kill prolifically for a purpose that is murky at best. By Unforgiven's end, the audience feels alienated from characters and message. The conclusion of William Munny's life is narrated by a cold, impersonal voice that labels him a scoundrel, but doesn't care enough to waste much breath condemning him. We are left with the image of the homestead, the center and heart of the Western film, where man attempted to master the wildness within his environment and himself. This house is empty and abandoned, its only companion the forlorn grave memorializing a genre which has passed away.

Not only were these movies extravaganza's they sometimes had little gimmicks to go along with them. Kind of like the old smell-o-vision gimmicks. If I remember correctly Earthquake had something that made it feel like the movie theater was shaking, Rollarcoster had something to make you feel you were actually on a Rollarcoster. Airplane of course was the first of these type of disaster movies and Earthquake was the grandest but after all of these years Towering Inferno is the one that holds up the best. Airplane really fell apart because of all of the crazy sequels. One actually had the George Kennedy character who started off as a airplane grounds worker as a Pilot! THen there was the Airplane\/Posiden one where the airplane actually fell into the water. The Posiden Adventure was good when it came out but it was not that exciting after the first half. The usual battle of wills and the obligatory young kid who holds the solution. Then the sequel. It goes on. But the Towering Inferno was really scary to me. I hear that dying in a fire is the worst way to go. The scene where Susan Flannery and Robert Wagner see a fire is right at their door is scary. THe phones are down and eventually both die with nowhere to go. Then we have the basis of the movie IMHO that buildings are being built too tall. In the late 70's I worked in the World Trade Center for a summer. I will go on record and say they were always a eyesore to me. Two very ugly monoliths in downtown Manhattan which is a very nice old area of the city. In any case I worked on one of the middle floors. I hated it. I previously seen the Towering Inferno and was affected by the what happened in the movie. People were not going to get out of that building no matter what. One of my good friends actually turned down a big job in 1995 because the offices were up too high and she had saw the movie and it affected her too..all those years later. Turned out to have saved her life. Because it was for that company Marsh which most of the employees died! People complain about not too much development of the characters in the movie. I say that is fine. I was sick of seeing Charlton Heston involved with some women 40 years too young for him while he is cheating on his wife. Or Dean Martin involved with some stewardess. Even Pilot George Kennedy love life. I didn't care if any of them died. Those disaster movies was all about the disaster and the sound effects not the characters. What about Ava Gardner playing Lorene Greens daughter in Earthquake! We weren't suppose to care about those folks. It was just stunt casting where a lot of actors could pick up a paycheck for a few days work. And in the 70's the movie goers understood that. But in Towering Inferno we have 2 popular actors in their prime in main roles. Cool Paul Newman and cooler Steve McQueen. Unlike Airlplane and Earthquake in which well known actors were in the lead but they were way past their heyday. Then you have Wiliam Holden who even though was a older actor was in a renewal of his career with Network plus he was having a big love affair with Stephanie Powers at the time and Faye Dunaway was a major actress. Newman is the architect of the building and McQueen the firefighter. You also have Richard Chamberlin playing the villain who cut costs in making the building. He was excellent and over the top like a true villain should be. The fire was terrifying and it continued until the very end of the movie. Unlike Earthquake which only takes place for a few minutes..the rest of the movie is about foolishness like Victoria Principle being attacked by a maniac. Walter Mattheu sitting in a bar and Charlton looking for his girlfriend. In Towering Inferno the danger was always right there with nowhere to go. Yes it does have the obligatory scene with the 2 children in peril but it is not a big plot device. Jennifer Jones and Fred Astaire actually have a few lines and we see him dancing a little. I did care about what happened to him and Jennifer Jones because the writers of the movie realized since the movie was about putting out a fire and people being trapped they should give these folks who have to sit around a story. Plus Jones plays a heroic character. I cared about what happened to Paul Newman because he was a good guy who was stabbed on the back by Richard Chamberlin and I cared about William Holden who I thought was a bad guy until he found out that the building was really a fire trap caused by his good old son in law. And I cared about Steve McQueen because he putting his life in danger to save people and he was not there just as a prop but in the whole movie. To me the stunt casting was done with the lesser known like OJ Simpson. Even he was OK. The solution was a simple one where I wondered why they hadn't thought of it before. But it was exciting because it involved detonating something and having 3 minutes to get out of a burning room. I am not going to say what happens but it will have you at the edge of your seats. This was the crown jewel of the 70's disaster movies .

But in Towering Inferno we have 2 popular actors in their prime in main roles. Cool Paul Newman and cooler Steve McQueen. Unlike Airlplane and Earthquake in which well known actors were in the lead but they were way past their heyday. Then you have Wiliam Holden who even though was a older actor was in a renewal of his career with Network plus he was having a big love affair with Stephanie Powers at the time and Faye Dunaway was a major actress. Newman is the architect of the building and McQueen the firefighter. You also have Richard Chamberlin playing the villain who cut costs in making the building. He was excellent and over the top like a true villain should be. The fire was terrifying and it continued until the very end of the movie. Unlike Earthquake which only takes place for a few minutes..the rest of the movie is about foolishness like Victoria Principle being attacked by a maniac. Walter Mattheu sitting in a bar and Charlton looking for his girlfriend. In Towering Inferno the danger was always right there with nowhere to go. Yes it does have the obligatory scene with the 2 children in peril but it is not a big plot device. Jennifer Jones and Fred Astaire actually have a few lines and we see him dancing a little. I did care about what happened to him and Jennifer Jones because the writers of the movie realized since the movie was about putting out a fire and people being trapped they should give these folks who have to sit around a story. Plus Jones plays a heroic character. I cared about what happened to Paul Newman because he was a good guy who was stabbed on the back by Richard Chamberlin and I cared about William Holden who I thought was a bad guy until he found out that the building was really a fire trap caused by his good old son in law. And I cared about Steve McQueen because he putting his life in danger to save people and he was not there just as a prop but in the whole movie. To me the stunt casting was done with the lesser known like OJ Simpson. Even he was OK. The solution was a simple one where I wondered why they hadn't thought of it before. But it was exciting because it involved detonating something and having 3 minutes to get out of a burning room. I am not going to say what happens but it will have you at the edge of your seats.

Not only were these movies extravaganza's they sometimes had little gimmicks to go along with them. Kind of like the old smell-o-vision gimmicks. If I remember correctly Earthquake had something that made it feel like the movie theater was shaking, Rollarcoster had something to make you feel you were actually on a Rollarcoster. Airplane of course was the first of these type of disaster movies and Earthquake was the grandest but after all of these years Towering Inferno is the one that holds up the best. Airplane really fell apart because of all of the crazy sequels. One actually had the George Kennedy character who started off as a airplane grounds worker as a Pilot! THen there was the Airplane\/Posiden one where the airplane actually fell into the water. The Posiden Adventure was good when it came out but it was not that exciting after the first half. The usual battle of wills and the obligatory young kid who holds the solution. Then the sequel. It goes on. But the Towering Inferno was really scary to me. I hear that dying in a fire is the worst way to go. The scene where Susan Flannery and Robert Wagner see a fire is right at their door is scary. THe phones are down and eventually both die with nowhere to go. Then we have the basis of the movie IMHO that buildings are being built too tall. In the late 70's I worked in the World Trade Center for a summer. I will go on record and say they were always a eyesore to me. Two very ugly monoliths in downtown Manhattan which is a very nice old area of the city. In any case I worked on one of the middle floors. I hated it. I previously seen the Towering Inferno and was affected by the what happened in the movie. People were not going to get out of that building no matter what. One of my good friends actually turned down a big job in 1995 because the offices were up too high and she had saw the movie and it affected her too..all those years later. Turned out to have saved her life. Because it was for that company Marsh which most of the employees died! People complain about not too much development of the characters in the movie. I say that is fine. I was sick of seeing Charlton Heston involved with some women 40 years too young for him while he is cheating on his wife. Or Dean Martin involved with some stewardess. Even Pilot George Kennedy love life. I didn't care if any of them died. Those disaster movies was all about the disaster and the sound effects not the characters.

better films, this is the one that catapulted Jim Jarmusch to the forefront of obscure American cinema in the 1980's, and aside from that fact; it's a hell of a lot of fun, and fans of Jarmusch, and just fans of obscure cool cinema in general will find lots to like about it. Treading a line between a classic prison movie and an odd comedy, Down by Law works on several levels. The premise of the film is simple, as we follow three rather different convicts that end up in the same cell in a penitentiary. Despite this being a simple base for a movie, Jim Jarmusch really makes the best of his premise and the three characters he has created to inhabit the jail cell are all unique enough to each other in order to make sure that the film is always interesting, and that the characters have a good chemistry with one another, so that the dialogue flows freely and that it's quirky nature is able to be revved up to the top.Tom Waits, John Lurie and Roberto Benigni take the lead three roles and although the former two actors are no doubt good in their roles, as usual it is Benigni that steals the show. His over the top style fits his over the top character like a glove and although Benigni isn't the sort of actor that can adapt to many different roles; when he's got one that fits him, he's pretty much unbeatable. The film's plot starts out slow, and the first half hour in which two of the three leads are introduced isn't all that exciting. It's when the three men get put inside that Down by Law really starts, and every minute from then on is a pleasure. Like he would with Dead Man nine years later, Jarmusch has opted to film Down by Law in a very stark black and white, which, also like Dead Man, increases the surrealism and also helps the film in it's bid to beat the thin plot line with a very potent visual complexity, which will delight fans of this sort of movie. On the whole, Down by Law is an excellent example of offbeat US film-making and I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

He must get from Point A to Point B. As the movie progresses and he makes his way towards his ex-wife's house, we see that some of life's simple things become more important to him. We see him enter a fast food restaurant and order a breakfast meal, only to be told that he is a few minutes late and they won't take his order for that meal. What takes place in the following scene is Foster's drastic solution to a simple problem, giving new meaning to the old Burger King slogan  Have It Your Way. The plot has Foster go through a series of everyday challenging situations and solving them in an unconventional way. Actor Fredrick Forrest's performance as Nick the racist surplus store-owner is exceptional and convincing. Joel Schumacher does an impeccable job directing this particular scene. In fact, the entire film shows Schumacher's expertise in the directing field. As the movie progresses, you will get to know the character of Foster, and even though you realize he is no longer rational and on a rampage, you find yourself rooting for him as he deals with some of the mutants of today's society. Robert Duval is superb in portraying Prendergast, the Los Angeles's detective who tries to figure out which direction D-Fens is headed. Falling Down's writer Ebbe Roe Smith shows how Foster and Prendergast each deal with the future of their lives. He allows us to feel the frustration of becoming obsolete and dispensable. Keep an open mind and you will see this movie represents real life feelings in today's world. When viewed from that perspective, it can be a more rewarding film than what is portrayed at surface level. This movie provides good entertainment and is well worth seeing.

Hepburn had asked that Tracy and Gable be her leading men but looking at this film, for all the chemistry that Tracy and Hepburn ever had and all the talent Gable had for acting in comedic farce, I can't imagine either of them playing any of the two leading males that are after Tracy Lord's love. That Grant plays C. K. Dexter Dex Haven so perfectly well, and his opening scene with Hepburn is the stuff of movie history, only rectifies that. That Stewart embodies the essence of MaCauley Connors as if he were in fact the character just proves how strong an actor he was, and one who didn't have to resort to extreme emoting to make his point. That the three make for the most memorable romantic triangle in film history is probably an understatement.Of course the story is old. Of course the character motivations are dated. THE PHILADELPHIA STORY belongs perpetually in its own time, the late 1930s (when it was written and performed on stage), when sensibilities towards the rich were much different than they are today. The whole bit of the society princess being humbled to become a better person is really a thinly disguised fable that tells the story of how Hepburn, who had made such a powerful debut in film with her appearance in A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT, quickly established a personality so abrasive (she wouldn't do interviews or cheesecake, it is rare to find a Hepburn picture from the 30s where she is dolled up) that it translated into box-office bomb after bomb and by 1938 she was all but washed up. Tracy Lord's return to humankind is really the story of Hepburn's return to the world of acting even if she retained her abrasiveness to her last days. And of course, who better suited for this role than Hepburn herself, who had done the role on stage and by the time Hollywood came (reluctantly) calling -- they wanted Norma Shearer, who in my opinion could have carried it off but differently -- knew the part in and out (and owned the rights to the play in a shrewd move). We can't imagine anyone else playing this role, which is why when the inevitable musical remake was made in 1956 with Grace Kelly in the lead, it misfires, and no amount of Cole Porter could save it even if it was a commercial success.But regardless being dated, maybe too talky for some, what a movie. To see the utter craziness of the plot which backfires at least twice and creates a sense of really not knowing what will happen next (even when we know on a certain level Hepburn and Grant will wind up in each other's arms) is the stuff romantic comedy is made of. Oscar nominated in almost every major category, it won two -- Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay -- but over the years it's grown beyond statuettes and remains as one of the greatest films of the 20th Century.

It's a movie that almost seems to promise hilarity yet strangely the movie isn't that funny. In fact it's not that interesting either though certainly not unwatchable. Yet for some reason, even though this movie contains two warm likable charismatic leads, the movie never picks up steam.I think there were a few things that I did not like here, one being the playing out of a very funny premise. But the movie, even though it's not that long, gets rather irritating. The whole thing centers on O'Donnell proposing to various women and while it was fun at first, none of the women are in their scenes long enough to make a strong comedic impression and Zelwegger herself, while coming across as charming and sweet as always, is somewhat underused. Her main point seems to be moaning about her problems with Jimmy. In the meantime, the viewer can't make up their mind whether Jimmy is a nice guy or a jerk, mainly because he keeps switching back and forth and we never get to see him one aspect of his personality for to long.The movie becomes a bit tedious as well as Jimmy races around in search of new ex girlfriends to propose to so he can get his inheritance. It should be laugh out loud funny but isn't. I was moderately interested in how it turned out but also wanted it to end. It was a given that these two would wind up together anyway.The movie didn't seem to contain enough truly hilarious material and with a premise such as this, it should have, because this is a great situation on which to build a romantic comedy.

Now if any scene had the potential to be UTTERLY HILARIOUS it was that one. But it doesn't happen. The brides aren't funny, their annoying, and by that time one just wants them to stop chasing the groom so he can marry Renee Zelwegger and the movie can end. It's another scene that should be hysterical but just fell flat.In closing, this is watchable but a bit disappointing and not very funny though the end is very romantic and big fans of Zelwegger may want to check it out, that was my main reason for doing so.

I had heard about this film for years and was really excited when I rented it, but was thoroughly unsatisfied by the product. Where do I begin...The setup is very compelling. I loved seeing Jane as a talentless brat and Blanche as the quiet older sister who grows up to become the hottest actress in Hollywood while Jane turns into a drunk laughingstock. Then when it looks like Jane cripples Blanche, I was horrified and my eyes were glued to the screen. It was all downhill from there.First of all, I have to take issue with Bette Davis's performance. I know that's sacrilege, but I couldn't stand her. I'm not sure how much of the blame should be divided among her, the screenplay and the director but her character was so over-the-top that it just became cartoonish at times. Some would of course argue that that's to the film's benefit, because they love the black comedy. I've heard that the film is a favorite of drag queens, and I can see why. But I think it severely undermines the film's merits as a HORROR movie, which is how it's almost always qualified. If they wanted to go the black comedy route, they should have gone farther with that b\/c I thought as they did it things just didn't mix. Davis's caricature was such a glaring contrast to the sincere performance of Joan Crawford, as well as pretty much everything else in the movie.Speaking of Crawford, though, I found her character mind-boggling at times. So it was established that Blanche has been trapped by Jane for all the years since the accident. Why couldn't she just leave? Surely the top actress in Hollywood would be able to afford personal care! Some fans might say that's answered at the end of the movie, but I'll come back to that. When Jane was torturing her that much, why couldn't Blanche at least call the police and say she was being held against her will? It's mentioned during the movie that Jane's started going insane, so maybe it hasn't been going on that long, but if Blanche doesn't even get any visitors ever, she must sense something's wrong. And then when Blanche goes through the INCREDIBLE ordeal of getting to the phone downstairs when she's home alone after Jane's taken out her phone, why doesn't she use that to CALL THE POLICE! Some might say she was concerned about Jane and wanted to get a doctor for her, but I'm sorry, when a character's such a one-dimensional doormat, I stop caring about here. If the ending is supposed to justify all this, well I think whatever Blanche did was more than made up for by the endless abuse Jane subject her to, and I don't see how anyone could reasonably argue otherwise.When Elvira found Blanche, I was relieved thinking at least the movie was going somewhere now with Blanche about to be rescued. BUT WHY DID ELVIRA LEAVE THE HAMMER OUTSIDE WITH THAT PSYCHO RIGHT NEXT TO IT? Gee, who thought Jane would bash her head in? I was again happy when Edwin found Blanche, but he just ran off stammering! What the hell was the point of him even being in the movie? I'm thinking there just wasn't enough story to fill out a film otherwise. I thought he was just an annoying fat guy, and he turned out to be an annoying heartless fat guy. How did Victor Buono get an Oscar nomination for that? Why am I not surprised that people never saw or heard of Mr. Buono again after this movie? While the movie had glaring flaws, I thought it would at least be great to see Blanche saved and Jane killed at the end. But instead, one of the worst twists in history was thrown at us!

BUT WHY DID ELVIRA LEAVE THE HAMMER OUTSIDE WITH THAT PSYCHO RIGHT NEXT TO IT? Gee, who thought Jane would bash her head in? I was again happy when Edwin found Blanche, but he just ran off stammering! What the hell was the point of him even being in the movie? I'm thinking there just wasn't enough story to fill out a film otherwise. I thought he was just an annoying fat guy, and he turned out to be an annoying heartless fat guy. How did Victor Buono get an Oscar nomination for that? Why am I not surprised that people never saw or heard of Mr. Buono again after this movie? While the movie had glaring flaws, I thought it would at least be great to see Blanche saved and Jane killed at the end. But instead, one of the worst twists in history was thrown at us! The only things the film had in its favor at any point were a sympathetic heroine and a contemptible villain. So what do they do at the end? Make Blanche responsible for her own trouble and Jane a lovable loon! Even if Blanche paralyzed herself, Jane kept her a prisoner, starved her, beat her, and berated her endlessly. And let's not forget SHE MURDERED ELVIRA! I'm not buying the mental illness excuse the movie tries-Jane was a monster her whole life and apparently towards the end became a monster unable to handle how pitiful she was. The pathetic attempt at shocking viewers just made me wish I'd never met either sister! Oh, and by the way-Jane's giddy dancing at the end? A RIPOFF of the INFINITELY superior Sunset Boulevard!!!!!!!

She works out a deal with the police to help them catch her boss, Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) in return from her freedom. Ordell has $500,000 in Mexico that Jackie is to bring to him. But there are a lot of people who want that money - the police, Ordell, Ordell's girlfriend, and even Jackie. Who is going to scam who to get their hands on the money? - Until I saw Jackie Brown, I had a hard time believing that any Tarantino film could top Kill Bill. Now, I'm not so sure. I need to revisit Kill Bill to be sure. Jackie Brown is a more grown-up film than most of his other works. It doesn't try as hard to be cool like Pulp Fiction and it doesn't try to be as violent as Kill Bill. Oh, the coolness and violence is there, but Jackie Brown is more about the story and characters than either of those films. It's a more subdued film that is a nice change of pace from what I had expected from Tarantino.- For me, Jackie Brown works because of two things - a good script and excellent acting. I'll start with the script. Tarantino may be one of the most self-absorbed jerks on the planet, but he certainly can write a script. The characters in Jackie Brown talk like real people. They're not like a lot of movie characters that seem so unreal you are unable imagine beyond the confines of the movie. These people are smart, clever, and capable of showing real emotion. It doesn't hurt any that Tarantino had good source material in the form of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch.- As for the acting, Pam Grier is AWESOME. I've seen a few of her movies from the 70s, but now I'm inspired to track them all down. She's cool, tough, vulnerable, and afraid - all at the same time. Kudos to Tarantino for taking a chance on an actress without the big Hollywood name. When you add Robert De Niro, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda, and the rest, you've got an all-star cast that, for once, lives up to the hype.- Another thing I've always enjoyed about Tarantino's movies is the music. The soundtrack to Jackie Brown may be the best.

It's supposed to be funny, but it just clunks along like a tank with lead caterpillar treads, and it goes nowhere fast. Apparently Lester and the Salkinds really didn't understand how slapstick stunts work, and they should have been locked in a room with a copy of Monty Python and the Holy Grail until they got it right.The movie does pick up a little bit from there, and there are a few good bits that save it from being utter crap the fight between 'good' and 'bad' Superman in the junkyard, with its denouement where Clark undoes his shirt to reveal the original hue of the costume, is quite nice. Some of the moments with Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang are decent, too - I'm not her biggest fan, but she suits the role of the small town girl that Clark left behind and fleshes it out well.Everything else until the very end is, well, bad. Going from Terence Stamp and Gene Hackman to people like Robert Vaughn and Richard Pryor is a terrible, terrible decision and completely undercuts any sense of real portent or menace that a decent villain is meant to have in a film like this. You can't believe for a moment that Vaughn's lightweight character and his nitwit entourage would be any kind of match for the Man Of Steel, and Pryor's role, even as an innocent dupe, just isn't what this film needs - he is completely out of place here. Give me the Pryor from BiCentennial ****** instead; THAT character belongs in a Superman film. There is just a bit of style and flair in the final showdown scene with the Super Computer where the villains are transformed into nightmarish robot slaves and then Superman is lashed repeatedly with huge energy bolts and pulled helplessly inside the guts of the computer - you actually get a sense of conflict and drama, and the clever way Supes saves the day by using his smarts and cunning almost saves the film.But it's not enough. 75% of the film has the same problems as the opening sequence - it just doesn't work or hold together. Unlike the first two films, the stuff that is supposed to be funny simply isn't, and most of the stuff that is supposed to be dramatic is spoiled by bad timing or misjudged performances that ruin any sense of involvement in the film.Rent the tape or DVD once so you can fast-forward to one or two of the scenes with O'Toole, the fight in the junkyard, and the fight with the Super Computer.

My theatrical group is going to present it in my city and I'm very familiar to the songs by now; and to all what the musical is. I like being on it because Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber are responsible for the music and the lyrics. I did Jesus Christ Superstar last year, and it was great. Evita includes more drama and similar melodies, but the essence is still there.Now, one thing is a theatrical musical, and another one is a movie musical. Yes, they're both musicals, but not the same; even when the movie is based on the play. We're talking about the movie now, but we can't forget about the play. There are some things the movie has wrong, and I'm not going to specify them for two reasons because we can pass them (they're not ruining the plot) and because it's cinema. Things are not happening in a rectangular stage, where everything is limited. Cinema takes the advantage to play with scenery, and puts everyone in every place at any time. That's why we are sometimes fascinated by this movie, that takes us (it took me) to those places we can never imagine on a theater stage.This movie looks beautiful, that's for sure. I had to see it to get some things about my character, because it isn't just about the songs, there are characters, like in every play and every movie. There's a contradiction about the three main actors, and their roles (not their characters) in the film. Madonna knows how to sing, but doesn't know how to act. Antonio Banderas knows how to act, but doesn't know how to sing; the same happens with Jonathan Pryce. However, they were all recognized, and they deserved it, because they did better than expectations. I mean, Madonna (Evita) won a Golden Globe (even if that's not very important). I never knew how she arrived at this role, but when she became the star, she took advantage of it; she sang the songs in lower keys (tones) because she couldn't sing them higher. But anyway, singing is what she does best, and adding the expressions, she got it.Antonio Banderas (Ché) sang in the original tones, and add a lot to his character. He deserved better for his performance. Jonathan Pryce (Juan Perón) was the actor that amazed me the most, achieving a perfect balance between anger and emotion. He could also sing the songs! The rest of the cast is barely noticeable, but always in the right positions for each scene.The scenes, I said, are beautifully constructed and realized. Alan Parker and his team worked at their best for the editing and the cinematography. The music (and the lyrics, of course), the reason for the existence of the film in first place, makes the movie worth watching. You Must Love Me turned out to be a beautiful song, in my opinion.But please, let's establish one thing by all means, this is not a masterpiece.

Yes, they're both musicals, but not the same; even when the movie is based on the play. We're talking about the movie now, but we can't forget about the play. There are some things the movie has wrong, and I'm not going to specify them for two reasons because we can pass them (they're not ruining the plot) and because it's cinema. Things are not happening in a rectangular stage, where everything is limited. Cinema takes the advantage to play with scenery, and puts everyone in every place at any time. That's why we are sometimes fascinated by this movie, that takes us (it took me) to those places we can never imagine on a theater stage.This movie looks beautiful, that's for sure. I had to see it to get some things about my character, because it isn't just about the songs, there are characters, like in every play and every movie. There's a contradiction about the three main actors, and their roles (not their characters) in the film. Madonna knows how to sing, but doesn't know how to act. Antonio Banderas knows how to act, but doesn't know how to sing; the same happens with Jonathan Pryce. However, they were all recognized, and they deserved it, because they did better than expectations. I mean, Madonna (Evita) won a Golden Globe (even if that's not very important). I never knew how she arrived at this role, but when she became the star, she took advantage of it; she sang the songs in lower keys (tones) because she couldn't sing them higher. But anyway, singing is what she does best, and adding the expressions, she got it.Antonio Banderas (Ché) sang in the original tones, and add a lot to his character. He deserved better for his performance. Jonathan Pryce (Juan Perón) was the actor that amazed me the most, achieving a perfect balance between anger and emotion. He could also sing the songs! The rest of the cast is barely noticeable, but always in the right positions for each scene.The scenes, I said, are beautifully constructed and realized. Alan Parker and his team worked at their best for the editing and the cinematography. The music (and the lyrics, of course), the reason for the existence of the film in first place, makes the movie worth watching. You Must Love Me turned out to be a beautiful song, in my opinion.But please, let's establish one thing by all means, this is not a masterpiece.

It turned out to be a lot more, Hilarious is the word I'm looking for. Basic plot revolves around 2 collage students, both roommates, one is smart(Josh) and wants to do the best he can in his exams, he studies and doesn't party. The other(Cooper) is intent on doing no work, doesn't go to his classes, likes his bong and late night party's. Cooper slowly pulls Josh into his world of Partys and Beer and it starts to show on his Collage work. Then comes the wacky loophole that if they have a roommate that commits suicide then there other roommates automatically pass there exams. Now, Enter the wacky roommates, handpicked by Cooper and Josh, that are all on the edge. The rest will have your sides splitting. All the Characters play their parts well, especially the insane roommates, but none more so than Cliff. He steals the show and whenever the film was getting boring and uninteresting, he would pop back up and bring this hilarious comedy back to life. Typical Teenage comedy packed with laughs but a rather far fetched plot, Cliff's wacky ways of dealing with cop car chases and putting out hair fires make this stand out above most.

I doubt the IMDb grosses are all that up-to-date or include video and DVD sales, ftm. But, taking their info at face value, $30 Million's not a bad return on $340K, eh!? Well, I saw this the week it came out -- Easy Bummer I called it! -- and it's good to see that so many young people are discovering it (and many other great films from the 60s & 70s; I was just checking out The Taking of Pelham 123, too!), as it (et al) should be mandatory\/desired viewing for everyone who loves films... and the America that we thought it was... for awhile, anyway (until JFK, RFK,& MLK were offed)! Of course, it's not a great story per se, but it is an accurate reflection that (fairly large) subculture and of what a majority of Americans felt -- and still do -- towards hippies and\/or others who are considered undesirable by virtue of the fact that they simply march to a different drummer or lifestyle or political\/religious opinion or p.o.v.... like believing in true freedom and what our Founding Fathers intended! Yes, it's a leisurely paced film...these guys were drug dealers (which most hippies were not), but they were MJ stoners, so that's an accurate reflection of their (desired) casual road trip, as is their passiveness in the face of abuse. Pretty much every film fan knows about The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy, The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Star Wars, Jaws, Network, and many other great films of that era... but here are a some more to check outThe Taking of Pelham 123 (1974) (Terrific crime thriller!!) Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round (1966) (Just fun!) The Last Of Sheila (1973) (Just fun!) Little Big Man (1970) (One of the great westerns!) Four Friends (1981) (Which sums up the personal emotional gestalt of the 60s & early 70s better than any other film for me!)Network (1976) is another great film with many truths. Like Easy Rider, in retrospect it seems prescient... but they were just telling it like it was (and still is; exponentially so, most unfortunately). Want to blow your mind, kiddies? Watch the coming very soon DVD, A Face In the Crowd...also about the potentially damaging power of the media. That one's from producer\/writer\/director Elia Kazan, one of the most socially conscious film makers, winner of 3 Tonys (nom'd for 7) and director of all of these highly recommended and\/or flat-out great films, of which you likely know of him for at least oneAmerica, America (1963) Wild River (1960) Baby Doll (1956) East of Eden (1955) On the Waterfront (1954) Viva Zapata! (1952) A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) Panic in the Streets (1950) Gentleman's Agreement (1947) A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945) Hey, I love that we now have CGI F\/X! I just finished watching LOTR trilogy. But unless the writer and director are Peter Jackson or similar, all HW cranks out tired remakes of old TV shows and better films in shallow-character\/storyline cotton candy flix, so... Viva la 60s & 70s! There's gold in them there times!!
