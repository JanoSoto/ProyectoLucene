Vanilla Sky at times, feels like a shot by shot remake.  Okay sure theres the extra plot lines about the seven dwarfs, and Sofia is not a mime in Vanilla Sky, but really it just has a stupid amount of similarities. Some of the camera shots appear to have been cut and pasted from Abre Los Ojos into Vanilla Sky.The Hollywood mentality behind remakes, blows me away.  Why must they do it? How can a director do a remake and not feel like they are merely a leach ripping off someone else's film.  Its the same with 'The Ring'.  Its not original, the cleverness has worn off, so why must they do it?  I believe Crowe is an extremely talented director, and some of his direction in this film is good, but really is it his at all?  Is the inspiration the same when you're recreating a film, that is not even five years old when you start filming it??  Why could he have not pooled his talents and his resources into an original screenplay.  Why a remake which is inferior in many ways to the original source?The acting for one, is extremely up and down.  Tom Cruise should never be allowed to make another movie after this.  Okay, maybe I am being a bit harsh, but his star power isn't enough to make his performance strong.  He appears muddled, and burdened by the intensity of a man torn by his nightmare.  And what about Penelope Cruz?  Was her inclusion in this film, merely a novelty, since she played the same role in the original?  Thats what it feels like because after about ten minutes, you wish she was the one in the car instead of Cameron Diaz.  Diaz is good for her brief spell, Lee shows he is one of the most underrated actors in the rotting Hollywood industry, and Russel is strong in his role.Abre Los Ojos on the other hand, has strong performances all round, particualarly from Eduardo Noriega, and Chete Lera.  The bit parts in Abre Los Ojos, such as the representative of the Cryogenic company, are better as well.  Vanilla Sky's counterpart of the Cryo rep, is like some sort of joke. A weedy little man with some sort of voice disorder - like a wisp, and a nice beatles-esqe haircut.  I don't think he could EVER convince me to buy anything, let alone immortality.The cinematography I briefly metioned before.  Occasionally it feels like you are watching Abre Los Ojos, because of the similarities in atmosphere and lighting.  However, to it's credit, Vanilla Sky does have some amazing photography.  A good example is the panorama shots over New York city, which Crowe describes as giving the feeling of a spirit falling.  However the endings Cinematography is baffling to say the least.  Why the sky is the colour it is, is beyond me.  I am guessing its meant to be mystical, spiritual, and dreamlike??  How about tacky, fake, and hideous.  That sums it up a bit better I think.Vanilla Sky, is not a good film.  However in saying that, it is far from the worst film of the year, and chances are if you haven't seen Abre Los Ojos, or you don't care that Hollywood is sucking the life out of an innovative, brilliant, SPANISH, film, you may enjoy it.  It certainly is frustrating to see such a clever, original thriller, suddenly turned into this dramatic attempt at arthouse (i think?? hell i couldn't even come close to defining it, its so messy).  Hopefully Hollywood will stop this whole remake trend, and leave the originals the way they are.  If you can't handle subtitles, then go rent something monosyllabic.  Chances are theres a new Julia Roberts flick coming out sometime soon.

I was reading everyone else's reviews and I'm wondering why this movie is receiving any praise.  I rented the movie last night and after the 106 minutes, I found myself wondering what I was just subjected to.  I'll admit that because Kirsten Dunst was in it was what had peaked my interest but this was by far her worst role to date.       The only acting that is worth any mention is Cary Elwes and Eddie Izzard, who were quite good in this film,  and thats it.  All the others were just awful.  I mean come on, Jennifer Tilly.  That voice just gets to you after a while.  She should do what she does in other movies and let her body do the acting.  But lets look at the rest of the movie.  The plot wasnt so bad but could've been much better.  Why did the director find it necessary to crank 20's music into every second of the movie?  We got that it was the 20's but there were so many countless times that there should have been a different score for serious moments and tense moments.  The two flapper girls were just bad characters, however, the lone saxophone player gets the award for the worst.  I've seen better acting in elementary school plays.      This movie is just as bad as Gosford Park.  I mean come on people open your eyes.  I think most movie critics have a bad case of the emperors new clothes.  Just because the movie had a great cast doesnt mean its any good.  I think we really want to believe that its good and that we fool ourselves into liking it when in fact the script to The Cat's Meow should have either been fixed up or kept away.

The two flapper girls were just bad characters, however, the lone saxophone player gets the award for the worst.  I've seen better acting in elementary school plays.      This movie is just as bad as Gosford Park.  I mean come on people open your eyes.  I think most movie critics have a bad case of the emperors new clothes.  Just because the movie had a great cast doesnt mean its any good.

I had been wanting to see it ever since it was still playing at the theaters.  My aunt rented it and the only thing that came out of my mouth, along with a few swear words here and there, was how I was so glad that I didn't waste my hard-earned money on such garbage.  This is the kind of film that gets everyone's attention when those clever but sneaky advertising jerks decide to air the trailer picking out the ONLY half interesting scenes in the entire film.  Man, I hate when they do that.  However, I would do it too if I were in their position.  Why wouldn't I?  Anyway, the previews looked really good; little did I know that they were extremely deceiving, and the film managed to stay at the top of the box office list for a while, so I figured that it couldn't be all bad.  Don't believe it!Aside from the terrible acting, lack of excitement, scares and intelligence, it moved at a pace that would irritate anybody, or so I thought, but being that a lot of people did like it for some reason, who knows anymore.  'Signs' also lacks...what's that thing called?  Oh, yeah, dialogue.  Was it just me or did it seem like there was absolutely no talking in this picture?  It was all show, actions, and not enough speaking.  It reminded me of 'Cast Away' in that sense, and I don't even want to get into that disaster.  So, moving along. The acting shown here is pathetic.  I know that everyone likes Mel Gibson and the guy earns up to $25 million a pic, but honestly, for what?  He looked out of it for the most part; what is Shyamalan really doing behind those cameras?  He didn't react to anything like he should have, his very few speaking parts were boring, drawn out, and a lot of them really had nothing to do with the plot itself.  Those really long monologues were unbearable. Joaquin Phoenix was just a tad better than Gibson, but still had nothing to show for it.  Another Culkin pops onto the screen and I have to say, he was probably the best actor in this film.  Most people found the young Abigail Breslin to be impressive while I found her to be purely annoying.  Oh, and the biggest laugh of all, you guessed it, the man behind this terrible project, M.

I found 'Signs' to move at a slow pace, yet it seemed to me that just as I had slipped the tape into my VCR, it wasn't only but a half hour or so after that I was finishing up the film.

That is, I expected more of a science fiction movie about robots.  And, actually, after watching the first half, I wasn't sure I wanted to see the rest.  Then, I figured out that this isn't a SciFi movie, it's a fantasy adventure, and as I followed the adventure I was drawn in!!  I was so moved by this film that I wept profusely, afterward.

The language is some of Shakespeare's most complex, yet when understood, also some of the most eloquent and beautiful ever written.The film had a lot to live up to.(This may contain plot spoilers.)In my opinion, Fishburne was an excellent Othello - brooding, jealous, suspicious, in anguish - everything I expected. He spoke the lines well and had great presence. Irene Jacob as Desdemona wasn't such a powerful character, but then was never intended to be - even in the play she was depicted as weak, although she does have her stronger characteristics, she is inherently not one of the most important or complex characters.No, for me it was, as always, Branagh, who stole the show. A wonderfully chilling performance, which left me convinced that Iago was possibly the most evil villain I have come across in any of Shakespeare's works. He shows no remorse, no emotion, but simply calculation and cruelty. He plots evil for evil's sake, and Branagh portrayed this very well. If you watch it, it's in his eyes, the way he looks at the others and at the camera - it ranges from impassivity to pure, unadulterated evil. Iago is not simply a baddie - he is a demi-devil, fuelled by nothing more than the desire to harm others. Iago seems to have no real motive, although several are given (jealousy of Othello and Desdemona, racism, hatred of Othello, anger of being passed over for promotion etc etc), but I believe that he is not intended to have a motive - he is evil simply because that is his way, and he needs no motive.Some people have criticised the film for not showing enough of Desdemona and Othello together, or that it seems odd that Iago has so much hatred for Othello and that his plan culminates so quickly. This is from the Shakespeare, where the concept of double time is used. There are two time frames, it seems, in the play, which is hard to put across in a film, but which I think worked well enough that I wasn't bothered by it. It all happens in a few days, in one time frame, but we get the impression that it takes far longer than this. This is difficult to get your head around, but it does make some kind of sense. ) Anyway, they couldn't have added bits in without adding to Shakespeare's lines, and I'd rather they didn't do that. )Overall, a very good film adaptation of a wonderfully moving and disturbing play.
