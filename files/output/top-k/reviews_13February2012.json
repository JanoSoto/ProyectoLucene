[{"date":"13 February 2012","score":"","review":" Spanish screenwriter and director Julio Medem's fourth feature film which he wrote the screenplay for, was shot in Madrid, Spain and on different locations in Finland. It tells the story about Ana and Otto, two eight-year-old children who coincidentally encounters one another in a forest outside of their school. Otto immediately falls in love with Ana who is still missing her recently deceased father and who chooses to believe that her father has gone on living inside of Otto. Ana and Otto's lives are strangely intertwined when Ana's mother Olga and Otto's father Álvaro falls in love and moves in together. Over the course of time their profound relationship grows stronger and they become lovers, but their emotional bond is disconnected when Otto becomes a pilot and begins to travel between Madrid and the Arctic Circle. This intriguing, fast-paced and finely edited fictional tale about an affectionate, secret and close to telepathic relationship which spans over several years, is a character-driven and plot-driven metaphysical drama. Told through various perspectives which shifts between the two protagonists point-of-view and a brilliant circular narrative reminiscent of those used in the films of Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996), this distinctly directed Spanish-French co-production draws two merging studies of character while examining themes such as coming-of-age, family relations, destiny, grief and love.Julio Medem's partly autobiographical story about the ambiguous nature of coincidence and love has a distinct visual style and a shifting atmosphere which is reinforced by cinematographer Gonzalo F. Berridi's beautiful cinematography, Alberto Iglesias' score and the significant use of sound. This geometric and romantic journey through the circumstantial lives of two destined lovers is a compassionately written drama with empathic and engaging acting performances by Spanish actor Najwa Nimri and Spanish actress Fele Martínez. A very moving and memorable love story which gained, among several other awards, the Turia Award for best Spanish film at the Turia Awards in 1999 and the Audience Award at the Athens International Film Festival in 2000.

The scenery is pretty much like any other wild west movie with Grand Canyon-like hills in the background, red deserts, sand and dirt. The film takes place mostly outside because there is a close link to nature.The sunlight is also represented as aggressive specially by the fact that the main character's skin is sun-burnt and dry. The story takes quite a few years to perform so the change in seasons is appreciated during the movie. The women in the film are represented as being obedient, pretty, shallow- brained and lacking of a mind of their own. They seem to leave their lives in the hands of men or destiny. They don't have any sense of control over anything. Their purpose on the film is practically ornamental the plot spins around them but they don't really have a saying or role other than being victims in need of a man who is willing to save them or marry them. In fact, their lack of activity is visible if one compares their skin complexion to the men's most women in the film are pale while men's skin is tan from being outside. The men, on the other hand, have more diverse personalities that go from aggressive machos (Ethan), to drunken yet well-intended and naive (Moze), to passionate, to kind, caring and yet incompetent (Marty). Because of this sexist nuance a modern woman might take offense in the movie because of the way they are depreciated. However it seems that the film doesn't intend to be sexist but rather tries to mimic the way women acted in that era. Nevertheless, the film does have a racist twist to it. The plot of the film seems like an awful excuse to show just how mean, cruel and savages the Indians were. They are represented as heartless, remorseless, blood-thirsty barbarians that only intend to do harm. On the other hand, the Mexicans represented during the movie are depicted as the men drinking tequila like if it were water while only being interested in earning easy money and the women doing nothing but dancing in a Spanish folklore dress while trying to seduce men. Also, it's important to mention how white people are represented as being civilized, courteous, polished and humane creating an important contrast with the other races. The way humor is used in the film is also representative. It's displayed especially when the moment of drama calls for a break. It gives the film a unique essence that helps take weight off the spectator.
