Simple art, done for the love of it, ruined by the fame and fortune you probably are not seeking anyway. Pecker gets recognition, but the ultimate sacrifice is made in the process. And the way he sees art in everything from grass stains to graffiti to his quirky neighborhood is exactly how a true artist's mind works. He adores his family even though they are clearly bizarre (maybe he loves them because of it?) He finds fun in everything, is not depressed by his surroundings but embraces it and makes it his own. He is innocent and full of wonder, and when the NYC art world threatens to corrupt him, he does not let it. Great movie, with the usual Waters weirdness. I loved it.
