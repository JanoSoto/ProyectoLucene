[{"date":"16 April 2013","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Heather Donahue decides to do a documentary about the urban legend of The Blair Witch. She takes along two other film students, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams, who are just as eager to do the project as she is. Their trip was planned to go to Maryland, interview some townsfolk, film some of the historic sites in the woods and return home. A year later their camera footage was found.Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez decided to break away from the traditional cinematography and go with a first person view of the events that take place. We actually watch the majority of the movie through Heather Donahue's eyes. It was pretty creative and went well with the story and the actors.The Blair Witch is really a feeling movie. You have to pay a lot of attention to the film and really get into the mood the scenery and actors are trying to set. There isn't any monsters, no ghosts and no gore to be seen. You have to use your imagination and focus on the feelings of the actors. Heather Donahue and the rest of the crew do some great acting to suck you in and make you really feel like you are there scared for your life right along with them. The story kinda stalls towards the end as it seemed like they added some scenes in to make the movie longer but not noticeable on your first watch through.The Blair Witch has set a precedence for this type of genre that was fun and enjoyable to watch. I recommend The Blair Witch to any fan and look forward to more movies of this genre.
