Here is a movie that has high production value in terms of its special effects, but is of low quality in regards to its character and story development. What makes Earthquake work is the fact that is in love with film-making and it is enthusiastic for the silly, low-key genre that it stems from.Earthquake is, I suppose, on paper a film that could have been a 1970s masterpiece but comes off as a 1970s cult favorite. The movie revolves around several everyday people in downtown Los Angeles on the day that a series of violent earthquakes begin to tear apart the city. Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner are a married couple whose matrimony is falling apart along with the buildings around them, George Kennedy is a troubled but goodhearted police officer, Richard Roundtree is a stunt cyclist wanting to show off his skills, Genevieve Bujold is a widow with a soft spot for Heston, John Randolph is the wearisome mayor of the city, and so on and so forth. The movie consistently cuts back and forth between their parallel story lines, meshing them together frequently, as some high-class and quite tense special effects sequences rumble the screen.That's the plot. And that's all the plot one needs and\/or expects from a movie titled Earthquake. As the simplicity of its namesake suggests, the film is low-key and quite silly and nonsensical, but this is its charm. Earthquake has some big-budget production values, but because its director Mark Robson recognizes that he has a silly story, he makes the best of it. Robson was clearly a director who loved his job and had a great time entertaining his audience. That's why Earthquake works. It makes the best of what it has, it's enthusiastic for its genre and its audience, and comes off as very, very fun to watch. Even though I really didn't care about the fates of any of these characters, I did like the way the movie would juxtapose and cut from their stories back and forth and that it made an *effort* to develop them as human beings. In so many disaster flicks and special effects extravaganzas, especially of modern times, there isn't even a fledgling attempt to make it work. Earthquake makes the best of what it has. What's more, the cast makes the best of what they have as well. The actors and actresses realize the low quality of their screenplay and embrace it with such joy and enthusiasm, that they put the movie up a few notches.There are some great special effects sequences in Earthquake. The buildings that topple apart are not constructed out of crude cardboard, but of credible models that crumble and have layers and foundations, the life-sized sets designed to fall apart are fantastic and realistic, the pyrotechnics are beautiful to look at, everything's fun to watch. What I also like is how the earthquakes show up infrequently, but when they do arrive, they go on for extended stretches of time so as to keep things moving. Unlike a modern-day disaster flick 2012, which lost a lot of momentum in its third act, Earthquake keeps things moving and is a roller coaster ride when the action begins.Do I wholeheartedly defend Earthquake as a motion picture? Not really, I suppose. It's silly and weak-minded. But I do defend it as sheer popcorn entertainment. It is in love with film-making and with the disaster movie genre and comes off as a lot of fun. This is precisely the sort of movie that I, and many people enjoy.

Animal House has been ripped off, copied or borrowed from by almost every college comedy (and many normal comedies) made since. While watching you'll see scenes from Van Wilder, Old School, Road Trip, Porky's, Accepted, and so on. The story seems like a clichéd and replayed story but that's because now, 30 years after, it is, however for its time it's very original.

Although Tim Matheson, Peter Reigert, Thomas Hulce and all the other more main characters are all funny in their own way and all give good performances this film would have been nothing without John Belushi. Belushi is more of a minor character but steals the film with his hilarious lines, facial expressions and actions. The way he chooses to deliver his lines add even more humor to the already funny writing. Animal house is one of the last comedies to come out before the 80s ruined comedies, and oddly enough it is partially Animal House's fault. I'm not saying that all 80's comedies are bad, but I feel most are. Porky's, Police Academy, Weird Science, Real Genius, etc, they're all seem to be the same style and not very funny but are still considered classics. Even the 80s comedies I do enjoy like Airplane and Caddyshack still have the same feel to them but are just funnier. Many of the films (still through the 90s and 00s) force nudity in to films where it is unnecessary and doesn't add any humor usually. Animal House sort of brought on that kind of comedy, but did it better than almost all of them, even the nude scenes are funny, not just there to bring guys in. Its truly a influential film, let alone comedy. Although it may be the responsible for inspiring some terrible films over the years, it has also inspired some of the best.

When I first saw it I thought it to be amongst the most beautiful films I'd ever seen, and nearly 25 years later, think so still. While nominated and winning many international awards, The Mission was mostly ignored by Hollywood, receiving only one Oscar (cinematography).The complexities of the story telling in The Mission are almost too much to take in in a single film lasting a bit more than two hours, but Jaffe has woven them together with a touch that is both delicate and profound, creating a tapestry as impressive and intricate as any medieval Flemish tapestry, its story held together flawlessly.While supposedly created for our own preservation and edification, politics and religion have done as much or more unspeakable horrors in the names of God and Man as they have good and in The Mission we see the bloody result, despite the effort of a few rebel priests who believe in the power of love and the natives with whom they try to share their world. The villains are plentiful in this true tale and Joffe never disguises them, allowing the deceptive simplicities of good versus evil run its predictable course, as they twist and turn everything they touch into the inevitable choked and knotted apocalypse of sorrow that is always the end result of greed.Despite its bleak, often hopeless nature, Joffe nonetheless gives us a miracle a film of such ineffable beauty that stirs both heart and mind through the combination of remarkable acting, a wilderness captured in breathtaking cinematography, battles both physical and spiritual, and wed it all to one of the most remarkable musical scores of the late 20th century.

The villains are plentiful in this true tale and Joffe never disguises them, allowing the deceptive simplicities of good versus evil run its predictable course, as they twist and turn everything they touch into the inevitable choked and knotted apocalypse of sorrow that is always the end result of greed.Despite its bleak, often hopeless nature, Joffe nonetheless gives us a miracle a film of such ineffable beauty that stirs both heart and mind through the combination of remarkable acting, a wilderness captured in breathtaking cinematography, battles both physical and spiritual, and wed it all to one of the most remarkable musical scores of the late 20th century.

I saw it for the first time in winter of 1971and for the third time I saw it last night. I hardly ever wanted to watch any movie for the second time, but I watched it already two times this week.This 1970 hit film has not aged at all. I was surprised at Jenny (Ali McGraw)'s outwear and accessories, I noticed some her fashion has never gone out of fashion, I feel like I could put on even nowadays. The movie's story is simple the story is about very rich millionaire's son Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) who happens to fall in love with the poor girl Jenny till the day the doctor diagnosed her with cancer. Have you heard it all before? Perhaps, but even if I've heard melancholy stories many times I am quite charmed by the movie and it's one of my favorite movies. Although the story is very simple, it kept me glued to the screen without doing anything spectacular during two hours. In addition, the movie is well known for its theme song composed by Francis Lai, which won an Oscar for the best theme song. There are many songs of Bach, Mozart and Handel, which enrich the beauty of the movie.It seems wonderful to peep over the old buildings of the University of Harvard, with the Boston streets as the backdrop. And I just love the improvised scene of Oliver and Jenny playing in the snow on the empty football field. It is one of the all time great movie scenes. The music playing in the background and these two beautiful actors improvising a lovely scene of young lovers playing in the snow. I think the memories of such moments when we were young never leave us, and when we see the film again our original reactions come back with it. I recommend it to everyone who loves a great love story but don't forget to get some tissues and prepare to experience a story about life, a sad story, one that will stay with you forever.

I believe it plays a core role making all the stories more radiant and impressive in this movie.This movie, set in late 1930s Italy, is roughly divided into two parts. The first part is focused on love and a happy family. A Jewish guy, Guido (Roberto Benigni) is a man of a brilliant sense of humor and has a talent to make people happy. He happens to meet a beautiful woman, Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) and soon falls in love with and gets married to her. They soon have a lovely son, named Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini). Guido, as a husband and father, always makes his family laugh, so they lead a happy life. The second part of this movie is about a miserable life in a Nazi Concentration Camp. Guido's family are sent to a place where it is extremely difficult to find any hope. However, Guido, a born witty person and devoted father, tries to make his son believe the life of this place just a hide and seek game in order not to let him know the devastating reality. Guido's humor reaches its peak when Guido is being dragged to be killed by a German soldier while his son is watching him. He gives his son a wink and walks away pretending he is performing one of the missions of the game not being killed, which makes this movie touching and impressive. This scene shows mixed feelings love, sorrow, sacrifice, and devotion and these feelings are maximized by Guido's witty wink.Although it could be a simple story like the narrator says, it is also a great one because it shows that good humor makes things different and has a power to overcome all difficulties.

So who is the Phantom? Well without the costume, he is Kit Walker; American born, but living in the illustrious Asian jungle. A friend of the local natives, Kit speaks their language and practices their culture, but dresses like something from another planet, in purple pyjamas (bearing vague tattooed patterns) He carrying twin pistols like a cowboy. Likewise, he rides a horse, but has a wolf for a sidekick. It is almost impossible to take something like this seriously. It is a good thing then that part of the time, The Phantom winks at itself. It acknowledges it's gimmicky\/campy nature, but it is far from being a comedy. As a result (despite some funny parts) it is still pretty cheesy and hard to care for, but that does not make the film unwatchableA better way to look at The Phantom is to see it as another entry into the comic book noir- class of pulpy film adaptations which include Dick Tracy and the Shadow. This one is not really 'noir' in the sense that it is dark, but it comes out of the noir time period, of the early- mid 20th century a time of fedoras, big black cars, and sub machine guns.The Phantom is dosed with an appropriate amount of comic book type thrills and chills, which include gun play, and chases on land sea and air, not to mention a fairly abrupt laser fight during the climax. This sequence should probably have been longer actually, It might have amounted to the best part of the film. Billy Zane doesn't do much for me as the Phantom, nor does Kristy Swanson as his gal, but it would be wrong to give them full blame for this error. The screenplay is feeble and shallow without giving them much to do or say, and the whole thing feels surprisingly short. Actually, the Phantom becomes a case of the heroes getting upstaged by the villains, like The Dark Knight. Treat Williams is a classic case of a sharp dressed, upper class sleaze who has some very epic evil plans. This is such a cliché, but Williams brings a great, and much needed sense of humour to it, something that probably should have been applied to the Mongolian Villain from the Shadow (whose name I forget at the moment). There are a few other laughs to be had, but not enough I feel.Maybe had director Simon Wincer chosen to take this movie further in the comedy direction, it would have been really good. The Phantom sorts of flirts occasionally with satire of that sort, but not enough. If taken seriously, it can still be enjoyed i suppose, but not on a great level. The end result is a mildly amusing motion picture, with some room for improvement, but it certainly could've been worse.The Phantom was actually a hard movie for me to find, and I'm not entirely certain, that the search as worth it, but I won't argue that I want those hundred minutes of my life back.

So who is the Phantom? Well without the costume, he is Kit Walker; American born, but living in the illustrious Asian jungle. A friend of the local natives, Kit speaks their language and practices their culture, but dresses like something from another planet, in purple pyjamas (bearing vague tattooed patterns) He carrying twin pistols like a cowboy. Likewise, he rides a horse, but has a wolf for a sidekick. It is almost impossible to take something like this seriously. It is a good thing then that part of the time, The Phantom winks at itself. It acknowledges it's gimmicky\/campy nature, but it is far from being a comedy. As a result (despite some funny parts) it is still pretty cheesy and hard to care for, but that does not make the film unwatchableA better way to look at The Phantom is to see it as another entry into the comic book noir- class of pulpy film adaptations which include Dick Tracy and the Shadow. This one is not really 'noir' in the sense that it is dark, but it comes out of the noir time period, of the early- mid 20th century a time of fedoras, big black cars, and sub machine guns.The Phantom is dosed with an appropriate amount of comic book type thrills and chills, which include gun play, and chases on land sea and air, not to mention a fairly abrupt laser fight during the climax. This sequence should probably have been longer actually, It might have amounted to the best part of the film. Billy Zane doesn't do much for me as the Phantom, nor does Kristy Swanson as his gal, but it would be wrong to give them full blame for this error. The screenplay is feeble and shallow without giving them much to do or say, and the whole thing feels surprisingly short. Actually, the Phantom becomes a case of the heroes getting upstaged by the villains, like The Dark Knight. Treat Williams is a classic case of a sharp dressed, upper class sleaze who has some very epic evil plans. This is such a cliché, but Williams brings a great, and much needed sense of humour to it, something that probably should have been applied to the Mongolian Villain from the Shadow (whose name I forget at the moment). There are a few other laughs to be had, but not enough I feel.Maybe had director Simon Wincer chosen to take this movie further in the comedy direction, it would have been really good. The Phantom sorts of flirts occasionally with satire of that sort, but not enough. If taken seriously, it can still be enjoyed i suppose, but not on a great level. The end result is a mildly amusing motion picture, with some room for improvement, but it certainly could've been worse.The Phantom was actually a hard movie for me to find, and I'm not entirely certain, that the search as worth it, but I won't argue that I want those hundred minutes of my life back.

It pairs Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, who famously play old and young Don Corleone in the Godfather I and II respectively, both roles iconic ones. It's actually the only time the two would ever appear on screen together, and it is Brando's last role. It also features Ed Norton, at the time one of the rising leading men, in sort of a tri-generational meeting of major stars.I'm sure people who don't even like caper films will watch The Score purely because of its cast. And why not? All deliver good performances, even Brando, whose interest in serious acting was often questionable in basically any of his roles after Godfather. It's not Oscar caliber stuff, and not the best any of these guys have done, but when you think about the barely two-dimensional roles the script gives them, they do about as good of a job as you could expect playing them. It's hard to imagine anyone else doing a better job, in other words.de Niro plays Nick, who runs a jazz club and subsidizes his cushy upper crust life by occasionally doing high-end heists for Brando's character Max, a rather cliché fence borrowing from Sidney Greenstreet's famous work in _The Maltese Falcon_. This movie falls victim to the biggest cliché of heist movies Nick wants to retire but Max talks him into breaking a few of his rules to return for One More Job. To pull this one off they'll need the help of inside man Jack (Ed Norton) who is posing as a mentally handicapped assistant janitor at the facility where the thingie-to-be-stolen is being guarded.Okay, there is nothing innovative at all about the overall plot. At best it's a hodgepodge of ideas that worked well when we saw them in earlier movies, in some cases 60 years before The Score came out. It is a sleek big-budget production, though, with competent direction, fine acting, eye-pleasing visuals and a nice (lower-case) score, and it can't help but have some redeeming values.The result is a movie that shouldn't fail to entertain fans of heist movies. If you like movies that are all about guys staging elaborate thefts of valuable thingies, this movie is some solid entertainment and belongs in your DVD collection. If the basic idea of a heist movie doesn't do much for you, and you don't want to see the movie just because of the three famous actors, this movie probably isn't even worth renting.

Peggy Sue Got Married is one of the best examples in Francis Ford Coppola's achievement but if you look closer and examinate the story of the film you're gonna understand why he decided to make it almost if it was a retrospective look to his life and how things worked for him in terms of personal growth facing an incredible success in the 1970's and some failures in the 1980's. In 1985, during a school reunion Peggy Sue (Kathleen Turner, excellent) collapses in front of all her friends and schoolmates after being selected as queen of the prom and strangely travels in time back to the school days in the 1960's. She was queen of a similar prom back in those days when she was a very popular teenage girl, dating the also popular Charlie (Nicolas Cage). The two got married but he had an affair, she was trying to divorce him and all comes back to the reunion in 1985. Resembling Marty McFly from Back to the Future series, Peggy changes some of her attitudes towards her best friends; her boyfriend Charlie (always remembering that someday he's gonna cheat on her); her parents (trying to enjoy more time with them); the future richer guy Richard (Barry Miller) who was a nerdy and underestimated guy (she approaches him telling the truth about her time travel and all the scientific things about to come in the future); and also she's gonna make some significant changes in her destiny, and one of these things is to know better Michael Fitzsimmons (Kevin J.O'Connor) a mysterious student she had a little crush but always were afraid to get close to him.But she's still trying to get some possible answers about her relationship with Charlie in this new past, torturing herself every time she stays with him, remembering all his love for her and then how things became so unbearable to her. Peggy can change her destiny? She's gonna make the same path twice and marry with the guy who's gonna be a great husband and a father but also is going to deceive her? What about a possible future with the future millionaire? Or even with the strange and poetic Michael? Despite its fiction theme it's a very down to earth movie about the things we do in life, our decisions and the way we deal with it. It was very interesting the way the movie expressed a message about giving value to what we have, and even more, by focusing that this is our only shot, our only chance to live and we must forget little barriers and discover new things, have new friendships and don't care what other people say. Peggy realizes that changing her attitudes is a great thing but changing her destiny is little more complicated, because she can't regret at all marrying Charlie because she cared about him and about their sons (although in the first minutes we look at her with the sad (not bitter as it might look) expression that says marriage ruined my life. A possible answer for Coppola wanting to make this movie, I think, comes from his response for what was happening to his life and career when first he had one hit after another with The Godfather series and Apocalypse Now, and then noticing that he seemed to have lost his public appeal in the box-office in the following decade after some more personal movies. Just like Peggy who analyzes her good times that later would become some disappointing times and not fully understanding what happened they both know that people always has a chance to get up and make things work out right again. The result was a great movie, his biggest hit in the 1980's and the first one after Apocalypse Now. The mix between a reflectional drama and comedy is brilliant; and all the performances are great except Sofia Coppola who remembers a similar character she made in Rumble Fish (also directed by her father).

Then the movie added a rather sad excuse for a plot and the rest of the movie suffers because of this. Not to say it was not a good movie from the moment they get the plot on, but it just feels cheapened by the whole, lets rescue this one dude scenario.

An interesting subplot though involves one of the American soldiers calling for the release of a Nazi that the rest wanted to kill. I found how that played out to be very intriguing. It made for one of the tenses scenes in the movie in my eyes as the one guy was trying to drive the knife in another and you just knew the other guy was going to come in and turn the tide. The cast is excellent as Tom Hanks is at his best here, I can believe he did not get an Oscar for this one and he did get one for Forrest Gump. The only member of the cast I did not care for all that much is Matt Damon in the role of Private Ryan, he just did not have a 1940's look to him, or like someone who had been in combat for a while like Hanks' troop. Still, overall this is a very good picture and while I never saw Shakespere in Love I am still certain this film got robbed.

Connery once said that everyone claims he made playing Bond look easy and effortless but he said it took a lot of work to CREATE Bond to make him a likable hero to make Bond a hero that would last generations.

The story itself is fun and funny, however I don't think most of the songs were that great, which isn't good for a musical. The dances were great but the music could have been better. One song I did like is the one done with Jerry the Mouse. The piano playing by Jose Iturbi is also very good and entertaining. Gene Kelly plays the same roll he usually does, so its nothing special for him but he is still great. Frank Sinatra I think did much better, and showed his ability to play different roles. He usually plays a confident, smooth ladies man where in this film he plays a character who is awkward and shy, far from his best work but its good for his early work. Most of the minor characters are played well too. The highlight of the film is definitely the dance with Jerry the Mouse, it kind of has no real point to be in the film, it works, but seems unnecessary. It's a great dance and a great song and a very unique scene that hasn't really ever been copied or redone The movie by itself has some great laughs and is definitely worth watching, especially if you are a Gene Kelly or Frank Sinatra fan. It seems to be a little longer than it need to be but as long as that doesn't bother you its great. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 June 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Anchors Aweigh (1945)5 word Summary2 sailors look for dames Anchors Aweigh is a fun comedic musical but it does have some issues.

Basically, it is 1969 in London, and unemployed anxiety-prone actor Marwood, or I (Paul McGann, the one time Doctor Who) and unemployable alcoholic actor Withnail (Richard E. Grant) live together in their damp, cold and dirty Camden flat. Wanting to continue resting and seeking a getaway from their drab style of living, they seek a holiday in the north of Penrith cottage of Withnail's uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths). They may have the nice countryside, but the weather is awful, the cottage is almost as dirty as their flat, there is little food and drink, and of course, eccentric and homosexual Uncle Monty being there isn't helping. Withnail falsely told Monty that Marwood is also gay, so there is a lot of affection going in his direction, and Marwood is just politely ignoring it. Then of course there is the point when Monty expresses his feelings for Marwood at bedtime, and he has to make up a really good lie to get him away from him, and obviously Withnail gets an earful of complaints. While the two friends are distanced, Marwood is told by telegram he has an audition, and he returns to the London flat with drug dealer friend Danny (Cape Wrath's Ralph Brown) squatting there. After cutting his curly hair short ready for the audition, Marwood prepares to leave, and drinking Withnail insists he accompanies his friend some of the way to the station, before being left in the rain in Regent's Park. Also starring Michael Elphick as Jake, Daragh O'Malley as Irishman, Michael Wardle as Isaac Parkin, Una Brandon-Jones as Mrs. Parkin and Noel Johnson as General. Grant makes a great drunk character with his reciting play lines very fun to watch, McGann is also very affective as his sometimes reclusive friend, and he is obviously tested by the reliable Griffiths coming out to him. I may not have caught on to the fact that this was meant to be a black comedy, but there were some good giggly moments, and it is a cult film to enjoy. It was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Films, it was number 21 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 16 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!
