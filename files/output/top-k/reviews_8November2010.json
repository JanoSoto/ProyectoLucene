They decide that the best way to get near her and similar girls is to sign up with a fraternity, specifically the Beta fraternity, whose leader Brad looks like either a vampire or an albino.To be considered as viable applicants, (even though they never intend to let the boys in), Brad and the frat-boys set them a task, more a prank actually, to steal a corpse from the local morgue and place it near another competing frat house...Oh the hilarity.In the process of completing this task the boys inadvertently unfreeze the 1950's Johnny, who has been chillin' for the better part of three decades for some unrevealed reason in a cryogenic lab in the morgue. Only Johnny was not dead, just chilly, and he kills the unfortunate morgue attendant and goes for a bit of a walk.Hereafter starts the horror part, which is actually reasonably bearable even though it sounds and is very silly. Again like Slither the evil comes from worms, who enter the living or dead through any available orifice and cause the body to lust after more flesh, the only way these carriers can be killed is to burn them after they leave their host.It turns out that the worms are directly linked to the events of the 50's, and some main characters reveal that they were around at that time and can therefore shed some light on exactly what has caused the events.The finale ends on the night of the college ball, and by this time Chris has managed to hook himself up with Cynthia and is preparing himself for the night, along with almost every other college kid.

Keeping with that %, about 90% of the jokes in Night of the Creeps fall flat, there are a couple of worthwhile moments still though.Lastly This movie is extremely formulaic, but that is perhaps a strength, as it follows the formula so tightly that even though we know what is about to happen, we draw some comfort from that.I found it amusing that the main cop in the film says at one point What is this a homicide or a bad B movie?.

The movie cuts to Washington, to the suburbia home Chris Macneil, an actress and a divorced(Big Surprise!) mother, where some disturbances begin to occur. Soon she will be forced to realize that her 12 year old daughter Regan, has been possessed by an ancient evil.She enlists the help of Father Karras, another disturbed soul who has his own demons to exorcise (figuratively this time) who in turn calls in famous exorcist Father Merrin, finely played by the legendary Max Von Sydow.All the major characters put in superb performances. We share the frustrated agonies of Chris Macneil (Ellen Burstyn) as she tries to move earth and then heaven to save her daughter, first seeking medical help and eventually, resorting to a God she does not believe in. The acting of Jason Miller and Sydow was restrained but mainly because of the taciturn characters they both played. But that does not in anyway reduce the impact of their performance. Without saying anything, you can see the fears on Karras' face as he doubts his ability to save the girl.But the true star in this movie was Linda Blair who played the possessed Regan. She played her character to the hilt. I do not believe there has been any other evil child character that has been portrayed more convincingly or more scarily.The only drawback I can see in this film is the detective character played by Lee J.

Willian Friedkin did a masterful job and paid attention to some minor details of the book such as the fighting dogs and the desecration of the statue of the Virgin Mary. I still believe that the Exorcist is his best movie and it was a good thing that the studio hired the Exorcist author to write the screenplay or otherwise we would have likely had a hatchet job.37 years after this movie was made, it is still an entertaining chiller and epitomizes the eternal struggle (or if you must, the spiritual warfare) between good and evil.The movie's success spawned two lousy sequels that nearly destroyed the legendary status of the original movie. I cannot believe that the great Richard Burton and the iconic James Earl Jones agreed to appear in Exorcist 2.

I still believe that the Exorcist is his best movie and it was a good thing that the studio hired the Exorcist author to write the screenplay or otherwise we would have likely had a hatchet job.37 years after this movie was made, it is still an entertaining chiller and epitomizes the eternal struggle (or if you must, the spiritual warfare) between good and evil.The movie's success spawned two lousy sequels that nearly destroyed the legendary status of the original movie. I cannot believe that the great Richard Burton and the iconic James Earl Jones agreed to appear in Exorcist 2. It was a really horrible movie.Much later, they tried to restore the franchise by making a prequel called The Exorcist The Beginning. It was a valiant attempt but still does not hold a candle to the original. ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"8 November 2010","score":"","review":" There are already excellent 2,296 review for this movie.

It's hard enough these days for a halfway challenging movie to win an audience on its own merits, without adding the extra burden of unrealistic expectations. But because of its credentials Bringing Out the Dead will have to withstand a lot of inevitable (and unfair) comparisons to the earlier film, with which it shares the same grim setting and similar themes of alienation and redemption.Hardly surprising, since both were written by Paul Schrader, who knows every contour of this ambiguous moral territory like the back of his own hand. Only the presence of Robert DeNiro (or at least Harvey Keitel) would have made the reunion complete, but Scorsese wisely agreed to the casting of Nicholas Cage in the lead role, as a burned-out paramedic working the graveyard shift in that mid-town neighborhood west of Times Square known (for good reason) as Hell's Kitchen.Cage is in a slump he's working too much, sleeping too little, and hasn't saved a life in months, not a healthy situation for someone who lives and (mostly) dies vicariously through his rescue efforts. Too many unresolved medical emergencies in the lunatic underbelly of Manhattan have brought him to a point where the only hold on his sanity is the paramedic's creed, usually applied to his patients keep the body going until the brain and heart recover.It's the pivotal message of the movie (and easy to spot because it's repeated twice), giving Cage's efforts to preserve his own battered psyche an irresistible, sometimes reckless momentum. The episodic storyline, adapted from the debut novel by Joe Connelly (an erstwhile paramedic himself) may not appeal to the average multiplex audience, conditioned to expect a more conventional, plot-driven narrative. But viewers who don't subscribe to the sales pitch ethos at large in modern Hollywood will find much to admire in Cage's not entirely successful struggle over a long, chaotic weekend of full moons to navigate the grief and accumulated guilt of too many flatliners.Not an easy task, as it turns out, especially in such a merciless environment. This city will kill you if you're not strong enough, he's reminded at one point by Patricia Arquette, playing the long-suffering daughter of a brain-dead heart attack victim, and representing a token ray of slightly tarnished sunlight in an otherwise gloomy all-male scenario. It's the second key line of dialogue in the movie a Nietzschean paraphrase no doubt endorsed by Scorsese himself, who (not for the first time) paints an all too vivid portrait of New York City not likely to be applauded by the local chamber of commerce.An introductory title places the action in the specific time frame of the early 1990s, before the PR mouseketeers of the Walt Disney Company ('Team Rodent', in Carl Hiaasen's memorable words) began their crusade to make the city safe for family tourism. This is the Big Apple before its corporate facelift a loser's paradise of low-rent sleaze emporiums and wasted lives. Every other scene leaves an indelible (if not entirely accurate) impression of being set at the top of another inner-city tenement building, surrounded by a (mostly) nocturnal landscape littered with human flotsam junkies, whores, hustlers, alcoholics, homeless bums and other assorted crazies, not least among them the paramedic crews themselves.Over the course of his dreamlike but sleepless 48-hour flight from reality Cage will find himself paired with a series of increasingly eccentric partners, from a jovial John Goodman to Ving Rhames to a truly psychotic Tom Sizemore. You'll find a measure of more or less traditional buddy-film banter while each team is on the streets, but don't expect too many comfortable chuckles. Scorsese has a gift for raising uneasy laughter from even the darkest scenario, and like all his best films the humor in Bringing Out the Dead is colored in shades of midnight gray, suitably morbid but still amusing if approached in the proper twisted spirit.Sharing equal screen time with a trio of certifies scene-stealers must have posed a particular challenge for Cage, normally an unrestrained actor of no small notoriety. He has been known to run amok over weaker material like a narcoleptic bull in a cheap china shop (quoting an acerbic review of his jaw-dropping hambone turn in the 1989 film 'Vampire's Kiss'), but it's a credit to Scorsese's skill that he manages to coax his star into a performance of laudable restraint and understatement. There's more than a little evidence of method acting residue at work it looks as if Cage prepared for his insomniac role by depriving himself of sleep for several weeks, giving his complexion a totally convincing night owl pallor, strikingly highlighted by Robert Richardson's luminous cinematography.In the spirit of the times the film outstays its welcome by a good twenty minutes, a familiar complaint in these days of slack-fingered editing and narrative hypertrophy. But after its headlong rush into the urban maelstrom of inner Manhattan the story manages to resolve itself on a note of unexpected grace. If the aim was simply to recapture the flavor of Taxi Driver, it might have ended in a cathartic bloodbath worthy of Travis Bickle, instead of with the quieter (but no less powerful) epiphany shown here.So maybe it's true, at least for the maverick directors of the 1970s you can't go home again.

Part of this memorability comes from cheap methods such as gross-out visual effects and three-breasted prostitutes, but credit also belongs to a story full of roller coaster twists.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Douglas Quaid, a man with a seemingly loving wife (Sharon Stone), who has vivid dreams about Mars, a planet that has been colonized by America and is at the center of a military controversy. Quaid becomes intrigued by a service that offers the implantation of vacation memories so that one can recall having been somewhere and experienced something without having to take the time to go through it. But instead of getting a nice vacation, the process goes wrong for Quaid and suddenly his friend at work and his wife are not who he thought they were -- and neither is he.Turns out Quaid was a skilled operative who had his memory tampered with previously and his former self sent him a message to go back to Mars because he has memories that hold the key to the undoing of the evil General Cohaagen who is oppressing those living on Mars.Mars is a circus sideshow in Las Vegas in this film.

Like its direct predecessor, it is a much maligned piece of cinema. Unlike Alien3, however, Resurrection doesn't descend further into the harrowing nightmare that ended with Ripley's death; it completely shifts the paradigms of the series.You could easily view this film as something apart from the previous three. It doesn't even have Ripley in it, not really- it's a clone (one of eight), and Sigourney Weaver doesn't play her like she's Ripley, either. Undeniably, they look similar these two protagonists, but that is pretty much the only link. Other than the blood-thirsty aliens stalking the corridors of a military space station- which itself finally delivers on the idea of what might happen should 'The Company' (or at least 'a company' since Weyland-Yutani are no more 250 years into the future) get hold of alien DNA and mess about with it. It raises some really interesting ideas about the nature of the creature itself (how, exactly, do you clone a parasite from the host's blood sample? That's a sci-fi concept waiting to be explored), not to mention their more 'human' aspects (problem solving intelligence, for one, an implied sexual interest in their genetic grandmother- Ripley 8) making for some pretty nasty monsters.That's the bad point really though, because ever since James Cameron took a load of machine guns to a colony of xenomorphs in 1986, they've lost the menace the creature had in the 1979 original. They are just teeth and claws to be dispatched, and perhaps it's intentional with regard to these aliens being a little bit human, but they look far too organic (they even seemed to have developed goat legs, which doesn't make such sense, but perhaps it's for artistic flare, and the creatures do look very good, just not as good as they used to).Alien Resurrection really isn't business as usual, but then every film in the series has been different, so why not have a European black comedy thrown in, too? Personally, I love Jeunet's touch; despite his language barriers at the time, he injects great humour into the proceedings, without ridiculing the hallowed science fiction saga, and that is thanks to Joss Wedon's script. He's been incredibly vocal about his disappointment with the project, but Jeunet's visual style lends itself incredibly well to science fiction, creating a grubby, dystopian future an age away from the clean white space station of Aliens and a darn sight more believable. If man as a species takes to the stars, the universe will be filthy, and that is on display here in abundance.There are some fantastic set pieces(although the underwater sequence's CGI has dated in the last 13 years), and a brave attempt at taking the series in a new and frightening direction with the love it\/hate it (mostly people seem to hate it) Newborn creature, born directly from the (sadly under-used) Queen's womb inherited from the genetic crossover (so when do we get to see Ripley laying eggs?).Like Alien3 before it, it takes up the reigns from an ending nobody really knows how to develop the series from. Sure, it would have been nice that Hicks and Newt made it. And sure, it might have been nice if Ripley hadn't died- but this series has been taking risks since the beginning. Captain Dallas should have been the hero way back in 1979, but he buys it halfway in. Ridley Scott pulls a Psycho on us, and we love it. Every time anyone else tries anything against the grain in this franchise, it's been met with disdain. The most popular entry into the series (Aliens) is the least subversive, all guns and war and even a happy ending. It's a masterclass in scifi action, sure, but I think Alien Resurrection is probably the bravest film of the four. It sort of writes itself into a hole at the end, but we've been there before with this series. I'd like to know what could happen next.Bizarre, grotesque, frightening and equal parts hilarious, beautiful and bold, Alien Resurrection is a film that has been brutalised by fans and critics alike; even by those who made it. It takes risks, and the result is a subversive and entertaining b-move schlock-fest with European sensibilities and an incredible visual flare (like Fincher, it doesn't matter how much a studio suppresses the choices of Jeunet, his style is too powerful to be completely oppressed).Alien was horror.

The 1967 comedy The Firemen's Ball has been interpreted as an allegory for the Socialist system that had a major effect on how people lived in Eastern Europe at the time, but it also works as an entertaining little flick in its own right.The loose plot was inspired by an actual firemen's ball that Forman and his screenwriter friends once attended. The aging fire department of a small village is arranging a ball in honour of their elderly chairman who is turning 86 and, unbeknownst to him, dying of cancer. The program is to include at least music, dancing, a beauty contest for the ladies and a lottery with various prizes, but it seems that Murphy's Law is alive and well in the village the lottery prizes keep getting stolen at an increasing rate, nobody wants to participate in the beauty pageant and the general chaos grows more and more out of control. Soon the firemen get to demonstrate their occupational skills in a genuine incident.Most of the actors were reportedly real firemen from the town where the movie was shot, but despite their lack of acting experience they fit in their roles perfectly. The grumpy men's arguments about the stressful arrangements are pretty hilarious, but the women are funny too even though their roles are somewhat smaller. Also, personally I didn't find any of the reluctant beauty contestants ugly at all, unlike the frustrated committee members! In addition, I should give a nod to the catchy ballroom music that is playing for a lot of the time and even references a Beatles song at one point. It is possible that the atmosphere-driven collection of errors and misadventures may feel aimless to some viewers who would prefer a stronger plot, but those with a fondness for looser narratives should find it easy to enjoy the firemen's adversities.Besides the comical bumbling, there are also more melancholic moments in the short movie. The fire scene near the end carries a feel of powerlessness when an old man watches his house burn down while the firemen futilely try to put the flames out by shoveling snow into the fire. Still, the service of drinks is never interrupted during the turmoil, keeping up appearances no matter what. The whole plot line of the stolen lottery prizes also culminates in a wistful moment when the honorary chairman finally gets to accept his gift after sincerely thanking his colleagues for the help they have given over the years. This lack of the oft-mentioned solidarity among the masses (not so much among individuals) may have been what prompted the Czechoslovakian officials to originally ban the film forever.As for myself, I can say I enjoyed The Firemen's Ball more than Loves of a Blonde (1965), the other early Forman film I have seen at the moment.

It ridiculously screams sci-fi, so much that it can be mistaken for a spoof, of which it certainly is not. Besson, ever the eye for detail, creates the future in a fantastically zingy way that draws the audience in to its colourful world of fast paced mingleaninga.Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) is former special agent, now taxi driver turned special agent again in order to save the world from an ever growing evil in the form of a giant burning evil 'scare the pants of The President' ball of fire. In order to save the world from this said evil he needs five elements, 4 of which are unknown to everybody except the fifth element who he predictably meets after she falls into his taxi after being chased by cops.Leeloo Minai Lekarariba Laminai Tchai Ekbat De Sebat, otherwise known as Leeloo, is the Fifth Element that predictably falls into Korben Dallas' taxi cab. She is not human, not robot, not anything really, although she is very much a human. She was built from strands of DNA to create what scientists called 'The Perfect Being', and she is really. She was built to 'Protect'. She is a likable character; her flaming orange hair accentuates her unique personality. She is the brainiest character, knows everything, and learns everything by just looking at pictures and text for just one split second, possibly due to the fact that she was made with a photographic memory.Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) is a squeaky voiced, over-dramatic confusing Radio DJ whose hair is really eccentric and unpredictable. He follows Korban around like a bad smell, and annoys the living daylights out of him. If it's not the plot of the film that keeps you entertained, it's Ruby. While he may seem annoying and you may think that you will hate him, I can assure you that you won't. There's just something about him that makes you want to see this film over and over again. In all the scenes he's in, he speaks in his own way, and will not shut up. Most of the time you can hear nothing but him blabbering on. He is a great character for a film like this.The film is largely dependant on its fast paced music to keep the audience enthralled, the punky pop music is extremely enjoyable and helps keep the film bouncing on its toes. In one electrifyingly gripping scene, an opera singer, known as the Diva, is singing classical opera, and then suddenly BOOM! She starts singing opera but with a punkish popish side to it, zingy waves of fast paced electric pop music flying into your awaiting ears and through your brain, instantly changing the mood of the scene. Whilst the Diva is singing, the scene cuts back and forth on time with the beat of the music between the Diva and a fight between Leeloo the Fifth Element and aliens bent on stealing the other 4 elements, the music greatly affecting the feelings happening in the fight.This film entertained me all the way through, and has burnt itself with great detail and a lot of smoke into my memory; I could never forget the colourful electric eccentric hilarious fast paced world of this film.

By night, she is a tempest of sexual deviance, freely indulging in her bizarre fetishes to cope with her never-ending distress. It is when Erica meets the dashing Walter Klemmer that her personal demons begin to dominate every aspect of her life&#x97;the quiet, disguised shame with which she handles their relationship soon gives way to an explosive finale that forces her to cope the only way she knows how...The Piano Teacher can best be described as a story of emotional anguish rife with some very uncomfortable and intense character study. Based upon Elfriede Jelinek's novel of the same name, Michael Haneke's film is one of the finest&#x97;not to mention, one of the most faithful&#x97;adaptations of a book I have ever seen. The novel itself was an extremely controversial depiction of a woman lost and Haneke crafts a startingly effective film, one that not only captures the feel of a book both praised and reviled for its stark treatment of some very polarising subject matter, but even goes so far as to improve upon something that was fantastic on its own to begin with! What we have here is not the archetype of the European art picture, but a story that can be told in only one way possible&#x97;with the necessary detachment.Haneke has often been criticised for his cold direction, but something I have always noticed and appreciated is the way all of his projects benefit from this detached style. The family depicted in The Seventh Continent lives in a home as lonesome and barren as the harsh world they wish to escape, the title character of Benny's Video sleeps in a bedroom as sullen, forbidding and dangerous as his steeply slipping mental state, and Erica Kohut's pain is a pain only she can understand, and only she can articulate, awaiting the interference she craves while she's on her last legs emotionally and mentally speaking. Therefore, it makes sense to have Erica reside in a world as cold and as formal and as dark and mistrusting as she forces herself to be, concealing her suffering in the only way she knows how by laying down the law&#x97;viciously!&#x97;on students she constantly belittles. Erica's home conceals anguish beneath the proper, sophisticated interior decor, and the conservatory where she teaches is a mask to hide the sexual perversions she regards as casually as the way she plays her piano.While it would be simple to classify Erica as a deranged, repulsive bitch of a woman, it is the portrait of silent, budding tragedy beneath her exterior that attracts aspiring concert pianist Klemmer, whom she sees as the window to emotional transcendence and sexual liberation that is deeply lacking in her home. Erica's mother (the gravely-voiced Anne Girardot in a Caesar Award-winning performance) is a manipulative, calculating shrew whose every intention is to keep her daughter mired at home at all costs, simultaneously urging her to taste independence while tugging her back every moment Erica senses salvation at the tip of her fingers. It is the relationship Erica has with her mother as well as Klemmer's spurning of her that drives her over the brink into pure, unadulterated madness, but beneath the madness, beneath the repulsive, shocking, seemingly untouchable personality is a woman who has tasted nothing but scorn every day of her life. Erica's thirst for happiness consumes her to the point that she finds herself unable to cope with the all too real extent of her mental breakdown and finds herself with a dilemma both horrifying and heartbreaking.Isabelle Huppert has to be commended for delivering one of the most fearless, engrossing performances to come out of cinema of the last ten years. It is her work here that perhaps earned her a rank among a list of my favourite actresses and it is her work here that defines The Piano Teacher as essential Haneke, perhaps the most ambitious and startling of all of his other works. Benoit Magimel too, is flawless as the well-intentioned Walter Klemmer and Anne Girardot is fantastic as Erica's wicked gorgon of a parent. The rest of the cast turns in fantastic work, but this is Huppert's film, and she owns every single bit of it with the apparent, jaw-dropping ease with which her contemporary, Isabelle Adjani commanded the screens in Zulawski's Possession twenty years prior.I cannot say that The Piano Teacher is a film for everyone, but I can definitely advocate it as a film that should be seen, if anything for its brutal honesty and clarity of the type of person our society demonises without taking the time to study the actions that define the reactions we, the unsuspecting public, view with our naked eyes. It is for its commitment to truth that I admire The Piano Teacher&#x97;uncompromisingly dark, twisted and always divisive&#x97;as any Haneke film!&#x97;it is, nonetheless, a favourite of mine, and a classic in every respect.

I've always gotten the feeling that the movie just wasn't as good as the first, but I could never be sure how much of that feeling came from nostalgia for the first film and how much from the movie's own fault. But after some careful re-watching I believe I've found the main culprits.For one, the timing and dinosaur reveals aren't as masterfully pulled off. In the first movie, director Steven Spielberg did an amazing job building up to the dinosaur money shots, I didn't feel like I was kept waiting too long or for too short a time. And said money shots were incredible, beautiful, and chilling. In The Lost World I wasn't as anxious to see the dinosaurs by the time they were shown, and even when the dinosaurs were revealed the shots weren't as visually appealing or exciting and the build up lacked the subtle touches of the first movie. To be fair, it's nearly impossible to recreate that first time charm to begin with.The next issue is that the set pieces aren't as suspenseful. There are some creepy and tense moments (one especially eerie one involving a tent) but overall it's more geared towards action than suspense. Sequels like Aliens have taken similar routes, but the results don't pay off as well in The Lost World. The raptor scene is a great example in the first film the raptors were cunning and sinister, and their portion of the movie was like a demented game of hide and seek. In The Lost World the raptors are used in a great action romp type scene, but it comes at the cost the monsters lethality and mystique. When raptors caught up to the characters in the first film it seemed like curtains for the heroes, but here the humans are able to run circles around the beasts. And I guess I should mention the infamous final act of the movie where a t-rex goes on a rampage in San Diego. It's a fun scene, and personally I can't help but love every minute of it. But it feels like overkill, like something tacked on at the last moment rather than part of the flow of the movie. But I find it to be a nice change in scenery and it always makes me smile ear-to-ear.As for the cast, Jeff Goldblum is likable as always, although his returning character, Ian Malcolm isn't as entertaining or lively as he was in the first film. He's more reserved and more sour in temperament which I guess is what happens to you after too many near death experiences with dinosaurs. Malcolm's daughter, Kelly, unfortunately yet another irritating seemly unnecessary child costar. Vince Vaughn seems miscast and his character comes across as dis likable at times, and Julianne Moore occasionally drops the ball acting wise. Can't say too much about the rest of the cast good or bad except for Pete Postlethwaite's Roland Tembo who is earnest and transparent in the best meaning of the word he just wants to kill something worth killing, that's all he wants period. It makes him a real standout in a crowd of characters motivated by fortune, glory, rescue, and activism.More on the up side, the story is darker both thematically and literally. Gone is the lush jungle, instead replaced by dark nightmarish forest. Gone is the band of cynical experts, replaced by an assortment of activist who are willing to go to extreme lengths to keep the dinosaurs on the island. And forget kindly old man-child John Hammond, in his place is his money lusting nephew backed up by an army of grizzled hunters. And this isn't a dinosaur break out, it's a land dominated by them. The dinosaurs run the place, and humans are the intruders. Aside from the fact that it isn't explained why the hunters go through the trouble of catching adult wild dinosaurs rather than just steal eggs or infants like the villains in the book the story is solid and seems like a natural progression for the franchise Hammond's company wants to reclaim their prehistoric cash cows and start Jurassic Park anew.The CGI and animatronics are improved, the dinosaurs seem more lively and more finely detailed and even more humanized thanks to the tyrannosaurus family. It's interesting to see the first film's lead monster as a caring parent this time around, in addition to also being the lead monster. And it's simply a pleasure watching the prehistoric cast do their thing.I'm always a bit mystified by people who refer to this movie as one of the worst sequels ever made. I agree that it falls short of it's predecessor, but I think it's a gross exaggeration to place this movie in the ranks of Batman and Robin and AvPR.

And I guess I should mention the infamous final act of the movie where a t-rex goes on a rampage in San Diego. It's a fun scene, and personally I can't help but love every minute of it. But it feels like overkill, like something tacked on at the last moment rather than part of the flow of the movie. But I find it to be a nice change in scenery and it always makes me smile ear-to-ear.As for the cast, Jeff Goldblum is likable as always, although his returning character, Ian Malcolm isn't as entertaining or lively as he was in the first film. He's more reserved and more sour in temperament which I guess is what happens to you after too many near death experiences with dinosaurs. Malcolm's daughter, Kelly, unfortunately yet another irritating seemly unnecessary child costar. Vince Vaughn seems miscast and his character comes across as dis likable at times, and Julianne Moore occasionally drops the ball acting wise. Can't say too much about the rest of the cast good or bad except for Pete Postlethwaite's Roland Tembo who is earnest and transparent in the best meaning of the word he just wants to kill something worth killing, that's all he wants period. It makes him a real standout in a crowd of characters motivated by fortune, glory, rescue, and activism.More on the up side, the story is darker both thematically and literally. Gone is the lush jungle, instead replaced by dark nightmarish forest. Gone is the band of cynical experts, replaced by an assortment of activist who are willing to go to extreme lengths to keep the dinosaurs on the island. And forget kindly old man-child John Hammond, in his place is his money lusting nephew backed up by an army of grizzled hunters. And this isn't a dinosaur break out, it's a land dominated by them. The dinosaurs run the place, and humans are the intruders. Aside from the fact that it isn't explained why the hunters go through the trouble of catching adult wild dinosaurs rather than just steal eggs or infants like the villains in the book the story is solid and seems like a natural progression for the franchise Hammond's company wants to reclaim their prehistoric cash cows and start Jurassic Park anew.The CGI and animatronics are improved, the dinosaurs seem more lively and more finely detailed and even more humanized thanks to the tyrannosaurus family. It's interesting to see the first film's lead monster as a caring parent this time around, in addition to also being the lead monster. And it's simply a pleasure watching the prehistoric cast do their thing.I'm always a bit mystified by people who refer to this movie as one of the worst sequels ever made. I agree that it falls short of it's predecessor, but I think it's a gross exaggeration to place this movie in the ranks of Batman and Robin and AvPR. The Lost World is a truly under-appreciated sequel.

The advice is given to his prot√©g√© Kevin Lomax a brilliant and ambitious lawyer who has never lost a case.The Devil's Advocate is a guilty pleasure that will surely offend puritan Christians. The Firm meets Angel Heart. Keanu Reeves is Kevin Lomak a Southern lawyer seduced by a very rich New York law firm headed by the mysterious John Milton(Al Pacino). It is the dream of every young professional. A huge salary, a large apartment, designer suits, flashy cars, the whole perks. In the background is his sexy wife (Charlize Theron)who is the first target of the the law firm, and his Christian mother who has a deep secret of her own.All these characters will eventually collide in their course to find different types of redemption starting from when Lomax agrees to work for the firm. The horror of what he has gotten himself into slowly begins to unwind and the watchers are drawn into the eternal metaphorical saga of the battle between good and evil.The strenght in this movie lies squarely on the indomitable shoulders of Good Old Pacino. His performance was certainly dazzling, even though a little bit over the top sometimes. It was obvious that he was enjoying his role as Old Nick. His presence on the screen was mesmerizing and his lines, were outrageous, disturbing, profane and yet spellbinding.He was ably supported by Charlize Theron who keeps on proving that she is more than just a pretty face. Her evolution from a woman excited at her husband's sudden success to a terrified screaming lunatic was top shot. That woman can act! To me the film's greatest shortcoming was Keanu Reeves himself. He has never impressed me with his thespian skills, and true to form his performance was just average.But still the film is great with less emphasis on special effects and certainly no horrifying creature lurking around the corner. Instead the film eschewed violence to rely on the story itself to thrill us.And it did.

This is what mostly makes Anatomy of a Murder such a simple, great and effective one.What I like about this movie is that it's a movie without any high morals or a strong message in it. It's just a movie about a random case and the lawyer just takes the case because it's a case. He doesn't feel that strong to, at the cost of everything, try to proof the innocence of his client and he doesn't get emotionally involved with the case or any of its key players, like often movies normally try to attempt. Movies more often try to get you behind the defendant, or else at least his attorney and feel strongly for the case. But in this case the murder suspect isn't presented as being either totally innocent or not. He even isn't that sympathetic of a character and you question his motives and his defense, during his trail, at times throughout the movie.It's a movie that doesn't really sidetrack with its story and it's being kept as straight-forward as possible all. So no odd occurrences happening in this movie, that are unlikely to ever happen in real life. This, together with its absence sense of morality, together with guilt and compassion, make this movie a mostly throughout realistic one. This works really pleasant for the movie and really helps to get you drawn into the story and its characters.I basically love all court room themed movies and this movie has pretty much everything present I want from such a movie. Granted that this is the sort of movie that would had not been as good or interesting to watch if it had a completely unknown and bad cast in it.So yes, the movie definitely benefits from the presence of James Stewart, as the movie its defense attorney and it also has a quite solid supporting cast. Quite fun to also see George C. Scott and Ben Gazzara in some of the more early roles out of their career. Seems that Scott was still holding back a bit, since he didn't had of course that much of a status yet as an actor. It's probably one of the more sophisticated and 'clean, quiet', roles out of his career but it was also really great to see him like that for a change and it at the same time also shows his range and versatility as an actor, since he was great in this movie as well, playing this sort of character.For its time it also was a quite daring movie, regarding some of its, still at the time controversial subjects. The story is also a rape case, so it features lines regarding that subject as well. Of course rape was an already known issue at the time but it wasn't something that really got featured that explicitly yet in any sort of movie at the time, simply because it was something at the time that you just didn't really talked about. Again an example of how simple and effectively straight-forward the movie was being.Just like its story, the movie is also being kept simple in its style. No fancy tricks or out of the ordinary sequences and set up here, just some plain, good old average film-making, like you would learn at film-school.One great and effective movie within its genre.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"8 November 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie doesn't try to get too complicated or smart with its themes or issues and the case in this movie, along with its characters seem like very random and standard ones.
