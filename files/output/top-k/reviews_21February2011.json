I won't comment a lot about it because there are lots of reviews on here that say the same thing I would say. I would just like to make a couple of observations.One time a friend and I were watching Mel Brooks' comedy High Anxiety, which is a hilarious sendup of themes from Alfred Hitchcock movies. My friend remarked, This is just a silly comedy, but I'm getting excited about the plot. I, too, found the plot oddly suspenseful, even though there were laughs galore. Someone has said that's a hallmark of a great parody; it gives you the feeling that you are watching a movie that was intended to be taken seriously, but is so absurd that comedy is the result.The Three Amigos is a parody of classic themes of Westerns, and also of the history of Hollywood films. While the plot is more simple than that of High Anxiety, I still found that the story pulled me in. I actually cared about the plot and the characters, and vicariously I went on their great adventure with them. The comedy made the journey that much more enjoyable. When people say this plot is unbelievable, I wonder what they were expectiing. After all, a movie like this is about things that don't happen just every day. Since most of the film could have happened, why not suspend disbelief and simply enjoy it?Also, for those of you old enough to remember, or who are at least familiar with the history of television, there was a famous 1950s TV show called The Cisco Kid. He travelled the Old West righting wrongs like the Lone Ranger, only he and his sidekick Pancho were both hispanic. That was unusual for the time, and the show was also the first series to be filmed in color (in the early 50s!). The clothes that the Cisco Kid wore bear a striking resemblance to the costumes of the Three Amigos. Clearly the movie borrowed themes from that show, even the ending. After waving goodbye to the viewers, Cisco and Pancho would say, Let's ride! and the thrilling music would rise as they rapidly rode away across the desert. I found it thrilling to see Lucky, Dusty, and Ned do that, too!

Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) - the only survivor from the first movie - is finally rescued by a salvage ship after being in hyper-sleep for 57 years. OK. She tries to brief the company that sent her and her team on the first mission on the dangerous aliens they encountered, but no one will believe her story. Why not? Because there have been human colonists on the planet now for over 20 years and there hasn't been a single report of a problem. Well, we know where this is headed, don't we. Now that Ripley's back all of a sudden contact with the colony is lost, which allows the company to send Ripley back to the planet to do battle with the aliens all over again. Apparently they were waiting for her to be found!Setting aside that moment of ultra-convenience, this movie is weaker than the original in the series. James Cameron took over the directing duties in this from Ridley Scott, and Scott's touch was missed. What made the first movie very effective was the shadowy nature of the aliens. Scott never really gave us a good look at them. They were shadowy figures which made the story quite suspenseful. Cameron dispenses with that idea completely. The aliens are front and centre once the team reaches the planet, and somehow that makes this movie less frightening than its original. Cameron (who also co-wrote the screenplay) also turns this into a pretty standard humans vs. aliens shoot out with lots of weapons and lots of explosions, etc. The characters in this seemed more one dimensional than those in the original. So you have an out of control Marine (Bill Paxton), an in control Marine (William Hope) and the requisite bad guy representing the company (Paul Reiser). Then of course there's Ripley who, while being far more aggressive here than in the original, also gets to explore her maternal side as she becomes a surrogate mother figure to Newt (Carrie Henn) - a little girl who's apparently the only survivor among the colonists. The scene in which Ripley holds the little girl tight as the alien is approaching and says to her close your eyes, baby is actually a virtual reshoot of a scene in which a mother comforts her daughter as a monster approaches them in a 1957 movie called The Monster Who Challenged The World. And - wow - can Newt ever scream when scary things happen!No. I wasn't especially impressed with this movie, although I did get a laugh near the end, when Ripley appeared to do battle with the aliens inhabiting that big robot-like suit swinging away at the creatures without mercy, and I suddenly realized that - hey - that's where James Cameron got the idea for the same kind of suits the Marines used in Avatar!

Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country is a powerful final hurrah for the original series cast as they end their terms serving with the Enterprise. But before they can retire they must complete one last mission. The Klingon economy has been devastated by over mining and they are now seeking help from the Federation. In order to do so the long standing Neutral Zone has to be decommissioned and Kirk and his crew have been volunteered to escort the Klingon ambassador to Starfleet Headquarters. Trouble arises when the ambassador's ship is attacked, seemingly by the Enterprise. This begins a story full of conspiracy and mystery, making for one of the most exciting and intelligent Star Trek movies ever.The Undiscovered Country's storyline encompasses everything that Star Trek is all about. The show stood for intergalactic peace and it envisioned a future where differences between races could be solved diplomatically, rather than by war and violence. This is the premise of the entire movie as the Klingon's seek peaceful help from Starfleet instead of violently overtaking them for resources, something we would surely see in your more typical science fiction tale. Of course the film is not all peace and love, and there are those who wish to use violent tactics to get where they want. And those villains represent all the corruption and evil of man. The corruption and evil that gets us nowhere in society.Then of course there is another more human issue raised by The Undiscovered Country. It is the issue of prejudice and pride in your race. It begins with Kirk, who holds a grudge against the Klingon's stemming back to when a rouge Klingon killed his son in Star Trek III The Search for Spock. But who knows, the prejudice could even go back further than that, as many prejudices seem to do. The film makes these overtones very obvious and they remain a central focus of the entire plot. Sometimes it is spelled out a little too clearly, leaving the audience no room for interpretation, but it doesn't take away any of the meaning behind these social reformations Star Trek is trying to permeate through the excitement and enticing nature of the films. There are some very profound conversations between the characters in this film, such as one between Kirk and Spock, who of course is not human either, about how when you look deep into our souls, we're all human and we can all connect. Thus stating that there is no need for prejudice when we can all solve our issues through democracy, rather than senseless violence. This film is a shining example of everything Star Trek stands for. It exemplifies the idealistic future the show perceived, and makes it a realistic looking reality.For the very last Star Trek film with the original series cast, they make damn sure to have the film pack a punch. And indeed it did. It's an extremely enjoyable film with a very heartfelt message it is trying to convey. It was sad to watch the film end as Captain Kirk signed off for the very last time, but it only made the movie that more enthralling. This is indeed one of the best Star Trek films out there, and I'm having trouble deciding if I liked it more than The Wrath of Khan or not.

At 2.25 hours in length, it overstayed its welcome by an hour or so for me.The windtalkers referenced in the title are Navajo marine codetalkers dispatched to the Pacific theater during World War II. They were trained in a special code based on the Navajo language, and distributed among units in an attempt to provide coded radio transmissions that couldn't be understood by the Japanese. This was accomplished both by using the Navajo language and also using coding within that language to add a complication that the Japanese were never able to overcome during World War II.Sounds like an interesting story, right? Maybe so, in another movie. The only real reason to include the codetalkers in this movie was to provide a focal point for a storyline about bigotry and personal biases among some of the troops. That's also a legitimate storyline for a movie, but it's been done many times before with other targets. The title seems to hint that this movie will go beyond that aspect, but it doesn't. Actually, even the storyline about bigotry doesn't matter much in this movie. Everything is just an excuse for action battle scenes.This movie is all about the battle scenes, and it contains a lot of bad ones. I guess this is supposed to have been a modern, therefore realistically portrayed, Pacific Theater World War II movie. The photography and noise and gore are done with modern techniques, but not the story or scenes. All of the worst battle clichés of war movie history have been brought together and updated. Hand grenades, artillery shells, land mines, everything explodes with giant fuel-laden fireballs. There are slow motion sequences of soldiers successfully diving away from exploding artillery shells and fiery eruptions. There are enemies too stupid to recognize infiltrators of a different race and language.And always, always, always, there is the crazy protagonist who goes nuts in every battle and charges headlong into the enemy fire unscathed as bodies are being torn apart on all sides of him. No marine-issue semi-automatic rifle for this guy-- as a Sergeant he has a sub-machine gun and indiscriminately sprays hundreds of pounds of rounds in all directions, never running out of ammunition. While in the middle of one heated battle he over-ran an enemy foxhole with a dead soldier at the bottom and stopped for a few seconds to spray a couple dozen bullets into the body while screaming triumphantly. Why not? His magic gun isn't going to run dry.The movie is supposedly about the codetalkers, or at least about how the Navajo code was used, but that hardly gets addressed. The code is used in a couple instances when a non-code English transmission would have been fine, but when two American soldiers transmit from a Japanese radio at an over-run enemy post and might be expected to use code to provide verification, everything is done in open English. Of course, the Japanese radio also conveniently had Arabic numerals on the frequency tuner so they could change to the correct transmission frequency.If you like this type of battle footage, I recommend that instead of devoting your time to watching the movie straight through you just drop in somewhere in the middle and watch a few minutes of battle. If you want more than a few minutes you can either continue with the movie or just keep re-watching the same few minutes you already saw. There won't be any difference.

That's because the final portion centers on the last years of Zola's life and his attempt to gain Dreyfus his release from prison. Dreyfus had been sent to Devil's Island--convicted of sending French military secrets to foreign powers. Amazingly, when the true perpetrator was learned, the highest officers in the military decided NOT to punish the man responsible and keep Dreyfus in prison so they wouldn't lose face for convicting the wrong man!! I really enjoyed The Life of Emile Zola though could see that a very important part of the story is missing. I am NOT talking about the film taking a few artistic liberties--I certainly expected that. Instead, I am talking about a deliberate effort by the studio to misrepresent a major part of the story to make it more palatable to the general public. You see, about 3\/4 of the movie concerns Zola and the Dreyfus Affair--yet it really makes no real effort to talk about the heart of why Dreyfus was convicted for a crime he clearly did not commit--because he was a convenient scapegoat because he was Jewish. The film BRIEFLY mentions he was Jewish but completely downplays this angle--mostly because I assume they were afraid antisemites in the US and abroad might find this unacceptable. Sadly, it makes this exceptional film just a bit less exceptional.What I liked about the film was the overall quality of the picture. It was well written, acted and just screams quality. Plus, compared to many other biopics of the era, this one is a little more accurate--as the facts of the story are essentially true (though rearranged and interpreted for dramatic effect). Still, I find it hard to believe it won the Oscar for Best Picture--though I must concede that Paul Muni was exceptional.

This is typical 70's fare Free, casual sex, irresponsible individuality, social issues (anti-pollution and anti-establishment in this one), and the lack of a plot or enough character development to understand the lead character's motivations, or to a least sympathize with their actions.This film does have its positives. Jack Nicholson as usual gives his typical Jack performance, which are always enjoyable (Jack is great at being Jack; don't get me wrong, I think he is a good actor playing Jack, just not great. I will watch anything with him, in fact, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is my favorite film. I just feel that to be a great actor, you have to be able to play characters other than yourself). The Script, most of all the dialogue, is very good. All of the actors give good performances.Unfortunately, there is no true plot. Jack's character, Bobby, is a skilled musician from an upscale musical family who turns his back on all of this to work on an oil rig. He is an unlikable character he will sleep with anyone regardless of their relationship to him and in spite of his live-in girlfriend and shows no respect to his family, girlfriend, superiors, even friends.The film never explains his decisions. The film leaves you totally blind at the end as to where Jack will go or do next. In fact the film's end conclusively determines that Bobby is not a likable person, let alone understandable.As stated before, this is a typical 70's movie. Lots of dialogue, little plot, not entertaining (with the exception of the cafe scene, which I will not remark on due to its popularity in film lore), and no conclusion. For 70's fare, stick to Biopics (Patton), Action (Bullitt, The Getaway), Thrillers (Godfather's), and Horror (Exorcist, Omen). Avoid the meaningful social dramas such as this, Network, Last Tango In Paris, etc. While these are well scripted and acted, the plots tend to be non-existent.

It is a visually extraordinary film for its time. You could almost consider it the Avatar of the 1920's. But then again it's like Avatar in more ways than one. One it spent a ton of money on the set design and production of this movie. It is said that Metropolis spent over half of the studios annual budget just to create this masterpiece, and it definitely paid off. The architecture of the great wonder city is brilliant. It truly grasps the vastness and wonderment of a futuristic city. The story however is not revered as being so in depth. This might have been because Fritz Lang built the reputation of the movie too much, I don't know. All I know is that Metropolis has gone down in history as being one of the most expensive, and visually groundbreaking films ever to be put on the screen, exactly like Avatar. I tend to agree with the critics. I did not think that the story was awful by any means, I thought it explored the aspects such as Christianity and romanticism. I thought the robot was a great human metaphor as people do always appear to be who they really are on the inside. The part of people that only themselves and their makers know is a self that is hardly ever revealed. But as far as the story being silly at some times, and just sort of boring at others, is what really gave it a negative effect for me, and once I got past the awe of the set design I soon became tired of the movie. So I believe the greatest amount of credit goes to the design team here. They are truly the ones who provided the label of masterpiece to this film.

It is fascinating due to the magnificent actors who portrayed the jurors. The viewer becomes increasingly engrossed in the dialog by their superb acting, which transcends the drab setting of the jury deliberating room. However, as a lawyer myself, the movie contains an instance of jury impropriety, which ruins the film from a legal standpoint.During jury deliberations, one of the jurors brought in an item identical to one that was introduced at the trial and showed it to the other jurors. This is a classic case of improper jury behavior! Jurors may only consider the facts, witnesses, and evidence presented at trial and what may or may not be inferred from them; not outside items that were introduced in the deliberating room, such as this second item. Reasonable doubt in a criminal case must exist itself, not be deliberately manufactured by a juror. Additionally, the movie takes a considerable stretch of the imagination to conclude that not one of the other jurors reported this behavior to the judge at the time it happened. The juror who mentioned that it was against the law was ignored.Despite the excellent acting, 12 Angry Men is disturbing even if it is only a movie because the legal content is pure fiction. The movie gives a distortion about permissible jury conduct and would never have ended the way it did. If the case had been real, there would have been either a mistrial or this juror would have been dismissed and replaced with an alternate juror who heard the trial and the deliberations started over again. Also, the juror would probably have received a stern rebuke from the judge when he was dismissed, mistrial or not. This juror (the late Henry Fonda) was not some kind of hero as the viewer is led to believe, indeed, he was quite the contrary. 12 Angry Men is not a movie for someone who may be called for jury duty for the first time, despite how it may seem to those untrained in the legal system. I have read that this is the only movie Mr. Fonda ever produced (as well as acted) and, perhaps, he let his personal feelings of justice interfere with reality.

I really love the way P.T.

Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of The Basketball Diaries and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something brand-new to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' Riders on the Storm, which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a kids being kids kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994).

The basic premise of the movie sounded so stupid and absurd I always automatically avoided it. Then, when the umpteenth sequels came pouring out, I thought that belief was confirmed. Boy, was I wrong.It takes a director with a very deft touch and steel-like confidence to pull something like this off, but Tom Holland does it, and he manages to make it creepy and scary and funny and wildly entertaining all at once. I now understand the large fan base, and my hat is off.See, Holland KNOWS how potentially ridiculous this story is, and he effectively puts you in the seat of the non-believer (personified by Catherine Hicks, who turns in an impressive rendition of slightly-befuddled, but earnest mom Karen Barclay). Holland plays it smart by keeping the Chucky-antics almost off camera for about 30-45 minutes of the film. It's kind of the same effect Spielberg got by hiding the shark in the first half of Jaws. And when he DOES give you a glimpse, it's freakishly mind-blowing. The scene where you see Chucky dart from a hallway opening behind unsuspecting Dinah Manoff is jaw-dropping in both it's fright-factor and it's outlandishness.

It's quite modern with its approach and story and definitely a movie that seemed to be decades ahead of its time.It's really a movie that gets made by its story. It by no means is an exciting movie action-wise, simply because there is more talking and set-up in this movie than anything else really but the movie itself manages to still become exciting nevertheless, all due to its well written and original story. It features lots of classic thriller themes in it and of course also takes advantage of the cold war scare that was very much alive among the people, during the '60's. It plays on some of the fears and paranoia aspects of that period. The actual story itself is actually being far from likely but yet it works out all within the movie, due to the way it all gets told by director John Frankenheimer and its wonderful cast.The movie also has plenty of surprises in it and chooses to tell its story slowly and reveal not too much about its main plot from the start on already but instead do so in a more slow but steady way. Step by step the movie its mystery gets revealed but not without adding in plenty of surprising twists as well, as well as its unforgettable awesome ending.It's a very serious movie, which actually does make the movie a realistic one, which in return enhances the movie its tension and other thriller aspects. In lots of ways this movie is being very similar, in its style and set-up, to political thrillers being made this present day.Frank Sinatra never was a person that impressed as an actor, not even with his Oscar winning performance for From Here to Eternity but I must say that he was being simply great within this movie. He's not being a typical or classic hero within this movie and he's actually being a very humane character, so also with all of its flaws. Laurence Harvey is also great and he plays the true main character of this movie, in my opinion. Also really fun to see Angela Lansbury already playing a mother character in this movie. A role she could still play just as well and convincingly now, almost 50 years later. Was this woman ever young?But I really don't regard this movie a a perfect one. The story gets to confusing for that at times and there are also lots of moments in the movie that just coma across as pointless and completely redundant, such as the entire Janet Leigh character. Seems that the movie had too much story to handle and to cram in, which might very well be the case, since this movie got based on a novel. Still a special thriller after all these years, due to how 'modern' and effective it is with its story and overall approach.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 February 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Watching The Manchurian Candidate doesn't feel at all like you are watching an old fashioned thriller.

Basically thirty one years ago an atom bomb exploded and vapourised Tokyo, leading to World War III, now in the future, 2019, the city has been rebuilt on the artificial Tokyo Bay, where terrorism and violence is gripping everyone. In amongst the this are The Capsules biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda (Johnny Yong Bosch) and his friend Tetsuo Shima (Joshua Seth) who go against rival gang The Clowns. Near the end of a chase, Tetsuo ends up crashing his motorcycle, after almost hitting a child that will be mentioned later, and captured by armed soldiers, while Kaneda are the gang are taken for questioning. The Colonel - Col. Shikishima (Jamieson Price) and The Doctor - Doctor Onishi (Simon Prescott\/Isaacson) of a secret government project discover Tetsuo has mental powers similar to the little boy who caused the explosion that destroyed the city, Akira, so naturally they decide to keep him in captivity and will kill him if his powers get out of control. But Tetsuo escapes the facility and meets up with girlfriend Kaori (Michelle Ruff), and after Kaneda joins them and stops an assault by The Clowns, Tetsuo experiences a painful headache. Taken away again by a government van, he goes to military hospital, where he is attempted to be killed by The Espers, Masaru (?), Takashi (Cody MacKenzie) and Kiyoko (Sandy Fox), of course with his power growing this only makes it worsen. After going on a rampage, Tetsuo stops off at a cryogenic storage facility below Neo-Tokyo's new Olympic Stadium, and that's how he finds out about Akira and the powers he had. Kaneda and Kei (Wendee Lee) meanwhile are determined to stop Tetsuo from becoming more powerful that he may lose his mind completely and destroy the city, Kaneda's right-hand Yamagata 'Yama' (Michael Lindsay) gets killed, and Kaneda is now out for revenge on Tetsuo. He meanwhile has returned to the Akira cryogenic chamber, where the Colonel is waiting to try and stop him, Kaneda soon arriving as well, but any attacks on Tetsuo fail, apart from removing his right arm. At the Stadium Tetsuo grows himself a new arm from non-organic components, like machinery, and Kaori arrives to see the power he now possesses, and that is when they go out of control and he starts growing. Continuing to grow into a large blob creature, and killing Kaori inside, the Colonel tries to make go back to the lab, but he just attacks, but Kaneda arrives, with the Espers protection, to stop him. In the end though, the explosion does happen, and all the Espers can do is teleport the Colonel and Kaneda to safety, with flashes of Tetsuo's memory showing, and they return to see most of the city destroyed in the glistening sunrise. Also starring Mike Reynolds\/Ray Michaels as Mr. Nezu and Matthew 'Masamune' Mercer\/Miller as Kaisuke 'Kai'. I have to say firstly, I had almost no idea what was going on throughout, the story was confusing and complicated, but I think this is one of the only times where I can forgive that, because it is so good. I recognised the most fantastic sequence, where Tetsuo becomes a mechanical blob monster, because it was spoofed in the Trapper Keeper episode of South Park, but there are so many great moments that will blow your mind. Director and creator of the comic strip Katsuhiro Ôtomo went over budget creating many night sequences with fantastically vast looking cityscapes, with marvellous use of colours, great camera-work, wonderfully disturbing material and design ahead of its time, this is an amazing animated science-fiction action fantasy.
