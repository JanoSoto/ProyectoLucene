This sets us up for the film, which is a paradox in itself. The paradox shows us how actions within a family unit can lead to a storm. This is epitomised materially by an actual storm that hits the neighbourhood, and has an effect on all of the characters. The start of the film is also ironic as both the director and the actor playing the character that reads the comic book would have their future in comic books; Ang Lee for 'The Hulk', and Tobey Maguire for the fabulous 'Spider-Man' films.The story takes place in a small neighbourhood in 1970's America and features two upper class families at it's centre; the Hood family, which consists of two parents (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen) and two children; a fourteen year old girl (Christina Ricci) and a sixteen year old boy (Tobey Maguire) and the Carver family, which consists of two parents (Sigourney Weaver and Jamey Sheridan) and two boys (Elijah Wood and Adam Hann-Byrd). It is mainly through the interactions between these families that the story progresses; Kevin Kline is having a purely sexual affair with Sigourney Weaver, which leads to suspicion and later jealousy from Joan Allen. At the same time, Christina Ricci is 'experimenting' with Elijah Wood and later his younger brother, which leads to protectiveness from her father etc. From this tight bond between the eight central characters, we are able to see why the characters do certain things, we see that it is their insecurities that drive them, usually to hypocrisy and it is this character study that makes The Ice Storm a good film. Due to the number of characters, and the relatively short running time of the film, it is impossible for them all to develop fully and for us to get to know all of them, and because of the way the relationships are shown, it makes the film seem deeper and more complex than it actually is. Two years later, a similar format to the one seen in this movie would be used to a much better effect; in a film called American Beauty. This predecessor never reaches the highs of that film.Ang Lee has assembled himself a marvellous here. Kevin Kline is an underrated actor who always gives a good performance, as he does here. Sigourney Weaver is ultra-seductive mode, and this is probably the sexiest she's ever been in a movie. Joan Allen is sultry as Kline's wife, but her performance is believable and she brings a great life to the movie. Meanwhile, on the younger side of the cast, Christina Ricci impresses very much as the smart and curious young lady of the film. She's a beautiful actress, and one with talent too. Her performance is the standout of the film for me; she's the most real and the most enticing by far. Despite being a big fan of Spider-Man, I've always found Tobey Maguire to be annoying. He's annoying here too; he has talent, but he's very annoying. Elijah Wood is as turgid as ever in this film. He would, of course, go on to become a 'big thing', but it's clear to see that he's rubbish, from this film and his later performances. As he would later show with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Ang Lee has a great directorial flair, and he shows it off here. The film is also supremely well written and there isn't a line that appears out of place for the character that speaks it. This allows us to get to know the characters and that is what you need to do in a film of this ilk. The Ice Storm is overall a good film.

At the same time, Christina Ricci is 'experimenting' with Elijah Wood and later his younger brother, which leads to protectiveness from her father etc. From this tight bond between the eight central characters, we are able to see why the characters do certain things, we see that it is their insecurities that drive them, usually to hypocrisy and it is this character study that makes The Ice Storm a good film. Due to the number of characters, and the relatively short running time of the film, it is impossible for them all to develop fully and for us to get to know all of them, and because of the way the relationships are shown, it makes the film seem deeper and more complex than it actually is. Two years later, a similar format to the one seen in this movie would be used to a much better effect; in a film called American Beauty. This predecessor never reaches the highs of that film.Ang Lee has assembled himself a marvellous here. Kevin Kline is an underrated actor who always gives a good performance, as he does here. Sigourney Weaver is ultra-seductive mode, and this is probably the sexiest she's ever been in a movie. Joan Allen is sultry as Kline's wife, but her performance is believable and she brings a great life to the movie. Meanwhile, on the younger side of the cast, Christina Ricci impresses very much as the smart and curious young lady of the film. She's a beautiful actress, and one with talent too. Her performance is the standout of the film for me; she's the most real and the most enticing by far. Despite being a big fan of Spider-Man, I've always found Tobey Maguire to be annoying. He's annoying here too; he has talent, but he's very annoying. Elijah Wood is as turgid as ever in this film. He would, of course, go on to become a 'big thing', but it's clear to see that he's rubbish, from this film and his later performances. As he would later show with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Ang Lee has a great directorial flair, and he shows it off here. The film is also supremely well written and there isn't a line that appears out of place for the character that speaks it. This allows us to get to know the characters and that is what you need to do in a film of this ilk. The Ice Storm is overall a good film.

This sets us up for the film, which is a paradox in itself. The paradox shows us how actions within a family unit can lead to a storm.

Several actually, including graphic brutal violence (one homosexual rape scene), pervasive language (according to one source the word f**k appears 205 times), sex and nudity. So why did I give it an 8.0? Well, considering the story (and with the exception of the opening bedroom scene) I would not consider any of this inappropriate. The scene mentioned above is totally unnecessary to the plot (except maybe to illustrate how angry the two characters are) and so the breast shot and the rather vocal sex are rather gratuitous. While it is true that some of the other scenes (such as the prison rape) could have been left to the imagination I think that a lot of the film's considerable power would have been lost.This is the story of the head of neo-nazi skinhead gang who murders a gang banger and goes to prison only to find loyal (and needed) friendship in a black man who saves him from almost certain death. He gets out and seeks to turn his brother away from the skinhead movement before it is too late. The story rocks. It is strong because it does not simply paint either side as idiots like many anti-racist films do. There are plausible reasons for the hero's racism and it is easy to see how he was led down the path to murder. At the same time it is made abundantly clear that racism is ultimately foolish and self destructive - especially if taken to its logical conclusion. No suspension of belief required here - this is a very true-to-life film. I've seen some whining over details on other review sites that all seem pretty petty to me. Some have commented that the friendship in prison was not believable - that the hero would have not become anti-racist simply based on one person's actions. That is certainly possible - but he is also shown as being rather open minded prior to his father's death, and easily malleable. Once the stereotypes on both sides were torn down (by a black friend and a skinhead enemy) and he saw the reality of the situation he came to the correct conclusion.The theme is obviously anti-racist which is excellent of course. One thing I am glad to see for once is that racism is not overcome in this film by becoming proud of one's race (i.e. more racism), nor is either race held up as particularly noble or without fault in the issue.

It is positively one of the tightest, most brilliant, sly, wickedly satirical action movie spoofs of all time. I am also rather amazed that Arnie actually agreed to this one; it's almost like he's biting the hand that fed him.The biggest clue of this movie is in the opening shot, when the whole picture wipes into frame in the shape of a movie screen (hint, hint!) From then on, anyone with any experience at watching blockbuster action movies at all should have picked up how the scene was taking the standard setup-action pieces of the time, and then pushing them a little bit further than normal; so that they become an obvious (to most people) parody of the situation. The close-up of the feet as Jack exits from the car is just a little closer and off-angle than normal. The ranting chief yelling at the hero that he's gonna get fired if he disobeys orders is just a little bit more heated that the standard action movie would do it.

If that doesn't confirm it, the cover art does. But wait-Henkel had a hand in the original and this is the 'true' sequel? That's a joke, right? So going into the film, I expected either camp or comedy and got neither (much like the second Saw film, I might add.) Again we open up with white text and someone reading the text in case the viewer happens to be illiterate. The narration brings us up to speed on the whole TCM mythos in case some poor fool obliviously sleep-walked into the horror section and picked the movie up by mistake. Seriously, Henkel, plain white text and narration doesn't count as a TCM trademark nor a mood setting device, and I know we can find something more interesting or drop the whole thing. This is not the Star Wars 'A long time ago . . .' line and fanfare. But what do I know? I didn't co-write the original screen-play.So let's meet the teenagers to be slaughtered and explore exactly how stupid a writer can write a character. There's something about horror films featuring the lowest forms of intelligence, and this usually happens for a reason. I mean, if the characters performed the intelligent act of finding a way out of their predicament there'd be no film. But as a fan of the genre, one grows to accept this and stop caring that the characters on screen are idiots . . . to a point. TCM Next Generation impressively managed to throw out characters that were too stupid and way too obnoxious. The possibility of Leatherface meat-hooking and slowly slicing these losers didn't appeal to me. It wasn't good enough to watch someone else torture and murder these characters-I wanted to beat and torture these characters, myself. Besides, TCM 1 proved Leatherface incapable of shutting up one screaming little girl, don't get me started on the second one, and it only gets worse here. My personal favorite line in the film (paraphrased) 'There's no place to turn around! Don't these people know how to build a road?!' What was he looking for? A U-turn sign? A driveway or big open parking lot? If that road were a bridge with guard rails any driver I know could've turned around easily. I guess the concept of a 'reverse' gear escaped these teens as well.Nevermind the lines that contradict what's shown on screen. I can still suspend my disbelief for the sake of humoring a horror flick. Especially for the moment where one guy is held at gunpoint, escapes into the gunman's house and uses the gunman's bathroom. Classic stupidity.And you know, since horror has gotten so cliché, Henkel decided to throw in some twists to the TCM formula. Hello, Leatherface in a dress (as if the makeup in the first TCM didn't already lower my opinion of Leatherhead). Hello, Men in Black. Hello, Conspiracy theory. It's actually hilarious that despite all the twists in the film how predictable everything is in terms of who lives and dies. Based on the opening credits, I predicted with 80% accuracy. Once the characters all were introduced, and I saw who filled what role that prediction was amended to be 100% accurate. Putting Leatherface in a dress was, admittingly, a ballsy move that angered many people. I don't understand why they didn't just go ahead and kill off Jenn (in a non-final-frame-jump-sequence) Note stating this character survives is not a spoiler - if you watch this movie and honestly don't know her fate, you need help.

The film does not fail in these respects. The mouth-watering cast-list will draw any film fan, and the standard of acting is very high indeed. The score is exquisite too, but unfortunately the good points end here. MAGNOLIA is, in short, a beautiful waste of time.(SOME MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW)The script of MAGNOLIA is woefully inadequate for such a long and complex film. Anderson enjoys hearing the word 'c**t' uttered fiercely - and with tiresome frequency - from the mouths of A-list celebs; I don't share his penchants. Just as Shakespeare's sprawling Troilus and Cressida is clogged with pleasantries that makes the dialogue trawl through mud, Anderson's multi-layered epic struggles to breathe beneath a roughly-wrought mesh of expletives. Pubescent boys might find it hilarious, but I doubt that this is the desired effect. I found it, after a while, very grating indeed.Anderson's film does not just contain one person dying of Cancer, but two. That's right, an extra 100% slow-death-by-cancer for your money; a sort of buy one get one free. This struck me as an infuriating contrivance, but sadly it is the first of many.

Like the movie Memento, this is not an easy movie to watch and an even harder one to understand. At it heart, the movie is about teen alienation, and has over the last few years gained a cult following on DVD. As such, a directors cut is in limited release in some cities, The new version includes about 20 minutes of new scenes, and some additional special effects have been added.The main character, Donnie Darko, is a brilliant, but troubled teen who, as we find out, is undergoing therapy. Donnie claims to see a 6 foot tall rabbit who tells him that the world will end in 28 days. In addition, the rabbit saves Donnie's life (from a falling jet engine), and then proceeds to guide his actions over the next 28 days. The original version of the movie left viewers to make up their own minds about what was going on Is Donnie delusional or is the world coming to an end? The Director's cut gives a few more answers while also adding scenes involving Donnie's family and therapist. (For those who want all the answers, listen to the Director's commentary on the DVD)This movie is not for anyone who wants to sit back and relax for a couple of hours. However the movie is visually impressive for a small budget (5 million dollars) independent movie. Many of the scenes are stunning and well worth watching even if you don't believe the movie as a whole works. My advice, take a chance and walk on the Dark side.
